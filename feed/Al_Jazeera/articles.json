US Central Command chief Brad Cooper, the most senior commander in the region, also joined the US delegation.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Speaking to Iranian television in Muscat after the talks finished, Araghchi said the indirect effort was “a good start” but that a decision on how to proceed with the next rounds would be taken after “consulting with the capitals”.</p><p>But Araghchi cautioned that there was a climate of “mistrust” since the US military attacked Iran’s nuclear sites when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in June, days before a sixth round of similarly mediated indirect talks had been scheduled.</p><p>Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi met with the US and Iranian sides separately multiple times on Friday and conveyed messages between the teams.</p><p>“It was useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress,” he said, adding that the aim is to “reconvene in due course”.</p><p>Consultations “focused on creating appropriate conditions for the resumption of diplomatic and technical negotiations”, according to a statement from Oman’s Foreign Ministry.</p><p>The talks in Muscat took place after a tumultuous week that saw Washington position the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/iran-prepares-for-war-as-us-military-armada-approaches\">USS Abraham Lincoln supercarrier</a> and supporting warships and fighter jets near Iranian waters and strengthen air defences in bases used by the US military across the region, while also shooting down an Iranian drone.</p><p>US President Donald Trump, in recent weeks, has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran if it does not reach a new agreement with the US on several issues.</p><h2 id=\"red-lines\">Red lines</h2><p>The US wants Iran to fully abandon enriching uranium, even at the 3.67 percent civilian-use rate agreed under the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that Trump unilaterally abandoned in 2018. Iran used to enrich up to 60 percent before its main nuclear facilities were destroyed or significantly damaged by US bombs in June.</p><p>Washington also wants to limit the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles – the main tool in the country’s arsenal – and ensure that Tehran’s aligned armed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Syria will no longer receive any military or financial support.</p><p>Several European powers have expressed support for the US demands, as has the far-right government in Israel, which wants to undermine a substantive military rival in the region.</p><p>But the Iranian government has repeatedly emphasised that it will only negotiate on nuclear issues to lift sanctions and de-escalate, saying that discussions on missiles or any other subject were a red line. As Araghchi reiterated on Friday, it also wants the US threats of war to end.</p><p>Iranian commanders have also said they remain highly prepared for a regional-scale war, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on Thursday showed a new test launch of one of the country’s top ballistic missiles.</p><p>Iranian Press TV said the Khorramshahr-4 missile, capable of reaching Israel and US bases across the region, was put on a mobile launcher taken out from <a href=\"/news/2023/2/7/iran-unveils-underground-base-in-response-to-us-israel-exercises\">an underground base</a>.</p><p>Yadollah Javani, the political deputy for the IRGC, said that “unveiling the missile means that although we have sat down at the negotiating table, we will not give up our military power”.</p><h2 id=\"conditions-more-severe-than-war\">‘Conditions more severe than war’</h2><p>People in Iran are closely following the developments.</p><p>But there are fewer signs of the cautious optimism seen during five rounds of previous negotiations held last year in the lead-up to the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/24/is-the-12-day-israel-iran-war-really-over-and-who-gained\">12-day war with Israel</a>.</p><p>Soroush, a Tehran resident, told Al Jazeera he hopes the negotiations can lift the shadow of war hanging over Iran.</p><p>“War not only brings fear and anxiety, but also doubles the economic pressure,” he said, as the country deals with one of the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/irans-economy-falters-as-internet-shutdown-hits-people-businesses-hard\">highest inflation rates in the world</a>.</p><p>But another resident, Maryam, said she believes the negotiations will not succeed “and will definitely lead to war”, due to clashing positions of the two sides.</p><p>Angered by the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/iran-rejects-un-rights-resolution-condemning-protest-killings\">unprecedented killings of thousands</a> during last month’s nationwide protests and frustrated by a prolonged state of unpredictability and pressure, some are actually welcoming a military escalation.</p><p>“War is not a good thing, but the conditions we are living in now are, in many ways, larger and more severe than war itself,” said Amir from the capital. “I don’t think that with war, something worse than what already exists will happen.”</p><p>The Iranian government says that 3,117 people were killed during the protests, and that “terrorists” and “rioters” were to blame, not state forces. It also released a controversial list of victims this week that has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/questions-after-irans-government-releases-victim-list-in-protest-killings\">only raised more questions</a>.</p><p>The United Nations and international human rights organisations say they have documented widespread use of lethal weapons by state forces, as well as attacks on hospitals and medical staff helping wounded protesters. Rights groups say the actual death toll is likely far higher than the official figure.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He is being investigated for economic corruption.</p><p>He was Norway’s prime minister from 1996 to 1997 and, afterwards, served as foreign affairs minister from 2000 to 2001. He was also head of parliament (stortingspresident) from 2005 to 2009.</p><p>However, Jagland’s association with Epstein is linked to his time as secretary-general of the Council of Europe, formed to protect human rights on the continent, and his simultaneous leadership of the Nobel Committee.</p><p>He joined the Norwegian Nobel Committee as chairman in 2009. He was later demoted to ordinary member in 2015 after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese rights activist Liu Xiaobo, prompting outrage from China. His demotion was seen as a peace offering to Beijing.</p><p>During this time, Jagland was also serving as head of the Council of Europe – he completed two terms from 2009 to 2019. His critics at the time alleged he did not do enough to fight corruption and that he was overly friendly towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>On Thursday this week, Norwegian police said it is investigating whether Jagland received gifts, loans and travel benefits while serving in those positions after emails between him and Epstein emerged in the released documents last Friday.</p><p>Authorities did not provide details as to whether Epstein or people in his network offered those benefits, but Pal K Lonseth, head of a special police economic crimes unit, Okokrim, told reporters that what was revealed in the files “provides a basis for investigating whether these are criminal offences”.</p><p>Several Norwegian publications have reported that the new files revealed plans Jagland made for a family visit to Epstein’s private Caribbean island in 2014, but say the trip was later cancelled.</p><p>Speaking to Norwegian state broadcaster NRK, Jagland’s lawyer Anders Brosveet denied the claims and said there was “no question” as to whether the politician received any benefits.</p><p>“Based on the information we have found so far, we believe it is quite simple to clarify that this is not a transfer of benefits,” he said.</p><p>Following the release of the Epstein files, Jagland stated via his lawyers that his contact with Epstein had been “unwise” and that he “never” related to Epstein around his private life or his “dealings with young girls”.</p><p>While Jagland enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution as a former Council of Europe head, the Norwegian police have asked the institution to revoke his protections.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4257561\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257561\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4257561\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T145607Z_1188291971_RC2Q5JAVYDLD_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769009464.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C510&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump gestures, as he stands next to the President and CEO of the World Economic Forum Borge Brende during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF), in Davos, Switzerland, January 21, 2026.

He is part of Norway’s opposition Conservative Party.</p><p>The WEF said in a statement after last week’s revelations that a risk committee would probe communications between Brende and Epstein.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/norway-police-probes-former-pm-jagland-over-epstein-ties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Speaking to Al Jazeera,</a> Brende said he had only ever had limited contact with Epstein and that he had been unaware of his past or crimes.</p><p>He said he met Epstein in 2018 at a dinner and that the financier had been presented to him as an “American investor”.</p><p>“This gathering included several other leaders,” he said. “The following year, I attended two similar dinners with Epstein, alongside other diplomats and business leaders. These dinners, and a few mails and SMS messages, were the extent of my interactions with him,” he said.</p><p>Brende also said he regretted not doing more to look into Epstein’s history.</p><p>“I remain committed to learning from this experience and welcome the upcoming independent review, which I indeed requested,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-response-been-in-norway\">What has the response been in Norway?</h2><p>The revelations have prompted demands for further probes in parliament, which Jagland’s Labour Party dominates.</p><p>Foreign Affairs Minister Espen Barth Eide, also from Labour, said in a statement on Thursday that he had acted on a request from the police and reached out to the Council of Europe to remove Jagland’s immunity.</p><p>However, opposition parties, including the Conservative Party, which is the main opposition, are demanding that the government set up an independent investigation committee to probe the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>“What everyone is questioning now is whether this is the tip of the iceberg. Whether this is a culture that exists at the top of Norwegian politics and the foreign service,” Sylvi Listhaug, head of the opposition Progress Party, said in parliament on Thursday, according to the NRK broadcaster.</p><p>Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, of the Labour Party, who has backed the police investigation, has, however, responded to the demand, saying an investigative committee is not “the right instrument to shed light on the matter”, NRK reported.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293029\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293029\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293029\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-12-10T133552Z_1481862617_RC2PDIAQ9FO3_RTRMADP_3_NOBEL-PRIZE-PEACE-1770388176.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mette-Marit\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4293029\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Norway’s Crown Prince Haakon, Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Princess Ingrid Alexandra attend the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony at Oslo City Hall in Oslo, Norway, December 10, 2025 [Ole Berg-Rusten/NTB/via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-crown-princess-mette-marit-linked-to-epstein\">How is Crown Princess Mette-Marit linked to Epstein?</h2><p>Meanwhile, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, 52, is also in the spotlight over her alleged close relationship with Epstein as documented by emails included in the files released by the US Justice Department.</p><p>Her friendship with Epstein was already known. The latest tranche of documents, however, provides a much clearer picture of the nature of her relationship with him, with hundreds of messages sent over several years.</p><p>They included a 2012 email from Mette-Marit to Epstein in which she asked him: “Is it inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my I5 yr old sons wallpaper?”</p><p>Epstein then replied, “Let them decide,” and advised that the mother should “stay out of it.”</p><p>In a separate email, Epstein told Mette-Marit he was in Paris “on my wife hunt” but that “i prefer Scandinavians.”</p><p>In response, Mette-Marit said Paris was “good for adultery” but that “Scandis” were “better wife material”.</p><p>In a statement following the documents’ release, the crown princess said she felt “deep sympathy and solidarity” with the girls abused by Epstein.</p><p>She said she took responsibility for “not having investigated Epstein’s background more thoroughly” and also expressed regret for “having had any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.”</p><p>Separately, Mette-Marit’s eldest son, Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, whom she had referred to in her emails to Epstein, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/son-of-norways-crown-princess-denies-rape-as-trial-opens\">appeared in court</a> this week on multiple charges, including rape and domestic violence.</p><p>He denied charges of rape and filming people without their consent in court on Wednesday, but admitted to transporting drugs and speeding while driving.</p><p>Hoiby was first arrested in August 2024 on suspicion of assault. His trial will continue until March.</p><p>Amongst the evidence against him, police say, are incriminating videos stored on his phone, including one that allegedly shows him assaulting a woman who was incapacitated at his parents’ Skaugum estate, west of Oslo, in December 2018. He is alleged to have raped four women.</p><p>Hoiby holds no royal title. He was born when Mette-Marit, a non-royal, was in a relationship before her 2001 marriage to the heir, Prince Haakon. He has previously spoken about mental health issues and a struggle with substance abuse.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

They took whatever came; now, we can be selective,” he said, adding, “We can easily absorb another million. I used to tell Putin always, what we need is just one more million.”</p><p>Barak said that Russians would come to Israel first without preconditions, but added, “Under the social pressure of the need, especially of the second generation to adapt, it will happen.”</p><h2 id=\"some-are-welcome-others-not\">Some are welcome, others not</h2><p>The government of Israel has actively promoted immigration into the country for decades. Americans and the French are especially welcome, and many end up moving to illegal settlements and espousing domination of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank, in which they have no previous links.</p><p>As recently as November, the government revealed that new immigrants and returning residents arriving in 2026 will be offered a zero-percent income tax rate for their first two years in the country.</p><p>Under the reform, which was introduced as part of the 2026 state budget, returning residents who lived abroad for 10 or more years and new immigrants who move to Israel in 2026 will pay no income tax in 2026 and 2027; the rates will be gradually increased, according to the Israeli media.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But a large wave of immigration into the country, when tens of thousands from the Beta Israel community were transferred to Israel from Ethiopia in the 1980s and 1990s, has exposed deep-seated racism.</p><p>Beta Israel was widely seen as the main and oldest Jewish presence in Ethiopia.</p><p>These Ethiopian Israelis have faced racism, exclusion and police violence against their communities.

It represents the biggest Shia bloc in the Iraqi parliament.</p><p>The loose nature of the coalition that makes up the CF means that opinions on al-Maliki’s candidacy are varied, with some opposing it, others willing to bend to Trump’s will and switch their backing, and still others who are adamant that they will push forward.</p><p>And it seems as though the majority are in the latter camp.</p><p>The CF issued a statement on Saturday reiterating its support for al-Maliki. “Choosing the prime minister is an exclusively Iraqi constitutional matter … free from foreign interference,” the statement added.</p><p>The statement reflects the position of various pro-Maliki forces in the CF, including former deputy parliament speaker Mohsen al-Mandalawi; the Badr Organization, led by Hadi al-Amir; and the Islamic Supreme Council, led by cleric Humam Hamoudi.</p><p>Current Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, whose party received the most votes in the elections but who did not receive the CF nomination despite his membership within it, is also officially supportive of al-Maliki’s nomination, even if he has not abandoned the possibility of continuing as prime minister himself.</p><p>Several of these factions did well in last year’s parliamentary elections, including al-Maliki’s own State of Law Coalition, as well as Badr and al-Sudani’s Reconstruction and Development Coalition.</p><p>But, with support from Kurdish and Sunni parties, the Shia al-Maliki sceptics have enough seats, and enough of a voice, to block the nomination if they desire to do so.</p><p>These include important Shia figures such as Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq group; Ammar al-Hakim, the leader of the National State Forces alliance; and former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.</p><p>Al-Hakim, whose parliamentary bloc has 18 seats, warned that there would be “incoming economic repercussions” if al-Maliki was chosen, and added that “public interest must be prioritised over private interests”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Victory Alliance, led by al-Abadi, issued a statement calling for “[the prioritisation of] the people’s vital interests given the exceptional circumstances Iraq and the region are experiencing”. Al-Abadi’s group has no seats in parliament, but retains an important voice within the CF.</p><p>Both statements contain a tacit acknowledgment of Iraq’s inability to withstand US pressure and the need for an alternative candidate suited to the current reality.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"other-roadblocks\">Other roadblocks</h2><p>The CF, therefore, still has an uphill battle to confirm al-Maliki as prime minister. Outside of the Shia political groups, there is also <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/25/what-al-malikis-return-would-mean-for-iraq-and-the-region\">opposition to al-Maliki</a>, a divisive figure remembered negatively by many Iraqis, particularly Sunnis.</p><p>And there are also divisions within the non-Shia groups that are also slowing down the nomination process.</p><p>Under the Iraqi Constitution, parliament must first elect a president for Iraq, who then mandates the nominee of the largest parliamentary bloc to form the government. According to Iraq’s post-2003 “muhasasa” system of dividing political offices by sect and ethnicity, the prime minister must be a Shia, the president a Kurd, and the parliamentary speaker a Sunni.</p><p>To date, the main Kurdish factions – the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Masoud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Bafel Talabani – have failed to agree on a consensus candidate for the presidency.</p><p>The CF is attempting to broker an agreement between the Kurds. Recent efforts included a delegation led by al-Sudani meeting with both parties, and a personal visit by al-Maliki to Barzani. But these initiatives have not yet succeeded, and without a political agreement on the presidency, the process of designating a prime minister cannot proceed.</p><p>And even if the Kurds reach an agreement and don’t stand in the way of al-Maliki, the CF must persuade a long list of the former prime minister’s opponents.</p><p>Among them is Mohammed al-Halbousi, former speaker of parliament and leader of the Takadum Party, who issued a statement prior to the US veto implicitly rejecting al-Maliki’s candidacy.</p><p>Collectively, the anti-al-Maliki groups could gather roughly a third of the seats in parliament, enough to prevent a presidential election session due to a lack of quorum.</p><p>To avoid that scenario, the CF would have to either reset internal negotiations regarding the next prime minister, or nominate al-Sudani for a second term.</p><p>Al-Sudani’s party issued a statement on January 28 calling for “positive relationships with the United States” – a move interpreted as an indirect pitch for his renewal, leveraging his proven track record of managing relations with Washington during his tenure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-leverage\">US leverage</h2><p>The US may no longer be the occupying power in Iraq, but it still has enormous economic leverage over the country.</p><p>The revenue from Iraq’s main export – oil – is routed through the US Federal Reserve Bank in New York.</p><p>Trump may decide not to renew a presidential executive order, issued originally by President George W Bush in the wake of the Iraq War, that grants legal protection for the oil revenue funds and prevents them from being frozen by Iraq’s creditors. The order had been expected to be renewed as a formality upon its expiration in May.</p><p>If the US president decides against renewal, creditors will seek to claim their funds, and New York courts may issue rulings to freeze the Iraqi assets. This would disrupt the transfer of funds necessary to pay public salaries and sustain the economy for months or even years. In practical terms, the Iraqi economy would grind to a halt.</p><p>That therefore explains why the pro-al-Maliki bloc in the CF is attempting to persuade the US to change its position, rather than simply ignore Trump.</p><p>A high-ranking source in the CF’s State of Law coalition, who wished to remain anonymous in order to speak freely on the topic, told Al Jazeera there are “ongoing attempts to convince the US administration to lift the veto on al-Maliki”.</p><p>Aqeel al-Fatlawi, the State of Law spokesperson, also said he was hopeful that the US “will change its stance in the coming period”.</p><p>While blaming regional states, including Turkiye and Syria, for the US position towards him, al-Maliki himself has sought to soften his positions.</p><p>Syria has been one of the main points of difference between al-Maliki and the US, which has backed Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa, even as the former Iraqi prime minister has denounced him for his past membership of al-Qaeda.</p><p>In a televised interview on Tuesday, al-Maliki used al-Sharaa’s full name, rather than the Syrian leader’s nom de guerre of “al-Jolani”, an attempt to emphasise that he was willing to move on from the past. Al-Maliki also attempted to soften his stance towards the Syrian government, directing his criticism towards the former regime of ousted President Bashar al-Assad and its role in supporting “terrorism” in Iraq.</p><p>Whether these attempts will go far enough to placate the US remains to be seen.</p><p>Reports indicate that US Special Envoy to Iraq Mark Savaya may have been removed from his position, although there is no official confirmation. His replacement would likely be Tom Barrack, currently the US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy to Syria.</p><p>The CF favours Savaya, who has proven to be more supportive of using a more gradual approach in reducing the power of Iraq’s Shia militias, versus Barrack, who is viewed by the CF more negatively for his role in weakening Hezbollah in Lebanon and his support for Syria’s al-Sharaa.</p><p>An official announcement of a change could indicate where Trump’s thoughts are in the critical next few weeks – and whether the president will choose to not renew the US guarantee to protect Iraq’s oil revenue in May.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

All her efforts, along with the expenses she endured, have been to no avail.</p><p>“I have adhered to the prescribed medications without fail. My body regains strength for a short time, but I fall sick again. This has exhausted my health and my finances,” she said.</p><p>Hadeel says she has lost faith in health facilities in Yemen, where the country’s more than decade-long war has taken a heavy toll on the healthcare system.

Houthi officials accuse regional and international actors of banning the resumption of flights.</p><p>The director of Sanaa International Airport, Khalid al-Shaef, said in December that the “American-Saudi-Emirati aggression alliance” continues imposing a blockade on the airport.</p><p>Al-Shaef noted that more than 500,000 Yemeni patients are registered as critical cases in urgent need of immediate travel, describing the ban on the airport as a “war crime not subject to a statute of limitations”.</p><p>Tayseer al-Samei, a media officer at the Ministry of Public Health and Population in central Yemen’s Taiz province, told Al Jazeera that thousands of patients in Yemen die while waiting for a flight.</p><p>“The patients are denied the right to travel for treatment purposes, which means they are denied the right to life,” al-Samei said.</p><p>He indicated that some diseases, such as cancer, are often not treatable in Yemen, which necessitates treatment abroad for those who can afford it.</p><p>“In Taiz alone, the health authorities documented 1,967 cases of cancer in 2025, recording a 21 percent increase compared to the previous year,” al-Samei said.</p><p>In late December, the Minister of Public Health and Population of the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/regained-momentum-sets-yemen-governments-eyes-on-houthis-in-the-north\">UN-recognised government</a>, Qasim Buhaibeh, revealed that authorities record 30,000 new cancer cases annually in the country.</p><p>Al-Samei posed a sobering question: “How many of these patients would have been saved if the airports were operating and medical evacuation were possible?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"high-cost-of-misdiagnosis\">High cost of misdiagnosis</h2><p>A faulty diagnosis or botched operation can turn a patient’s life into a misery.

However, the result was not what they expected.</p><p>“That wound expanded instead and became cancerous,” said Maram. That forced him to travel for treatment abroad three months ago.</p><p>To catch a flight, he had to travel from Sanaa to the southern port city of Aden, under the control of the government. “My father spent 15 hours on a bus to reach Aden Airport. If Sanaa Airport were operational, that would have taken him only 15 minutes to the terminal,” she added.</p><p>Suad, a doctor in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that particular medical appliances in some clinics or hospitals are increasingly outdated. This shortage of modern equipment severely compromises the accuracy of diagnostic tests, particularly for cancer screenings and prenatal care.</p><p>She shared a story of a patient who visited her three months ago. The woman, two months pregnant, arrived suffering from nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.</p><p>“Using an ultrasound, I checked the fetal pulse. It was zero. I informed the patient of the fetal demise,” Suad said.</p><p>However, the woman was not happy with the news. She went to another clinic and did a second ultrasound. There, the practitioner told her the fetal pulse was weak but still there.</p><p>“She clung to that result because she did not want a miscarriage,” said Suad. Two months later, the patient’s body began to swell, and the fetus had to be removed to save the mother’s life.</p><p>Suad emphasised that many clinics and health centres need to be equipped with modern medical appliances, which can provide accurate results to spare patients unnecessary suffering.</p><p>“This is the shared responsibility of the Yemeni authorities, the private sector, and international humanitarian organisations to ensure that reliable medical testing is accessible to patients,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"aid-cuts-claiming-lives\">Aid cuts claiming lives</h2><p>Ahmed Yahya has worked as an aid worker with multiple local and foreign humanitarian organisations in rural areas of Yemen’s Hodeidah and Raymah provinces during the war.</p><p>The aid offered to the health sector, he told Al Jazeera, has saved lives, improved the personal health of countless people, and kept health facilities functional.</p><p>UN reports say more than 450 facilities in Yemen have already closed, and thousands more are at risk of losing funding.</p><p>“Medications, medical appliances and health-related training programmes have been among the aid packages humanitarian organisations have provided to different areas of Yemen. Without such health aid, death would have taken many more lives,” Yahya said.</p><p>The declining aid is a grave and increasingly visible concern. “Lately, humanitarian organisations have largely reduced their aid programmes in the areas where I have engaged in humanitarian activities.”</p><p>He added, “For example, therapeutic nutrition for malnourished children and pregnant and lactating women has decreased over the past year. The reduction seems set to continue this year.”</p><p>The UN itself has acknowledged the situation.</p><p>On January 19, Harneis, the UN coordinator, said: “For 10 years, the UN and humanitarian organisations were able to improve mortality and improve morbidity … this year, that’s not going to be the case.”</p><p>Last month, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) indicated that Yemen’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan is just 25 percent funded.</p><p>The funding gap has forced agencies to scale back life-saving services across all sectors, leaving millions of Yemenis on the brink of total health collapse.</p><p>The security situation in northern Yemen, where the Houthis govern, presents further challenges.</p><p>Authorities in Sanaa have detained 73 UN aid workers since 2021 on accusations of espionage, prompting UN organisations to suspend operations.</p><p>The Houthi authorities control northern Yemen, where 70 to 80 percent of the country’s 42 million people live.</p><p>This hostile environment forces organisations to stop or scale back their programmes, leaving millions of people in desperate health and living conditions.</p><p>“When aid stops flowing, families feel helpless,” Yahya said. “They lose access to life-saving healthcare and vital assistance.”</p><p>“As long as the war drags on, humanitarian support should continue, and patient evacuation should be facilitated,” he added. “The collective punishment of the population is unfair and inhumane.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He had been rushed to intensive care a day earlier with a dangerously slow heart rate and organ failure.

The prison informed her on January 28 that he had returned to hospital and was being monitored.</p><p>But Khalid’s mother told Al Jazeera that prison authorities are not forthcoming with further information about his condition or level of care, despite her repeated calls and emails.</p><p>“I fear for his life,” she told Al Jazeera on Friday. “Mentally, he’s probably stressed and distraught.</p><p>“We’re not having contact with anybody. I hope he’s doing OK, but I don’t know because I don’t know what’s wrong with him.”</p><p>She said that when they last spoke, Khalid sounded tired and complained of a dry mouth; towards the end of his hunger strike, he had also been refusing liquids in an escalation of his protest.</p><p>“He was just lying down and taking some rest because he just felt really tired. He was too weak to stand up,” she said.</p><p>In a statement to Al Jazeera, the UK Ministry of Justice said, prisoners were managed in line with policy.</p><p>“This includes regular checks by medical professionals, heart monitoring and blood tests, and support to help them eat and drink again. If deemed appropriate by healthcare teams, prisoners will be taken to hospital,” a spokesperson said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Khalid is among five activists accused of breaking into the UK’s largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, last June and spray-painting two Voyager refuelling and transport planes.

Critics have condemned the ban as illiberal overreach, given that the direct action group’s <a href=\"/video/the-take-2/2025/7/10/is-direct-action-for-palestine-terrorism-the-uk-says-it-is\">stated objective</a> is to counter Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians and what it says is British complicity in it by disrupting the UK arms industry.</p><p>Earlier this week, a jury <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/uk-pro-palestinian-activists-not-guilty-of-aggravated-burglary\">acquitted</a> six other Palestine Action-linked detainees of aggravated burglary during a 2024 raid on ⁠a factory operated by the Israeli defence firm Elbit in Bristol.</p><p>Khalid, who suffers from limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes muscle weakness and wasting, is part of a collective of eight remand prisoners linked to Palestine Action that began a rolling hunger strike in November. All have since ended their protests.</p><p>Friends and family of the other hunger strikers have previously told Al Jazeera that when their loved ones were hospitalised, prison authorities did not provide regular updates about their health.</p><p>His trial date is set for January 2027, by which time he would have spent a year and a half in prison – well beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This leads to less liquidity, so any move higher or lower is exacerbated.”</p><p>He explained that the crypto market relies heavily on “hype-driven” cycles where people buy due to a fear of “missing out” on an opportunity.</p><p>“This hype forms the foundation of trading volumes, and that is what we mean by liquidity. Essentially, more trading volumes mean more liquidity, as it makes it easier to quickly buy and sell Bitcoin,” he said.</p><p>“Right now, that foundation is disappearing and this tends to happen during bear markets or ‘crypto winters’, making it much harder to effectively trade assets, and they become even less appealing then. So it’s quite a vicious circle that leads to these downward spirals,” he added.</p><p>A “crypto winter” is an extended period of declining or stagnant prices, something that can be driven by worsening macroeconomic conditions or tightening market regulations, among other reasons.</p><p>Volatility in gold and silver prices in the past two weeks has also dampened market sentiment, affecting the price of cryptocurrencies. Analysts say geopolitical instability and the prospects of a rising US dollar have led investors to sell precious metals, resulting in the sudden downturn.</p><p>Then, last week, prices came back sharply, with the price of gold hitting a record peak of almost $5,595 an ounce, while silver hit an all-time high of nearly $122.</p><p>But this peak did not last long, and this week, the prices of these precious commodities plunged – again – with gold falling to $4,872.83 per ounce on Thursday and silver falling to $77.36 an ounce.</p><p>Other cryptocurrencies like Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, have also fallen. The price of Ether has fallen by 19 percent this week, closing at $1,854 late on Thursday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"does-this-mean-crypto-friendly-policies-in-the-us-aren-t-working\">Does this mean ‘crypto-friendly’ policies in the US aren’t working?</h2><p>The price of Bitcoin soared after United States President Donald Trump’s return to the White House last year, with analysts expecting he would adopt a “crypto-friendly” regulatory regime.</p><p>At a Bitcoin conference in July 2024, as part of his pre-election rally, Trump had said the US is the “crypto capital of the planet” and pledged to also create a Bitcoin “strategic reserve” if he became president.</p><p>In March 2025, on taking office, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/3/4/trump-announces-us-crypto-reserve-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters\">announced</a> his government would create a national strategic crypto reserve which would include five cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and Ether as well as smaller currencies XRP, Cardano and Solana.</p><p>In July last year, Trump also <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/18/trump-says-newly-signed-crypto-law-will-establish-american-dominance\">announced</a> the GENIUS Act, a new cryptocurrency legislation that would establish regulations and consumer protections for “stablecoin”, a type of cryptocurrency whose value is linked to a fixed currency or commodity.</p><p>Then, last month, the US also unveiled draft legislation that would create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, which, if signed into law, would clarify financial regulators’ jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency sector.</p><p>The US president has a personal interest as his family owns the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/is-trumps-pardon-of-binance-boss-changpeng-zhao-a-conflict-of-interest\">cryptofirm</a> World Liberty Financial (WLFI).</p><p>Last March, WLFI launched its own “stablecoin” – a dollar-pegged cryptocoin backed by US treasuries – called USD1.</p><p>But the president’s personal interest in cryptocurrencies and supportive policies have not shielded the digital asset from external market factors.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"have-we-seen-crypto-winters-before\">Have we seen ‘crypto winters’ before?</h2><p>Yes.</p><p>A crypto winter was triggered after Bitcoin peaked in December 2017 and then tumbled in December 2018 due to intense regulatory crackdowns in the US, Canada and other countries, among other reasons.</p><p>Another such winter occurred in November 2022 after a peak in October 2021, due to the <a href=\"/economy/2022/11/11/distressed-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy#:~:text=The%20trading%20platform%20had%20been,after%20a%20wave%20of%20withdrawals.\">FTX currency exchange scandal</a>. In November that year, crypto exchange FTX initiated US bankruptcy proceedings after a liquidity crisis prompted intervention from regulators around the world.</p><p>In a Thursday briefing note, analysts at Kaiko said the downward trend in prices “truly accelerated” after Trump appointed Kevin Warsh as the new Federal Reserve Chair.</p><p>Warsh will replace Jeremy Powell, who Trump has lambasted for not lowering interest rates.</p><p>The Kaiko briefing note stated: “Powell’s recent announcement on January 28th that interest rates would remain unchanged, combined with the appointment of the new Chairman, constituted a true turning point, acting as a catalyst for a sharp acceleration of the decline. The reaction was all the more pronounced given that the crypto market, particularly sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic regime, was already weakened,” the report said.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>Hougan noted that crypto winters typically last for about 13 months and assured investors that the current “winter” will not last for long.</p><p>“As a veteran of multiple crypto winters, I can tell you that the end of those crypto winters feels a lot like now: Despair, desperation, and malaise. But there is nothing about the current market pullback that’s changed anything fundamental about crypto,” he said in his report.</p><p>“I think we’re going to come roaring back sooner rather than later. Heck, it’s been winter since January 2025. Spring is surely coming soon,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

By the grace of God, he has returned from the dead,” he said with a smile.</p><p>Barata, 35, who began working on the mines in 2012, was one of the rare survivors.</p><p>Rebel authorities in charge of the town say at least 200 people were killed when the coltan mine in the mineral-rich eastern DRC city collapsed last week.</p><p>Many victims died of asphyxiation due to a lack of oxygen, while others were crushed by the weight of the earth caving in around them.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heavy-rains-landslides\">Heavy rains, landslides</h2><p>Above the mines of Rubaya are hills that rise steep and green. From the flanks of the mountainside, orange‑brown terraces have been carved out, cutting into the slopes.

Where miners once stood and worked, rescuers were gathered, wading into the thick mud, digging with shovels and bare hands, to haul survivors and dead bodies from the slurry.</p><p>Around the landslide, the community gathered to watch – many faces tight with grief – as they waited for news of survivors.</p><p>After 21 hours underground, rescuers finally pulled Barata from the earth on Thursday at about 1pm.</p><p>He feels lucky to have been rescued alive, along with two of his friends, but says that dozens of others who were with him in the mine shaft did not survive.</p><p>“There were many of us in the same shaft, which I would describe as a tomb,” said Barata, a bandage covering part of his head.</p><p>“We saw the light from afar and knew we would be rescued,” he remembers, but laments that “the others died before our eyes, without saying a word.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4292592\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4292592\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4292592\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25136541152189-1770379448.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4292592\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A coltan mining quarry in Rubaya, DRC [File: Moses Sawasawa/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"trading-blame\">Trading blame</h2><p>Last year, the antigovernment Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) and M23 rebel coalition stormed through eastern DRC, <a href=\"/news/2025/3/13/people-need-a-break-drc-conflict-reignites-dark-memories-of-congo-wars\">seizing</a> key towns and cities from government control, including North Kivu’s Goma and Rubaya.</p><p>The AFC-M23 officials who now control the area reported at least 200 deaths in the Rubaya mine tragedy, but local civil society says the number may rise.</p><p>The Congolese authorities in Kinshasa say M23 and Rwanda – who they accuse of backing the rebels – are behind the deadly mine tragedy.</p><p>According to government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya, the Rubaya mining area is classified as “red status”, which prohibits all mining and commercialisation of minerals, including artisanal mining. He emphasises that digging activities that continue there are in “flagrant” violation of the law and do not comply with any safety standards.</p><p>Kinshasa and regional experts have also accused M23 of smuggling minerals out of the DRC and into Rwanda, to be sold to the international market – an accusation Rwanda rejects.</p><p>“It is clear that the more than 200 percent increase in coltan exports by Rwanda is the result of this illegal and uncontrolled exploitation,” claimed Muyaya.</p><p>The AFC-M23 coalition rejects these accusations, instead claiming that Kinshasa is attempting to “exploit” an accident caused by torrential rains for “political” purposes.</p><p>In a statement on February 1, the group referred to the “irresponsible, politicised and misinformed attitude” of Kinshasa, saying the DRC government is “choosing to manipulate public opinion to mask its appalling record on miner safety”.</p><p>It urged Kinshasa to instead conduct an audit of its own governance, particularly in the mining, flood management, and sanitation sectors.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"natural-wealth-material-poverty\">Natural wealth, material poverty</h2><p>Daniel Kalalizi, an environmental analyst, said the Rubaya collapse is a human tragedy as well as a revealing environmental disaster. Such landslides are also the result of unregulated and illegal mining, he added, because that activity weakens the soil, destroys vegetation cover, and disregards basic safety standards.</p><p>“The responsibility lies with the Congolese state, which is responsible for regulating the mining sector, enforcing environmental laws, and protecting citizens,” he said.</p><p>“The lack of effective control of mining sites contributes directly to this type of tragedy,” he added, calling on miners to focus on safety over profits and saying mineral supply chains must prioritise sustainability in their sourcing.</p><p>Mines in Rubaya produce between 15 and 30 percent of the world’s coltan and are believed to account for over 60 percent of global coltan reserves.</p><p>However, despite the region’s immense natural wealth, observers say the local population still languishes in undignified living conditions, working in extreme and unsafe circumstances just to make a living.</p><p>Barata, who is now recovering in Goma from the trauma of what he endured, says that because of economic concerns, he has no choice but to return to the mines for work.</p><p>But in the meantime, he tries to focus on the fond memories of the miners who were with him underground.</p><p>Although several people he knew died that day, he remembers the last good hours he spent underground with a man named Bosco, a father of two, whose funeral took place on Friday, January 30, in Goma.</p><p>Barata says on the evening before the collapse, the two shared their meals, towels and even sleeping space. When the collapse happened, they talked about whether they would make it out alive.</p><p>“Before the oxygen ran out in the shaft, we told each other to repent so that we would not miss what we had come for or the kingdom of heaven,” Barata remembers.</p><p>Bosco didn’t make it, he says, but “I came back from the dead.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

A brilliant and gifted young doctor specialising in women’s and children’s health, Dr Maisara had returned to serve his besieged and occupied homeland after completing his master’s degree at King’s College London as a Chevening Scholar in 2019. Until the day he was killed, he repeatedly risked his life to provide desperately needed healthcare to his people under relentless Israeli attacks.</p><p data-start=\"966\" data-end=\"1080\">Dr Maisara was just one of more than 1,700 Palestinian healthcare professionals killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023.</p><p data-start=\"1082\" data-end=\"2027\">As I wrote this, I received news from Gaza that paramedic Hussein Hassan Al-Samiri, aged 48, from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, had been killed in an Israeli air strike targeting clearly identified ambulance crews in the al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis. The strike hit the rescue team as they attempted to reach people wounded in an attack on tents sheltering displaced families – an attack that killed 21 people, including five children.</p><p data-start=\"1082\" data-end=\"2027\">Al-Samiri was the fourth healthcare worker killed in Gaza since a so-called “ceasefire” was declared in October 2025 and the second in less than 24 hours. He was killed in a double-tap attack: an initial strike followed by a second, deliberate attack targeting medical responders and rescue teams as they rushed to treat the wounded. This war crime had been in the Israeli playbook for many decades. I personally witnessed double-tap attacks on ambulances and rescue teams in Beirut during the brutal and bloody Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and later in Gaza during innumerable Israeli attacks.</p><p data-start=\"2029\" data-end=\"2135\">In the past two years, many Palestinian health workers were also executed by Israeli forces merely for doing their jobs.</p><p data-start=\"2137\" data-end=\"2503\">Last March, for example, Israeli soldiers <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/3/31/what-happened-to-missing-medics-killed-in-gaza\">executed</a> 15 Palestinian paramedics and civil defence rescuers one by one in the al-Hashaashin area as they rushed to help the wounded at the site of a missile attack, before burying their bodies in a shallow mass grave in an apparent attempt to conceal the crime. <a href=\"/news/2025/4/5/unprecedented-video-shows-last-moments-of-gaza-medics-killed-by-israel\">Video footage</a> of the killings, recovered from the phone of one of the dead rescue workers, later circulated widely across international media.</p><p data-start=\"2505\" data-end=\"2647\">The execution of medical responders in al-Hashaashin marked one of the most extreme manifestations of Israel’s targeting of healthcare workers.</p><p data-start=\"2649\" data-end=\"3001\">The gruesome footage shocked many, but — like irrefutable evidence of double-tap strikes  — it did not prove enough to move Western governments backing Israel into meaningful action. A few issued mournful statements, others delivered stern warnings, but none acted to stop or effectively sanction Israel.</p><p data-start=\"3003\" data-end=\"3652\">Would these governments have remained silent if Palestinian resistance had targeted Israeli healthcare workers and ambulance crews in the same way? Would they have merely paid lip service to human rights or swiftly condemned, sanctioned and punished the perpetrators? We know the answer. The continuation of carnage in Gaza reflects profound racist structural violence sustained by Western indifference. This indifference grants the settler-colony’s genocidal government impunity, and poses a deadly threat not only to Palestinian lives, healthcare and human rights, but also to the credibility of what is described as the rules-based international order, to all of us.</p><p data-start=\"3654\" data-end=\"4218\">The scale of destruction facing Gaza’s population is staggering. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, at least 71,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, with tens of thousands more still trapped beneath the rubble. Civilian death rates exceed 80 percent, with children, women and elderly people forming the overwhelming majority of victims. Life expectancy in Gaza has collapsed from approximately 74 years to around 35 years as a result of military violence, starvation, displacement, disease and the systematic destruction of medical infrastructure.</p><p data-start=\"4220\" data-end=\"4564\">Today, Palestinian healthcare workers continue to operate under unimaginable conditions. Hospitals and clinics have been bombed, invaded or burned, yet their services continue, often at minimal capacity. The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/gazas-medical-students-help-health-system-decimated-by-israels-war\">resilience and bravery</a> of Gaza’s medical professionals is extraordinary, but cannot compensate for the systematic dismantling of the healthcare system.</p><p data-start=\"4566\" data-end=\"5086\">The so-called “ceasefire” that went into effect on October 10, 2025 and presented internationally as a step towards ending hostilities, did nothing to lift Palestinians out of this misery. Their suffering continues under the cloak of this pretend “peace”. Since the “ceasefire”, Israeli military attacks have killed at least 529 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,400 others. Gaza authorities report more than 1,450 violations of the ceasefire between October 2025 and January 2026 through Israeli air strikes, artillery fire and direct shootings.</p><p data-start=\"5088\" data-end=\"5669\">One of the promises attached to this ceasefire charade was safe evacuation routes for the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/gaza-patients-head-to-rafah-crossing-as-people-return-amid-israeli-attacks\">sick and wounded</a>. On January 26, the World Health Organization was able to facilitate the evacuation of just 24 children from Gaza to Jordan, accompanied by 36 caregivers. On February 2, only five critically ill patients were permitted to leave. Meanwhile, nearly 20,000 patients remain trapped inside Gaza, including 4,500 children in urgent need of treatment unavailable within the territory. More than 1,200 patients have died while waiting for permission to leave Gaza for life-saving medical care.</p><p data-start=\"5671\" data-end=\"5878\">Israel has not only devastated Gaza’s healthcare system by destroying hospitals and killing doctors and nurses; it has also trapped the sick and wounded inside what has become an apocalyptic open-air concentration camp.</p><p data-start=\"5880\" data-end=\"6394\">The man-made catastrophe facing Gaza’s healthcare system is not the result of any failure by Gaza’s medical professionals. It is the outcome of 18 years of siege, compounded by more than two years of sustained bombardment, and <a href=\"/news/2024/11/24/dying-in-hell-palestinian-medics-jailed-by-israel\">the detention</a>, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2024/5/6/family-says-al-shifa-doctor-was-tortured-to-death-in-israeli-prison\">torture</a> and targeted killing of medical personnel. The World Health Organization has recorded more than 1,800 attacks on healthcare facilities and staff across the occupied Palestinian territories since October 2023, killing more than 1,000 people and injuring nearly 2,000 others.</p><p data-start=\"426\" data-end=\"953\">These attacks are part of a longer historical pattern. Over the past two decades, at least 3,254 Israeli attacks on healthcare have been documented by WHO across the occupied Palestinian territories, killing or injuring more than 4,200 patients and medical staff. Each cycle of Israeli military assault further erodes Gaza’s already fragile medical system, deepening the exhaustion of a healthcare infrastructure already <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/gaza-patients-facing-death-as-israel-continues-to-block-medical-supplies\">crippled</a> by <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/no-gauze-no-gloves-israels-severe-restrictions-on-medical-aid-to-gaza\">chronic shortages</a> of medicines, equipment, maintenance, fuel, repair capacity and international protection.</p><p data-start=\"955\" data-end=\"1554\">The humanitarian consequences are visible everywhere. Gaza is now enduring its third consecutive winter under conditions of mass displacement. More than 80 percent of buildings have been damaged or destroyed. Families are living in overcrowded shelters, exposed to storms and freezing temperatures. Children have already died from hypothermia. Disease outbreaks are spreading rapidly, with more than 88,600 acute respiratory infections and approximately 11,000 cases of acute watery diarrhoea reported in recent weeks, about 80 percent affecting children, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p data-start=\"308\" data-end=\"927\">Humanitarian assistance itself is under direct attack. Israel has refused to renew operating licences, banning at least 37 internationally recognised humanitarian organisations from working in Gaza, including <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/israel-says-it-will-ban-msf-from-operating-in-gaza\">Doctors Without Borders</a> and the Norwegian Refugee Council. At the same time, Israel’s parliament has passed legislation allowing the cutting of electricity and water supplies to United Nations agencies providing life-saving aid, healthcare and education to more than 2.5 million Palestinian refugees. The consequences are obvious and deliberate: humanitarian collapse, collective punishment and ethnic cleansing as policy.</p><p data-start=\"1913\" data-end=\"2219\">What is unfolding in Gaza is not only a war on a population but a direct assault on the principles of international law, including the obligation to protect civilians and medical services during armed conflict. With consistent backing from the United States, Israel is replacing legal norms with raw power.</p><p data-start=\"2221\" data-end=\"2426\">Europe once vowed “never again” after the Holocaust. That promise was meant to warn humanity that tolerating racist violence leads not to stability but to catastrophe. Today, that warning is being ignored.</p><p data-start=\"2428\" data-end=\"2750\">The genocide in Gaza represents one of the defining ethical tests of our time. Humanitarian aid, while essential, cannot address the root causes of illness and premature death in Gaza and the West Bank. These root causes lie in the structural realities of the Israeli occupation and apartheid, shaping every aspect of Palestinian life.</p><p data-start=\"2752\" data-end=\"3005\">The new year has brought no renewal for Gaza, only the continuation of a slow genocide and the collapse of Western moral leadership. Yet hope remains in the resilience and resistance of the Palestinian people and the growing global solidarity demanding accountability.</p><p data-start=\"3007\" data-end=\"3118\">“Never again,” the world declared in 1945. For Palestinians, the urgency of those words has never been greater.</p><p data-start=\"3007\" data-end=\"3118\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the first time this has happened in our country’s history.</p><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">“Spaniards cannot live in a world where foreign tech oligarchs can flood our phones with propaganda at will simply because the government has announced measures to protect minors and enforce the law.”</p><p>So what is the dispute about, and why has it become so heated?</p><h2 id=\"what-has-sanchez-announced\">What has Sanchez announced?</h2><p>Speaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Tuesday, Sanchez said that by banning social media for children under 16, Spain aimed to “protect them from the digital Wild West”.</p><p>Currently, social media platforms such as Facebook and TikTok require users to be at least 13 years old.</p><p>Sanchez said, “Our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone … We will no longer accept that.”</p><p>Sanchez added that Spain would also devise a law to hold social media company executives responsible for the illegal, hateful or harmful content on their platforms.</p><p>“The power of the state is there to protect democracies from the attacks they suffer and also children and adolescents from that toxic, unpunished world that social media has unfortunately become,” Sanchez said.</p><p>“They won’t break us, because the voice of reason … will not be silenced by these techno-oligarchs of the algorithm.”</p><p>Sanchez also announced that Spain has joined a group of five European countries, which he termed the “Coalition of the Digitally Willing”, to discuss cross-border regulation of social media.</p><p>Sanchez did not provide details of what this collaborative effort could entail, nor did he name which countries would participate, but added that they would meet in the upcoming days.</p><p>“We know that this is a battle that far exceeds the boundaries of any country,” he said.</p><p>The proposed ban would be introduced as an amendment to an existing bill on digital protection for minors that is currently being debated in parliament, the Reuters news agency reported, quoting an unnamed government spokesperson.</p><p>Furiously. On Tuesday, Musk responded to a video of Sanchez’s speech on X, writing: “He is a traitor to the people of Spain.”</p><p>He then reposted the video of the speech, writing, again: “Dirty Sanchez is a tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain.”</p><p>Grok, which is the AI platform on X, was the number one mobile application in Spain last month, Musk claimed.</p><p>However, Musk has been accused of platforming the far-right and white supremacists, particularly in Europe. He addressed a political rally of the far-right <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/2/german-security-service-designates-far-right-afd-as-extremist\">Alternative for Germany (AfD) party</a> in the German city of Halle last year.</p><p>On Wednesday, Telegram founder Pavel Durov also lashed out at Sanchez in a message on Telegram, writing: “These aren’t safeguards; they’re steps toward total control.

He was allowed to leave France in March under judicial supervision, but the case remains open.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-people-in-spain-want\">What do people in Spain want?</h2><p>The Ipsos Education Monitor 2025, published in late August 2025, reported that 82 percent of people in Spain support banning social media for children under the age of 14, a rise from 73 percent in 2024.</p><p>The survey was conducted in 30 countries, and a majority of respondents in all 30 countries supported banning social media for children under 14.</p><p>While social media has long provided easy access to unregulated graphic content, misinformation and hate speech, the recent explosion of AI‑generated material poses new risks to the wellbeing of children and young people, experts say.</p><p>The American Psychological Association published an advisory last year warning that generative AI systems can amplify harmful content such as violent or sexual videos.</p><p>It also added that adolescents are less likely than adults to question the accuracy of AI-generated content. “They may also be unaware of the persuasive intent underlying an AI system’s advice or bias,” the advisory stated.</p><p>AI can also <a href=\"/news/2024/3/1/could-ai-exacerbate-inequalities-in-our-world-today?traffic_source=KeepReading\">amplify</a> pre-existing <a href=\"/news/2024/3/9/why-google-gemini-wont-show-you-white-people\">societal prejudices</a>, according to Ayo Tometi, co-creator of the US-based antiracist movement Black Lives Matter.</p><p>Children worldwide are also worried about the misuse of AI for online child sexual exploitation and “deepfakes”, according to UNICEF research on children’s perspectives and AI published in October 2025.</p><p>Governments appear to be taking this seriously.</p><p>Musk’s Grok recently came under fire for allowing users to generate sexually explicit fake images of women and minors.

Under the law, 10 of the biggest platforms will face $33m in fines if they fail to take “reasonable steps” to purge Australian-based users younger than 16.</p><p>As of January 16, social media companies revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia, according to officials.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We stared down everybody who said it couldn’t be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,” Australian Communications Minister Anika Wells told reporters last month.</p><p>Days after Australia’s ban took effect, Reddit, which was one of the 10 platforms required to purge minors, lodged a challenge to the ban in the High Court, while still complying with it.<strong> </strong></p><p>In 2023, France adopted a law mandating that social media platforms obtain parental consent before children under 15 could open accounts. However, local media report that technical difficulties have hampered enforcement.</p><p>In Germany, children aged between 13 and 16 require parental consent to be able to use social media platforms. In Italy, children under 14 need parental consent to set up social media accounts.</p><p>Last year, the Chinese internet regulator Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) introduced a “minor mode” that applies device‑level controls and app-specific rules to limit screen time by age.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In November 2025, Denmark said it would introduce a ban on social media platforms for children under 15.

His political trajectory and election as President of the United States were unprecedented. Without a track record in politics, his first term was, by definition, a foray into the ways of Washington and the conduct of international affairs. The successes of his first term enabled him to master the intricacies of American governance and prepared him for his second, which places greater emphasis on foreign policy.</p><p>One year after his second election, President Trump’s foreign policy doctrine has reshaped the global order and redirected America’s role in the world at lightning speed, from defence alliances to resource security strategy. Critics dismiss the Trump Doctrine as nothing more than a chaotic combination of isolationism, dismantlement of multilateralism, and imperialism. Yet the reality is quite the opposite. President Trump’s vision is methodical and strategically results-driven. Although unorthodox, Trump’s bold and sometimes deliberately provocative pronouncements unnerve adversaries, often leading to concessions and desired outcomes. Whether friend or foe, America-first interests define his agenda and tactics. He aptly practises the “art of the deal” to achieve his goals. Nowhere is this strategy clearer than in Greenland. Trump threatened an invasion, a maximalist bargaining position, if Denmark refused to cede the island, which he deems vital to US security. The result: an agreement in which Denmark and the US will greatly increase their joint military footprint and open investment almost exclusively to the United States while excluding Chinese and Russian encroachment. Mission accomplished: enhanced US strategic access while reinforcing Western security architecture. Trump believes that by placing American interests first, the free world will also benefit, prosper and be more secure. Trump argues that prioritising American strength ultimately stabilises and secures the broader democratic alliance.</p><p>To accomplish his objectives, Trump has discarded what he sees as the role of the United Nations and argues that the 80-year-old organisation is at best ineffective and at worst a forum for anti-Americanism and left-wing activism, frequently paralysed by veto politics and incapable of enforcing meaningful accountability. Instead, his approach is bilateral or regional, reflecting a doctrine that prioritises direct power relationships over multilateral consensus. Regional alliances, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), have been redefined by Trump’s insistence on collective engagement and greater contributions by member states, rebalancing alliance obligations to strengthen deterrence while reducing US overextension. Wealthy allies in Europe and Asia will now shoulder more of the financial burden for their own defence. At its core, the Trump Doctrine rests on two strategic pillars designed to secure peace through strength and prosperity through leverage. First, enhanced American military strength through a proposed doubling of the defence budget to 6 percent of the United States’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP), aimed at restoring overwhelming military deterrence in an era of great power competition. Second, the promotion of investment and equitable free trade. Trade and tariffs are instruments used by Trump not only to achieve equitable trade agreements but also as strategic tools designed to shape global behaviour and advance foreign policy objectives, ranging from curtailing Russian oil purchases in support of Ukraine to combating the global illicit drug trade, demonstrating Trump’s belief that economic leverage can be as decisive as military strength in shaping global outcomes.</p><p>In no region of the world has Trump invested more energy and political capital than the Middle East, which has become a central arena for his foreign policy approach. The Trump Doctrine has reaffirmed and strengthened the American-Israeli relationship while expanding the United States’ historic ties to Arab allies through the Abraham Accords that Trump championed in his first term, positioning them as a framework for broader regional cooperation. President Biden labelled Saudi Arabia a “pariah state”; Trump, in turn, considers the Kingdom a pivotal ally and a cornerstone of regional stability. Trump’s sway with Arab allies, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, was instrumental in achieving a ceasefire in Gaza, using regional alliances to advance negotiations. Trump’s vision for the Middle East is largely based on a philosophy that prosperity and opportunity, particularly for the Palestinians, is the cornerstone to achieve peace. Hence, his references to the development of Gaza and investments to make it prosperous. Trump’s 20-point, three-phase Gaza peace plan and Peace Council seek to balance Palestinian self-rule with Israeli security requirements. By marshaling the resources and commitments of Turkey and key Arab allies in the region, Trump is prepared to take calculated gambles to resolve the long-festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict, applying similar regional coalition-building efforts, just as he has done with the warring parties in Syria and with his support of the Sharaa-led government. Where Trump draws a red line is with respect to Iran. The Trump Administration subscribes to the view that most of the instability in the region is attributable to the Iranian regime’s meddling and support of terrorism and Iranian proxies in Yemen, Gaza, and Lebanon. Beyond being a state sponsor of terrorism, Iran’s nuclear ambitions also pose a global threat and, if successful, would serve to impose Iran’s hegemony over the entire region. Whether by military force or through a verifiable negotiated agreement, Trump is determined to conclusively end the Iranian threat, seeking to contain or dismantle Iran’s strategic capabilities for the long term. Trump is the first American President to strike Iran and is prepared to do so again. With Iran’s containment or with regime change through internal revolution supported by the United States, Trump would have much more leeway to press for a Palestinian state and the necessary security arrangements for both Israel and the Palestinians. In Trump’s vision, the guarantors of such a peace would be the United States and a cadre of Arab leaders representing an expanded Abraham Accords roster that would include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Syria, and Lebanon, alongside other Arab states committed to regional security cooperation.</p><p>It is essential to consider the Trump Administration’s global foreign policy achievements and objectives through a broad lens, recognising them as part of a deliberate and coherent strategic doctrine. The Trump Doctrine’s principles are anchored in an unprecedented expansion of national defence, the pursuit of fair and equitable trade, and steadfast support for American allies. Unorthodox as Trump’s approach may be, its outcomes, according to its supporters, have demonstrated tangible strategic gains. In many respects, Donald Trump is portrayed as a 21st century Theodore Roosevelt, a leader willing to project strength to secure national interests. Both Presidents put America First and carried a big stick, prioritising national power as the foundation of global influence and stability.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
