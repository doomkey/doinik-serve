He noted that aside from the energy sector, residential buildings and the railway were also damaged.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s air force said Russia deployed 345 weapons, including 50 missiles and 297 drones, in the overnight attack. It said it shot down 33 missiles and 274 drones.</li>\n<li><span>Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha called on the international community to impose tougher sanctions against the Kremlin following the latest Russian attack, saying, “This terror cannot be normalised; it must be stopped. Russia cannot wag the world, just as the tail cannot wag the dog.”</span></li>\n<li>Russian-installed officials in the occupied Ukrainian region of Zaporizhia said emergency crews were restoring power to areas hit by cuts following a Ukrainian attack on <span>energy infrastructure.

It said four members of Oseguera’s Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) were killed in the raid, while two others died during their transfer to Mexico City.</p><p>Two more were arrested, and armoured vehicles, rocket launchers and other arms were seized, it said. Three members of the armed forces were wounded and are receiving medical treatment, it added.</p><p>US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau welcomed the operation and called Oseguera “one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins”.</p><p>“This is a great development for Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world,” he added.</p><p>The US State Department warned Americans in the states of Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon to remain in safe places due to the ongoing security operations.</p><p>Canada also issued a travel warning for some areas, citing “shootouts with security forces and explosions” in Jalisco, Guerrero and Michoacan.

His brother is in a US prison, and his son, called El Menchito, is also in prison. As is his daughter. We could now see different regional bosses in the cartel start disputing for power. We saw this happen before. When El Chapo was arrested, it eventually sparked a civil war between the different Sinaloa factions,” Hollman said.</p><p>The timing is particularly sensitive, our correspondent noted, with Mexico set to host the FIFA World Cup and Guadalajara serving as a host city.</p><p>“So, what looks like a government triumph today could become a significantly bigger security crisis in the months ahead,” he said.</p><p>Analysts said Mexico’s military needed to move quickly to limit any violence.</p><p>“Killing or capturing the head of the cartel is not really going to have a major impact. They have to go after the infrastructure, their logistics, the money laundering, their armed wings,” said Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations at the US Drug Enforcement Administration.</p><p>“What they have to do is launch a frontal assault based on intelligence, and basically diminish the infrastructure of this cartel. And they have to do it quick and they have to do it efficiently, because if not, there is going to be hell to pay in terms of violence,” he said.</p><p>Vigil said the Trump administration has done little to address the US side of the equation, despite pressuring Mexico on drug trafficking.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of weapons flow from the US into Mexico annually – a stark contrast to Mexico’s single military-run gun store, which sells just 6,500 firearms a year – yet the Republican Party has shown no appetite for curbing those exports, he said.</p><p>Similarly, the administration has made no meaningful push to reduce domestic drug demand, he said.</p><p>“If there is no demand or consumption, there’s not gonna be any cartels. It is a big problem,” he said. “But the Trump administration does nothing in terms of drug education, treatment of drug addiction – none of that.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Prominent American conservative journalist Tucker Carlson’s interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has caused quite a stir. Since it was released on Friday, observers from across the political spectrum in the United States have taken to social media to comment.</p><p>Indeed, the interview highlighted — perhaps more than any other political or media spectacle — the growing suspicion that American officials may be more loyal to a foreign country than they are to the US. This may well turn out to be a defining moment for how Americans view their government’s relationship with Israel.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-true-friend\">Israel’s ‘true friend’</h2><p>Huckabee, who is also a Baptist minister and former governor of Arkansas, was confirmed as US ambassador to Israel in April 2025. The news of his appointment was welcomed by the Israeli government and various pro-Israel groups, and he was hailed as a “true friend of Israel”.</p><p>That Israel is quite close to Huckabee’s heart was made clear throughout his interview with Carlson, as he repeatedly parroted Israeli talking points.</p><p>He spoke of Israel’s “biblical right” to the land; referred to the occupied West Bank as “Judea and Samaria”; and even <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/absurd-and-provocative-huckabee-faces-firestorm-for-israel-border-stance\">appeared to approve</a> of Israel expanding its territory to other parts of the Middle East.</p><p>He repeatedly spoke of Israeli interests as US interests, often used “we” seemingly including Israel, and even insisted that the “problem on the border with Lebanon” was an issue Americans should care about. He defended his meeting with Jonathan Pollard, the former American intelligence analyst convicted of spying on the US for Israel, and for advocating for his early release from prison.</p><p>Huckabee went as far as taking a jab at the US Army in his effort to defend the violations of the Israeli military in Gaza.</p><p>When Carlson pressed him about Israel’s killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he appeared to suggest that the Israeli military is more careful about avoiding civilian casualties than the US military.</p><p>After Huckabee argued that Israel’s war on Gaza produced a “lower number of civilians killed” than any modern urban war, Carlson pressed him for a reference point.</p><p>The ambassador offered two US wars — in Iraq and Afghanistan — as comparisons, suggesting that Israeli military commanders have been more concerned about protecting civilian life than their American counterparts.</p><p>A US ambassador publicly arguing that a foreign military is more humane than his own country’s armed forces inevitably raises questions about where his primary loyalty lies.</p><p>But Huckabee is, of course, not the only “true friend of Israel” within the US political elite.</p><p>The US Congress, on both sides of the aisle, has been known to give boisterous standing applause to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu every time he visits.</p><p>Huckabee’s boss, US President Donald Trump, has repeatedly claimed he is “the best friend to Israel… they’ve ever had”.</p><p>Trump’s predecessor, President Joe Biden, has proudly declared he is a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/i-am-zionist-how-joe-bidens-lifelong-bond-with-israel-shapes-war-policy-2023-10-21/\">Zionist</a> and ensured full support and impunity for Israel as it carried out genocide in Gaza.</p><p>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has boasted that he goes to Israel every two weeks “whether I need to or not”.</p><p>Eric Adams, former New York City mayor, chose to visit Israel at the end of his tenure and <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/11/17/us-news/eric-adams-meets-with-netanyahu-on-taxpayer-funded-israel-trip-as-he-rips-mayor-elect-zohran-mamdani/\">said</a> that as mayor of America’s largest city, he had been serving Israel.</p><p>And the list goes on.</p><p>For the longest time, declarations of loyalty to Israel were seen as a political advantage in US politics. But this may well be changing.</p><h2 id=\"a-wake-up-call\">A wake-up call</h2><p>American academics have long been interested in Israel’s oversized influence on US politics. Scholars like John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have written extensively about the issue.</p><p>But for many years, this scrutiny was largely confined to academia or left-wing activist circles. Conservatives and liberals labelled such critics as conspiracy theorists or anti-Semites.</p><p>The Carlson-Huckabee interview has perhaps let the cat out of the bag on the American right.</p><p>What makes the interview important is not simply the substance of Huckabee’s remarks, but the interviewer, venue, audience, and underlying message of the line of questioning.</p><p>A hugely popular conservative media figure travelled to Israel and publicly pressed a sitting US ambassador on whether American interests are being subordinated to Israeli interests. He questioned the theological and historical underpinnings of Zionism, criticised Israel’s treatment of Palestinian Christians, and asked why US tax dollars are sent to Israel.</p><p>In his responses, the ambassador appeared to speak more as a representative of the Israeli government than the United States government.</p><p>Judging by Huckabee’s <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/american-politics/article-887416\">defensive</a> reaction after the interview and its social media fallout, he is learning an important lesson: appearing to put Israel first and America second is no longer an asset, but a liability, for American politicians.</p><p>Elected American officials will be watching the public reaction carefully — especially in light of polling data showing that American public opinion towards Israel has <a href=\"/opinions/2025/9/22/us-public-opinion-on-israel-is-changing-us-policy-will-have-to-as-well\">shifted</a> dramatically in recent years.</p><p>The political incentive that has driven decades of unconditional support for Israel has now been weakened. The political calculus, too, is changing — it may be politically advantageous for American officials to adopt more evenhanded, even openly critical, approaches to Israel.</p><p>This alone marks a significant shift.</p><p>Carlson’s interview with Huckabee did not create that shift, but it brought it into the heart of the American right. If the question “America first or Israel first” can now be asked openly in conservative circles, then important political boundaries have already been broken.</p><p>The Carlson-Huckabee interview could be the wake-up call that American politics needed to break free from the outsized influence of a Middle Eastern country that has long undermined US interests.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

However, we continue to closely monitor US actions and have made all necessary preparations for any potential scenario,” he said.</p><p>The cautious optimism came after Oman’s minister of foreign affairs, Badr Al Busaidi, confirmed a third round of indirect talks between the two sides in Switzerland.</p><p>“Pleased to confirm US-Iran negotiations are now set for Geneva this Thursday, with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalizing the deal,” said Al Busaidi, who acts as a mediator in indirect talks between Washington and Tehran.</p><p class=\"p1\">Iran and the US resumed indirect talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme in Oman earlier this month, and held <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/irans-araghchi-arrives-in-geneva-for-second-round-of-nuclear-talks-with-us\">a second round</a> in Geneva last week. Although Washington and Tehran described the talks in overall positive terms, they failed to achieve a significant breakthrough.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-haven-t-they-capitulated\">‘Why haven’t they capitulated?’</h2><p>Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who leads nuclear negotiations for Washington, said on Saturday that the US president was curious as to ‌why Iran has not yet “capitulated” and agreed to curb its nuclear programme.</p><p>“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’, because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t… I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” Witkoff said during an interview with Fox News’s My View with Lara Trump, hosted by the US president’s daughter-in-law.</p><p>“Why, under this pressure – with the amount of seapower and naval power over there – why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet, it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”</p><p>According to US media, the airpower Washington is amassing in the region is the greatest since its invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the past few days alone, the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">US has deployed</a> more than 120 aircraft to the Middle East, while the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, is on its way to join the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group already positioned in the Arabian Sea.</p><p>Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi reacted to Witkoff’s comments in a post on X, saying: “Curious to know why we do not capitulate? Because we are Iranian.”</p><p>He also said ⁠in an interview with CBS that a diplomatic solution with the US was still within reach. He told the Face the Nation moderator, Margaret Brennan, that Iran’s nuclear programme was a matter of “dignity and pride” for Iranians.</p><p>“We have developed this technology by ourselves, by our scientists, and it is very dear to us because we have created it – we have paid a huge expense for that,” he said.</p><p>Araghchi cited among the costs two decades of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\">US sanctions</a>, the targeted <a href=\"/news/2025/6/13/israel-kills-nuclear-scientists-strikes-sites-in-iran-who-did-it-target\">killings of Iranian scientists</a>, and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/6/iran-demands-accountability-for-israel-and-us-after-war-of-aggression\">US-Israeli attacks on nuclear facilities</a> in June last year.</p><p>“We’re not going to give [our nuclear programme] up. There is no legal reason to do that while everything is peaceful and safeguarded” by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Araghchi said.</p><p>As a “committed member” of the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/17/what-is-the-npt-and-why-has-iran-threatened-to-pull-out-of-the-treaty\">Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)</a>, which requires non-nuclear-weapon states not to seek or acquire nuclear weapons, Iran is “ready to cooperate with the agency in full”, Araghchi added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"peaceful-enrichment\">Peaceful enrichment</h2><p>But he stressed that under the treaty, Tehran also has “every right to enjoy a peaceful nuclear energy, including enrichment”.</p><p>“Enrichment is a sensitive part of our negotiations. The American team knows about our position, and we know their position. We have already exchanged our concerns, and I think a solution is achievable,” the minister noted.</p><p>Washington, meanwhile, has also sought to expand the talks beyond the nuclear issue to cover Iran’s missile programme and its support for regional armed groups.</p><p>Iran has rejected the demands, and Araghchi told CBS that the Iranian delegation was “negotiating only nuclear” at the present time.</p><p>He also said that the Iranian delegation is working ahead of the next meeting to present a draft that includes “elements which can accommodate both sides’ concerns and interests” to reach a “fast deal”.</p><p>The top Iranian diplomat added that the agreement would likely be “better” than the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/iran-says-restrictions-on-nuclear-programme-terminated-as-deal-expires\">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)</a>, negotiated by former US President Barack Obama in 2015.</p><p>“There are elements that could be much better than the previous deal,” he said, without elaborating. “Right now, there is no need for too much detail. But we can agree on our nuclear programme to remain peaceful forever, and at the same time, for more sanctions [to be] lifted.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"simply-unrealistic\">‘Simply unrealistic’</h2><p>Some observers were less optimistic about the chances of striking a deal.</p><p>Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, told Al Jazeera that Iran is likely to put forward a proposal that goes beyond anything they ever offered, but even that may not be enough.</p><p>“Trump has been sold a narrative by the Israelis that portrays Iran far, far weaker than it actually is. As a result, he’s adopting maximalist capitulation positions that are simply unrealistic based on how the power reality actually looks,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Unless this gets corrected, even if the Iranians put forward a very far-leaning proposal that is extremely attractive to the US, Trump may still say no, because he’s under the false belief that he can get something even better.”</p><p>A previous negotiating effort collapsed last year when Israel launched attacks on Iran, triggering a 12-day war that Washington joined by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.</p><p>Trump issued new threats of military action in January following a deadly Iranian crackdown on antigovernment protesters. Tehran responded by threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz – a vital oil export route for Gulf oil – and warning that it could <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">strike US military bases</a> in the region.</p><p>The exchange heightened fears of a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/irans-khamenei-maintains-tough-rhetoric-with-us-despite-nuclear-talks\">regional war</a> and prompted diplomatic efforts by Gulf states, including Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, to prevent escalation.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, has lobbied Trump to negotiate a deal that will dismantle Iran’s nuclear programme and resolve the issue of its ballistic missiles.</p><p>The Israeli Kan public broadcaster reported last week that Israel is preparing for the possibility that Washington could give the green light for strikes on Iran’s ballistic missile system.</p><p>Mark Fitzpatrick, former director of the non-proliferation programme at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that zero uranium enrichment is out of the question for Tehran.</p><p>He also outlined a potential strategic rift between Trump and Netanyahu regarding policy on Iran. Fitzpatrick argued that the Trump administration remains laser-focused on the nuclear threat, while the Israeli government seeks a much broader containment strategy.</p><p>“Trump just has the nuclear goal, and if he could get to that [zero enrichment], I don’t think he would feel obliged to keep pressing because Netanyahu wanted the other things,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

South Africa in their first cricket match of the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup and now must win their next two games to have a chance of reaching the semifinals.</p><p>The defending champions were bowled out for 111 in 18.5 overs while chasing a target of 188 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India on Sunday.</p><p>It was the cohosts’ first loss of the tournament and also ended their 12-match winning streak in the T20 World Cup that they had carried on from their title-winning run in 2024.</p><p>South Africa’s bowlers put on a near-perfect display against a strong Indian batting lineup, and were backed by their fielders to leave the pre-tournament favourites reeling.</p><p>India lost their in-form opener Ishan Kishan on the fourth ball of the innings to the offspin bowling of South Africa’s captain Aiden Markram while trying to hit against the spin.</p><p>One-down batter Tilak Varma was the next to fall as he was caught behind off the first ball of Marco Jansen’s over.</p><p>India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav and out-of-form star batter Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild their innings until Sharma fell in the fifth over after scoring 15 runs off 12 deliveries.</p><p>Incoming batter Washington Sundar and Yadav were the next two wickets to fall as India failed to build a big partnership in front of a large home crowd.</p><p>A 35-run partnership between all-rounders Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube lifted the Indian run chase briefly, but South Africa’s disciplined bowling and near-faultless fielding resulted in regular dismissals for the home side.</p><p>When Dube fell for 42 off 37, India’s fate was sealed.</p><p>Jansen’s superb bowling earned him four wickets for 22 runs off 3.5 overs , while left-arm spin bowler Keshav Maharaj took three for 24 in his four overs.</p><p>All of South Africa’s bowlers were economical, with Lungi Ngidi leading the way by conceding only 15 runs in his four wicketless overs.</p><p>Earlier, player of the match David Miller’s crucial innings of 63 runs off 35 balls stabilised South Africa’s innings after they were reduced to 20-3 in four overs.</p><p>He shared a 97-run partnership with Dewald Brevis, who scored 45 off 29 balls, as the pair resurrected the Proteas after Markram decided to bat first after winning the toss in the first Super Eight match in Group 1.</p><p>Despite Miller’s dismissal in the 16th over, South Africa were able to post a formidable total of 187-7, thanks to a 24-ball 44 not out by Tristan Stubbs at the end of the innings.</p><p>Jasprit Bumrah picked up 3-15 off his four overs.</p><p>The loss propels South Africa to the top of Group 1 in the Super Eight stage, with India at the bottom with a net run rate of -3.80.</p><p>The defending champions must win their remaining two games to have a chance of qualifying for the semifinals.</p><p>West Indies and Zimbabwe are the other two teams in their group and will face each other on Monday.</p><p>South Africa face the West Indies on Thursday, while India play Zimbabwe on Friday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It served as a pointed warning about the economic consequences if Washington proceeds with its threats to strike Iran, highlighting how quickly a regional confrontation could spill into global markets.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-the-strait-of-hormuz\">Where is the Strait of Hormuz?</h2><p data-start=\"2029\" data-end=\"2094\">The Strait of Hormuz is the world’s most critical oil chokepoint.</p><p data-start=\"1467\" data-end=\"1755\">The curved waterway lies between Iran to the north and Oman and the United Arab Emirates to the south. It is roughly 50km (31 miles) wide at its entrance and exit and narrows to about 33km (20 miles) at its tightest point. It forms the only maritime link between the Gulf and the Arabian Sea.</p><p data-start=\"1757\" data-end=\"2003\">Despite its narrow width, the channel accommodates the world’s largest crude carriers. Major Middle Eastern oil and gas exporters rely on it to move supplies to international markets while importing nations depend on its uninterrupted operation.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3794723\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INTERACTIVE-Strait-of-Hormuz-Map-Iran-Israel-1750677677.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Strait of Hormuz Map Iran Israel-1750677677\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-much-oil-and-gas-pass-through-the-strait\">How much oil and gas pass through the strait?</h2><p data-start=\"2056\" data-end=\"2326\">According to the US <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65504\">Energy Information Administration</a> (EIA), about 20 million barrels of oil transited through the Strait of Hormuz each day in 2024. That equates to nearly $500bn in annual energy trade, underlining the waterway’s central role in the global economy.</p><p data-start=\"2328\" data-end=\"2564\">The crude passing through the strait originates from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p data-start=\"2413\" data-end=\"2508\">Any prolonged disruption would rattle producers and the economies that depend on their exports.</p><p data-start=\"2566\" data-end=\"2803\">The strait also plays a critical role in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade. In 2024, roughly a fifth of global LNG shipments moved through the corridor with Qatar accounting for the vast majority of those volumes, according to EIA <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65584\">data</a>.</p><h2 id=\"where-does-it-all-go\">Where does it all go?</h2><p data-start=\"2832\" data-end=\"3009\">The strait handles LNG flows in both directions. Kuwait and the UAE import supplies sourced outside the Gulf, including shipments from the US and West Africa.</p><p data-start=\"3011\" data-end=\"3257\">The EIA estimated that in 2024, 84 percent of crude oil and condensate shipments transiting the strait headed to Asian markets. A similar pattern appears in the gas trade with 83 percent of LNG volumes moving through the Strait of Hormuz destined for Asia.</p><p data-start=\"3259\" data-end=\"3516\">China, India, Japan and South Korea accounted for a combined 69 percent intake of all crude oil and condensate flows through the strait last year. Their factories, transport networks and power grids depend on uninterrupted Gulf energy.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4329332\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4329332\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4329332\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/000_97WK3YL-1771759990.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"This handout photo released by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)'s official website Sepanews on February 17, 2026, shows a rocket being fired during a military exercise by members of the IRGC and navy in the Strait of Hormuz.

At its narrowest stretch, the Strait of Hormuz and its designated shipping lanes fall entirely within the territorial waters of Iran and Oman.</p><p data-start=\"247\" data-end=\"518\">That legal reality gives Tehran geographic leverage. About 3,000 vessels transit the strait each month. If Iran tried to obstruct traffic, one of the most effective tactics would involve deploying naval mines using fast attack boats and submarines.</p><p data-start=\"520\" data-end=\"943\">Tehran’s fleet includes fast boats equipped with antiship missiles, alongside surface vessels, semisubmersible craft and submarines designed for asymmetric warfare.</p><p data-start=\"945\" data-end=\"1219\">Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/14/what-is-the-strait-of-hormuz-could-it-factor-into-israel-iran-conflict\">parliament</a> last year approved a motion to close the Strait of Hormuz. Any final decision rests with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.</p><p data-start=\"1221\" data-end=\"1614\">Regional dynamics could further complicate the situation.</p><p data-start=\"1221\" data-end=\"1614\">In Yemen, the Houthi group, which maintains close ties with Iran, could again try to disrupt traffic through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, another vital maritime chokepoint linking the Red Sea to global trade routes. Shipping through that corridor suffered significant disruptions after Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza began in October 2023.</p><p data-start=\"1616\" data-end=\"1868\">The Houthis, who control northwestern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, recently <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/houthi-threats-and-us-iran-conflict-escalate-ramadan-fears-in-yemen\">organised</a> a mass rally under the slogan Steadfast and Ready for the Next Round, signalling readiness for a potential confrontation with domestic or foreign adversaries.</p><p data-start=\"1870\" data-end=\"2008\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Any coordinated pressure on the Strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab Strait would amplify risks for global shipping, energy markets and international trade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"impact-on-global-oil-prices\">Impact on global oil prices</h2><p data-start=\"3551\" data-end=\"3814\">Colby Connelly, head of Middle East content at Energy Intelligence, told Al Jazeera from the UAE that a full or partial closure of the Strait of Hormuz would have a “major impact on oil prices in the near term”, depending on how long the strait remains contested.</p><p data-start=\"3816\" data-end=\"4033\">“There are no other major sources of supply that can make up for what comes from the Gulf, especially given the consideration that around 70 percent of OPEC+ spare production capacity sits in the Gulf,” Connelly said, referring to the group of oil-producing countries that collectively sets production volumes.</p><p data-start=\"4035\" data-end=\"4231\">Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the strait to export its crude, shipping roughly 5.5 million barrels per day through the corridor – more than any other country in the region, according to EIA data.</p><p data-start=\"4233\" data-end=\"4387\">Iran’s oil exports, about 90 percent of which go to China, averaged roughly 1.7 million barrels per day in the first half of 2025, according to the EIA.</p><p data-start=\"4645\" data-end=\"4821\">“Saudi Arabia and the UAE both have limited pipeline capacity that can allow exports to continue via the Red Sea coast and Fujairah,” a UAE port on the Gulf of Oman, Connelly warned.</p><p data-start=\"4823\" data-end=\"5210\">While some Gulf producers hold substantial volumes in overseas storage that could cushion supply shocks, Connelly noted that buffers may prove limited in the face of serious disruptions. He cautioned: “Oil prices have been highly reactive to geopolitical tensions in recent weeks, and as a result, prices could spike to well over $100 per barrel if there were to be a major disruption.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325065\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325065\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325065\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-15T190353Z_1949412274_RC27GJAEQ307_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-CRISIS-USA-CARRIER-1-1771517393.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Frank E.

Several major Asian economies depend heavily on shipments transiting through the strait.</p><p data-start=\"5872\" data-end=\"6128\">Almost half of India’s crude oil imports and about 60 percent of its natural gas supplies move through the Strait of Hormuz. South Korea sources roughly 60 percent of its crude via the same route while Japan relies on it for close to three-quarters of its oil imports.</p><p data-start=\"6130\" data-end=\"6443\">“For the Gulf countries in particular, it’s going to cause a lot of disruption,” Ramani told Al Jazeera. “I was in the UAE recently, and investors in Dubai are concerned about what that would mean for the tourism and finance sector. This may cause some investment hiccups in some of the Vision 2030 projects in Saudi Arabia.”</p><p data-start=\"6445\" data-end=\"6676\">“There’s many, many layers of concern here, not just exports and prices but also broader macroeconomic and microeconomic consequences. So we should be looking at this as a very serious adverse financial development,” Ramani added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
