Then you clearly underestimate the people of this state and nation.”</p><p>“We believe in law and order in this state; we believe in peace,” Walz added. “And we believe that Donald Trump needs to pull these 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another person.”</p><p>Walz’s comments came after senior Trump administration officials defended Pretti’s killing, despite graphic video evidence appearing to contradict their accounts.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Federal agents shot and killed Pretti on Saturday while scuffling with him on an icy roadway in Minneapolis, less than three weeks after an immigration officer shot dead Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three and US citizen.</p><p>Trump administration officials have claimed that Pretti intended to harm the agents, as they did after Good’s death, pointing to a handgun they said was discovered on his person.</p><p>Videos shared widely on social media and verified by US media showed Pretti never drawing a weapon, with agents firing about 10 shots at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with a chemical irritant and thrown to the ground.</p><p>The footage has further inflamed the ongoing protests in Minneapolis against the presence of federal immigration agents, with about 1,000 people participating in a demonstration on Sunday.</p><p>The claims that border agents act in self-defence, echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other members of the Trump administration on Sunday, have ⁠prompted outrage among local law enforcement, many Minneapolis residents and Democrats on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Trump, who had earlier described Pretti as a “gunman”, on Sunday laid the blame for his and Good’s deaths on Democrats, accusing state and local authorities of refusing to cooperate with federal authorities.</p><p>“By doing this, Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved. Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,” Trump said on Truth Social.</p><p>Democratic strategist Arshad Hasan said Pretti’s killing and its aftermath were “deeply unsettling”, and accused federal agents of turning a low‑crime city into an “occupation”.</p><p>“I don’t know why a government agency should get particular exemptions from due process when somebody is murdered… Homicide is a crime for which the state and local law enforcement have jurisdiction,” Hasan told Al Jazeera, adding that the community was “grieving” and felt “under siege”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"holding-phone-not-gun\">Holding phone, not gun</h2><p>Videos from the scene show ​Pretti holding a phone in his hand, not a gun, as he tries to help other protesters who had been pushed to the ground by agents.</p><p>As one video begins, Pretti ‍can be seen filming while a federal agent pushes away one woman and shoves another to the ground. Pretti moves between the agent and the women, then raises his left arm to shield himself as the agent pepper-sprays him.</p><p>Several agents then take hold of Pretti – who struggles with them – and force him onto his hands and knees. As the agents pin Pretti down, someone shouts what sounds like a warning about the presence of a gun.</p><p>Video footage then appears to show one of the agents removing a gun from Pretti and stepping ‍away from the group with it.</p><p>Moments ⁠later, an officer with a handgun points at Pretti’s back and fires four shots in quick succession.

Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.”</p><p>Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press programme on Sunday, US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that an investigation was necessary to get a full understanding of the killing.</p><p>Asked if agents had already removed the pistol from Pretti when they fired on him, Blanche said, “I do not know. And nobody else knows, either. That’s why we’re doing an investigation.”</p><p>Multiple senators from Trump’s Republican Party also called for a thorough probe into the killing and for cooperation with local authorities. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,” Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said.</p><p>Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed to heavily Democratic Minneapolis for weeks, after conservative media reported on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly amplified the racially tinged accusations, including on Sunday, when he posted on his Truth Social platform: “Minnesota is a Criminal COVER UP of the massive Financial Fraud that has gone on!”</p><p>Minneapolis has one of the largest Somali communities in the US.</p><p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison pushed back against Trump’s claims of fraud.</p><p>“It’s not about fraud, because if he sent people who understand forensic accounting, we’d be having a different conversation. But he’s sending armed masked men,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Many of them want to come back, or some want to come back, to maybe help rebuild or see their families. But what Israel wants is for huge amounts of Palestinians to leave and not come back,” said Anthony Lowenstein, author of The Palestine Laboratory, a book on the Israeli arms and surveillance industry. “I fear that if this crossing reopens and is only monitored by Israel, that is the long-term goal.”</p><p>Lowenstein also noted out that a pedestrian-only reopening of Rafah would do nothing to move the tonnes of desperately-needed humanitarian supplies stranded in Egyptian warehouses.</p><p>“Ultimately, [this can happen] only if the international community presses Israel to allow aid in,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the University of Beirut, echoed the sentiment, arguing that Israel’s announcement reflects its strategy of controlling all aspects of Palestinian life.</p><p>He contended that while Israel has agreed to Trump’s ceasefire proposal and Hamas has fulfilled its obligations—releasing captives, returning bodies, and ending attacks—Israel is not meeting its own commitments.</p><p>“So, they play around with the humanitarian aid, the access to people, even those who are dying and those who need medical treatment. They let them go out sometimes, sometimes they don’t. Water. Food. Every dimension of Palestinian life, they want to control,” Khouri said.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/us-envoys-meet-netanyahu-as-israel-continues-to-bomb-gaza\">Israeli attacks</a>, meanwhile, have continued across Gaza, with at least three Palestinians killed in two separate incidents on Sunday, and an Israeli drone wounding four others in Gaza City, according to health officials.</p><p>Medics said Israeli forces killed at least two people east of the Tuffah neighbourhood of northern Gaza City and a 41-year-old man in southern Khan Younis.</p><p>Altogether, Israeli attacks have killed more than 480 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire began in October. Some 71,657 others were killed and 171,399 also wounded over two years of Israel’s genocidal war.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This is one of the best moments for me here,” he said on Premier League Productions.</p><p>“It means everything. This is the type of thing I wanted to do when I came here.”</p><p>Arsenal’s skipper Odegaard lamented some of the mistakes that knocked his team off its stride.</p><p>“It was never going to be easy. We know every game in this league is a big challenge,” he told Sky Sports.</p><p>“Now it is time to work harder than ever. We are still top of the league, so we have to keep going and bounce back straight away.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Earlier on Sunday, Emi Buendia’s sweet strike set Aston Villa on their way to a hard-fought 2-0 Premier League win at Newcastle as they maintained their pursuit of the top two.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Argentine’s sumptuous finish and a late header from Ollie Watkins secured victory at St James’s Park – a first on Tyneside since 2005.</p><p class=\"p1\">Elsewhere, Estevao opened the scoring and added an assist as fourth-placed Chelsea secured a 3-1 victory over 10-man Crystal Palace and a first Premier League away win under Liam Rosenior.</p><p class=\"p1\">Eighteen-year-old Estevao took advantage of an Eagles error to break the deadlock in the 34th minute. Then the young Brazilian teed up Joao Pedro after the restart.</p><p class=\"p1\">Enzo Fernandez added a goal from the penalty spot just after the hour, with Palace going down to 10 men when Adam Wharton was shown a second yellow card.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris Richards nodded home an 88th-minute consolation for the Eagles, whose winless streak has now extended to 11 games across all competitions.</p><p class=\"p1\">In West London, Goals from Igor Jesus and Taiwo Awoniyi eased Nottingham Forest’s relegation fears in a surprise 2-0 win at Brentford.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Two weeks ago, incumbent Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani announced his withdrawal from the premiership race. Amid political negotiations following the November elections, this move effectively paved the way for former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to return to power.</p><p>This development is not just an act of political recycling; it reflects the failure of Iraqi state-building after the United States invasion of 2003. Under al-Maliki, Iraq may well go back to the disastrous policies that in 2014 led to the rise of ISIL (ISIS).</p><h2 id=\"sectarian-politics\">Sectarian politics</h2><p>In reflecting on what al-Maliki’s return could possibly mean for Iraq, it is important to examine his track record. In 2006, when he was first nominated for the prime minister’s post, the administration of US President George W Bush supported him. Washington did so in the name of stability and trust, despite the early red flags. By November 2006, just six months after al-Maliki came to power, US National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley was already raising concerns about his ability to rein in violence against the Sunni population.</p><p>The decision by the Bush administration to continue its support for the prime minister reflects its own record of misguided policies, driven by ignorance of the region and its history. By backing al-Maliki, Washington paved the way for the chaos and instability it sought to avert.</p><p>During his first two terms, al-Maliki established a governance template that deliberately dismantled the post-2003 settlement’s vision of inclusive politics. He pursued policies of deliberate exclusion of the Sunni population on the political and social levels under the guise of de-Baathification. While originally intended to remove Saddam Hussein’s loyalists, the process was weaponised by al-Maliki as a sectarian tool. In 2010, for example, the prime minister used a de-Baathification law to ban nine parties and more than 450 candidates — predominantly Sunnis — from the parliamentary elections.</p><p>The security apparatus under his leadership also carried out arrests of moderate Sunni politicians on trumped-up charges of “terrorism” and suppressed peaceful demonstrations.</p><p>The 2013 massacre in the town of al-Hawija, in Kirkuk province, is a case in point. In January of that year, scores of Sunnis gathered for a peaceful protest of the discriminatory policies of al-Maliki’s government that lasted weeks. Three months later, security forces attacked the protest sit-in,<a href=\"/news/2013/5/4/iraq-pressured-to-step-up-raid-probe\"> killing at least 44 protesters</a>.</p><p>Under al-Maliki, Baghdad also witnessed the deliberate displacement of Sunnis from their homes and the consolidation of Shia-dominated areas. This was a form of demographic engineering with the full support and complicity of the state.</p><p>As a result of these policies, sectarian politics escalated to the point where ethnic and religious identity became the main dividers of society, undermining national unity and plunging the country into civil conflict.</p><p>The constant assault on Sunni communities generated widespread discontent, which was easily exploited by extremist organisations – first al-Qaeda and then ISIL (ISIS).</p><h2 id=\"corruption-and-mismanagement\">Corruption and mismanagement</h2><p>The industrial-scale haemorrhaging of national wealth during the al-Maliki era was nothing short of staggering. The Iraqi parliament’s own transparency commission <a href=\"/video/2018/5/8/iraq-corruption-watchdog-320bn-stolen-over-15-years\">estimated</a> in 2018 that by then, $320bn had been lost to corruption since the US invasion; al-Maliki was in power for eight of those 15 years.</p><p>The money was used to fund the extravagant lifestyles of those close to al-Maliki, the purchase of expensive real estate, and deposits in shell companies and secret bank accounts. All of this is not a matter of administrative dysfunction but of large-scale thievery.</p><p>Iraq’s Federal Commission of Integrity carried out extensive documentation of such malpractices, but to this day, no one has been held accountable. Under al-Maliki, the independence of the judiciary was destroyed, rendering any process of accountability impossible.</p><p>Mismanagement also extended to the security and military forces. For years, the army was paying salaries to “ghost soldiers”; by 2014, the bill for this corruption scheme had grown <a href=\"/news/2014/12/1/iraq-pm-sacks-officials-over-ghost-soldiers\">to $380m a year</a>. The prime minister himself <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/02/02/133440159/group-claims-iraq-secret-prison-in-operation\">was found </a>to be running his own prison and commanding a special force of 3,000 soldiers loyal to him.</p><p>Years of corruption and dysfunction within the Iraqi army amid nearly $100bn in US funding led to the disaster of 2014, when military units dispersed in the face of advancing ISIL (ISIS) forces.</p><h2 id=\"al-maliki-s-return\">Al-Maliki’s return</h2><p>Al-Maliki did not spend the past 11 years in political isolation. Instead, he was at the centre of the political machinery, plotting and lining up all the necessary components for his ultimate return under the watch of successive US administrations.</p><p>A third term for him would likely deepen sectarian divisions and entrench corruption. Iraqi governance will continue to be undermined by his tendencies to create shadow power structures in which loyalists are empowered at the expense of institutions.</p><p>Al-Maliki’s return would also be significant regionally. After the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and the serious weakening of Hezbollah, Iraq has become Iran’s most critical regional security and financial asset.</p><p>Iran’s position in the region has not been this vulnerable in decades, but al-Maliki’s return would effectively preclude Iraq from embarking on a more independent path from Tehran in its domestic and foreign affairs.</p><p>His third term would also likely obstruct normalisation with Damascus. Al-Maliki has vocally opposed engaging Syria’s new leadership. Last year, he voiced his opposition to interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa attending the Arab League Summit in Baghdad and described him as “wanted by Iraqi courts on terrorism charges”.</p><p>In parallel, a new al-Maliki government would also pose a challenge to US interests. The appointment of Mark Savaya as a special envoy to Iraq by the administration of US President Donald Trump, the first such appointment in 20 years, demonstrated its intent on pushing through policies aimed at curbing Iranian influence.</p><p>Washington wants the pro-Iranian Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) dismantled and fully integrated into the Iraqi army. Al-Maliki is unlikely to undertake such a move because he is the “godfather” of these parallel armed structures. Dismantling them would mean destroying his own creation and severing his ties with Iran.</p><p>The issue at stake, however, is not just what policies al-Maliki will pursue. It is also the fact that Iraq is not able to escape a political cycle that has brought it nothing but catastrophe. It shows that the Iraqi political elite has learned nothing from the 2014 crisis.</p><p>Sectarian mobilisation and kleptocratic politics are still valid political options. Iraqi youth have repeatedly taken to the streets to protest this deeply flawed and dysfunctional status quo. Without significant changes to the incentive structure, accountability system, and sectarian distribution of power, Iraq is doomed to repeat the same grave mistakes of the past.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has justified US actions in Venezuela as necessary to secure US security and economic interests.</p><p>The unclassified version of the NDS, which is released every four years, is uncharacteristically laden with photos of the defence secretary and president and repeatedly targets the administration of former President Joe Biden.</p><p>Under Biden, the Pentagon described “revisionist powers” like China and Russia as the “central challenge” to US security.</p><p>The NDS followed the release in December of the National Security Strategy, which argued that Europe is facing civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to US interests.</p><p>The NDS noted that Germany’s economy dwarfs Russia’s, arguing that, therefore, Washington’s NATO allies are “strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe’s conventional defense, with critical but more limited US support”.</p><p>The strategy blueprint noted that this includes taking the lead in supporting Ukraine’s defence.</p><p>The document also addressed the question of Iran, repeating the US position that Tehran cannot develop nuclear weapons. It also described Israel as a “model ally”. “And we have an opportunity now to further empower it to defend itself and promote our shared interests, building on President Trump’s historic efforts to secure peace in the Middle East,” it said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264251\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264251\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264251\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-03T170928Z_888660269_RC2TTIAXMQ80_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-1769329397.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"trump\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4264251\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks during a news conference with President Donald Trump after US forces abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3, 2026 [Jonathan Ernst/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-impact-on-us-allies\">What’s the impact on US allies?</h2><p>First, Europe is pushed further down on Washington’s list of priorities and has been told to shoulder more responsibility for its own defence. Many NATO allies had already increased their defence spending and offered to provide security guarantees to Ukraine against Russian threats.</p><p>For South Korea and Japan, the US Defense Department recognised the “direct military threat” from North Korea, led by Kim Jong Un, and noted that Pyongyang’s “nuclear forces are increasingly capable of threatening the US Homeland”.</p><p>About 28,500 US soldiers are stationed in South Korea as part of a defence treaty to deter the North Korean military threat. Seoul has raised its defence budget by 7.5 percent for this year after pressure from Trump to share more of the defence burden.</p><p>The NDS noted that South Korea “is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea, with critical but more limited US support”, which could result in a reduction of US forces on the Korean Peninsula. “This shift in the balance of responsibility is consistent with America’s interest in updating US force posture on the Korean Peninsula,” the document said.</p><p>Harsh Pant, a geopolitical analyst based in New Delhi, said the defence strategy is line with the Trump administration’s push to get allies to take control of their own security.</p><p>“The Trump administration has been advocating that the relationship that they see now in terms of security cooperation with their allies is one where allies will have to bear a heavier burden and pay their share,” Pant told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“America’s allies in the Indo-Pacific will have to be much more cognisant of their own role in shaping the regional security architecture. America will be there, and it will continue to have an overarching presence, but it won’t foot the bill in ways that it has done in the past,” said Pant, who is the vice president of the Observer Research Foundation think tank.</p><p>North Korea routinely criticises the US military presence in South Korea and their joint military drills, which the allies say are defensive but which Pyongyang calls dress rehearsals for an invasion.</p><p>Seoul’s Ministry of National Defence said on Saturday that the US forces based in the country are the “core” of the alliance, adding: “We will be cooperating closely with the US to continue developing it in that direction.”</p><p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said: “It is inconceivable that South Korea – which spends 1.4 times North Korea’s gross domestic product on defence and possesses the world’s fifth largest military – cannot defend itself. Self-reliant national defence is the most fundamental principle amid an increasingly unstable international environment.”</p><p>Lee made the comments after visiting China this month in an effort to improve ties with the country, which is Seoul’s largest economic partner, its top destination for exports and a primary source of its imports. Seoul wants to cultivate better ties with Beijing, which wields influence over North Korea and its leader.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-taiwan\">What about Taiwan?</h2><p>When the previous NDS was unveiled under Biden in 2022, it said the most comprehensive and serious challenge to US national security was China’s “coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences”. A part of that strategy, Washington said at the time, was Beijing’s ambitions concerning Taiwan.</p><p>The Pentagon said four years ago that it “will support Taiwan’s asymmetric self-defense commensurate with the evolving [Chinese] threat and consistent with our one China policy”.</p><p>China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has threatened to take it by force if necessary. In a New Year’s address, Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/chinas-xi-says-reunification-with-taiwan-unstoppable\">pledged to achieve the “reunification” of China and Taiwan</a>, calling Beijing’s long-held goal “unstoppable”. Chinese forces have carried out wargames in the Taiwan Strait, which separates the two.</p><p>In this year’s NDS, the US Defense Department does not mention Taiwan by name.</p><p>“The American people’s security, freedom, and prosperity are …  directly linked to our ability to trade and engage from a position of strength in the Indo-Pacific,” the document said, adding that the Defense Department would “maintain a favourable balance of military power in the Indo-Pacific”, which it called “the world’s economic center of gravity”, to deter Chinese threats.</p><p>It said the US does not seek to dominate, humiliate or strangle China but “to ensure that neither China nor anyone else can dominate us or our allies”. Instead, the US wants “a decent peace, on terms favourable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under”, the blueprint said, adding that, therefore, the US would deter China by “strength, not confrontation”.</p><p>“We will erect a strong denial defense along the First Island Chain (FIC),” the NDS said, referring to the first chain of islands off the East Asian coast. “We will also urge and enable key regional allies and partners to do more for our collective defense.”</p><p>Pant said it would be a mistake on the part of China “to read this as America leaving its allies”. He added that “there is an undercurrent [in Trump’s foreign policy] of how America wants to see a stable balance of power in the Indo-Pacific where China is not the dominant force.”</p><p>“And I think, therefore, for China, if it reads this as a weakening of American commitment to its allies, that would not really be in consonance with the spirit of this defence strategy.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They said one of their demands had been met after a UK-based subsidiary of the Israeli weapons company Elbit Systems was denied a UK government contract.</p><p>“Our prisoners’ hunger strike will be remembered as a landmark moment of pure defiance; an embarrassment for the British state,” the Prisoners for Palestine Group said.</p><p>Two of the prisoners who concluded their hunger strikes, Heba Muraisi and Kamran Ahmed, were on the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/palestine-action-hunger-strikers-near-death-intent-on-continuing-protests\">brink of death</a> after more than two months without food. Still, Muraisi <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/uk-hunger-striker-heba-muraisi-i-think-about-how-or-when-i-could-die\">told Al Jazeera</a> in the days before the announcement that she felt “it’s important to fight for justice and for freedom”.</p><p>The group’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/palestine-action-hunger-strikes-what-are-their-demands\">list of demands</a> includes bail, the right to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action as well as for Elbit sites to be closed in the UK. They’re also seeking an end to what they call censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls, books and visitation rights.</p><p>Before starting to refuse liquids on Saturday, Umer Khalid told Al Jazeera: “The only thing that seems to have any impact, whether that is positive or negative, is drastic action.”</p><p>“The strike reflects the severity of this imprisonment,” he added. “Being in this prison is not living life. Our lives have been paused. The world spins, and we sit in a concrete room. This strike reflects the severity of my demands.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In another case, the father of a five-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a US citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a five-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.</p><p>The events have led to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/minnesota-sues-trump-administration-over-immigration-crackdown\">protests</a> and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain people? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public and private spaces, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?</p><p>Legal experts weighed in on the public’s constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.</p><h2 id=\"what-rights-do-people-have-when-approached-by-ice\">What rights do people have when approached by ICE?</h2><p>Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone, including immigrants suspected of being in the US illegally, is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution’s <a href=\"/news/2025/4/30/a-constitutional-loophole-how-phone-inspections-test-us-civil-rights\">Fourth Amendment</a>.</p><p>“All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,” said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specialising in immigration cases.</p><p>The Fourth Amendment doesn’t stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.</p><p>For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions – such as a brief detention that’s not a formal arrest – require a “reasonable suspicion” that someone has committed a crime or is in the US illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.</p><p>Reasonable suspicion “has to be more than a guess or a presumption”, said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed, or would be committed.</p><p>Agents must meet a higher bar to arrest someone. They need “probable cause”, which generally requires sufficient evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.</p><h2><span>What is a ‘Kavanaugh stop’?</span></h2><p>Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.</p><p>In the Noem vs Perdomo case of 2025, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favour of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles, California. Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity” could be used as a “relevant factor” in determining reasonable suspicion as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.</p><p>Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had “often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they ‘looked like an immigrant’ or were in a high-crime area”, Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh’s guidance, “it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile”.</p><p>Critics of Kavanaugh’s opinion “argue that the ‘relevant factor’ language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling”, said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.</p><p>But Kavanaugh’s opinion was not cosigned by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court “has not made a definitive ruling on ‘Kavanaugh stops’ and their permissibility”, said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.</p><p>Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump vs Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.</p><h2 id=\"do-people-s-rights-differ-inside-their-homes-versus-in-a-public-space\">Do people’s rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?</h2><p>The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.</p><p>“This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,” Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as when an officer encounters a violent crime in progress or someone needing medical care.</p><p>Securing a judicial warrant is time-consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. “It’s much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,” she said.</p><p>In the past, federal immigration officers would typically not enter homes forcibly if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE, without a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/us-judge-orders-curbs-on-ice-agents-actions-against-minnesota-protesters\">judge</a>’s approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>Specific ICE officials have the authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require “probable cause to believe” that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.</p><p>A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press news agency reported on January 22.</p><p>The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and “those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo”.</p><p>The memo dated May 12, 2025, signed by acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence” but added that “the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the US Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose”.</p><p>If this policy were to be challenged in court, it is unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.</p><h2 id=\"what-can-people-do-if-they-think-ice-has-infringed-on-their-fourth-amendment-rights\">What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?</h2><p>If one believes that their rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, their options for suing for compensation are limited.</p><p>Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil <a href=\"/features/2026/1/23/are-ice-agents-trained-to-shoot-and-evade-lawsuits\">lawsuits</a> against federal officials for violating people’s rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions before tightening them again.</p><p>Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley’s law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, “In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.”</p><p>David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p><p>Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: “It’s not an easy path, and most people can’t afford to retain a lawyer.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
