The order alleged that the government of communist-run Cuba was an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/trump-seeking-regime-change-in-cuba-by-end-of-the-year-us-media-report\">“unusual and extraordinary threat”</a> to US national security.</p><p>In a social media post on Friday, Diaz-Canel said that under “a false and baseless pretext”, Trump plans “to suffocate” Cuba’s economy by slapping tariffs “on countries that sovereignly trade oil” with it.</p><p>“This new measure reveals the fascist, criminal and genocidal nature of a clique that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal ends,” he said, in an apparent allusion to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Cuban American and a known anti-Cuban government hawk.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Cuba, which is suffering rolling electricity blackouts blamed on fuel shortages, was cut off from critical supplies of Venezuelan oil after the US abducted Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in a bloody military night raid on the capital, Caracas, earlier this month. At least 32 members of Cuba’s armed forces and intelligence agencies <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/cuba-pays-tribute-to-soldiers-killed-in-us-attack-on-venezuela\">were killed</a> in the January 3 attack.</p><p>The US has since taken effective control of Venezuela’s oil sector, and Trump, a Republican, has issued threats against other left-wing governments in the region, promising to stop oil shipments previously sent to Cuba.</p><p>Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Friday declared an “international emergency” in response to Trump’s move, which he said constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat”.</p><p>Venezuela’s government also condemned the measure in a statement on Friday, saying it violates international law and the principles of global commerce.</p><p>Reporting from Cuba’s capital, Al Jazeera’s Ed Augustin said Trump’s announcement “is a massive psychological blow”, noting that analysts describe it as the “most powerful economic blow the United States has ever dealt the island”.</p><p>Days after Maduro’s abduction and transfer to the US, Trump urged Cuba to make a deal “before it is too late,” without specifying what kind of agreement he was referring to.</p><p>In a post on social media, Trump suggested Rubio could become the president of Cuba. “Sounds good to me!” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><h2 id=\"there-s-no-solution\">‘There’s no solution’</h2><p>In Havana, residents expressed anger at Trump’s tariff threat, which will only make life harder for Cubans already struggling with an increase in US sanctions.</p><p>“My food is going bad. We haven’t had electricity since 6am,” Yenia Leon told Al Jazeera. “You can’t sleep. You have to buy food every day. There’s no solution to the power situation,” she said.</p><p>“This is a war,” Lazaro Alfonso, an 89-year-old retired graphic designer, told The Associated Press news agency, describing Trump as the “sheriff of the world” and saying he feels like he is living in the Wild West, where anything goes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4277503\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4277503\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4277503\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-30T195347Z_1431135769_RC2N6JAVP5OT_RTRMADP_3_USA-CUBA-ECONOMY-1769854644.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A man sells vegetables on the street during a blackout in Havan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4277503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man sells vegetables on the street during a blackout in Havana on January 22 [Norlys Perez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Alfonso, who lived through the severe economic depression in the 1990s known as the “Special Period” following cuts in Soviet aid, said the current situation in Cuba is worse, given the severe blackouts, a lack of basic goods and a scarcity of fuel.</p><p>“The only thing that’s missing here in Cuba … is for bombs to start falling,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would seek alternatives to continue helping Cuba after Trump’s announcement following a decision this week to temporarily halt oil shipments to the island amid heightened rhetoric from Trump.</p><p>Mexico became a key supplier of fuel to Cuba, along with Russia, after the US sanctions on Venezuela paralysed the delivery of crude oil to the island.</p><p>Sheinbaum said cutting off oil shipments to Cuba could trigger a “far-reaching humanitarian crisis” on the island, affecting transportation, hospitals and access to food. She did not say whether Mexico would cut shipments of oil or refined products to Cuba, which ‌she said accounted for 1 percent of Mexico’s production.</p><p>“Our interest is that the Cuban people don’t suffer,” Sheinbaum said, adding that she had instructed her foreign minister to contact the US ‌State Department to better understand the scope of the executive order.</p><p>Mexico supplied 44 percent of Cuban oil imports and Venezuela exported 33 percent until last month, while some 10 percent of Cuban oil is sourced from Russia. Some oil is also sourced from Algeria, according to The Financial Times figures.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In November last year, a senior United Nations expert <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/us-sanctions-must-be-stopped-as-they-reshape-life-in-cuba-un-rapporteur\">said</a> the long-running US sanctions on Cuba must be lifted as they are “causing significant effects across all aspects of life”.</p><p>The US imposed a near-total trade embargo on Cuba in 1962, with the goal of toppling the government put in place by Fidel Castro after he took power in a 1959 revolution. Castro himself was the target of numerous assassination attempts by the US’s Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA.</p><p>Alena Douhan, special rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights, said the “extensive regime of economic, trade and financial restrictions” against Cuba marks the longest-running unilateral sanctions policy in US history.</p><p>She noted that there are shortages of food, medicine, electricity, water, essential machinery and spare parts in Cuba, while a growing emigration of skilled workers, including medical staff, engineers and teachers, is further straining the country.</p><p>The accumulative effect has “severe consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, food, health and development”, Douhan said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

ruling represents the latest legal setback to the administration’s broader push to end temporary protections for more than one million people across multiple countries.</p><p>Murphy’s decision came during a virtual hearing, where he said the delay would provide time for the Department of Homeland Security to produce records explaining its decision-making process before he considers blocking the move for longer.</p><p>“I want to do everything I can to keep this case going,” the judge said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The case was brought by three Ethiopian nationals and the advocacy group African Communities Together, who filed suit after the DHS announced in December it was <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/trump-strips-legal-protections-from-ethiopian-refugees-in-latest-crackdown\">terminating</a> the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) first granted to Ethiopia in 2022.</p><p>The

earlier when a federal appeals court found the administration unlawfully ended protections for 600,000 Venezuelans.</p><p>That three-judge panel said Noem’s actions were based on “racist stereotyping”

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The January 14 announcement of the new Palestinian technical committee to oversee Gaza’s reconstruction comes at a critical moment. While states are discussing the governance and reconstruction of Gaza, on the ground, the basic survival of 2.1 million people hangs by a thread. This moment demands immediate action to lift the ongoing and suffocating restrictions that are systematically dismantling the very means for Palestinians to survive.</p><p>Famine conditions in Gaza have moderately stabilised, but the humanitarian catastrophe continues to deepen. Families remain displaced without adequate shelter; children still go to bed hungry; and basic healthcare is out of reach for hundreds of thousands.</p><p>Winter rains have turned displacement camps into seas of mud, exacerbating suffering and significantly increasing the risk of disease outbreaks. Daily Israeli air attacks and bombardments continue, with more than <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/31/live-israel-kills-12-palestinians-in-gaza-as-rafah-crossing-set-to-open\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">500 Palestinians killed</a> since the ceasefire agreement was announced in October. This month alone, seven UNRWA school compounds in eastern Gaza have been demolished by Israeli forces.</p><p>UNRWA remains Gaza’s largest and most comprehensive service provider, effectively acting as the public sector for more than half the population. Our 11,000 staff continue to operate despite immense risks, as they have done each day since October 7, 2023.</p><p>They are providing healthcare to almost 100,000 people each week and education to 70,000 children in damaged school premises across Gaza. Our schools also shelter tens of thousands of displaced families.</p><p>UNRWA teams essentially function like a local municipality; we distribute water and collect solid waste from entire communities, covering the needs of more than half the population. When we speak of “service delivery”, these are not abstract programmes. We are talking about the clinics where children are vaccinated, the classrooms where traumatised boys and girls find some collective care, and the distribution points where families are provided with basic sustenance.</p><p>Yet our ability to respond remains severely impeded by systematic barriers. What should we understand from the entire and complete assault on the most basic services needed for any community to survive?</p><p>Our goods are prevented from entering Gaza. We are unable to communicate with Israeli authorities – the occupying power that controls all of Gaza’s land, air and sea crossings – due to the <a href=\"/news/2024/10/28/israel-parliament-approves-bill-to-ban-unrwa\">“no contact” law</a> passed by the Israeli parliament in October 2024.</p><p>Our international staff – myself included – are barred from entering Gaza to support the work of our teams on the ground.</p><p>Nowhere is the inhumanity of these restrictions more evident than in the denial of children’s basic rights. About 700,000 Palestinian children in Gaza are being systematically denied their right to education. Before the war, UNRWA was educating 300,000 of these children, accounting for two-thirds of all primary schooling.</p><p>UNRWA alone has the capacity, expertise and reach to resume this work at scale across Gaza, yet we are prevented from doing so by the same restrictions that target our broader operations.</p><p>We have launched a “Back to Learning” campaign to bring some hope and normality to children who have known only war, displacement and loss for more than two years. But instead of supporting this effort, the restrictions we face mean that most children remain in the rubble-strewn streets. This is a continuous and deliberate attack on their future.</p><p>We are not alone in facing unacceptable challenges that defy the most basic obligations of an occupying power under international law. The registration process for international NGOs has become a de facto blockade in itself, with the vast majority of the existing aid system now on the brink of shutdown.</p><p>Restrictions on so-called dual-use items have turned basic shelter and construction materials, among other essential supplies, into contraband, leaving families exposed to the elements and rendering reconstruction impossible as harsh winter weather persists.</p><p>This brings us to the uncomfortable truth: These restrictions are not merely bureaucratic impediments. They appear to be part of ongoing efforts to systematically dismantle the means for Palestinians to survive. Every restriction, every obstacle, every denial of basic materials adds another layer of evidence to <a href=\"/news/2024/1/11/a-quick-guide-to-south-africas-icj-case-against-israel\">South Africa’s case</a> at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). So too do the attacks on the one United Nations agency – UNRWA – that is able to provide basic education and healthcare at scale, but is prevented from doing so.</p><p>UNRWA has a proven ability to provide continuous education, healthcare, social welfare, sanitation, humanitarian assistance and other support. It enjoys the trust and confidence of the Gaza population, whose world has been erased since October 2023.</p><p>Preserving UNRWA until there is a lasting peace is a pragmatic solution for anyone serious about Gaza’s future. It is essential for the wellbeing and recovery of more than two million people who have suffered beyond imagination.</p><p>Make no mistake – this is about far more than the future of a single UN agency. This is about defending the international rules-based order. When states pressure humanitarian responders, restrict humanitarian access and ignore ICJ rulings, they are targeting Palestinians while also attacking the very foundations of international law.</p><p>This has transcended the Palestine context and become a test case for the viability of humanitarian action and international law worldwide.</p><p>The time for half-measures and diplomatic ambiguity is over. The survival of Gaza is intrinsically linked to UNRWA’s continued operation. Defending this is about defending humanity, international law, and the possibility that even in the darkest circumstances, the world will continue to support compassion over cruelty.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of states voted in December 2025 to renew UNRWA’s mandate in the UN General Assembly. But that decision is impeded by the perpetrator of what the ICJ has found to be an illegal occupation and what the UN Commission of Inquiry has concluded is a genocide. The choice must now be clear: We can either stand by as Gaza’s lifeline is systematically cut, or we can act collectively to protect what remains and rebuild what has been destroyed.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

After graduating as a nurse in 2023, she spent two years volunteering in the healthcare sector, hoping the experience would eventually lead to paid employment. That opportunity never came.</p><p>“Volunteering doesn’t pay the bills,” al-Maghrabi said. “With prices constantly rising and no stable income, it became impossible to rely on this work to meet even my basic needs.”</p><p>With limited prospects in Gaza’s overstretched healthcare system, she made a difficult decision to leave her field entirely.</p><p>Al-Maghrabi instead shifted into social media marketing and e-commerce, working online to generate a modest income.</p><p>As al-Maghrabi recounted, she graduated as a nurse and began training in the hospital. During that training, she also took several design courses and tried to find work in that field, but she was unable to reach clients and earn an income. She then decided to take marketing courses instead of waiting for someone else to promote her work, allowing her to market herself effectively. After gaining experience in marketing, she began working in e-commerce and digital marketing.</p><p>“This isn’t what I studied or planned for,” she said. “But even though the income is limited, it helps me cover my daily expenses and survive under these conditions.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"economic-crisis\">Economic crisis</h2><p>Al-Maghrabi’s experience reflects a broader phenomenon in Gaza, where years of compounded crises have pushed unemployment to unprecedented levels. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics’ 2024 figures, the overall unemployment rate in Gaza is 69 percent, rising to approximately 80 percent among 15- to 29-year-olds.</p><p>The population under 30 accounts for approximately 70 percent of Gaza’s residents, meaning the majority of the community faces severe economic challenges, with a significant portion of young people holding university degrees but unable to find suitable employment.</p><p>Gaza’s GDP has also contracted by more than 82 percent due to Israel’s ongoing war and destruction of economic infrastructure, and around 80 percent of the population relies on international aid due to food insecurity and loss of income sources.</p><p>The economic collapse has not only affected employees, but business owners as well. Mohammed al-Hajj, who previously worked in general trade and food supplies, saw his entire business model unravel after the war.</p><p>“My warehouses and goods were destroyed, and I could no longer afford import costs or the required licences,” al-Hajj said. “Everything I had built over the years was suddenly gone.”</p><p>Faced with few options, al-Hajj searched for an alternative way to earn an income. Because his neighbourhood had not been heavily damaged, and he still had intermittent internet access, he converted part of his property into a small workspace equipped with an internet connection.</p><p>“I created this place after running out of options,” he said. “Students and engineers needed somewhere stable to take exams or work online, and this became a solution for them – and for me.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"innovating-to-survive\">Innovating to survive</h2><p>As traditional employment structures collapse, innovation has become less a choice than a necessity. For some Palestinians in Gaza, finding unconventional solutions to personal crises has opened new paths not only for survival, but for rebuilding economic activity.</p><p>Ahmed Fares Abu Zayed, CEO of Abu Zayed General Trading, described how his company’s operations came to a halt when the war began.</p><p>“We started the company before the war as a very small electricity generation business with limited resources, aimed only at supplying specific energy needs,” said Abu Zayed. “But when the war broke out, our operations stopped immediately due to fuel shortages for the generators. The situation was extremely difficult.”</p><p>Rather than shutting down entirely, Abu Zayed began searching for alternatives. The result was an innovative approach to energy production that relied on available materials rather than scarce fuel.</p><p>“We thought about how to turn surrounding waste into energy,” he said. “That’s how we started producing electricity systems using plastic scraps as fuel. It was a difficult experience, but it was driven by creativity and necessity.”</p><p>His story illustrates how innovation in Gaza often emerges directly from crisis, as individuals attempt to solve immediate problems with limited resources.</p><p>Project manager and business management specialist Maram al-Qarra explained that such efforts play a critical role in Gaza’s labour market.</p><p>“The problem in Gaza isn’t a lack of talent, but the absence of an economic environment capable of absorbing it,” al-Qarra said. “Even small projects can stimulate the market by creating direct jobs and indirect service and production chains.”</p><p>She emphasised that innovation is now essential. “When traditional jobs are absent, innovation becomes a means to create opportunities instead of waiting for them,” she said.</p><p>On the broader labour market, al-Qarra concluded, “The blockade and the war destroyed traditional work structures, pushing many young people to seek alternatives outside conventional employment.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"exploitation-and-opportunity\">Exploitation and opportunity</h2><p>Across Gaza, many educated young people – doctors, engineers, nurses, and graduates – now sell bottled water, vegetables, or second-hand clothes on the streets. These efforts are not entrepreneurial ambitions, but survival strategies in a place where choice has all but disappeared.</p><p>As one young resident put it, “We don’t have the luxury of choice; all we can do is try to survive.”</p><p>While innovation has opened new paths for some, desperation has also created space for exploitation. Mahmoud, a young man from Gaza, described how the lack of jobs and social protection has pushed people towards shady or dangerous businesses.</p><p>“With no government support and no safety nets, securing a steady income has become almost impossible,” Mahmoud said. “Some people are turning to illegal or exploitative methods just to survive.”</p><p>He explained that money lending, currency trading, and exploitative financial transfers have become increasingly common.</p><p>“People are sometimes forced to receive their remittances in cash at a discount of more than 50 percent,” he said. “This is clear exploitation of people’s urgent needs, and it shows how desperation is being abused.”</p><p>Yet even amid these negative outcomes, examples of innovation that benefit the wider community persist. Abu Zayed noted that his electricity project did more than solve his own problem.</p><p>“The most important part is that it didn’t just provide energy,” he said. “It created jobs for dozens of young people in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, and gave them skills they couldn’t gain in the traditional job market.”</p><p>“Even under the toughest circumstances,” he added, “a small idea can turn into a sustainable project that supports the community and restores a sense of productivity.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The shutdown is likely ‍to be brief.</p><p>⁠Lawmakers from both parties have been working to ensure a debate over immigration enforcement does not disrupt other government operations, despite mounting Democratic anger over <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/us-protesters-begin-nationwide-strike-as-doj-launches-pretti-killing-probe\">the killing of two people</a> by immigration agents in Minnesota.</p><p>This is a marked contrast from last fall, when Republicans and Democrats dug into their positions in a dispute over healthcare, prompting a shutdown that lasted a record 43 days and cost the US economy an estimated $11bn.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><span>“Technically, there will be a partial government shutdown come midnight on Saturday,” Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan said earlier on Friday, reporting from Washington, DC.</span></p><p>“The earliest that the House of Representatives can take a look at the changes, which the US Senate approved late on Friday, is not before Monday. That’s because they’ve been in recess all this week. They should be coming back to Washington this weekend,” Jordan said.</p><p><span>But there is also a concern the shutdown could drag out longer, given political polarisation around Trump’s administration’s harsh immigration raids and the killing of US citizens at those operations.</span></p><p>“So there is the expectation that this could be resolved early next week. But there is the possibility that it may not be,” Jordan added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The funding impasse has been driven by Democratic anger over aggressive immigration enforcement following the fatal shootings of two US citizens – Alex Pretti and Renee Good – by federal agents in separate incidents this month in the northern city of <a href=\"/podcasts/2026/1/29/the-take-they-picked-the-wrong-state-how-minneapolis-is-fighting-back\">Minneapolis amid a violent operation</a> against undocumented migrants.</p><p>The killings in Minneapolis have become a flashpoint that has hardened opposition to approving new money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) without changes to how immigration agencies operate.</p><p>“The nation is reaching a breaking point,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote. “The American people are demanding that Congress step up and force change.”</p><p>“Instead of going after drug smugglers, child predators, and human traffickers, the Trump Administration is wasting valuable resources targeting peaceful protestors in Chicago and Minneapolis,” Senate Democratic Minority Whip Dick Durbin posted on social media.</p><p>“This Administration continues to make Americans less safe.”</p><p>As lawmakers in both parties called for investigations into the fatal shootings, Trump said he didn’t want a shutdown and negotiated the rare deal with Schumer, his frequent adversary. Trump then encouraged members of both parties to cast a “much needed Bipartisan ‘YES’ vote.”</p><p>Under the deal negotiated between the White House and Senate Democratic leaders, lawmakers approved five outstanding funding bills to finance most of the federal government through the end of the fiscal year in September.</p><p>The deal approved by the Senate separates funding for the DHS – which oversees immigration agencies – from the broader government funding package, allowing lawmakers to approve spending for agencies such as the Pentagon and the Department of Labor while they consider new restrictions on how federal immigration agents operate.</p><p>Funding for the DHS has now been split off and extended for just two weeks under a stopgap measure intended to give lawmakers time to negotiate changes to the department’s operations.</p></div></div></body></html>"
