But the devastating injury has put a spotlight on the importance of bindings, which hold boots to the skis and remain some of the oldest technology in the sport.</p><p>Officials told The Associated Press news agency that a binding system designed to automatically release skis when a racer like Vonn loses control is still in the drawing-board phase after years of stalled discussions.</p><p>“Unfortunately, sometimes it does take horrific accidents to shine even more of a light on what can be done,” said Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the US Ski and Snowboard Association. “It’s an area we can’t be competitive in; we’ve all got to be in it together with our different country counterparts and FIS [the International Ski and Snowboard Federation].”</p><p>Bindings haven’t significantly changed in their basic design for half a century: Once a skier steps in toes first and then locks in by stepping down with the heel, pressure needs to be applied for the system to release the boot. Less-skilled skiers have bindings that release more easily to avoid leg injuries. The higher the skill level and the more serious the skiing, the more the bindings are cranked down to keep elite racers on their skis.</p><p>Few were surprised that Vonn’s skis did not release. The question is whether they should have.</p><h2 id=\"a-smarter-binding\">A ‘smarter’ binding</h2><p>A “smart binding” system based on an algorithm and designed to automatically release when a skier loses control “would have surely” helped prevent Vonn from breaking her leg, said Peter Gerdol, the FIS women’s race director at the Olympics and on the World Cup circuit.</p><p>“That’s exactly what the system will be designed to do,” Gerdol told AP. “Her skis would have definitely popped off. … We’ve seen a lot of other cases in which the bindings don’t open and it results in knee issues, especially when the still-attached ski acts as a lever, either on the net or on the snow or on a gate or on any other obstacle. The leg becomes blocked, and the knee gives out.”</p><p>Nine days before her Olympic crash in Italy, Vonn tore the ACL in her left knee in a crash in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. She ended up in the safety nets with her skis still attached.</p><p>A smart binding system could borrow technology from the safety air bag system that became mandatory for skiers this season in the speed events.</p><p>“It’s still going to take time to develop, but the idea is that the binding would be triggered by the same algorithm that prompts the airbag to inflate,” Gerdol said. “The heel piece would slide back, and the athlete’s skis would pop off.”</p><h2 id=\"algorithm-needs-to-be-adapted\">Algorithm needs to be adapted</h2><p>Dainese and its sister company, D-Air Lab, spent years developing an algorithm for airbags to inflate under skiers’ racing suits after creating a similar system for motorcycle racing.</p><p>In coordination with the FIS, Dainese is sharing the airbag algorithm with top binding suppliers, such as Look, Tyrolia, Salomon, Atomic and Marker to adapt the formula to release skis.</p><p>Releasing skis is potentially more dangerous than inflating an airbag. Elite skiers are sometimes capable of spectacular recoveries after flying into the air, and they also can often use their skis to brake before slamming into safety fences.</p><p>“It’s a very complicated project,” said Marco Pastore, a Dainese representative on the circuit for the airbag system. “If you release a binding, you’ve got to be absolutely sure you do it at the right moment. For the airbag, you can look at the rotations and the entire body position. But with the bindings, you’ve got to examine how the feet move, what the trajectory of the skis is, plus a series of other variables.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4322089\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4322089\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4322089\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26039600194520-1771410562.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"In this image taken from video provided by Olympic Broadcasting Services, OBS, United States' Lindsey Vonn lays on the course after crashing during an alpine ski women's downhill race, at the 2026 Winter Olympics\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4322089\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">American Lindsey Vonn lies on the course after crashing during an alpine women’s downhill race at the 2026 Winter Olympics[Screengrab/Olympic Broadcasting Services via AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"finances-an-issue-for-complicated-safety-projects\">Finances an issue for complicated safety projects</h2><p>While the FIS wants to coordinate the project, issues remain over who will pay for it.</p><p>“These are very costly projects, and to be honest, Dainese has not made much” from the airbags, Pastore said. “Right now, it’s costing us money. Everyone wants these great things, but at the end of the day, someone has to pay for it.”</p><p>Sasha Rearick, the head coach of the United States men’s ski team from 2008 to 2018, recalls discussions about bindings when he was in charge of the World Cup coaches working group nearly a decade ago.</p><p>“The problem is that Dainese is the one who’s putting in the money and all the investments,” Rearick said. “So if they’re sharing it with the binding companies, the binding companies now need to invest heavily, and it probably costs [a lot].”</p><p>Head racing director Rainer Salzgeber, who is involved in the project via Tyrolia, added: “It’s already a lot.” He suggested a simpler and quicker solution for crashes like Vonn’s: gate panels that give way.</p><p>Markus Waldner, the men’s World Cup and Olympics race director, said earlier this season that FIS is “working with biomechanists and manufacturers to refine boot and binding standards to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic edge catches at high speed.”</p><p>Still, Gerdol suggested the project could be anywhere from two to six years away from being implemented.</p><h2 id=\"will-ski-racers-use-the-technology\">Will ski racers use the technology?</h2><p>To avoid skis popping off, ski technicians crank up racers’ bindings so they are virtually locked in.</p><p>Leo Mussi, the ski technician for American downhillers Bryce Bennett and Sam Morse, said he sets his racers’ bindings at up to 200kg (440lb) of pressure – more than double what a store-bought binding is even capable of.</p><p>Austrian racer Marco Schwarz suffered a serious knee injury in a December 2023 crash during the Bormio Alpine Ski World Cup downhill in Italy. His skis didn’t release as he slid into the safety netting.</p><p>“It’s tough to say,” he said of whether the skis popping off would’ve saved him from injury, and he added that he isn’t sure about changing things.</p><p>“The best way is to keep it simple,” Schwarz said. “I don’t want to push too much into more technology.”</p><p>Nina O’Brien, an American who had to endure four surgeries after a gruesome compound fracture at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, said she didn’t fault any equipment issues for her crash and credited her technician.</p><p>“Regardless if I’ve worn the skis that morning, clicked out and gotten a coffee,” O’Brien said, “when I step back in, he checks them to make sure they’re perfect.”</p><h2 id=\"advances-in-ski-racing-safety-have-been-slow\">Advances in ski racing safety have been slow</h2><p>The airbag system was first tested on the World Cup circuit in 2013 and only this season became mandatory for the speed events of downhill and super-G. In between, some skiers said the bags hindered their aerodynamics, were uncomfortable to wear or could actually cause injuries.</p><p>Safety issues became more of a pressing issue recently when Italian skier Matteo Franzoso died from a head injury caused in a crash during preseason training in Chile.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it always takes something serious to happen for people to say, ‘No. Now we need to do something,’” Pastore said.</p><p>This is also the first season in which a cut-resistant undergarment is required for all World Cup and Olympic events.</p><p>There is plenty of room for safety advancements. While the smart bindings system is being developed, Rearick – now the director of Apex 2100, an international ski academy in Tignes, France – suggested addressing the racing suits.</p><p>“Make one suit of material for everybody that’s a little bit warmer, that’s a little bit slower, that’s cut-proof,” Rearick said. “That will make the sport a lot safer for everybody.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In a 2014 email (<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01936285.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) regarding civil unrest in Syria, Libya, and Somalia, Epstein wrote to Barak, “isn’t this perfect for you”.</p><p>Barak replied, “You’re right in a way. But not simple to transform it into a cash flow.”</p><h2 id=\"field-proven-on-palestinians\">‘Field-proven’ on Palestinians</h2><p>The files detail how Israeli intelligence firms marketed their technology to Nigeria using euphemisms such as “field-proven”, a reference to systems deployed by the Israeli military against Palestinians under occupation.</p><p>In 2015, Barak and a business partner invested $15m in FST Biometrics, a firm founded by the former head of Israeli military intelligence, Aharon Ze’evi Farkash. The company’s core technology, a biometric system known as Basel, was originally prototyped at the Beit Hanoon (Erez) <a href=\"/features/2022/6/15/the-seven-border-crossings-of-gaza\">crossing</a> between Israel and the besieged Gaza Strip to control the movement of Palestinian workers.</p><p>While the Nigerian military battled Boko Haram, Barak facilitated the sale of similar biometric surveillance equipment to Babcock University, a Christian institution in Nigeria. The project was framed as a counterterrorism measure, with a press release at the time boasting that the technology would “filter away all unwanted persons”.</p><p>The emails suggest this initial foothold allowed Barak to institutionalise Israeli cyber-expertise within the Nigerian state. By 2020, the World Bank had tapped the Israel National Cyber Directorate and a startup cofounded by Barak to shape Nigeria’s national cyber-infrastructure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"resources-and-logistics\">Resources and logistics</h2><p>The documents indicate that security cooperation was often a pretext for accessing Nigeria’s vast resource wealth. Epstein facilitated high-level talks for DP World, aiming to secure ownership of ports in Lagos and Badagry.</p><p>In the summer of 2018, Epstein brokered discussions between Jide Zeitlin, then-chair of Nigeria’s sovereign investment fund, and bin Sulayem. The documents show Epstein attempting to navigate US sanctions on figures involved in the mining sector to facilitate these deals.</p><p>“I hope your pal’s sojourn in Tel Aviv … was more effective than his efforts on the African continent,” Zeitlin wrote (<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02624197.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) to Epstein in September 2018, referring to the diplomatic normalisation Epstein and bin Sulayem were quietly cultivating between Israel and the United Arab Emirates years before the Abraham Accords.</p><h2 id=\"friends-for-israel\">‘Friends for Israel’</h2><p>The correspondence highlights the immense access Epstein and Barak secured within the Nigerian government. In 2013, Barak attended a cybersecurity conference in Abuja, which organisers privately described as a cover to arrange meetings with then-President Goodluck Jonathan.</p><p>“The dinner is one other excellent way … to meet with good Friends of Israel and make new friends for Israel as well,” the event organiser wrote to Barak.</p><p>Following these meetings, Israeli defence contractor <a href=\"/features/2023/11/17/israels-weapons-industry-is-the-gaza-war-its-latest-test-lab\">Elbit Systems</a> proceeded with a controversial internet surveillance project in Nigeria, despite opposition from the country’s legislature.</p><p>The documents further reveal that Epstein coached Barak on how to parlay these security relationships into personal gain. When Barak shared financial details of a potential oil deal, Epstein responded (<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02592783.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) with harsh advice: “I told you on the phone before sending or asking anyone about it you should do your own homework.”</p><p>The ties between <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">Epstein and Israel</a> have come into sharp focus after the release of millions of documents.</p><p>The documents have revealed more details of Epstein’s interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak. But they also document his funding of Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli army, and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his ties to members of Israel’s overseas intelligence services, the Mossad.</p><p>Barak, who led Israel from 1999 to 2001, has expressed remorse over his lengthy relationship with Epstein. However, despite Epstein having been convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008 and spending about a year in prison during the course of their relationship, Barak, maintaining a close personal and business relationship, claimed he was unaware of the scope of Epstein’s crimes until a wider inquiry into him was opened in 2019.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They also took her sons.</p><p>Within 24 hours, five members of her family were dead, killed in separate “police encounters” across different districts of Pakistan’s Punjab – the province that alone is home to more than half of the country’s population.</p><p>Her sons Imran, 25, Irfan, 23, and Adnan, 18, along with two sons-in-law, were among them.</p><p>“They broke into our house in Bahawalpur and took everything we owned,” Zubaida told a fact-finding mission from Pakistan’s foremost rights group, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).</p><p>“We followed them to Lahore and begged for our sons’ release. The next morning, five of them were dead,” she added.</p><p>When she later filed a legal petition, Zubaida says police threatened to kill whoever remained in her family if she did not withdraw it.</p><p>Her husband, Abdul Jabbar, insists his sons had no criminal records. “They were working men, married with children,” he said.</p><p>The family’s account sits at the centre of an explosive HRCP fact-finding report, published on February 17, which concludes that Punjab’s Crime Control Department (CCD) is pursuing what it calls “a systemic policy of extrajudicial killing in contravention of the law and Constitution”.</p><p>The HRCP documented at least 670 “encounters”, resulting in 924 suspected deaths between April 2025, when the unit was formed, and December 2025.</p><p>The CCD, formally constituted in April last year, was mandated to combat serious and organised crime.</p><p>But the HRCP describes it as a “parallel police force” operating with virtual impunity, linking it to a sharp spike in encounter killings that has ignited debate over the rule of law and the state’s duty to protect the right to life.</p><p>Farah Zia, the HRCP’s director, says Punjab was historically where encounter killings first took root in the 1960s, “partly because of an already existing policing culture where there was impunity for torture”.</p><p>She said the practice later spread to other provinces. HRCP’s annual State of Human Rights reports document hundreds of police encounters each year elsewhere, particularly in Sindh.</p><p>“That the governments choose to apply such short-term, unsustainable and illegal measures to curb crime rather than invest in better forensic investigation techniques, community-based policing and more effective prosecution has not helped matters,” Zia told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-force-a-sharp-rise\">A new force, a sharp rise</h2><p>Under the Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the CCD was established with the stated aim of helping bring to fruition the provincial government’s “Safe Punjab” vision.</p><p>It is a specialised force aimed at tackling serious and organised crime, inter-district gangs and hardened offenders whom regular police struggle to combat.</p><p>Maryam, daughter of three-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and niece of current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, belongs to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party.</p><p>Within weeks of the CCD’s formation, a sustained rise in police encounters was recorded across Punjab. More than 900 suspects were killed in eight months. In the same period, two police personnel were killed and 36 were injured.</p><p>By comparison, HRCP’s annual report for 2024 recorded 341 suspects killed in encounters across Punjab and Sindh combined over the entire year. The CCD, operating in a single province, more than doubled that toll in less than eight months.</p><p>The highest concentration of killings occurred in Lahore, with 139 encounters, followed by Faisalabad with 55 and Sheikhupura with 47.</p><p>The largest category of suspects killed was those accused of dacoity, armed gang robbery, accounting for 366 deaths. Narcotics-related suspects accounted for 114 deaths, robbery suspects 138, and those accused in murder cases, 99.</p><h2 id=\"a-familiar-script\">A familiar script</h2><p>Drawing on multiple police reports filed after the killings, the commission describes how a CCD team typically intercepts suspects, almost invariably on motorcycles and described as moving “suspiciously”, typically at night or at a roadblock.</p><p>The suspects allegedly react aggressively and open fire first, forcing police to respond in self-defence. During the exchange, the suspects are hit while their accomplices escape, “taking advantage of the dark”.</p><p>HRCP notes what it calls “strikingly similar” wording in numerous FIRs, including accounts in which a wounded suspect briefly regains consciousness and, just before dying, volunteers his full name, parentage, home address and criminal history to the officers who have shot him.</p><p>The commission found identical phrases appearing across districts, dates and alleged crimes, suggesting “copy-paste structuring rather than incident-specific reporting”.</p><p>Official police media releases issued after each encounter and circulated to crime reporters via WhatsApp groups often also reproduce the same sequence almost verbatim, emphasising the deceased’s alleged criminal record while omitting procedural details.</p><p>Asad Jamal, a Lahore-based human rights lawyer who has long worked on encounter cases, said the chief minister, Maryam Nawaz, has repeatedly claimed that crime in Punjab has been curtailed, suggesting the approach reflects a policy decision at the highest political level. He expressed scepticism about prospects for accountability.</p><p>“They seem to think that if the crime rate is lowered,” Jamal told Al Jazeera, they are justified in resorting to “extrajudicial killings” – instead of improving investigation techniques, better resources for law enforcement and improved intelligence.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4322155\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4322155\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4322155\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-10T182435Z_1475691388_RC229HATPALG_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PAKISTAN-PROTEST-1771411820.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C525&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Police officers stand as they use tear gas to disperse supporters of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) during a solidarity march for Gaza in Lahore, Pakistan, October 10, 2025.

Whether crime is addressed through investigation, prosecution and a judicial process, or through summary execution, goes to the heart of what kind of state Punjab seeks to be, the commission argues.</p><p>The commission says families reported being told to bury their dead immediately, before independent postmortem examinations could take place.</p><p>The HRCP said it received no data from Punjab Police after requesting material on encounter procedures, and written requests to meet senior police and provincial officials went unanswered.</p><p>Al Jazeera also repeatedly contacted Punjab police officials, including the CCD, as well as Information Minister Azma Bokhari and Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, but received no replies.</p><p>A former senior Punjab police official, who retired in the 2010s, said two main factors drive the rise in encounter killings: an overburdened and often corrupt justice system, and political pressure to demonstrate control over crime.</p><p>Court delays and weak prosecutions create “frustration amongst the people and the police, and they start legitimising short cuts like extrajudicial killings”, he said.</p><p>“The political government wants to be seen as controlling crime, even violating due process. This approach also encourages police to resort to extrajudicial killings, knowing there won’t be any accountability for such actions,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.</p><h2 id=\"a-decade-of-encounters\">A decade of encounters</h2><p>The HRCP’s annual reports show nearly 5,000 encounter cases nationwide over the past decade to 2024, with almost 2,000 in Punjab alone.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2023, encounter figures in Punjab hovered below 400 annually, suggesting a persistent but relatively stable baseline.</p><p>In 2024, however, the number surged to 1,008, more than tripling from the previous year. The latest report records fewer encounters overall but a significantly higher number of fatalities.</p><p>The HRCP and independent observers have repeatedly characterised many such incidents as staged or fake encounters, effectively extrajudicial killings in which suspects are executed rather than arrested.</p><p>Rida Hosain, a Lahore-based lawyer, said encounter killings and extrajudicial violence are a “relic of colonial control structures and military dictatorships” that treated citizens as subjects rather than rights-bearing individuals entitled to a fair trial and due process.</p><p>“The Punjab government frames these measures as a pathway to ‘zero crime’, when in fact it appears to institutionalise another form of criminality: state-sanctioned criminality. Once state-sanctioned violence is normalised, it rarely remains confined to alleged ‘criminals’,” Hosain told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The government may claim that the hundreds killed are ‘criminals’, but guilt must be determined through due process, not summary executions. If this violence goes unquestioned, tomorrow’s targets could be dissidents, even innocent bystanders labelled as ‘criminals’ to justify killing with impunity,” she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I believe so.</p><p>“It should be the crazy moment of the game, an amazing goal,” Mourinho continued. “Unfortunately, [he was] not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.</p><p>“I told [Vinicius], when you score a goal like that, you just celebrate and walk back.

Nothing that happened today is new in my life or my family’s life,” Vinicius wrote.</p><h2 id=\"what-else-have-real-madrid-said-about-the-allegations-against-prestianni\">What else have Real Madrid said about the allegations against Prestianni?</h2><p>Real Madrid defender and England international Trent Alexander-Arnold spoke to the media after the game to condemn the incident.</p><p>“What has happened is a disgrace to football and overshadowed the performance, as well as an amazing goal,” said Alexander-Arnold.</p><p>“Vini has been subject to this a few times throughout his career.

It is disgusting.”</p><h2 id=\"has-mbappe-called-for-prestianni-to-be-banned\">Has Mbappe called for Prestianni to be banned?</h2><p>Mbappe said he had been prepared to leave the pitch immediately but was persuaded by Vinicius to continue playing, before the referee intervened, as per protocol.</p><p>“We cannot accept that there is a player in Europe’s top football competition who behaves like this. This guy [Prestianni] doesn’t deserve to play ⁠in the Champions League any more,” Mbappe told reporters.</p><p>“We have to set an example for all the children watching us at home. What happened today is the kind ⁠of thing we cannot accept because the world is watching us.”</p><p>When asked ⁠whether Prestianni had apologised, Mbappe laughed.</p><p>“Of course not,” he said.</p><p>Former Real Madrid midfielder Clarence Seedorf was among the first to react to Mourinho’s comments.</p><p>“He is still emotional, [but] he made a big mistake today to justify racial abuse,” Seedorf told Amazon Prime.</p><p>“He’s saying it’s OK, when Vinicius provokes you, to be racist, and I think that is very wrong.”</p><p>“We should never, ever justify racial abuse. Vinicius has had enough of that unjustified behaviour from people. I know Mourinho by heart would agree with me, but he expressed himself a bit unfortunately.”</p><p>Former England international Theo Walcott also criticised Mourinho.</p><p>“I am quite calm and composed, and I am not someone who gets angry often,” the former Arsenal forward told Amazon Prime.</p><p>“I love everything Jose Mourinho has done in football, but I think he has made a poor decision in that sense. It was maybe the one time we shouldn’t have heard from him, the one night he should not have been in front of the cameras.”</p><h2 id=\"former-barcelona-forward-supports-vinicius\">Former Barcelona forward supports Vinicius</h2><p>Speaking on CBS, former France, Arsenal and Barcelona forward Thierry Henry said he could understand fully how Vinicius was feeling.</p><p>“I can relate to what Vinicius Junior is going through. That happened to me so many times on the field. At times, you feel lonely because it’s going to be your word against his word, because we don’t know what he has said,” Henry said.</p><p>“He put his shirt over his mouth. Clearly, already, he looks suspicious because he didn’t want people to see what he said.”</p><p>“Let’s see how big of a man Prestianni is – tell us what you said.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The accusation was a first from the prime minister, following repeated denials by his government about reported mass killings, looting and the destruction of factories by Eritrean troops during the Tigray conflict.</p><p>Eritrea’s government rejected Abiy’s claims about atrocities, with Gebremeskel calling them <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-eritrea-tigray-war-108f32cdd0c24ed009bb623b597b7c96\">“cheap and despicable lies”</a>, noting that Abiy’s government had until recently been “showering praises and state medals” on Eritrean army officers.</p><p>As the tensions escalate, many observers say war between the two is now inevitable and have called for dialogue and the de-escalation of the situation.</p><p>“The situation remains highly volatile and we fear that it will deteriorate, worsening the region’s already precarious human rights and humanitarian situation,” the United Nations Human Rights spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said this month.</p><p>Kjetil Tronvoll, a professor of peace and conflict studies at Oslo New University College, told Al Jazeera a new war would have “wide-reaching implications for the region” – regardless of the outcome.</p><p>He believes the looming conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea could take the shape of a new civil war, positioning Addis Ababa against Tigray’s leadership yet again.</p><p>From Ethiopia’s side, he argues the objective would be regime change in both Asmara and Mekelle, noting that “regime change in Eritrea may lead to Ethiopia gaining control of Assab”. For Asmara and Mekelle, the aim would also be regime change in Addis Ababa, he suggests.</p><p>“If it erupts, it will be devastating for Tigray,” Tronvoll said. “The outcome of such a war will likely fundamentally alter the political landscape of Ethiopia and the Horn [of Africa],” he warned, pointing out that regional states could also be pulled into a proxy war.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4320067\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320067\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4320067\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/4ad31a25-5e0b-432b-a005-913e4d7923ac-1771345507.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C590&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4320067\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People in Tigray are afraid renewed tensions may bring another war [Zantana Gebru/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fears-for-the-future\">Fears for the future</h2><p>For many in Tigray, memories of massacres committed during the 2020-2022 war are still fresh.</p><p>Axum, a UNESCO World Heritage site in the central zone of the Tigray region, is known for its tall obelisk relics of an ancient kingdom.

Israel’s genocidal war has killed at least 72,061 people and wounded 171,715 since October 2023, according to the Ministry of Health. It has also shattered infrastructure and displaced the majority of the population. Financial hardship dominated conversations in markets this week.</p><p>“There is no cash among the people. There is no work. It is indeed Ramadan, but Ramadan requires money,” said Gaza City resident Waleed Zaqzouq, calling on merchants to recognise people’s economic struggles.</p><p>“Before the war, people lived a dignified life,” he added. “The situation has completely changed in the war, meaning people have been devastated and worn down.”</p><p>Harsh winter conditions have intensified suffering, with extreme cold killing children, and torrential rains flooding displacement camps and collapsing damaged buildings.</p><p>“There is much that has changed from this Ramadan to Ramadan before the war,” reflected Raed Koheel from Gaza City. “In the past, the atmosphere was more delightful. The streets were lit up with decorations. All streets had decorations. Our children were happy.”</p><p>Nevertheless, amid the overwhelming destruction, some Palestinians endeavour to maintain Ramadan traditions. In Khan Younis, calligrapher Hani Dahman painted “Welcome, Ramadan” in Arabic among the ruins as children looked on.</p><p>“We are here in Khan Younis camp, trying to bring happiness to the hearts of children, women, men and entire families,” Dahman said. “We are … sending a message to the world that we are people who seek life.”</p><p>Decorative Ramadan lights now hang among the debris. Mohammed Taniri, witnessing these efforts, observed: “When they provide such beautiful, simple decorations, it brings joy to the children. Despite all the hardships, they are trying to create a beautiful atmosphere.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Introduced in 2013 by the Manmohan Singh government led by the Congress party that preceded Modi, the trusts, unlike bonds, require the donors to disclose their identities and the amount of money being given.</p><p>But that relative transparency is not dissuading companies from major mega-donations to parties directly positioned to benefit them through policies and contracts, an analysis of recent political funding by Al Jazeera reveals.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321666\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321666\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321666\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2024-03-13T144252Z_1829078988_RC2UK6AH7OTP_RTRMADP_3_TATA-INDIA-SEMICONDUCTOR-1771398858.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C589&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ashwini Vaishnav, Union Minster of Railways, Communications and Electronics &amp; Information Technology and N.

The main opposition Congress party got about $36m (8 percent), while other parties received the remaining amount.</p><p>This data is sourced from disclosures made during the first full year after the Supreme Court ban on bonds.</p><p>Two major corporations stood out, due to their significant financial scale and policy influence:  The Tata Group, founded in 1868 by Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, is a global conglomerate with more than 30 companies spanning steel, IT, automobiles, aviation, and more. Its aggregate revenue for FY 2024-25  exceeded <a href=\"https://www.tata.com/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$180bn</a>. The Murugappa Group, founded in 1900 by A M Murugappa Chettiar as a money-lending business in Burma (now Myanmar), is a prominent Indian conglomerate with 29 businesses in engineering, agriculture, financial services and beyond. Its turnover stood at <a href=\"https://www.murugappa.com/media/yvnkccsm/press-release-wendt-india-q4-fy-2024-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$8.53bn</a> in 2024-25.</p><p>Documents submitted to the Election Commission of India in 2024-2025 show that the Progressive Electoral Trust, backed by 15 companies belonging to the Tata Group conglomerate, distributed approximately $110.2m to 10 political parties in the run-up to the 2024 general election.</p><p>The BJP received about $91.3m – again roughly 83 percent of the total fund – while the Congress got $9.31m, with smaller sums going to several regional parties. Tata made its contribution on <a href=\"https://www.eci.gov.in/eci-backend/public/pdf/report/November/1762861609.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">April 2, 2024</a>, while Murugappa did so on <a href=\"https://www.eci.gov.in/eci-backend/public/pdf/report/July/1753355372.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">March 26, 2024</a>.</p><p>India’s general elections began on April 19 and concluded on June 1, 2024.</p><p>The timing and scale of these donations are significant, say experts. Tata’s donations came within weeks of the government approving two semiconductor projects worth more than $15.2bn announced by the Tata Group in Gujarat and Assam – both BJP-ruled states.</p><p>The Modi government also provided additional support of about $5.3bn under India’s plans to promote semiconductor development.</p><p>Meanwhile, in February 2024, the Indian government approved a semiconductor assembly and testing facility proposed by CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, a Murugappa Group company. The project, to be set up in Sanand, Gujarat, with an investment of approximately <a href=\"https://www.murugappa.com/media/usflpl3a/press-release-cg-semi-unveils-one-of-india-s-first-end-to-end-osat-facilities-in-sanand-gujarat.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$870m</a>, also received central and state government incentives.</p><p>In the same financial year, disclosures showed that yet another trust called Triumph Electoral Trust received $15.06m from Tube Investments of India Ltd, another Murugappa Group company. The entire money went to the BJP, with no contribution by Triumph to other parties.The scale of these donations surprised observers as the Murugappa Group had been a modest political donor over the previous decade.</p><p>“Electoral trusts may be legal, but they normalise a system where money determines access, policy, and electoral success,” Parayil Sreerag, a political strategist, told Al Jazeera. Sreerag argued that such a mechanism “favours the ruling party, marginalises smaller movements, and erodes democratic competition and public trust”.</p><p>To be sure, corporate funding in India has a long history.</p><p>The Birla group of companies was a major financier of Mahatma Gandhi in the years leading up to independence in 1947. Since then, other companies and parties have continued the practice.</p><p>“Business houses have traditionally supported ruling political parties,” G Gopa Kumar, former vice chancellor of the Central University of Kerala and a political strategist, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>India’s legal framework governing corporate donations to political parties has evolved alongside political shifts. The <a href=\"https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/12807/1/the_companies_act%2C_1956_no._1_of_1956_date_01.01.1956.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Companies Act, 1956</a>, first regulated such contributions, barring government companies and young firms, while mandating disclosure of donations. <a href=\"https://rsdebate.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/500270/1/PD_68_17051969_16_p3570_p3631_13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Corporate funding was later banned in 1969 under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi</a>. The ban was lifted in <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/financing-elections-india-scrutiny-corporate-donation-49750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1985</a>.</p><p>A major overhaul came in <a href=\"https://www.adrindia.org/sites/default/files/CBDT_rules_for_Electoral_Trust.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013</a> with the introduction of Electoral Trusts and the Companies Act, 2013. The new law capped corporate donations at 7.5 percent of average net profits, required board approval, and mandated disclosure, marking a significant attempt at regulation and transparency.</p><p>But while the Modi-era electoral bonds between 2018 and 2024 drew the bulk of the criticism over electoral finance from transparency activists, the return to electoral trusts has coincided with what is, in effect, an increase in corporate funding for parties. Between 2018 and 2024, the electoral bonds led to an average of under $350m in total donations per year.</p><p>Trusts – to which corporates turned after the bonds were scrapped – donated more than $450m by contrast, in 2024-25.</p><p>“Left unchecked, it [soaring corporate funding] risks creating a duopoly between political power and corporate capital,” Sreerag said.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the Tata Group, the Murugappa Group and the Election Commission of India for their responses to concerns over links between donations and influence, but it has not yet received any response.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321676\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321676\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321676\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP24071317812573-1771399004.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Activists of Communist Party of India (Marxist) protest in Hyderabad, India, against the State Bank of India seeking more time to disclose details of “electoral bonds” to the Election Commission of India, Monday, March 11, 2024.

In several cases, firms accused of tax evasion or other financial crimes donated after raids by India’s enforcement and investigating agencies, raising concerns of coercive political pressure: 26 entities under investigation bought bonds worth $624.7m, including $223.3m after raids by investigating agencies.</p><p>Bond purchases peaked around election cycles. That timing – around elections and after raids – was “significant”, Poola told Al Jazeera. “That sequencing is analytically difficult to dismiss as coincidence.” While the data cannot establish legal intent, Poola stressed that the pattern points to an “institutionalised quid pro quo ecosystem enabled by opacity”.</p><p>Yet critics say transparency alone does not resolve the link between public policy and political funding – as the data since the ban on electoral bonds shows.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321688\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321688\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321688\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-09-at-11.36.12-PM-1-1771399178.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C439&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"S Mini during her campaign in 2024 April\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321688\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">S Mini, a candidate from the SUCI party, during her campaign for India’s national elections in April 2024.

But that is not happening. Abhilash MR, a Supreme Court lawyer, said large corporate donations raise serious concerns, particularly under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees political equality and administrative fairness.</p><p>He said there is mounting evidence of generous government incentives followed by large corporate donations.“When policy decisions appear calibrated to facilitate corporate funding, the very idea of a welfare state is undermined,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that proving corruption in courts remains extremely difficult.</p><p>“Temporal proximity between policy benefits and donations rarely meets the evidentiary threshold needed to trigger an independent judicial inquiry,” he said. “In such situations, accountability shifts from courtrooms to the public domain.”</p><p>Mini S, a politician from the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) party, had hoped for that shift among voters when she contested the 2024 national elections from Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of the southern Kerala state.</p><p>She couldn’t fund air-conditioned vehicles, so her campaign during India’s notorious summer moved through neighbourhoods on hired motorbikes and autorickshaws. She hoped to unseat Shashi Tharoor, a former UN diplomat and politician from the opposition Congress party, who had been representing Thiruvananthapuram in parliament since 2009. When the votes were counted, Mini secured just 1,109 votes, while Tharoor won by a landslide. She also forfeited her $275 security deposit.</p><p>But for Mini, the outcome was less a personal defeat than an indictment of how Indian elections are fought. Her entire campaign ran on $5,500, she said, an amount much lower than the $105,000 limit set by the Election Commission of India on expenditure by a parliamentary candidate.</p><p>“India likes to call itself the world’s largest democracy, but it’s not,” Mini told Al Jazeera. “When corporate money openly funds mainstream parties – through electoral bonds and trusts, often in clear quid pro quo arrangements – and the Election Commission stays silent, what kind of democracy is this?”</p><p>In such a scenario, Mini said, government policies “serve corporate interests, not the constitution”.</p><p>“Ordinary people are sidelined, and the marginalised are pushed further into the margins. With money of this scale in elections, anyone without corporate backing, like us, is effectively locked out of politics,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They’ll fight at 145lb (66kg) for five five-minute rounds.</p><p>Despite their lengthy absences, Rousey and Carano remain two of the most iconic fighters in MMA history for their trailblazing careers. Carano led their once-outlawed sport into the mainstream of broadcast television, while Rousey secured the enthusiastic acceptance of women’s MMA by Dana White and the UFC.</p><p>Rousey (12-2) rose to become arguably the biggest athlete in all of MMA after winning an Olympic medal in judo in 2008. Her armbar finishes and cage charisma single-handedly prompted White to begin the promotion of women’s MMA, with Rousey at the centre of his plans.</p><p>Rousey won the UFC’s first-ever women’s bout in 2013 to claim the bantamweight title belt, and she still holds the promotion’s record with six title defences.</p><p>After ending 11 of her first 12 fights in the first round, her career abruptly stalled when she lost back-to-back bouts to Holly Holm and Amanda Nunes, prompting her to move on to acting, professional wrestling and motherhood.</p><p>“Been waiting so long to announce this: Me and Gina Carano are gonna throw down in the biggest super fight in women’s combat sport history!” Rousey said. “This is for all MMA fans past, present and future.”</p><p></p><p>Carano (7-1) fought in the first Nevada-sanctioned MMA bout between women in 2006, and she won a series of fights that made her a network television draw in the sport’s early days. She was stopped by Cris “Cyborg” Justino in her most recent fight in August 2009, and she moved on to an acting career despite repeated rumours of a return to the cage.</p><p>“Ronda came to me and said there is only one person she would make a comeback for, and it has been her dream to make this fight happen between us,” Carano said.</p><p>“She thanked me for opening up doors for her in her career and was respectful in asking for this fight to happen. This is an honour. I believe I will walk out of this fight with the win, and I anticipate it will not come easy, which I welcome. This is as much for Ronda and me as it is for the fans and mixed martial arts community.”</p><p>Carano, who turns 44 in April, landed several prominent film roles and became a cast member of Disney’s “The Mandalorian” before her contract failed to be renewed in 2021, after she expressed controversial right-wing views in a series of social media posts.</p><p>Carano settled a lawsuit last year against Lucasfilm and The Walt Disney Company over her claim that she was fired for the posts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321643\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321643\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321643\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26048615229932-1771397945.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt='FILE - Gina Carano attends the Disney Plus launch event promoting, \"The Mandalorian,\" on Oct. 19, 2019, at the London West Hollywood hotel in West Hollywood, Calif.

Photos shared by the sheriff’s office showed a car park blanketed in white flurries, where rescuers carrying skis and poles trudged through knee-high snow.</p><p>The stricken group consisted of ski guides and clients. The sheriff’s office clarified on Tuesday night that there were 15 skiers on the trip – not 16 as initially believed – and said no further updates were expected for the rest of the evening.</p><p>Greene said authorities learned of the avalanche through notifications from the ski tour company guiding the group, as well as activations from the emergency beacons carried by the skiers themselves.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321605\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321605\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321605\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26049125274093-1771396638.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"This image provided by the Nevada County Sheriff's Office shows members of a rescue team in Soda Springs, California on Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026.
