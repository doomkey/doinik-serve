It is rare but not unprecedented for House leadership to cut a contested vote short.</p><p>Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said the decision prevented some Democrats from voting.</p><p>“Listen, it’s playing games when people’s lives are at stake,” DeLauro said. “They jettisoned it.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It was the latest episode of congressional discord over the subsidies, which are slated to expire at the end of the year.</p><p>The vote also offered another key test to the Republican leadership of House Speaker Mike Johnson. Normally, Johnson determines which bills to bring to a House vote, but recently, his power has been circumvented by a series of “discharge petitions”, wherein a majority of representatives sign a petition to force a vote.</p><p>In a series of quickfire manoeuvres on Wednesday, Democrats resorted to one such discharge petition to force a vote on the healthcare subsidies in the new year.</p><p>They were joined by the four centrist Republicans: Mike Lawler of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick, Robert Bresnahan and Ryan MacKenzie of Pennsylvania.</p><p>The Democratic proposal would see the subsidies extended for three years.</p><p>But Republicans have largely rallied around their own proposal, a bill called the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act. It would reduce some insurance premiums, though critics argue it would raise others, and it would also reduce healthcare subsidies overall.</p><p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Tuesday said the legislation would decrease the number of people with health insurance by an average of 100,000 per year through 2035.</p><p>Its money-saving provisions would reduce federal deficits by $35.6bn, the CBO said.</p><p>Republicans have a narrow 220-seat majority in the 435-seat House of Representatives, and Democrats are hoping to flip the chamber to their control in the 2026 midterm elections.</p><p>Three of the four Republicans who sided with the Democrats over the discharge petition are from the swing state of Pennsylvania, where voters could lean right or left.</p><p>Affordability has emerged as a central question ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p><p>Even if the Republican-controlled House manages to pass a healthcare bill this week, it is unlikely to be taken up by the Senate before Congress begins a looming end-of-year recess that would stop legislative action until January 5.</p><p>By then, millions of Americans will be looking at significantly more expensive health insurance premiums that could prompt some to go without coverage.</p><p>Wednesday’s House floor battle could embolden Democrats and some Republicans to revisit the issue in January, even though higher premiums will already be in the pipeline.</p><p>Referring to the House debate, moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters: “I think that that will help prompt a response here in the Senate after the first of the new year, and I’m looking forward to that.”</p><p>The ACA subsidies were a major point of friction earlier this year as well, during the historic 43-day government shutdown.</p><p>Democrats had hoped to extend the subsidies during the debate over government spending, but Republican leaders refused to take up the issue until a continuing budget resolution was passed first.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But California regulators will not impose that part of the judge’s proposed penalty.</p><p>Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales licence suspended.</p><p>After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas-based company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it is deployed.</p><p>“Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue – steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,” said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.</p><p>In a post on Musk’s X service, Tesla brushed off the decision as regulatory overkill.</p><p>“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem. Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,” the company said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The car maker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began with a backlash to Musk’s high-profile role overseeing cuts in the US government budget via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that President Donald Trump created.</p><p>Politics apart, increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world’s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.</p><p>Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, Tesla’s sales have continued to slide and have decreased by 9 percent from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.</p><h2 id=\"bumper-stock\">Bumper stock</h2><p>Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla’s stock price touched an all-time high of $495.28 during Wednesday’s early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla’s shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk’s ill-fated stint in the Trump administration – a “somewhat successful” assignment he recently said he wouldn’t take on again.</p><p>The performance of Tesla’s stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk’s efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the US.</p><p>Musk has been promising Tesla’s self-driving technology would fulfil his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. In the past few days, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.</p><p>California regulators are far from the first critics to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner.</p><p>The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle’s owner’s manual on its website has made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own.</p><p>The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company’s California sales licence, remained on its website for nearly four years.</p><p>Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterisations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false sense of security that have resulted in lethal accidents.</p><p>The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year, a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a <a href=\"/economy/2025/9/18/eyeing-the-future-of-self-driving-cars-musks-tesla-settles-accident-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lethal crash in Florida</a> that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240m in damages.</p></div></div></body></html>"

These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs.”</p><p>While US and British companies were involved in early oil exploration in Venezuela, the fuel belongs to the Latin American country under the international law principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Venezuela nationalised its oil sector in 1976 and brought it under the control of the state-owned PDVSA.</p><p>Later, in 2007, the late left-wing President Hugo Chavez nationalised the remaining foreign oil projects in Venezuela, effectively ousting US oil giants like ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil.</p><p>The US companies filed legal challenges to fight the expropriation process, and in 2014, a <a href=\"/economy/2014/10/10/venezuela-ordered-to-pay-1-6bn-to-exxon\">World Bank arbitration tribunal</a> ordered Venezuela to pay Exxon Mobil $1.6bn. Legal proceedings remain ongoing.</p><p>The US imposed sanctions on PDVSA in 2019, under Trump’s first presidency.</p><p>But Trump has ramped up his “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela since returning to office for a second term in January.</p><p>Late on Tuesday, Trump announced a blockade on Venezuelan oil tankers, describing them as “sanctioned”. In a Truth Social <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115731908387416458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on the subject, Trump echoed Miller’s assertions that Venezuelans had stolen oil from the US.</p><p>“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before – Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The blockade is part of the increasingly confrontational approach Trump has taken towards Venezuela and its left-wing President Nicolas Maduro, who served as vice president under the late Chavez.</p><p>Last week, the US military – which has been amassing military assets near Venezuela – seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a move that <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/venezuela-oil-exports-fall-steeply-after-us-forces-seize-tanker-off-coast\">Caracas denounced</a> as “international piracy”.</p><p>Since September, the US has also been bombing vessels near the South American country in the Caribbean Sea that it says are drug boats, in a deadly campaign many legal experts call a violation of domestic and international laws.</p><p>On Tuesday, the publication Vanity Fair quoted White House chief of staff Susie Wiles as saying that the US boat strikes <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/top-trump-aide-suggests-boat-strikes-aim-to-topple-venezuelas-maduro\">aim to topple</a> the Venezuelan president, who has faced accusations of human rights abuses.</p><p>Wiles reportedly told the magazine that Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries ‘uncle'”.</p><p>The Trump administration has also taken several actions against the Maduro government itself. In November, the administration designated the “Cartel de los Soles” as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, even though the term does not refer to an organised group.</p><p>Rather, it is a reference to alleged corruption within the Venezuelan government and military.</p><p>There is no evidence, however, to back the claim that Maduro is the leader of a drug cartel, nor that Venezuela is a major source of US-bound narcotics.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump nevertheless said he would name “the Venezuelan regime” a “foreign terrorist organisation”, citing the “theft of our [US] assets”.</p><p>Another grievance that Trump and his aides have cited is the unfounded claim that Maduro intentionally sent criminals and gang members to the US over the past years.</p><p>But Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – believed to be the largest in the world – have been a particular point of contention.</p><p>On Wednesday, citing anonymous sources, the news publication Politico reported that the Trump administration had been approaching private oil companies to ask if they were interested in returning to Venezuela, should Maduro be removed from power.</p><p>“There has been the genesis of an outreach with the industry on the potential of reentering Venezuela,” one anonymous source told Politico.</p><p>“But frankly, there’s not a lot of interest from the industry, in light of lower oil prices and more attractive fields globally.”</p><p>However, prominent Venezuelan opposition figure <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/venezuelas-machado-taunts-maduro-government-after-dramatic-exit-to-oslo\">Maria Corina Machado</a> has promised to privatise the country’s oil sector and open it up to investment should Maduro lose power.

This was about going after the Republican Party, and most importantly, it was about going after our candidate for president, President Trump,” Representative Jim Jordan, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told the TV programme Fox and Friends on Wednesday.</p><p>Formerly a prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Smith was appointed as a special counsel to the Justice Department in 2022, under former President Joe Biden.</p><p>Special counsels are selected from outside the Justice Department to prevent conflicts of interest in cases that are politically sensitive, and they operate without daily oversight from the department.</p><p>Smith ultimately dropped the two federal cases against Trump after the Republican leader’s successful re-election in 2024, as it is against Justice Department policy to prosecute a sitting president. He later resigned in January, shortly before Trump took office.</p><p>But Trump has repeatedly called for <a href=\"/news/2025/8/2/us-authorities-investigating-ex-trump-prosecutor-jack-smith\">Smith</a> to be prosecuted for his role in the criminal cases against him.</p><p>In October, for instance, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115457600588415376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> a link to an article about Smith on his Truth Social platform, accompanied by the message: “These thugs should all be investigated and put in prison. A disgrace to humanity. Deranged Jack Smith is a criminal!!!”</p><p>Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively pushed for the prosecution of critics and political rivals and has continued to push the false claim that he was the true winner of the 2020 election instead of Biden.</p><p>Democrats, meanwhile, have pushed the Trump administration to make Smith’s full report into the two federal cases public.</p><p>After Wednesday’s hearing, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Jamie Raskin, told reporters that there was a reason Republicans wanted Smith to testify in private.</p><p>Had he testified in public, Raskin said, “It would have been absolutely devastating to the president and all the president’s men involved in the insurrectionary activities” on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Experts warn that, by threatening to sever Venezuela from its foreign oil markets, the US is attempting to destabilise the country’s economy and topple the leadership of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Already, tensions between the US and Venezuela are at a high, with the Trump administration surging military assets to the Caribbean and Maduro responding with his own troop movements.</p><p>That has led figures like United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to press for calm in the region and a de-escalation.</p><p>Through UN spokesperson Farhan Haq, Guterres called on both countries to “honour their obligations under international law” and “safeguard peace in the region”.</p><p>Guterres also spoke with Maduro by telephone on Wednesday, repeating the need for both parties to respect international law.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, however, questioned whether the UN was taking enough precautions to prevent a full-scale conflict from erupting in the Americas.</p><p>“I call on the United Nations to fulfil its role. It has not been present. It must assume its role to prevent any bloodshed,” Sheinbaum said in her morning news conference on Wednesday.</p><p>She echoed Guterres’s appeal to find a “peaceful solution” to the tensions, adding: “We call for dialogue and peace, not intervention.”</p><p>The regional friction was also felt at a ministerial meeting in Brazil on Wednesday, where President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva spoke to the conflict.</p><p>“I am concerned about Latin America. I am concerned about President Trump’s attitudes toward Latin America, his threats. We are going to have to be very attentive to this issue,” Lula said.</p><p>The Brazilian leader shared that he had spoken to Trump about Venezuela and urged him to find a diplomatic solution.</p><p>“The power of words can be worth more than the power of weapons,” Lula said he told Trump. “It costs less and takes less time if you are willing to do it.”</p><p>He added that he had offered Brazil’s services as a mediator to facilitate communications with Venezuela. It shares a border with Venezuela to the north, and previously, in 2022, Lula <a href=\"/news/2022/12/14/brazil-to-resume-diplomatic-relations-with-venezuela-under-lula\">restored</a> Brazil’s relations with the Maduro government.</p><p>“I told Trump: ‘If you are interested in talking on good terms with Venezuela, we can contribute. Now, you have to be willing to talk. You have to have patience,'” Lula said.</p><p>The comments come on the heels of Trump’s latest threats on Tuesday.</p><p>On his online platform Truth Social, the US leader announced that he had designated Maduro’s government as a “foreign terrorist organisation” and would implement a “TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela”.</p><p>“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115731908387416458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before.”</p><p>Already, Trump has offered a $50m bounty for any information that leads to Maduro’s arrest, and his administration has deployed approximately 15,000 troops to the Caribbean, along with military jets and ships, among them the USS Gerald Ford, the largest aircraft carrier in the world.</p><p>Last week, the Trump administration also <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/trump-admin-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-reports\">seized an oil tanker</a> off the coast of Venezuela, claiming the vessel was sanctioned. The tanker’s oil, Trump said, would remain with the US.</p><p>Since his first term, Trump has led a “maximum pressure” campaign against the Maduro government, which has been accused of human rights abuses ranging from torture to the false imprisonment of political dissidents.</p><p>Last year, Maduro also claimed victory in a highly contested presidential election that critics called fraudulent — and that was followed by a deadly crackdown on protesters.</p><p>But critics have accused Trump of using his feud with Maduro as a pretext to expand his presidential powers and carry out controversial actions in the Caribbean region.</p><p>Since September 2, for instance, the Trump administration has bombed at least 25 boats and maritime vessels as part of an anti-drug campaign. An estimated 95 people have been killed in the attacks, which UN experts have likened to extrajudicial killings, in violation of international law.</p><p>Trump, however, has argued that the air strikes were necessary, blaming Maduro and other Latin American leaders for seeking to flood the US with drugs and criminals — allegations he has made with little to no proof.</p><p>The identities of those on board the bombed vessels remain largely unknown.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, an overlapping map of influence is evident on the ground with de facto authorities competing over security, resources and representation.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>At the heart of these changes is the STC, backed by a regional power, which now stands as the most powerful actor in Yemen’s south and parts of its east at a time when the government’s ability to impose unified administration over the whole country is distant and the economy is suffering.</p><p>In this context comes what the Yemeni government has said is the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) decision to suspend activities in the country. While the IMF has not publicly commented on the topic, President Rashad al-Alimi, the head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, warned on Sunday that the decision was a “wake-up call” and an early signal of the cost of the STC’s security and military escalation in Hadramout and al-Mahra.</p><p>Al-Alimi stressed that Yemen’s economic circumstances – the country is the poorest in the region and has <a href=\"/news/2021/10/14/yemens-humanitarian-crisis-growing-as-economy-collapses-un\">suffered immensely during the war</a> – cannot withstand any new tensions. He added that the security instability in eastern Yemen would immediately affect the distribution of salaries, fuel and services and international donor confidence.</p><p>The solution, according to al-Alimi, is for the withdrawal of forces who have arrived in Hadramout and al-Mahra from outside the two governorates, calling it a necessary step to contain tensions and restore a path of trust with the international community.</p><p>But that economic warning cannot be understood in isolation from the shift in power in eastern Yemen, where competition for influence has become a direct factor in generating tension that leaves donors wary.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-new-balance-of-power\">A new balance of power</h2><p>The STC is clear that its goal is ultimately the secession of the territories in Yemen – its south and east – that formerly made up the country of South Yemen before unification in 1990.</p><p>It is opposed to the Houthis, who control Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s populous northwest, and the STC’s leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, has a seat on the government’s Presidential Leadership Council, officially as one of its vice chairmen.</p><p>The STC and government forces have previously fought, most notably in 2018 and 2019, in Aden and its surrounding governorates.</p><p>Its current expansion eastwards, focused on government forces and those affiliated with them, is part of that ongoing division in the anti-Houthi camp but one that redraws the balance of power within it, turning resource-rich Hadramout and al-Mahra into a multiparty arena of competition.</p><p>There are three concurrent trends that are emerging as a result: the expansion of STC forces with regional support, a desire by local and tribal forces – independent of the STC – to solidify their presence and the clearly limited tools the government has to confront its rivals.</p><p>The result is the further fragmentation of the state on three interconnected levels.</p><p>Politically, there is fragmentation within the same anti-Houthi camp with multiple decision-making centres. The government and regional actors are finding it more difficult to unify security and administrative policies, and the idea of a single “chain of command” controlling territory under anti-Houthi control has been eroded.</p><p>Geographically, new lines of contact have now been formed. Whereas lines of control were previously between the Houthis and government forces, they are now between Houthi and STC forces as well as grey areas contested by local and tribal forces and multiple military groups.</p><p>And then there is fragmentation on the representative level with mounting disputes over who actually speaks for the south and Hadramout and the practical decline of the concept of a single state as a sovereign framework for managing resources and institutions.</p><p>In Hadramout and al-Mahra, the fragmentation is particularly sensitive as both governorates include important border crossings with Saudi Arabia and Oman and also have a long coastline with routes tied to trade, smuggling and irregular migration.</p><p>Any imbalance here does not remain local; it quickly spills over into the region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"economy-hostage-to-security\">Economy hostage to security</h2><p>The IMF’s suspension of activities carries not only financial implications but also a political reading that the security and institutional environments no longer provide sufficient conditions for sustaining support programmes.</p><p>The Yemeni state relies heavily on its own limited resources and fragile external support, so any disruption in resource areas, ports or supply routes translates into immediate pressure on livelihoods.</p><p>The latest military developments increase pressure on the exchange rate and the government’s ability to meet its financial obligations and widen the trust gap between society and the state, prompting non-institutional alternatives based on levies and loyalties.</p><p>And it will shrink the room for the government to manoeuvre, meaning the government has to take into account the cost of any escalation because any military move increases an economic bill that it cannot pay and drains what remains of the government’s ability to manage services.</p><p>Now that the impression has taken root that Yemen has turned into “islands of influence”, some external actors may be inclined to deal directly with de facto local authorities at the expense of the government, weakening the political centre rather than helping it to strengthen.</p><p>That is why the latest developments are so important if not existential to the government and al-Alimi. His call for the withdrawal of outside forces from Hadramout and al-Mahra is part of an attempt to stop the deterioration of trust in Yemen and to present the government once again as capable of controlling the other parties in the anti-Houthi camp if reasonable political and economic conditions are provided.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"houthis-gain-while-rivals-stay-divided\">Houthis gain while rivals stay divided</h2><p>The Houthis, who overthrew the government in Sanaa in a coup in 2014, have benefitted from the developments in Hadramout and al-Mahra even without being directly involved.</p><p>Every struggle for influence in areas outside the group’s control gives it clear gains, including the disintegration of the front opposing it and its rivals being preoccupied by internal conflicts rather than by the Houthis themselves.</p><p>In the anti-Houthi camp, the notion of a united front recedes every time a military confrontation between its components takes place, and the discussion shifts from confronting the Houthis to disputes over power and resources within the same camp.</p><p>The divisions within the anti-Houthi camp and the regional dimension to them also allow the Houthis to reinforce their narrative that their rivals are working within competing foreign agendas, as opposed to the Houthis, who portray themselves as independent actors able to carry out their own decisions.</p><p>Moreover, the recent conflict and its consequences ultimately improve the Houthis’ negotiating position now that the other side is even more fragmented and weak. The Houthis will enter any upcoming settlement from a more cohesive organisational and administrative position, raising the ceiling of their conditions.</p><p>The Houthis may have their own economic and social tensions, but divisions among their enemies give them extra time to sustain the war economy and their instruments of control over it and over the people they rule.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rising-risks-domestic-and-regional\">Rising risks, domestic and regional</h2><p>The current course of events in Yemen elevates a number of overlapping risks.</p><p>Domestically, there is the possibility of front lines turning into actual borders between adjacent entities, the expansion of security vacuums and declining prospects for producing a unifying social contract.</p><p>Regionally, there could be an expansion of the areas considered lawless along the borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman, increasing the risks of smuggling and leading to higher costs for managing border security.</p><p>Internationally, the growing need for global powers to communicate with multiple parties in Yemen prolongs the crisis and increases the chances that the conflict is internationalised through competition over ports, resources and shipping routes.</p><p>However, the picture painted does not mean there will be a decisive victory for any side and instead makes a mosaic of authorities, all needing external sponsorship, more likely. Inevitably, that will weaken the prospect of establishing a stable state.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-way-out\">A way out?</h2><p>Lowering tensions by making partial deals on redeployments of forces is not enough. Instead, the path forward needs a broader approach based on three interlinked pillars.</p><p>First, the national project needs to be redefined by drafting a vision of the state that guarantees fair partnership for all the regions of Yemen within a viable federal framework and redefines the political centre as a guarantor of rights and services.</p><p>Second, security must be based on a model of local forces under a national umbrella. In Hadramout and al-Mahra, this should be done by building professional local forces within a clear national and legal framework with practical arrangements for withdrawing outside forces and ensuring that security decision-making in state institutions is uniform.</p><p>Third, an economic deal is necessary to restore trust by concluding a transparent agreement on managing resources in the governorates that produce them, the fair distribution of revenues and the linking of international support to an implementable reform plan with a clear commitment to protecting sovereign facilities under central management.</p><p>In the absence of these steps, Yemen will continue towards a gradual model of disintegration from the peripheries in which the most cohesive armed entities advance and contested margins expand.</p><p>If that continues, the economy will be the first victim of fragmentation, making conditions even more difficult for millions of Yemenis.</p><p>And the governance crisis will eventually turn into a prolonged stability crisis, the repercussions of which will be difficult to contain locally and perhaps even regionally.</p><p><em>Saeed Thabit is the Al Jazeera Media Network’s bureau chief for Yemen</em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

After Warner Bros accepted the streaming giant’s offer, Paramount launched a hostile offer to outdo that bid.</p><p>“It does not, and never has,” the board wrote of the guarantee of Paramount’s offer, noting that the offer posed “numerous, significant risks”.</p><p>The board said it found Paramount’s offer “inferior” to Netflix’s $27.75 per share offer, which is a binding agreement that requires no equity financing and has robust debt commitments, the board wrote.</p><p>The board also said the offer could be terminated or amended at any time before the deal’s completion, which is not the same as a binding merger agreement.</p><p>Warner Bros has not yet set a date for a shareholder vote on the deal, but it is expected to happen sometime in spring or early summer, its chairman, Samuel Di Piazza, said in an interview with CNBC.</p><p>The Ellisons have cited their relationship with United States President Donald Trump as a reason why the deal would face an easier regulatory path.</p><p>“The Warner Bros Discovery Board reinforced that Netflix’s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders,” its co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement.</p><p>Netflix is already talking with the US Department of Justice and the European Commission, its other co-CEO, Greg Peters, told CNBC while expressing confidence in how regulators would view the deal.</p><p>Netflix has told Warner Bros it would keep releasing the studio’s films in cinemas in a bid to ease fears that the deal would eliminate another studio and major source of theatrical films, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><h2 id=\"paramount-s-case\">Paramount’s case</h2><p>Paramount last week took its case directly to Warner Bros shareholders, arguing it had arranged “air-tight financing” to support its bid with $41bn in new equity assured by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54bn of debt commitments from the Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.</p><p>The board decision came a day after Affinity Partners, a fund backed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and one of the funding sources of the Paramount offer, pulled out of the deal. The amount Affinity Partners was contributing to the offer was not disclosed in Paramount’s latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>“With two strong competitors vying to secure the future of this unique American asset, Affinity has decided no longer to pursue the opportunity,” the firm said in a statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October. We continue to believe there is a strong strategic rationale for Paramount’s offer.”</p><p>The Warner Bros board countered that Paramount’s latest offer included an equity commitment “for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind” but rather the backing of “an unknown and opaque” Lawrence J Ellison Revocable Trust, whose assets and liabilities are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change.</p><p>“Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was, … the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer,” the Warner Bros board wrote.</p><p>“A revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling shareholder.”</p><p>Paramount had submitted a total of six bids to acquire the entire Warner Bros studio, including its television networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports.</p><p>It has previously said the Ellison family trust – which Paramount says contains more than $250bn in assets, including about 1.16 billion shares of Oracle – is more than adequate to cover the equity commitment.</p><p>Warner Bros had raised questions about Paramount’s financial condition and creditworthiness. The offer relied on a seven-party, cross-conditional structure with the Ellison Revocable Trust providing 32 percent of the required equity commitment while capping its liability at $2.8bn, Warner Bros said. It noted that the trust’s assets could have been withdrawn at any time.</p><p>On Wall Street, Paramount Skydance’s stock tumbled on the news. It was down 3.8 percent from the market open. Warner Bros Discovery was down 0.4 percent while Netflix was surging – up 2.8 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But one 2019 report from George Mason University found that there were 857,200 immigrants among the country’s 8.1 million teachers, in roles ranging from pre-school to university.</p><p>For the 2023-2024 school year alone, the US government <a href=\"https://j1visa.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Teacher-Exchange-Visitors-Flyer-2023-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brought</a> 6,716 full-time teachers to the country on temporary exchange visas to fill openings in pre-kindergarten, primary and secondary school education.</p><p>Many hailed from the Philippines, as well as countries like Jamaica, Spain and Colombia.</p><p>The uncertainty for immigrants under Trump’s second term, however, has proven disruptive to schools that rely heavily on foreign-born teachers.</p><p>That is the case for the pre-school where Susanna worked, CommuniKids, which offers language immersion programmes in Washington, DC.</p><p>Cofounder and president Raul Echevarría estimates that immigrants — both citizens and non-citizens working with legal authorisation — comprise about 90 percent of CommuniKids’s staff.</p><p>But Echevarría told Al Jazeera that the push to rescind legal pathways to immigration has jeopardised the employment of several faculty members.</p><p>Five other teachers at the school have seen their ability to work affected by changes to the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme.</p><p>All five, Echevarría explained, were originally from Venezuela. But in October, the Trump administration ended TPS status for more than 350,000 Venezuelan citizens, including the teachers at CommuniKids.</p><p>Their authorisation to work legally in the US will expire on October 2, 2026, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.</p><p>“These teachers lost their ability to make a living,” Echevarria said, noting that his school requires educators with expertise in languages like Spanish, French and Mandarin.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4172070\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4172070\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4172070\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image005-1765679104.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A classroom hall at CommuniKids\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4172070\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CommuniKids, a language immersion school in Washington, DC, helps young children develop skills in French, Mandarin and Spanish [Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"strong-bonds\">‘Strong bonds’</h2><p>For the schools themselves, the losses can be devastating. Every state in the US has reported teacher shortages to the federal government.</p><p>But advocates say the high stress and low pay of education make teachers difficult to recruit and keep.</p><p>That leads some states to look abroad for education workers. In North Carolina, for example, 1,063 foreign nationals worked full-time as grade-school teachers on temporary J-1 visas during the 2023-2024 school year.</p><p>The top destinations for such recruits were all southern states: North Carolina was followed by Florida with 996 teachers on J-1 visas, and Texas with 761.</p><p>But Echevarria said some of the biggest impacts of the deportation drive are felt by the students themselves.</p><p>“Our students develop strong bonds with their teachers, and all of a sudden, overnight, they lost their teachers,” said Echevarría.</p><p>“Their number one superpower”, he added, “is their ability to empathise and to create strong, effective bonds with people from any background”.</p><p>But when those bonds are broken, there can be mental health consequences and setbacks for educational achievement, particularly among younger children.</p><p>A 2024 study published by the American Educational Research Association found that, when teachers leave midyear, children’s language development takes a measurable hit.</p><p>In other words, the loss of a familiar teacher — someone who knows their routines, strengths and fears — can quietly stall a child’s progress. The consequences extend to a child’s sense of self and stability.</p><h2 id=\"mental-health-consequences\">Mental health consequences</h2><p>For parents like Michelle Howell, whose child attends CommuniKids, the loss of teachers has also made the classroom environment feel fragile.</p><p>“The teachers there aren’t just teachers for these young kids,” Howell said of CommuniKids. “They’re like extended family.</p><p>“They hug them, they hold them, they do the things a parent would do. When those people disappear, it’s not just hard for the kids. It’s hard for everyone.”</p><p>Howell, who is Chinese American, said the sudden disappearances reminded her of her own family’s history.</p><p>“I used to read about things like this happening in China, the place my family left to find safety,” she said. “It’s very disturbing to know that what we ran from back then is our reality now. People disappear.”</p><p>School psychologist Maria C, who asked to remain anonymous to protect her work in the Texas public school system, has noticed the children she works with struggling with instability caused by the deportation push.</p><p>The disappearance of a loved one or mentor — say, a favourite teacher — could flood a child’s body with cortisol, the hormone meant to protect them in moments of danger, she explained.</p><p>But when that stress becomes chronic, the same hormone starts to hurt more than it helps. It interferes with memory, attention and emotional regulation.</p><p>“For some, it looks like anxiety. For others, it’s depression or sudden outbursts,” Maria said. “They’re in fight-or-flight mode all day.”</p><p>She added that selective mutism, an anxiety disorder, is on the rise among the children she sees, who range in age from five to 12.</p><p>“It used to be rare, maybe one case per school,” she said. “Now I see it constantly. It’s a quiet symptom of fear.”</p><h2 id=\"preparing-for-the-worst\">Preparing for the worst</h2><p>Back at CommuniKids, Echevarría explained that he and other staff members have put together contingency plans, just in case immigration enforcement arrives at the pre-school.</p><p>The aim, he said, is to make both employees and students feel safer coming to class.</p><p>“We put those steps in writing because we wanted our staff to know they’re not alone,” he said. “We have attorneys on call. We’re partners with local police. But above all, our job is to protect our children.”</p><p>But as an added precaution, teachers are advised to carry their passports or work permits with them.</p><p>Even Echevarría, a US citizen born in Virginia, said he carries his passport wherever he goes. The fear of deportation has a way of lingering.</p><p>“I’m bilingual and of Hispanic descent,” he said. “Given how things are, I want to be able to prove I’m a citizen if anyone ever questions it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
