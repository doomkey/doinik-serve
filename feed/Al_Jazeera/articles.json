In reality, it was a major military operation in response to Indonesia’s unilateral declaration of independence in August 1945. This two-part series reveals how far the Dutch government went in “selling” the war as a domestic affair aimed at restoring peace in what it called the Dutch East Indies. The series exposes how propaganda, selective media coverage and historical omission shaped the Dutch collective memory. A wide range of interviewees explain the complex relationships in the former colony and provide a global context. International pressure eventually forced the Dutch government to give up its colonial war, but its carefully orchestrated disinformation campaign still hangs over the public debate in the Netherlands today. This is about how history is written, rewritten and often manipulated to serve powerful vested interests.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Others say the opposite.</p><p>Every month, the federal Bureau of Labour Statistics publishes the consumer price index, which measures price changes for goods and services, including food, apparel, gasoline and housing. The report is used to assess economic stability and inform policy decisions.</p><p>Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida celebrated the July report on the day of its release.</p><p>“Another month of inflation coming in lighter than expected. That’s GREAT NEWS for Florida families, and another reminder to trust in Pres. Trump!” Scott posted on August 12 on X, alongside a short Fox Business clip about energy and gas price decreases.</p><p>US Representative Kathy Castor, a Democrat from Florida, had a different take.</p><p>“Trump is raising your grocery bill to line the wallets of his billionaire friends. Nothing great about this for American families across the country,” Castor wrote in an August 12 X post that included a link to a CBS News story that said in its headline that the index rose in July by 2.7 percent on an annual basis.</p><p>Economists told PolitiFact this muddled framing isn’t new, and people from different political tribes use varying metrics to reinforce their views. They said the full picture on the economy’s health and trajectory needs more time to come into focus.</p><p>Overall, the report’s numbers are “another dose of modest bad news,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the centre-right policy institute American Action Forum. “It’s not dramatic yet, it’s not a crisis, but it’s not positive.”</p><p>Trump’s tariffs, widely watched to see how they affect consumer prices and inflation, are still new and some <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/trumps-higher-tariffs-take-effect-on-imports-from-dozens-of-countries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just went into effect</a> in August.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Since at least 2021, the CPI reports have become a partisan battleground with both sides cherry picking the data to best support their argument,” said Jason Furman, an economist and professor at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government who previously served as an economic adviser to former President Barack Obama. “And there is so much data in the CPI report that there is always some way to slice and dice it to support just about any view.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>The CPI report and its meaning</strong></h2><p>For July, <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/12/consumer-prices-increase-in-july-amid-tariff-driven-economic-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPI</a> increased 0.2 percent compared with the previous month and 2.7 percent from a year ago. That’s slightly cooler than the 2.8 percent rise economists had forecast, thanks to declines in gasoline and energy prices.</p><p>Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the 2.7 percent 12-month rise in consumer prices for all items is a “bit lower than it was at the start of 2025,” to Trump’s advantage. But the number is also a bit higher than it was from March to July, he said, an advantage for Trump’s critics.</p><p>A separate measure, core inflation – which excludes food and energy because they are considered volatile measures prone to large, rapid fluctuations – increased 0.3 percent for July and 3.1 percent from a year ago. This is the first time annual core inflation, which officials use to monitor underlying, longer-term inflation trends, has risen above 3 percent in several months. This outpaces Federal Reserve projections before the 2024 election, which projected 2.2 percent median core inflation for 2025.</p><p>“Economists tend to focus on the core because it is less erratic than food and energy prices,” said Dean Baker, cofounder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Food and energy prices are very important, but big changes in either direction tend to be reversed. Therefore, it is often more useful if we are looking for future trends to look at the core index.”</p><p>Despite the uptick, the report was mild enough for investors, as US stocks closed near a record high on August 12. The stock market appears, for now, to be focusing on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, given concerns about a cooling labour market. Central bank officials, to Trump’s disapproval, have held rates steady in 2025 as they wait to see tariffs’ effects on the economy.</p><p>The July data comes amid a Bureau of Labor Statistics shake-up. After the agency’s downward revision of May and June employment data, Trump <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/1/trump-fires-official-overseeing-jobs-data-after-dismal-employment-numbers\">fired</a> bureau Commissioner <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/4/banana-republic-trump-puts-credibility-of-us-economic-data-on-the-line\">Erika McEntarfer</a>, accusing her of political bias. Trump nominated<a href=\"/economy/2025/8/13/trump-nominee-to-lead-labour-statistics-agency-faces-wave-of-criticism\"> E J Antoni</a>, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has criticised the bureau, as the agency’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/12/trump-names-conservative-economist-to-lead-labour-statistics-agency\">new commissioner</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-long-and-winding-road-of-trump-s-tariffs\"><strong>The long and winding road of Trump’s tariffs</strong></h2><p>As the Trump administration highlights the collection of nearly $130bn from the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/trump-sets-new-tariffs-on-dozens-of-countries-exports\">new tariffs</a> so far, many economists expect that businesses will begin passing on the additional costs to US customers.</p><p>Goldman Sachs estimated in an analysis shared with Bloomberg that US companies have so far absorbed the bulk of tariff costs – about two-thirds of the levies – while consumers absorbed about 22 percent of the costs through June.</p><p>But Goldman Sachs said it expects the consumer share of the costs to soar to 67 percent by October if the tariffs follow previous patterns of how import levies affected prices.</p><p>Trump wrote in an August 12 Truth Social post that Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon should replace its economist. “It has been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury’s coffers,” Trump wrote.</p><p>Some US companies have avoided passing along higher prices by stockpiling goods ahead of the tariffs’ implementation. Others have absorbed costs to avoid losing customers or are holding off in hopes that <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-about-legality-of-trump-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">courts</a> nix the tariffs.</p><p>“That’s just businesses making business decisions,” said Holtz-Eakin, from the American Action Forum. “But there will be a point if the tariffs stay in place at the current levels, where that just won’t be feasible any more.”</p><p>Many studies of past tariffs have found that they harm the economy and raise consumer prices.</p><p>For now, however, experts agreed that the <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/what-has-been-the-impact-of-trumps-tariffs-so-far\">US economy</a> is in a wait-and-see moment.</p><p>Burtless, from Brookings, believes that the effects of tariffs on consumer prices are modest so far, and that price increases across different categories of goods and services appear “inconsistent with the idea that tariffs are the main driver of overall inflation”.</p><p>“That may turn out to be the case in the future,” he said, “but not yet.”</p><p>Holtz-Eakin also warned about putting too much stock in a single report.</p><p>“Never believe one month’s data,” he said. “That’s a rule of life if you’re doing policy work.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

So there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” the US president said.</p><p>Trump and Putin also refused to take questions.</p><p>As a result, the summit ended with “nothing concrete”, Kucherenko said, as Putin said the “root causes” of the war should be addressed before any ceasefire or real steps towards a peace settlement are made.</p><p>“In order to make the [future peace] settlement lasting and long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict, and we’ve said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia,” Putin said.</p><p>“Root causes” is Putin’s code for rejecting Ukraine’s existence outside Moscow’s political shadow and denying its very sovereignty.</p><h2 id=\"the-china-angle\">The China angle</h2><p>However, the talks were not a total triumph for Putin, another Ukrainian observer said.</p><p>They lasted for less than three hours instead of the seven that Russian officials had announced, and there was no bread broken over a joint lunch.</p><p>And what was discussed behind closed doors went far beyond the war.</p><p>“Russia works through <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/15/can-putin-sway-trump-with-economic-offers-in-alaska\">economy and geopolitics</a>, offers Trump profit here and now, and also haggles over the topic of containing China,” Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevych told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Based on that, the Kremlin is trying to gain political concessions that could help Russia confirm its ambitions for the status of a geopolitical centre, ” he said.</p><p>“And Ukraine is just a derivative part – an important but derivative one – of these processes,” he said.</p><p>As the White House wants to prevent the <a href=\"/features/2025/3/14/is-trump-trying-to-pull-putin-away-from-china-and-can-it-work\">fusion of Moscow’s and Beijing’s interests</a>, Trump finds it beneficial to negotiate business projects and political interactions with Moscow, Tyshkevych said.</p><p>“As a result, the United States is not interested in a total defeat and a crisis for Russia. Alas for us,” he said.</p><p>However, both Washington and Beijing wouldn’t agree with boosting Moscow’s geopolitical role to the status of a third global power, so the White House only “partially understands” Putin’s ambitions, he said.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>For Ukraine, it all means more hostilities and attacks by Russian drones and missiles – while Moscow would boost mobilisation of men of fighting age, he said.</p><p>One of Ukraine’s pre-eminent military analysts, meanwhile, is pessimistic about the summit’s outcomes.</p><p>The very fact of a face-to-face with Trump on American soil means Putin was “legitimised” and raised from the role of a political pariah, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of the Ukrainian military’s General Staff, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He was legitimised in an absolutely unacceptable way” while being an “international evil man who should be held responsible for his actions”, Romanenko said.</p><p>“Yet again, Trump didn’t fulfil his promises about sanctions [on Russia], didn’t reach a position on a ceasefire,” he said.</p><p>Ukraine, therefore, will have to continue its “complicated fight until Trump grows his willpower and political will”, the general said.</p><p>Russia will accelerate its attempts to break through Ukraine’s defence lines in the east and will resume its devastating air strikes with drones and missiles, he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities will need to make strategic decisions to start a “full and just” mobilisation of men of fighting age and focus the economy on military needs, Romanenko said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Spanish flu claimed the lives of 50 million people – more than eight times the number of COVID-19 deaths.</p><p>This was when Vick’s VapoRub sales began to soar.</p><p>“Its closest rival was Ely’s Creme Balm … something of a copycat product but doesn’t seem to have had the same cachet,” explained Catharine Arnold, author of the book Pandemic 1918.</p><p>She added that there were other remedies for respiratory ailments, including coughs, colds and the flu, such as Hale’s Honey of Horehound and Tar. Some products did not stand the test of time, such as “vaporisers”, similar to modern nebulisers, and throat lozenges such as Formamint. It contained the chemical formaldehyde, which is <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jhrm-12-2020-0058/full/html\">toxic</a> in large amounts.</p><p>However, a marketing campaign led by Smith took the Vicks brand onto the global stage.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, the company produced a series of six ads. Rather than solely promote Vick’s VapoRub, the series focused on raising awareness about the Spanish flu and included information about symptoms, treatment and tips to avoid getting sick. It urged people not to panic and conveyed that the brand cared about people’s wellbeing at a bleak time. The flu was just another variation of an influenza that strikes every century and is caused by germs that attack the nose, throat and bronchial tubes, the ads said. Vick’s VapoRub would “throw off the grippe germs” and make it easier to breathe, they said.</p><p>Years later, the accuracy of this content came under criticism. Still, “at the time, this advertisement must have seemed reassuring, telling readers it was just the same old flu, only, of course, it wasn’t,” Arnold said.</p><p>“Spanish flu was an atypical autoimmune virus which attacked the youngest and fittest and caused unusual reactions, such as violent haemorrhaging and the notorious heliotrope cyanosis when people’s skin turned blue.”</p><p>However, the advice in the advertisements to rest and stay in bed was “sensible”, she added, because the virus was spread through human contact.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3843381\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3843381\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3843381\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP21260828293021-1752765237.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C507&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - In this November 1918 photo made available by the Library of Congress, a nurse takes the pulse of a patient in the influenza ward of the Walter Reed hospital in Washington.

Supplies expected to last four months had run out in three weeks.</p><p>Newspaper notices published at that time showed the company had received orders for 1.75 million VapoRub jars in a single week, and the daily turnover of the business was about $186,492. The jars came in <a href=\"https://exhibits.lib.unc.edu/exhibits/show/going-viral/item/5528\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three sizes</a> costing 30 cents, 60 cents and $1.20.</p><p>“Big shipments are en route to jobbers [wholesalers] by freight and express. Until these arrive, there may be a temporary shortage. All deals postponed. Buy in small lots only,” one notice read.</p><p>The company informed the public that it was working day and night to catch up with demand. The orders received were twice the company’s daily output, and by November 1918, the firm said its factory was running 23.5 hours daily to produce 1.08 million jars weekly.</p><p>The product gained worldwide popularity during the pandemic, and according to company data, VapoRub sales grew from $900,000 to $2.9m from 1918 to 1919.</p><p>Afterwards, Vick Chemical Company continued to market its product in novel ways. It sent millions of free samples to mailboxes and in 1924 published a 15-page advertisement in the form of a children’s book called The Story of Blix and Blee. The story, written in rhyming verses, was about two elves named Blix and Blee who lived in an empty Vicks VapoRub jar beneath an old jujube tree. One night, they rushed to the rescue of a sick child, little Dickie. The elves convinced the child, who was refusing to take the medicine given by his mother, to use Vicks VapoRub to soothe his cough so he could sleep.</p><p>More than 130 years later, Vicks VapoRub is sold in about 70 countries on five continents with more than 3.78 million litres (more than 1 million gallons) of it produced annually. From 2011 to 2016 alone, there were more than a billion units sold worldwide, according to its owner Procter and Gamble.</p><p>For Arnold, Vicks VapoRub is part of an American childhood.</p><p>“Generations of us grew up with that familiar waxy menthol compound, robes and pyjamas redolent of Vicks during flu season,” she said. “That familiar blue and green label is as much of an American cultural icon as Coca-Cola or Campbell’s soup.”</p><p><em>This article is part of Ordinary Items, Extraordinary Stories, a series about the surprising stories behind well-known items. </em></p><p><em>Read more from the series:</em></p><p><em><a href=\"/features/2025/7/26/how-the-inventor-of-the-bouncy-castle-saved-lives\">How the inventor of the bouncy castle saved lives</a></em></p><p><em><a href=\"/features/2025/8/2/how-a-popular-peruvian-soft-drink-went-toe-to-toe-with-coca-cola\">How a popular Peruvian soft drink went ‘toe-to-toe’ with Coca-Cola</a></em></p><p><em><a href=\"/features/2025/8/9/how-a-drowning-victim-became-a-lifesaving-icon\">How a drowning victim became a lifesaving icon</a></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The general, in apartheid-era South Africa, served in the army wing of the African National Congress (ANC), which started as a liberation movement, and commanded a parliamentary majority until 2024.</p><p>Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya, at a press briefing, said the general’s decision to visit Iran was itself badly timed.</p><p>“At this period of heightened geopolitical tensions and conflict in the Middle East, one can say the visit was ill-advised, and more so, the general should have been a lot more circumspect with the comments he makes.”</p><p>He added, “We are in the delicate process of resetting political relations with the US, but more importantly, balancing the trade relationship in such a manner that the trade relationship is mutually beneficial.”</p><p>Similarly, the Ministry of International Relations and the Defence Ministry dissociated the government from the army chief’s alleged comments.</p><p>“It is unfortunate that political and policy statements were reportedly made…The minister of defence and military veterans [Matsie Angelina Motshekga] will be engaging with General Maphwanya on his return,” a statement by the Defence Ministry on Wednesday read.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, one of the four parties that form the South African coalition government, is calling for the army chief to be tried in a military court on grounds of “gross misconduct and a flagrant breach of the SANDF [South African National Defence Force] Code of Conduct.”</p><p>“According to Iranian state media, General Maphwanya went far beyond his constitutional and professional mandate, pledging ‘common goals’ with Iran, endorsing its stance on Gaza, and calling for deeper strategic alignment,” the DA said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>“Such political statements are explicitly prohibited for serving officers, violate the SANDF’s duty of political neutrality, and undermine the constitutional principle of civilian control over the military,” the party added.</p><p>The US and South Africa’s relations are at their lowest in decades, making this a particularly sensitive time, analysts say, as it follows June’s 12-day war between Iran and the US-Israel coalition.</p><p>President Trump slapped a 30 percent tariff on South African goods entering the US as part of his wide-ranging reciprocal <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/how-are-countries-and-markets-reacting-to-trump-tariffs\">tariff wars</a> in April. The US is a major destination for South African goods such as cars, precious metals and wine.</p><p>Trump’s main gripes with Pretoria include South Africa instigating a genocide case against Israel, the US’s ally, at the International Court of Justice, amid the ongoing war in Gaza. He earlier accused South Africa of strengthening ties with Iran.</p><p>Trump has also <a href=\"/features/2025/2/21/are-white-afrikaners-at-risk-in-south-africa-not-really-most-say\">wrongly claimed</a> that white South Africans are being persecuted in the country under the majority Black leadership of the ANC, the country’s main political party to which President Ramaphosa belongs. He also claims South Africa is <a href=\"/news/2025/2/3/south-africa-rejects-trumps-accusations-over-expropriation-act\">confiscating land</a> belonging to whites.</p><p>White South Africans are a wealthy minority and largely descendants of Dutch settlers. Afrikaner governments controlled the country under the racist apartheid system until 1990.</p><p>South African wealth, particularly land, continues to be controlled disproportionately by the country’s white population. In recent times, fringe, extremist Afrikaner groups claiming that whites are being targeted by Black people have emerged, pointing to cases of white farmers being attacked by criminals on their farmland.</p><p>Elon Musk, Trump’s one-time adviser before their public fallout in June, had also made claims of white persecution and claimed that the South African government’s business laws were blocking his internet company from operating in the country.</p><p>He was referring to laws requiring that foreign businesses be partly owned by Blacks or other historically disadvantaged groups, such as people living with disabilities.</p><p>The South African government denied Musk’s accusations.</p><p>In early May, Trump’s government admitted 59 white “refugees” in a resettlement programme meant to protect them.</p><p>Previously, the US, under former President Joe Biden, was at loggerheads with South Africa <a href=\"/news/2025/3/19/in-south-africa-russias-anti-colonial-narrative-sways-public-opinion\">over its close ties with Russia</a> and its vocal criticism of Israel.</p><p>The latest incident echoes a 2022 scandal when a sanctioned Russian cargo ship called the Lady R docked at Simon’s Town Naval Base in the Western Cape, said analyst Chris Vandome of think tank Chatham House.

The delegation also agreed to a review of the country’s business ownership laws.</p><p>However, Trump’s 30 percent tariffs went into effect last week. Analysts say it could put up to 30,000 South African jobs at risk, particularly in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ramaphosa’s government promised to take further action to ease the burden on manufacturers and exporters. On Tuesday, Trade Minister Parks Tau told reporters that South Africa has submitted a revised proposal to Washington, without giving details.</p><p>General Maphwanya’s pronouncements this week, therefore, “couldn’t have come at a worse time” for South African diplomatic ties with the US, security analyst Jakkie Cilliers of the International Security Institute said, speaking to South African state TV, SABC.</p><p>“For the chief of the national defence force to pronounce so clearly and so unequivocally at this time is remarkably politically sensitive,” Cilliers said, adding that the general could be asked to resign upon his return.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-general-maphwanya-said\">What has General Maphwanya said?</h2><p>Maphwanya, who the presidency said has returned to the country, has not put out public statements on the controversy.

But there was a more subdued atmosphere a few hours later as Trump and Putin departed on their respective planes – with no clear breakthrough on the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Here are some key takeaways from their meeting:</p><h2 id=\"no-deal-until-there-s-a-deal\">‘No deal until there’s a deal’</h2><p>While the meeting was anticipated to take about seven hours, it wrapped up in less than three. Trump and Putin addressed a gathering of journalists after the talks with relatively brief pre-prepared statements. Neither leader took any questions.</p><p>Putin said his country is committed to ending the war, but the conflict’s “primary causes” must be eliminated for an agreement to be long-lasting.</p><p>Putin also warned Ukraine and the European Union against throwing a “wrench in the works” and cautioned against attempts to use “backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress”.</p><p>A relatively subdued Trump praised the “extremely productive meeting”, in which he said “many points were agreed to”. He said there is a “very good chance of getting there” – referring to a ceasefire – but conceded that there remain sticking points with Moscow, including at least one “significant” one.</p><p>He cautioned that it’s “ultimately up to them” – referring to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he said.</p><p>And there was none by the time Trump and Putin left Alaska.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-pr-coup-for-putin\">A PR coup for Putin</h2><p>The Russian leader has become an increasingly maligned and isolated figure in the West since waging war on Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But on Friday, that ended, with a red carpet welcome, a flypast by US fighter jets and warm applause from Trump.</p><p>Putin himself seemed pleased, grinning out the window as he drove off the tarmac with Trump in the presidential Cadillac limousine known as “The Beast”.</p><p>“For three years they [Western media] have been talking about Russia’s isolation, and today they saw the red carpet that greeted the Russian president in the United States,” Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gloated after the summit, on Telegram.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"talking-business\">Talking business</h2><p>Before the meeting, it was widely anticipated that Putin would attempt to dilute peace talks with talk of bilateral trade and cooperation.</p><p>Trump had asserted that there would be no discussion of business with Putin until the pair had made substantive progress on bringing about a ceasefire in Ukraine.</p><p>This plan, however, seems to have been derailed somewhat, with the Russian president saying in his post-meeting statement that the pair discussed their collaboration in the areas of tech and space.</p><p>“It’s clear that US and Russian investment and business cooperation has tremendous potential. Russia and the US can offer each other so much. In trade, digital, high-tech and in space exploration, [and] we see that Arctic cooperation is also very possible,” he told reporters.</p><p>Russia has previously tried to pitch its vast <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/15/can-putin-sway-trump-with-economic-offers-in-alaska\">reserves of rare earth minerals</a> – critical for several cutting edge sectors – to the US to broker a breakthrough.</p><h2 id=\"next-up-another-meeting\">Next up: Another meeting – and pressure on Ukraine</h2><p>As Trump thanked Putin for his time, he said he hoped they would meet again soon. Putin quickly responded by saying, in English with a laugh, “Next time, in Moscow”.</p><p>“I’ll get a little heat on that one, but I could see it possibly happening,” he said in response.</p><p>Trump has previously asserted that he hopes to host a trilateral meeting on ending the war in Ukraine very soon, this time attended by Ukraine’s Zelenskyy, too. In Alaska, the US leader said he would now call NATO officials and Zelenskyy to discuss the meeting.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity after the meeting, Trump was asked how he rated the summit on a scale of 10. He described the meet as a “10 out of 10”.</p><p>“We got along great,” he said.</p><p>Then, he emphasised the importance of the Ukrainian leader agreeing to a deal.</p><p>“Now, it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done. And I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit. But it’s up to President Zelenskyy,” he said, adding that he’ll attend the next meeting “if they’d like”.</p><p>“Make a deal,” he said, in a message apparently for Zelenskyy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

A couple of big ones that we haven’t quite got there, but we’ve made some headway,” Trump said.</p><p>“So there is no deal until there is a deal,” Trump said, adding that he will now call up NATO as well as President Zelenskyy and others to brief them on the meeting.</p><p>“It’s ultimately up to them,” the president said.</p><p>“Many points were agreed to,” he continued, without providing any details.</p><p>“There are just a very few that are left; some are not that significant, one is probably the most significant,” Trump said without elaborating.</p><p>“But we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”</p><p>Later, in an interview with Fox TV, Trump advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p>“Gotta make a deal. Yeah. Look, Russia is a very big power, and they’re not. They’re great soldiers,” Trump replied when asked about his advice to Zelenskyy.</p><p>The US president added that Zelenskyy and Putin were going to set up a meeting to try to reach a ceasefire. “Now, it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done. And I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit. But it’s up to President Zelenskyy … And if they’d like, I’ll be at that next meeting,” Trump told Fox News’s Sean Hannity after the Alaska meeting.</p><p>In his first public comment after the Alaska talks, Zelenskyy said he supported Trump’s proposal for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the US, and Russia, adding that Kyiv is “ready for constructive cooperation”.</p><p>“Ukraine reaffirms its readiness to work with maximum effort to achieve peace,” the Ukrainian president posted on X.</p><p>Zelenskyy said that he plans to meet the US president in Washington next week after holding a “long and substantive” conversation with Trump. The Ukrainian leader said he spoke to Trump one-on-one and then in a call with other European leaders.</p><p>He reiterated the importance of involving Europe.</p><p>“It is important that Europeans are involved at every stage to ensure reliable security guarantees together with America,” he said. “We also discussed positive signals from the American side regarding participation in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security.”</p><p><span>Earlier, the US president held a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart and subsequently spoke to several European and NATO leaders after the talks with Putin, the White House said.</span></p><p>European leaders have praised Trump’s effort in ending the war in Ukraine after a phone conversation with the US president following the Alaska summit. In a statement, EU leaders, including the French president and German chancellor, outlined key points in stopping the conflict.</p><p>They said: “Ukraine must have ironclad security guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p><p>Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine‘s pathway to the EU and NATO, the statemen said. “It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"next-time-in-moscow\">‘Next time, in Moscow’</h2><p>Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Anchorage, Alaska, said President Trump is likely to come in for criticism for a summit that “all became much ado about nothing”.</p><p>“The only achievements that were actually made was that the Russian president has been able to continue his war, which we know is now a war of attrition and which each day favours the Russian side,” Halkett said.</p><p>“He has bought time,” she said.</p><p>Also reporting from the summit, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor, James Bays, said Ukraine’s European allies – who had been pushing for concrete steps to come out of the meeting, such as a ceasefire – will likely see the meeting as “a big win for President Putin”.</p><p>“And it does beg all sorts of questions about where the diplomacy on Ukraine goes,” Bays said.</p><p>Melinda Haring, senior fellow from the Atlantic Council Eurasia Center, said that expectations were low.</p><p>“In some senses, I think Kyiv will wake up in the morning and European capitals will wake up and be relieved that you know Donald Trump did not try or agree to some kind of land swap,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“That was the worst-case scenario … that major foreign policy decisions over Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would be made without Ukraine.”</p><p>Trump ended his remarks at the news conference on Friday by telling Putin, “I’d like to thank you very much, and we’ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon.”</p><p>To which Putin quickly chipped back: “Next time, in Moscow.”</p><p>Trump then responded, saying that he might “get a little heat on that one” but that he could “possibly see it happening”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
