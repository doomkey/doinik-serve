And particularly if the regime feels that its back is up against the wall, it could lash out in really horrific ways against American forces in the region, against allies.”</p><p>Since the start of the year, as a <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/iran-in-limbo-whats-next-for-country-under-internet-blackout\">wave of antigovernment demonstrations</a> sweep Iran, Trump has threatened to intervene militarily against the country if the authorities kill protesters.</p><p>“If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/trump-says-any-country-doing-business-with-iran-will-face-25-percent-tariff\">Trump wrote</a> in a social media post on January 2.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, he repeated that threat several times, and he called on protesters to take over state institutions, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/14/trump-says-help-is-on-the-way-for-iran-protesters\">promising them</a> that “help is on the way”.</p><p>But the government has led a deadly crackdown, and the death toll has risen into the thousands, according to activist groups. As Iranian authorities imposed a total internet blackout on the country, Trump appeared to dial back his position.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump presented <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/irans-fm-says-protests-became-bloody-to-give-trump-intervention-excuse\">Tehran’s version</a> of the events – that armed demonstrators were targeting security forces.</p><p>“They [Iranian officials] said people were shooting at them with guns, and they were shooting back,” Trump said. “And you know, it’s one of those things, but they told me that there will be no executions, and so I hope that’s true.”</p><p>Two days later, Trump conveyed his “respect” and gratitude to Iran for cancelling what he said were 800 executions scheduled for Thursday.</p><h2 id=\"sugar-high-from-venezuela\">‘Sugar high from Venezuela’</h2><p>Some reports also suggest that the protest movement appears to be receding for now, although it is difficult to verify the situation on the ground with Iranians unable to access the internet.</p><p>But experts warn the crisis is not over, and the situation could change quickly. Demonstrations may ignite again, and Trump has not taken the military option <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-says-all-options-on-the-table-if-iran-protest-killings-continue\">off the table</a>.</p><p>Several US media outlets reported on Friday that the Pentagon is starting to surge military assets to the Middle East, including an aircraft carrier strike group.</p><p>Trump has shown willingness to deploy the brute force of the US military to advance his policy goals.</p><p>He has bragged about the killing of ISIL (ISIS) leader <a href=\"/news/2019/10/27/us-targeted-isil-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-us-officials\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> in 2019, the Soleimani assassination and the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities last year. Just this month, he ordered the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>But experts say Trump’s chances of a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/analysis-why-a-quick-and-clean-us-attack-on-iran-wont-be-easy\">swift operational victory</a> in Iran are slim.</p><p>“This is not Venezuela,” Slavin said of Iran.</p><p>“This is not one and done, and given all the other crises, many of them self-inflicted, that he is dealing with – Venezuela, this ridiculous effort to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-may-tariff-countries-that-dont-go-along-with-his-greenland-plan\">take over Greenland</a> – does he really want a massive crisis in the Middle East after having campaigned against this sort of adventure?”</p><p>Only two months ago, the Trump administration released a National Security Strategy outlining a push to shift foreign policy resources away from <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">the Middle East</a>. It said that the past considerations that made the region so important to the US – namely, energy production and widespread conflict – “no longer hold”.</p><p>The document also asserted Trump’s commitment to non-interventionism.</p><p>“We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world without imposing on them democratic or other social change that differs widely from their traditions and histories,” it read.</p><p>However, given the Iranian government’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/iran-says-3000-people-arrested-as-antigovernment-protests-subside\">brutal crackdown</a> on protests, Trump may have “cornered himself into being a humanitarian interventionist”, according to Trita Parsi, the executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a think tank focused on diplomacy.</p><p>“He may be on a sugar high from Venezuela, but that’s not replicable in Iran in that same manner, and it would require tremendous amount of military force,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-iran-may-respond\">How Iran may respond</h2><p>After the June 2025 strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, Tehran’s response was relatively restrained. Iranian forces fired a volley of missiles at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which hosts US troops, in an attack that caused no casualties.</p><p>But Parsi said Iranian authorities have come to the conclusion that they will no longer tolerate attacks to avoid a major confrontation with Washington.</p><p>“Even though it’s going to be very bad for them, of course, the metric of success for Trump and the metric of success for Iran may be very different,” he said.</p><p>“Trump may need to take down the entire state. The Iranians cannot win the war, but they don’t have to. They just need to make sure that they destroy Trump’s presidency before they lose a protracted war that goes on for some weeks. Oil prices shooting up, inflation going up worldwide, including in the United States, could be sufficient to destroy Trump’s presidency.”</p><p>Naysan Rafati, a senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, said Iranian officials were willing to tolerate both the <a href=\"/news/2020/7/7/us-killing-of-irans-qassem-soleimani-unlawful-un-expert\">Soleimani assassination</a> and the strikes on nuclear facilities because of the limited nature of the attacks.</p><p>But the regime views the antigovernment protests as an existential threat, and even a limited US attack may prompt a stronger response from Tehran.</p><p>“If the Iranians are convinced that it’s a start of a wider campaign or that its effect on the ground will be sufficiently galvanising to spark another surge in the protests, then their desperate position could lead to reckless decisions,” Rafati told Al Jazeera.</p><p>If Trump’s goal were to collapse the regime, Rafati believes that Washington would ideally rely on a “synergy” of protesters reaching a critical mass and Iranians acting as boots on the ground, supported by a US air campaign.</p><p>But he noted that Trump is more inclined to pursue quick and decisive military operations.</p><p>“And here you get into potential scenarios where the ends are a little bit muddied,” Rafati said.</p><p>“Like, what happens if you end up in a scenario of US action, Iranian retaliation and then further US response – and then broadening of the campaign?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-struggling\">Iran struggling</h2><p>Despite the risks associated with military action with Iran, Tehran’s foes, including many US officials in Trump’s orbit, see a historic opportunity to take down the Iranian system.</p><p>Since the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1979, Iran has endured enormous hardships and survived wars, sanctions and internal unrest.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2020/9/22/legacy-of-iran-iraq-war-still-reverberates-40-years-later\">Iran-Iraq war</a> in the 1980s lasted eight years and killed hundreds of thousands of people. But the regime survived it, as it has withstood several waves of protests, economic crises and feuds within the ruling class.</p><p>But the Islamic Republic is currently living through the most challenging period in its 47-year history, analysts say.</p><p>The network of regional allies that Tehran fostered over decades – known as the “axis of the resistance” – has all but crumbled.</p><p>Hamas and Hezbollah have been severely weakened by Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and its devastating 2024 campaign in Lebanon. Former President Bashar al-Assad in Syria fell to armed opposition fighters hostile to Tehran who have since taken power.</p><p>Even in Venezuela, Iran lost one of its last standing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/trumps-abduction-of-maduro-escalates-concerns-over-potential-war-with-iran\">allies in Maduro</a> after his detention.</p><p>Militarily, Iran’s ability to deter attacks has been severely degraded after Israel took out the country’s air defences and claimed total control of the country’s skies in June of last year.</p><p>Tehran’s nuclear programme was also severely damaged by the US strikes, and Iran is no longer enriching uranium, although it continues to emphasise its right to enrichment.</p><p>These external challenges have been compounded by a crushing economic downfall after years of sanctions. The Iranian currency, the rial, has lost more than 90 percent of its value, reaching an all-time low.</p><p>And the protests, which have been met by a harsh security response, now represent a legitimacy crisis for the government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The ferociousness with which the state has responded in the last two weeks underscores their sense of deep vulnerability, both in terms of their internal political legitimacy but also their strategic position in the region and vis-a-vis the US,” said Rafati.</p><p>For war hawks in Washington, Iran’s current vulnerability is a chance to “vanquish the great bete noir of US regional policy for the past 47 years”, Rafati added.</p><h2 id=\"diplomacy-chances\">Diplomacy chances</h2><p>US Senator Lindsey Graham, who is close to Trump, has been making the case that Iran is ripe for <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/trump-poses-with-make-iran-great-again-hat-after-maduro-abduction\">regime change</a>, and he travelled to Israel this week to advance the push for war.</p><p>The interventionist voices around Trump, however, are balanced by geopolitical dynamics: The US’s Gulf allies, wary of instability and regional violence, have <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">cautioned against</a> striking Iran.</p><p>Internally, Trump must also face American voters ahead of the critical 2026 midterm elections, including large segments of his “America First” base who are largely opposed to war after the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>Parsi noted that, even though the abduction of Maduro came at a minimal cost to the US, opinion polls suggest that the American public is not pleased with the military intervention in Venezuela.</p><p>“I don’t think his base is excited about this at all,” Parsi said.</p><p>“I think the base wonders why he is still so focused on foreign policy issues instead of focusing on domestic issues that they believe are much more important for their concerns.”</p><p>So is diplomacy still possible?</p><p>On Thursday, Trump’s special envoy <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">Steve Witkoff</a> said he hopes that there is a diplomatic resolution.</p><p>He outlined a list of US demands for Iran: giving up on nuclear enrichment, handing over highly enriched uranium, cutting back its missile programme and ending support for “proxies” like Hezbollah.</p><p>“If they want to come back to the league of nations [and] we can solve those four problems diplomatically, then that would be a great resolution. The alternative is a bad one,” Witkoff said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Parsi, however, said the US is asking for capitulation from Iran and moving <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/trump-says-us-would-back-strikes-against-irans-missile-programme\">the goal posts</a>.</p><p>“I don’t see a likelihood of diplomacy succeeding unless there is a profound recalibration of what it is that the US actually seeks to achieve, at least in this scenario,” he said.</p><p>“I’m not particularly optimistic that diplomacy in the manner that the administration currently is envisioning can succeed.”</p><p>But Rafati underscored that Iran is currently already at zero enrichment, but that the country has maintained it has a right to concentrate uranium and bolster its defences.</p><p>“Given that the Iranian position, especially on enrichment, has been fairly consistent [and] its position on missiles has been fairly consistent, it would require a very significant shift in its positions, recognising that its economic and political fortunes are not promising,” he said.</p><p>Iran has remained defiant throughout the ordeal, describing the protests as a US-Israeli plot to spread chaos in the country. Iranian officials have pointed to Israeli media reports that foreign agents are arming demonstrators to kill security forces and attack public institutions.</p><p>Tehran has also promised strong retaliation against any external attack.</p><p>But Slavin said it is possible that Iran could compromise on <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-says-its-strikes-degraded-irans-nuclear-programme-by-one-to-two-years\">the nuclear issue</a> and give up its enriched uranium for sanction relief.</p><p>“That would be very controversial. A lot of people would accuse Trump of selling out the protesters, but I could imagine that he might take some sort of deal like that and call it a big victory,” she told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

seeking to extend his nearly four decades in power, saying ahead of this week’s election that he expected to secure 80 percent support.</p><p>Museveni was comfortably leading as votes were counted on Friday, with the Electoral Commission saying he had secured 73.7 percent support to Wine’s 22.7 percent, with close to 81 percent of votes counted.</p><p>Final results were due around 4pm local time in Kampala (13:00 GMT) on Saturday.</p><p>After a campaign marred by clashes at opposition rallies and the arrests of opposition supporters, <a

opposition supporters who had gathered at his home to wait for the election results to come in. <span>The opposition lawmaker said 10 people were killed.</span></p><p>“After killing them, the military

Biden, over his four-year term, announced 4,245 acts of clemency, the most of any president in modern history.</p><p>But news of Vazquez’s pardon stirred dissent among Puerto Rico’s political opposition, including Pablo Jose Hernandez Rivera, who represents the island territory in the US House of Representatives.</p><p>“Impunity protects and promotes corruption,” Hernandez <a href=\"https://x.com/RepPabloJose/status/2012245345837740522\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>“The pardon granted to former governor Wanda Vazquez weakens public integrity, erodes trust in the justice system, and offends those of us who believe in honest government.”</p><p>Puerto Rico, as a territory, only has non-voting representation in the US Congress, and Trump has had a tumultuous relationship with the island.</p><p>In August, Trump removed the five Democratic members of Puerto Rico’s federal control board, which governs the island’s finances. And during his 2024 re-election campaign, Trump held a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York that featured a politician who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage”.</p><p>But Trump has sought to protect political allies through his use of pardons, often accusing the US justice system of being unfairly biased against conservatives.</p><p>He has also denounced what he calls the “weaponisation” of the Justice Department under his Democratic predecessors. Trump himself faced four criminal indictments, two on the federal level, during the four years between his two terms.</p><p>Only one state-level indictment, in New York, resulted in a conviction and sentence.</p><p>Vazquez identifies as a Republican, and she is a member of the New Progressive Party, which advocates for US statehood for Puerto Rico.</p><p>She became governor of Puerto Rico after her predecessor, Ricardo Rosello, stepped down in 2019, and she served until January 2021.</p><p>Vazquez was arrested in 2022 after the US Justice Department accused her of participating in an act of corruption while in office, allegedly promising to fire a commissioner in exchange for a campaign contribution.</p><p>The bribery case focused on incidents that happened while she was in office between December 2019 and June 2020.</p><p>At the time, Puerto Rico’s Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions had been investigating a bank owned by the Venezuelan financier Julio Martin Herrera Velutini for suspicious transactions.</p><p>According to prosecutors, Vazquez agreed to call for the commissioner’s resignation in exchange for a promise of financial support in the 2020 gubernatorial election. She ultimately hired an associate of Herrera Velutini to replace the commissioner.</p><p>Herrera Velutini and Mark Rossini, a consultant and former agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), allegedly paid $300,000 to political consultants to boost Vazquez’s 2020 campaign. She went on to lose the primary, though.</p><p>Vazquez at first denied any wrongdoing, but she agreed to a plea deal in August. She was the first former Puerto Rican governor to face federal charges.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It took place on stage at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank known for publishing a policy blueprint for Trump’s second term, known as Project 2025.</p><p>Trump, like Machado, has long had a tense relationship with Maduro, the former bus driver who assumed Venezuela’s presidency in 2013 as the late Hugo Chavez’s hand-picked successor.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"machado-absolutely-grateful\">Machado ‘absolutely grateful’</h2><p>Maduro was a champion of Chavez’s socialist political movement, chavismo, and he also faced widespread criticism for carrying out a campaign of human rights abuses, including the torture and imprisonment of political dissidents.</p><p>Since returning to office, Trump ratcheted up US pressure against Maduro’s government, including through a large-scale military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the bombing of alleged drug-trafficking boats leaving Venezuela.</p><p>But on January 3, Trump’s campaign reached a zenith, as he launched a full-scale military attack on Caracas that resulted in Maduro’s abduction and transport to New York City to face trial.</p><p>Trump described the military offensive as a law enforcement operation, but critics have denounced it as a violation of international law, including the United Nations charter.</p><p>Machado was among the figures who had lobbied for such an intervention to take place, and she used Friday’s appearance to express gratitude for Trump’s actions.</p><p>“As Venezuelans, we are absolutely grateful to President Trump, his team, his administration and the people of the United States because it took a lot of courage to do what he did,” she said.</p><p>“And he did it, yes, on behalf of the American people, but also because he cares for the people of Venezuela, and he told me that yesterday.”</p><p>Trump has previously said that the US will “run” Venezuela and that, if the current government there did not obey his demands, a “second wave” of military action was possible.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-complex-phase-in-venezuela-s-history\">A ‘complex phase’ in Venezuela’s history</h2><p>So far, the Trump administration has avoided discussions of restoring Venezuela’s democracy, and it has declined to provide a timeline for new elections.</p><p>Instead, it has recognised the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former deputy, citing the need for stability in Venezuela.</p><p>Trump’s support for Rodriguez has raised eyebrows, since Maduro’s last two elections were hotly contested. The most recent, in 2024, culminated with the government withholding the vote tallies typically released on election night — and Maduro claiming victory in his pursuit of a third term.</p><p>The opposition coalition, led by Machado, subsequently released documents that appeared to show its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, winning by a landslide.</p><p>On stage at the Heritage Foundation, Machado reiterated her belief that she has a mandate from the Venezuelan people to lead the government.</p><p>“We are facing challenging times ahead. We are prepared to do what it takes as a legitimate government,” she said.</p><p>“Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia and I have been in communication  permanently all these days, and we feel the mandate from the Venezuelan people. That’s why I’m here, and that’s what I conveyed to the president of the United States.”</p><p>But she softened her rhetoric, appearing to accept Trump’s backing of the interim Rodriguez government.</p><p>She also called the democratic transition a “very complex, delicate process” and said the current government would handle the “dirty work” of having to “dismantle” itself.</p><p>“Delcy Rodriguez, yes, she’s a communist. She’s the main ally and representation of the Russian regime, the Chinese, and Iranians,” she said, citing some of Venezuela’s allies under Maduro.</p><p>“But that’s not the Venezuelan people, and that’s not the armed forces as well. So I am profoundly, profoundly confident that we will have an orderly transition. This is a complex phase we are [in] right now. Some of the dirty work is being done by them.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"addressing-migration-and-human-rights\">Addressing migration and human rights</h2><p>Machado, known for her unwavering opposition to the Maduro government, said that the Venezuela that will emerge in the aftermath of his removal will be a country built on “merit”, echoing one of Trump’s frequent talking points.</p><p>She also described a more affordable Venezuela where residents do not have to live on “handouts”.</p><p>“The result of this process will be a society based on these values, a society that is profoundly pro-American,” Machado told reporters at the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>She also addressed recent steps the Rodriguez government had taken to address concerns over Venezuela’s human rights and appease Trump.</p><p>One reporter on Friday asked Machado about Venezuela’s decision to resume accepting deportation flights from the US, where Trump has made the mass deportation of immigrants a central pillar of his second term.</p><p>A plane carrying approximately 199 Venezuelan deportees had arrived at La Guaira airport earlier in the day, marking the first such flight since Maduro’s removal. At moments of tension, Maduro was known to reject such deportation flights.</p><p>“We all know how this regime weaponised migration against several countries, not only the United States,” Machado told the reporter.</p><p>The United Nations estimates that nearly 7.9 million refugees have fled Venezuela in recent years, for reasons including oppression and economic instability.</p><p>Machado argued that restoring Venezuelan democracy would help pave the way for many Venezuelan migrants to return home, thereby helping to address Trump’s concerns about immigration.</p><p>“I think it is clearly in the best interest of the United States, and those that are concerned about migration, to have a transition take place as soon as possible. Because you will see millions coming back home,” Machado said.</p><p>“It’s not a matter of having all economic problems solved. People are willing to go back to be part of the solution,” she added.</p><p>The opposition leader was also dismissive of the Rodriguez government’s announcement that it had released nearly 400 political prisoners, though human rights groups speculate the number is much smaller.</p><p>“The fact that you are not in a prison doesn’t mean that you are free. In Venezuela, they have left the jails, but they cannot speak to the press. They cannot leave the country, and they are still terrified,” Machado said.</p><p>“All torture centres have to be closed. And certainly there have to be guarantees for journalists to speak out and those who have left the country to come back.”</p><p>She added that, if the Rodriguez government respected Venezuela’s constitution, there would no longer be political prisoners at all, and Gonzalez Urrutia would be president.</p><p>“We wouldn’t have a president-elect exiled in Madrid. He would have taken power on January 9, 2024 — sorry, 2025,” she said. “We realise that there’s no rule of law in Venezuela.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"venezuela-is-going-to-be-free\">‘Venezuela is going to be free’</h2><p>Machado has faced criticism in the past for her embrace of far-right figures like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and it remains unclear what role, if any, she will have in Venezuela’s future governance.</p><p>On January 3, the day of the US military operation, Trump appeared dismissive of her prospects, telling reporters, “I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country.”</p><p>But Machado remains popular among the Venezuelan opposition, both in the country and abroad, and her visit to Washington, DC, saw her thronged by supporters, who sought hugs and selfies.</p><p>On Thursday’s visit, she sought to ingratiate herself to Trump by offering him the Nobel Peace Prize she accepted in December, after fleeing Venezuela in secret for fear of arrest.</p><p>She emphasised on Friday her view that a better Venezuela could only be built with Trump’s backing.</p><p>“The only thing I want to assure the Venezuelan people is that Venezuela is going to be free, and that’s going to be achieved with the support of the people of the United States and President Donald Trump of the United States,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But on Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a trade deal in Beijing that would <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/16/canada-china-strike-trade-deals-to-slash-tariffs-on-evs-canola\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allow in up to 49,000 Chinese EVs</a> at a tariff of 6.1 percent on most-favoured-nation terms. That move has prompted alarm in the US that it could help China get a broader foothold in North America even as Washington takes an increasingly hardline on Canadian vehicles and parts.</p><p>US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the limited number of vehicles would not impact US car companies exporting cars to Canada.</p><p>“I don’t expect that to disrupt American supply into Canada,” he said. “Those cars are going to Canada – they’re not coming here.”</p><p>The Canadian Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.</p><p>Greer, in a separate CNBC interview, called Canada’s decision “problematic” and added, “There’s a reason why we don’t sell a lot of Chinese cars in the United States. It’s because we have tariffs to protect American auto workers and Americans from those vehicles.”</p><p>As per the trade agreements announced in Beijing on Friday, Carney said he expects China to lower tariffs on its canola seed by March 1 to a combined rate of about 15 percent, down from 85 percent.</p><p>Greer questioned that agreement. “I think in the long run, they’re not going to like having made that deal,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"cybersecurity-of-vehicles\">Cybersecurity of vehicles</h2><p>Greer said rules adopted in January 2025 on vehicles that are connected to the internet and navigation systems are a significant impediment to Chinese vehicles in the US market.</p><p>“I think it would be hard for them to operate here,” Greer said. “There are rules and regulations in place in America about the cybersecurity of our vehicles and the systems that go into those, so I think it might be hard for the Chinese to comply with those kind of rules.”</p><p>In contrast, President Donald Trump has said he would like Chinese automakers to come to the US to build vehicles.</p><p>However, lawmakers from both major US parties have expressed strong opposition to Chinese vehicles as major US car makers warn China poses a threat to the US car sector.</p><p>Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno, a Republican, said at the event he was opposed to Chinese vehicles coming into the US — and drew applause from the other government officials.</p><p>“As long as I have air in my body, there will not be Chinese vehicles sold the United States of America — period,” Moreno said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Local phone services have been restored but SMS text messages remain blocked.</p><p>Since Tuesday, only outgoing international phone calls have been reconnected. The state continues to send many one-way text messages to people across the country daily, urging them not to fall victim to ploys by “enemies” and to report any suspicious activity.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244866\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244866\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244866\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260115__92RT8FC__v2__HighRes__TopshotIranProtestRights-1768579750.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tehran\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244866\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man stands by the wreckage of a burned bus in Tehran’s Sadeghieh Square on January 15, 2026, following deadly protests across Iran, initially caused by economic grievances [Atta Kenare/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"foreign-elements-blamed\">Foreign ‘elements’ blamed</h2><p>The government has not released official figures for the number of people killed during clashes between protesters and government forces, mostly on the night of January 8 and January 9. The widely cited United States-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (<a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">HRANA</a>) put the death toll at 2,615 on Wednesday this week, although Iran’s government claims that is an exaggeration.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday this week, Iran’s ‍Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/trump-says-he-has-been-told-killing-of-protesters-in-iran-has-stopped\">Araghchi denied</a> that Tehran had any plans to execute protesters. During that interview, he downplayed the death toll being reported.</p><p>“I certainly deny the numbers and figures they have said. It is an exaggeration, it is a misinformation campaign, only to find excuses, only to do another aggression against Iran,” Araghchi said, adding that the number was being exaggerated to involve US President Donald Trump in the conflict.</p><p>While Iranian authorities have confirmed that protesters, including children, women and unarmed civilians, are among those who have died, officials claim “terrorists” and “elements” trained and armed by the US, Israel and their allies are behind all of the mass killings as well as the “riots” that saw government buildings attacked, and public property burned across the country.</p><p>The Iranian authorities have not confirmed the killings of protesters by state forces. Instead, they have conversely claimed that members of the Iranian forces were killed, including by being burned or beheaded.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot independently verify the casualty figures because of the communications blackout.</p><p>At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, and in communications with the UN and international stakeholders, Iranian authorities placed the blame for deaths during the protests on the US and Israel, saying they, in effect, hijacked protests that started peacefully in reaction to a quickly deteriorating economic situation.</p><p>The UN has emphasised that violence must not be used against protesters. At the same time, it has also opposed any form of armed intervention amid <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/trumps-bluffs-why-us-strike-on-iran-remains-real-threat\">persistent concerns</a> that Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/what-are-trumps-military-options-for-an-attack-on-iran\">could attack Iran</a> as he has threatened to do.</p><h2 id=\"no-mercy-for-rioters\">‘No mercy’ for rioters</h2><p>The streets of Tehran and other cities across the country have been relatively quiet in the aftermath of the deadly protests. But many may fear what is to come.</p><p>There is a heavy presence of security forces on the streets, where countless checkpoints and armed patrols have been set up.</p><p>The government has also organised massive counter-demonstrations across the country during the past several days and has held public funerals for the killed security forces in many cities, including Tehran.</p><p>State television has referred to those participating in these displays “the real people of Iran” while Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proclaimed that Iranians participating in state-organised demonstrations “diffused the plot by foreign enemies that was to be implemented by local mercenaries”.</p><p>The judiciary has set up courts and said it will prioritise protest-related cases, with Chief Justice Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei pledging “no mercy” will be shown to “rioters”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244862\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244862\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244862\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260114__92MM9EH__v2__HighRes__TopshotIranProtestRights-1768579588.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iran\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244862\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An Iranian woman holds a portrait of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a funeral of security forces personnel killed in recent protests in Tehran, on January 14, 2026 [Atta Kenare/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"most-deadly-protests-in-years\">Most deadly protests in years</h2><p>Late on Wednesday, Trump said he had received assurances that the Iranian government would not carry out executions of protesters.</p><p>Iranian state media rejected reports by foreign media outlets that a young man had been sentenced to execution for participating in the unrest and could be hanged soon.</p><p>In his first interview with state television early this week to address the people after the protests, President Masoud Pezeshkian chose to focus on condemning violent “terrorists” and engaging in economic reform, making no mention of the fact that the entire country remained gripped by a state-imposed digital blackout.</p><p>The Pezeshkian administration has begun rolling out electronic coupons worth under $7 per person each month for four months to buy essential goods subsidised by the government as rampant inflation continues to erode public purchasing power.</p><p>This is not the first time that Iran has witnessed protests in recent years. People say they are angry about corruption, mismanagement, economic hardship, devaluation of the currency and eroding social freedoms.</p><p>In September 2022, a young woman named Mahsa Amini, aged 22, was arrested in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. She collapsed while in custody and died in hospital a few days later.</p><p>Her death caused national outrage and widespread protests in Iran that lasted for several weeks. The slogan “woman, life, freedom” was chanted in the streets. HRANA reported in October 2022 that 200 people died and about 5,500 people were arrested during those protests.</p><p>But this latest wave of protests, which started with a few shopkeepers in Tehran in December, has been the biggest in recent years and almost certainly the most deadly.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He did not specify a time period.</p><p>That compares with the 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles imposed by the government of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2024, following similar US penalties. In 2023, China exported 41,678 EVs to Canada.</p><p>“This is a return to levels prior to recent trade frictions, but under an agreement that promises much more for Canadians,” Carney told reporters.</p><p>Trudeau justified his tariff on the grounds that there was an unfair global market edge for Chinese manufacturers benefiting from state subsidies, a scenario that threatened domestic producers.</p><p>“For Canada to build its own competitive EV sector, we will need to learn from innovative partners, access their supply chains, and increase local demand,” Carney said.</p><p>He pointed to a stronger partnership with China in clean energy storage and production, driving new investments.</p><p>Carney said he expected the EV pact would drive “considerable” Chinese investment into Canada’s auto sector, create good careers and speed it towards a net-zero future.</p><p>Doug Ford, premier of Ontario, Canada’s main car manufacturing province, complained China now had a Canadian foothold and would take full advantage.</p><p>“The federal government is inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantee of equal or immediate investments in Canada’s economy, auto sector or supply chain,” he said in a post on X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"lowering-tariffs\">Lowering tariffs</h2><p>Last March, in retaliation for Trudeau’s tariffs, China levied tariffs on more than $2.6bn of Canadian farm and food products, such as canola oil and meal, followed by tariffs on canola seed in August.</p><p>That led to a slump of 10.4 percent in China’s 2025 imports of Canadian goods.</p><p>Under the new deal, Carney said, Canada expects China will lower tariffs on its canola seed by March 1, to a combined rate of about 15 percent.</p><p>“This change represents a significant drop from current combined tariff levels of 84 percent,” he said, adding China was a $4bn canola seed market for Canada.</p><p>Canada also expects its canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas to have anti-discrimination tariffs removed from March 1, until at least year-end, he added.</p><p>The deals will unlock nearly $3bn in export orders for Canadian farmers, fish harvesters and processors, Carney said.</p><p>He also said Xi had committed to ensuring visa-free access for Canadians travelling to China, but did not give details.</p><p>In a statement announced by China’s state-run Xinhua news agency, the two nations pledged to restart high-level economic and financial dialogue, boost trade and investment, and strengthen cooperation in agriculture, oil, gas and green energy.</p><p>Carney said Canada will double its energy grid over the next 15 years, adding that there were opportunities for Chinese partnership in investments, including offshore wind.</p><p>He also said Canada was scaling up its LNG exports to Asia and will produce 50 million tonnes of LNG each year – all destined for Asian markets by 2030.</p><h2 id=\"china-more-predictable\">China ‘more predictable’</h2><p>“Given current complexities in Canada’s trade relationship with the US, it’s no surprise that Carney’s government is keen to improve the bilateral trade and investment relationship with Beijing, which represents a massive market for Canadian farmers,” said Beijing-based Trivium China’s Even Rogers Pay.</p><p>“Meanwhile, it’s difficult for Washington to criticise Carney for striking a beneficial trade deal when Trump himself just did so in October.”</p><p>US President Donald Trump has also imposed tariffs on some Canadian goods and suggested the longtime US ally could become his country’s 51st state.</p><p>China, similarly hit by Trump’s tariffs, is eager to cooperate with a Group of Seven nation in a traditional sphere of US influence.</p><p>“In terms of the way our relationship has progressed in recent months with China, it is more predictable, and you see results coming from that,” Carney said when asked if China was a more predictable and reliable partner than the US.</p><p>Carney also said he had discussions with Xi about Greenland. “I found much alignment of views in that regard,” he said.</p><p>Trump has in recent days revived his claim to the semi-autonomous Danish territory as NATO members scrambled to counter US criticism that Greenland is under-protected.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"sino-us-rivalry\">Sino-US rivalry</h2><p>Analysts say the rapprochement could reshape the political and economic context in which Sino-US rivalry unfolds, although Ottawa is not expected to dramatically pivot away from Washington.</p><p>“Canada is a core US ally and deeply embedded in American security and intelligence frameworks,” said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy.</p><p>“It is therefore very unlikely to realign strategically away from Washington.”</p><p>But if Ottawa took a more pragmatic and autonomous economic policy toward China, Beijing could point to it as evidence that US-led decoupling was neither inevitable nor universally accepted among America’s closest partners, he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"
