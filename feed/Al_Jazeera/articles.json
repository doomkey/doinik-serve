That’s when an agent standing near the front left bumper of the SUV opens fire. The vehicle continued forward down the road before crashing into a utility pole and another car.</p><p>A video of the aftermath appeared to show law enforcement agents refusing to allow an individual who identifies himself as a physician to give medical aid to Good, who was pronounced dead soon after.</p><p>Good – a 37-year-old mother of three – was dropping off her youngest child at school.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Just moments after the killing, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed in a statement that Good was a “violent rioter” who “weaponized her vehicle” in an attempt to “run over” law enforcement.</p><p>Hours later, Trump called Good without evidence a “professional agitator” who “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer”, blaming the incident on the “Radical left”.</p><p>The US president claimed it was “hard to believe” the involved agent was alive, despite video showing him walking around the scene after opening fire.</p><p>Joining a lengthy White House news conference on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance also presented an incendiary account of the incident, calling it “classic terrorism” and suggesting Good had been “brainwashed” by the “radical left”.</p><p>He also falsely claimed that the officer who opened fire “is protected by absolute immunity” from state prosecution because he was a federal law enforcement agent “doing his job”.</p><h2 id=\"renewed-scrutiny-over-ice\">Renewed scrutiny over ICE</h2><p>The shooting has brought renewed scrutiny to Trump’s mass deportation drive, which has seen his administration flood communities across the country with federal agents as it has sought to quickly grow the ballooning ranks of ICE.</p><p>Prior to the killing, The Trace news website had documented 16 incidents in which federal agents enforcing the immigration crackdown shot someone since Trump took office in January 2025. Good was among four people killed in those shootings, it said.</p><p>On Thursday, two Customs and Border Patrol agents, who fall under DHS like ICE agents, opened fire and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/two-wounded-in-a-shooting-with-us-federal-agents-in-portland-report\">wounded</a> a man and a woman during a traffic stop in Portland, Oregon.</p><p>A bill signed into law by Trump in 2025 allocates $75bn for ICE’s personnel, enforcement and detention budget over the next four years – funds that far surpass the military budgets of most countries in the world.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Speaking at Friday’s news conference, Minneapolis city council member Jason Chavez said it was imperative to have an independent investigation into Good’s killing for local residents to be able to “have a sense of trust in this process”.</p><p>Good’s killing came as the administration surged ICE agents to Minneapolis in its<a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/white-house-looking-at-denaturalising-somali-americans-for-alleged-fraud\"> latest targeting</a> of Somali Americans, leaving many living in fear, he added.</p><p>“What descended upon Minneapolis and in this state is not the American dream,” he said. “It is not what the American dream is about.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Analysts warn that without a comprehensive resolution to the tensions, more fighting is all but inevitable.</p><p>While it appears that there is no domestic or international appetite for an all-out war in Syria, experts say that with the merger of the SDF – which controls large parts of northeast Syria – into the state stalled, the threat of renewed violence persists.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s a lot of international interest in major fighting at the moment, especially from the US side — so that could help tamp things down,” said Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International.</p><p>“It’s far from over, however.

Both sides remain at odds over a number of issues, including the process and structure of integration, for example, whether the SDF would join as a unified bloc or dissolve into individual recruits.</p><p>A meeting on January 4 between senior SDF commanders and government officials concluded with no “tangible” outcomes according to state media, with talks suspended pending further negotiation.</p><p>The SDF rose to prominence as Syria began to fragment under the strain of civil unrest in 2011.</p><p>It was officially established in 2015, with the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia linked to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), forming the bulk of its fighting force.</p><p>Despite the PKK being listed as a “terrorist” group by the US and most Western countries, Washington quickly allied itself with the SDF in the fight against ISIL (ISIS).</p><p>The group continues to be backed by a US-led international coalition and retains advanced equipment and training that were provided by the US and its partners.</p><p>It is estimated to have 50,000 to 90,000 well-trained, battle-hardened fighters.</p><p>But Turkiye, which struggled with a decades-long PKK rebellion and attacks, views the SDF as a threat to its security.</p><p>In the recent clashes, official Syrian government media outlets have referred to the SDF as “PKK terrorists”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"regional-influences\">Regional influences</h2><p>With Turkiye, a NATO ally of the US, distrustful of the SDF, the country’s defence ministry has said it is ready to “support” Syria in its fight against the group.</p><p>Ankara, an ally of al-Sharaa’s government, has criticised Washington for years over its support for the SDF and launched several military operations in northern Syria to push the group off its border.</p><p>The intensifying rivalry between Turkiye and Israel has also raised concerns that the Israeli government may put its weight behind the SDF to provide a counterweight to Ankara’s influence in Syria.</p><p>Israel has already intervened in the internal Syrian conflict when it <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/ceasefire-collapses-in-syrias-suwayda-as-israel-threatens-escalation\">bombed Damascus</a> in July in support of Druze fighters battling government forces in the south of the country.</p><p>The Israeli military has also expanded its occupation beyond the Golan Heights, and it has been establishing checkpoints and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/israeli-incursions-abductions-stoke-fear-in-syrias-occupied-golan-heights\">abducting people</a> deep inside Syria’s territory.</p><p>The US, which has troops stationed in eastern Syria, is allied with all the parties involved: Turkiye, Israel, the Syrian government and the SDF.</p><p>And so, Washington has been trying to mediate between all the sides. Last week, Syria and Israel agreed to establish an intelligence-sharing mechanism after US-brokered talks.</p><p>US envoy <a href=\"/news/2025/8/28/us-envoy-says-calling-lebanon-reporters-animalistic-was-inappropriate\">Tom Barrack</a> has urged the “utmost restraint” after the clashes in Aleppo and hailed the short-lived ceasefire.</p><p>“Together with our allies and responsible regional partners, we stand ready to facilitate efforts to de-escalate tensions and to afford Syria and its people a renewed opportunity to choose the path of dialogue over division,” Barrack said in a statement calling for de-escalation from all sides.</p><p>“Let us prioritize the exchange of ideas and constructive proposals over the exchange of fire. The future of Aleppo, and of Syria as a whole, belongs to its people and must be shaped through peaceful means, not violence.”</p><h2 id=\"us-can-do-the-most\">US ‘can do the most’</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said with both the government and SDF maintaining relationships with the US, it could limit the risk of the March agreement’s total collapse, saying it keeps a “ceiling on escalation”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“American involvement does not guarantee resolution, but it constrains the range of outcomes and keeps both parties tethered to a negotiating framework neither can afford to abandon,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Reporting from Damascus, Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna said Washington can “do the most” to boost talks between the Syrian government and the SDF.</p><p>“The US has enjoyed a strong relationship with the SDF for over a decade. The US helped build up and train the SDF, it fought alongside the SDF, and 1,000 US troops remain in SDF territory where they work closely together in the effort to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/us-says-it-killed-or-captured-25-isil-operatives-in-syria-over-nine-days\">eradicate ISIL</a> from Syria,” Oghanna said.</p><p>“But the US has also recently strengthened its ties with Damascus.”</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>Rob Geist Pinfold, an international security lecturer at King’s College London, said the temporary <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/9/syria-live-ceasefire-in-aleppo-after-at-least-22-killed-since-tuesday\">ceasefire in Aleppo</a> simply pushes “the more complicated issues” down the road.</p><p>“Yes, we’ve got a temporary ceasefire … which makes everyone’s lives better, but this means that we are arguably further away from getting to a comprehensive deal.”</p><p>For his part, Lund, the analyst, warned that more clashes could lead to a wider escalation.</p><p>“Unless this situation is managed well, it could prompt foreign interventions and worsen the already bad relationship between Israel and Turkiye,” Lund told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Some analysts have said the key is more talks and less violence.</p><p>Armenak Tokmajyan, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Middle East Center, argued that military pressure alone will not resolve Syria’s fragmentation.</p><p>“Reintegration … cannot happen just with force,” he told Al Jazeera, stressing the need for a multi-pronged strategy, including an inclusive national framework.</p><p>“A lot of these armed groups don’t want to lay down their weapons because they don’t know what this state will look like,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Chelle said they would train again later on Friday.</p><p>Chelle declined to comment about reports that Osimhen was on the verge of walking out of the team after an on-field argument with teammate Ademola Lookman during the Super Eagles’ 4-0 win over Mozambique in the last 16 on Monday.</p><p>“I prefer to speak about the (upcoming) game. Victor is there and that’s all,” Chelle said. “Yes, everyone’s speaking about Osimhen and Lookman, it’s normal, they’re the last two best African players, but we’re here to serve them to score, we’re working for them. We’re a team, and that’s what teamwork is all about.”</p><p>Osimhen scored two goals in that match with Lookman involved in both, but apparently he was furious when Lookman tried scoring instead of setting him up for another.</p><p>Lookman played down the argument when asked about it post-game, when he said it was “just football” and called Osimhen his “brother”.</p><p>Lookman also subsequently posted photos of himself celebrating with Osimhen on social media with the caption “together always”.</p><p>Nigeria, which lost the final to Ivory Coast in the last edition, is bidding to win the title for a fourth time. It would help make up for the disappointment of failing to qualify for the World Cup.</p><p>Both of Algeria’s two titles included wins over Nigeria on the way – twice in 1990 and again in the semifinals in 2019.</p></div></div></body></html>"
