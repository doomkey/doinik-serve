We will know when there are men – rich men – in handcuffs being perp-walked to the jail,” Massie said in his speech. “And until then, this is still a cover-up.”</p><p>Over the years, Epstein built a network of hundreds of girls and young women for sexual exploitation. Many of the victims were made to travel around with him and stay at his private island in the Caribbean.</p><p>But the Trump administration has all but ruled out further charges in the case.</p><p>Last year, before the release of the documents, the US Department of Justice <a href=\"/news/2025/7/7/epstein-no-client-list-died-suicide-justice-department-says\">denied that Epstein</a> had a “client list” of powerful people to whom he trafficked his sex abuse victims.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier this month, deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche sparked outrage when he appeared to dismiss calls for prosecuting Epstein’s allies.</p><p>“We will always investigate any evidence of misconduct. But as you know, it is not a crime to party with Mr Epstein,” he told Fox News. “And so, as horrible as it is, it is not a crime to email with Mr Epstein.”</p><p>Alsalem, the UN expert, said Blanche’s comments were “dismissive” of the victims and “the horrific experiences” they endured.</p><p>She noted that it had been known that Epstein was convicted of sex abuse crimes in 2008.</p><p>“In light of everything that we know and was known even back then by those who engaged with him, nobody can claim unawareness,” Alsalem told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But indeed, at the same time, everybody accused should still benefit from a fair and impartial trial, but that’s why we have to get to that impartial and fair trial, and then they can also explain themselves.”</p><h2 id=\"the-trump-connection\">The Trump connection</h2><p>Epstein was given what is widely seen as a lenient plea deal during his first conviction, where he admitted to solicitation of prostitution with a minor and was sentenced to 18 months in jail that included work release privileges.</p><p>He was arrested and charged again in 2019 after media reports scrutinised the 2008 federal prosecution against him, which was led by Alexander Acosta, who served as labour secretary in the first Trump administration.</p><p>Trump himself has been accused of ties to Epstein, but the US president said that he only knew the late sex offender as a neighbour in Palm Beach, Florida, and eventually dissociated with him because he was a “creep”.</p><p>Last year, The Wall Street Journal released what it said was a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/trumps-alleged-suggestive-letter-to-epstein-released-by-democrats\">sexually suggestive</a> birthday card in the shape of a nude woman sent by Trump to Epstein. The US president denied sending the letter and filed a lawsuit against the newspaper over the allegation.</p><p>“If a Prince can be held accountable, so can a President,” Democratic Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury wrote on X after Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest.</p><p></p><p>Congressman Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, called the arrest of the former British royal an “enormous step forward” towards accountability.</p><p>“Oversight Democrats called for Mountbatten-Windsor to come clean about his ties to Epstein months ago, and Britain is now holding him accountable with this arrest,” Garcia said in a statement.</p><p>“Now it’s time for the United States to end this White House cover-up. President Trump and his Epstein Administration are not above the law.”</p><p>In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week, a majority of US respondents – 53 percent – agreed that the Epstein files have lowered their “trust in the country’s political and business leaders”.</p><p>And 69 percent said their views were captured by the statement that the files “show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions”.</p><p>Trump’s allies often note <a href=\"/news/longform/2024/12/28/enabling-genocide-former-biden-officials-reflect-on-the-presidents-legacy\">that the administration</a> of former Democratic President Joe Biden had four years to release the Epstein files, but chose not to do so.</p><p>Some powerful Democratic politicians and donors, including former President Bill Clinton and ex-Treasury Secretary <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/19/ex-treasury-boss-summers-resigns-from-openai-after-named-in-epstein-files\">Larry Summers</a>, also had ties to Epstein.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"organised-attack-against-women-and-children\">‘Organised attack’ against women and children</h2><p>The issue goes beyond the US. The Epstein files have rocked British politics and led to calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who appointed Epstein associate <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/corbyn-alleges-uk-complicity-after-streetings-admission-of-gaza-abuses\">Peter Mandelson</a> as ambassador to Washington.</p><p>France <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/norwegian-police-search-former-pm-jaglands-properties-over-epstein-ties\">and Norway</a> have also opened probes into corruption and sex abuse allegations related to Epstein.</p><p>Earlier this week, UN experts, including Alsalem, found that Epstein’s crimes “reasonably meet the legal threshold of crimes against humanity”.</p><p>Alsalem told Al Jazeera that there needs to be an “independent, impartial investigation that spans all the countries and all individuals” reported to be involved in <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/files-reveal-epstein-was-offered-chance-to-buy-us-pentagon-fbi-buildings\">Epstein’s network</a>.</p><p>“Not only that, we have to also examine the architecture of the alleged enterprise – the organisational structure,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We have to shift this investigation from looking at individual crimes, isolated criminal transactions, to realising that we’re talking about an organised attack directed against vulnerable women and children, including girls.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But trade was diverted away from China. The goods gap with Taiwan doubled to $147bn and shot up 44 percent, to $178bn, with Vietnam.</p><p>Trump last year unleashed a barrage of tariffs against trading partners with the aim, among other things, of addressing trade imbalances and protecting US industries. But the punitive duties have not yielded a manufacturing renaissance, with factory employment declining by 83,000 jobs from January 2025 through January 2026.</p><p>“There just isn’t any evidence out there in the economic research literature to suggest that tariffs have materially impacted trade deficits historically when countries have implemented them,” said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p>The trade gap ballooned by 32.6 percent to a five-month high of $70.3bn, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and the US Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters forecast the trade deficit would contract to $55.5bn.</p><p>The report was delayed because of last year’s government shutdown.</p><p>Imports increased 3.6 percent to $357.6bn in December. Goods imports surged 3.8 percent to $280.2bn, boosted by a $7bn increase in industrial supplies and materials, mostly non-monetary gold, copper and crude oil. Capital goods imports increased by $5.6bn, lifted by computer accessories and telecommunications equipment. That rise is likely related to the construction of data centres to support artificial intelligence.</p><p>But consumer goods imports fell, pulled down by pharmaceutical preparations. There have been large swings in imports of pharmaceutical preparations because of tariffs.</p><p>“But strong imports should also imply strength in details like inventories or business investment,” said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. “Surging computer imports in particular should correspond with stronger business equipment investment and could remain strong due to AI-related demand.”</p><p>Exports fell 1.7 percent to $287.3bn in December. But capital goods exports increased, boosted by semiconductors. There were increases in exports of consumer goods, including pharmaceutical preparations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The structure of the deal would have made Epstein a co-owner and, effectively, a landlord to the US government.</p><p data-start=\"1232\" data-end=\"1416\">There is no evidence that the transaction went ahead. But the prospect of a convicted sex offender acquiring a stake in property serving the Pentagon raises serious security questions.</p><p data-start=\"1418\" data-end=\"1551\">Among millions of emails published last month, an FBI informant wrote in a memo that Epstein was a “Mossad Agent” <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">working for Israel</a>.</p><p data-start=\"1553\" data-end=\"1671\">“Epstein was close to the former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, and trained as a spy under him,” the memo adds.</p><p data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1902\">Epstein maintained a decade-long relationship with Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and one-time senior military intelligence figure. Barak visited Epstein’s New York townhouse more than 30 times between 2013 and 2017.</p><p data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1902\">The ties between Epstein and Israel have come into sharp focus following the release of the documents. Beyond his interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak, the files document Epstein’s financial support for Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli army and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his connections to the Mossad, Israel’s overseas intelligence agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"1904\" data-end=\"2064\">The Pentagon-linked proposal formed part of three documents – an email, an investor presentation and a deal summary – contained within the newly released files.</p><p data-start=\"2066\" data-end=\"2299\">David Stern, a businessman who referred to himself as Epstein’s “soldier”, forwarded the offer. Stern also served as a close aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/2/19/live-ex-uk-prince-andrew-arrested-amid-epstein-scandal\">arrested</a> on Thursday on “suspicion of misconduct in public office” following revelations in the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/why-was-former-prince-andrew-arrested-by-uk-police\">Epstein files</a>.</p><p data-start=\"2301\" data-end=\"2511\">In the same year Stern relayed the Pentagon-area proposal, he became director of the St George’s House Trust at Windsor Castle and attended an event at St James’s Palace, where he sat beside the late Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p data-start=\"2513\" data-end=\"2754\">Stern also sent Epstein a separate proposal in 2015 to invest in two FBI field offices in Richmond and Baltimore, and courthouses, which were called “sexy assets”. That deal required an initial $25m, followed by a further $80m, with ownership routed through a Cayman Islands offshore entity.</p><p data-start=\"2756\" data-end=\"2900\">Real estate investor Jonathan D Fascitelli originated both property proposals.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Wexner’s name appears, both redacted and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/six-men-named-in-us-congress-why-is-so-much-redacted-in-the-epstein-files\">unredacted</a>, on communications and financial documents within these files.</p><p>“I was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,” Wexner said in a statement. “He was a con man.

At the time, Epstein was a college dropout who had briefly taught at Manhattan’s elite Dalton School after reportedly exaggerating his academic credentials. He had passed through Bear Stearns under executive Alan “Ace” Greenberg before leaving to set up his own advisory firm.</p><p>By 1986, he had met Wexner. Five years later, the retail billionaire had granted him full power of attorney, an extraordinary delegation allowing Epstein to sign cheques, hire staff, borrow money, and buy or sell property on Wexner’s behalf.</p><p>Al Jazeera has reviewed newly released Justice Department records, including a 1998 purchase and sale agreement and related promissory note and guaranty, which detail the mechanics of asset transfers between the two men.</p><p>The documents show how control of Wexner’s Manhattan townhouse at 9 East 71st Street was formalised through a structured transaction involving a $10m promissory note and a personal guaranty signed by Epstein. The property became Epstein’s New York base and a symbol of his growing stature.</p><p>By the early 1990s, Epstein was embedded in Wexner’s philanthropic and corporate world, serving as a trustee of the Wexner Foundation and as the president of Wexner-affiliated property companies. In 1996, he relocated his firm to the US Virgin Islands, positioning himself as an offshore financier.</p><p>The authority Wexner granted him over assets, philanthropy and property did more than elevate his status socially. It conferred institutional legitimacy. With control over substantial wealth and formal roles inside a major foundation, Epstein could present himself as a financier with access to capital and global networks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-wexner-foundation-and-the-israel-connection\">The Wexner Foundation and the Israel connection</h2><p>One of the clearest through-lines from that period runs to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was introduced to Epstein by former Israeli President Shimon Peres at a large event in Washington in 2003.</p><p>Between 2004 and 2006, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/wexner-foundation-2-3-million-to-barak-was-for-2-reports-1-wasnt-finished/\">the Wexner Foundation</a> paid Barak approximately $2.3m for two commissioned research studies, one on leadership and another on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The foundation later said only one paper was completed, but determined that the work justified the payment.</p><p>Barak, who served as Israel’s prime minister from 1999 to 2001 and later as defence minister from 2007 to 2013, maintained contact with Epstein for several years.</p><p>A court filing included in the newly released Epstein records contains an allegation that prominent victim Virginia Giuffre claimed that Wexner and Barak were two of the men Epstein trafficked her to.</p><p>The filing does not provide supporting evidence for the claim. Neither man has been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.</p><p>In February this year, Barak <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/former-israeli-pm-barak-responds-to-criticism-over-close-epstein-links\">told</a> Israel’s Channel 12 he had been unaware of the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and regretted ever meeting the financier.</p><p>Wexner has said he severed ties with Epstein around 2007 after he discovered the financier had “misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family”.</p><p>But the financial and institutional credibility Epstein accumulated during his years managing Wexner’s wealth did not evaporate when that relationship ended.</p><h2 id=\"epstein-editing-barak-s-op-ed\">Epstein ‘editing’ Barak’s op-ed</h2><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Even after his relationship allegedly ended with Wexner, Epstein now had the social prestige, and money, to develop ties with powerful decision-makers, emails newly released by the Justice Department and reviewed by Al Jazeera show.</p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">In October 2014, Nili Priel Barak – Barak’s wife – wrote to Epstein about travel plans to New York, suggesting dates when Ehud Barak would be in town and asking whether he would be available to meet.</p><p>Days later, she forwarded him a draft opinion piece, writing: “Herewith the Op Ed. Please let me know your opinion and your remarks. Thanks.”</p><p>Epstein replied with what he labelled “beginning edits”, returning a version of the unpublished article. The draft speaks in Barak’s political voice, including the line: “As the Minister of Defence of Israel I’ve met more than once with [US] President [Barack] Obama…” and lays out arguments about the “two states solution” versus a “one state solution”.</p><p>A year later, in 2015, Epstein invested in Reporty Homeland Security, later rebranded as Carbyne, a startup chaired by Ehud Barak that developed advanced emergency communications technology – further tying their political relationship to a shared commercial venture.</p><p>The company’s leadership included CEO Amir Elichai, a former special forces officer, and director Pinhas Buchris, a former Israeli Defence Ministry director-general and former commander of Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s cyber intelligence unit.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2014, documents <a href=\"https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/jeffrey-epstein-israel-surveillance-state-cote-d-ivoire-ehud-barak-leaked-emails\">reportedly</a> indicate Epstein also assisted Barak in exploring security-related business with African world leaders. The documents illustrate how Epstein managed to convert financial credibility into political access, and then reinforced those relationships through shared commercial ventures.</p><p>Barak has said: “I am responsible for all my actions and decisions. There is room to question whether I should have investigated more thoroughly. I regret not doing so.”</p><p>Wexner has never been charged with any crime and has said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal conduct. But his name appears repeatedly throughout the newly released files, a reminder of how central their relationship once was.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The proposal, pushed by far-right Israeli leaders, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Defence Minister Israel Katz, emphasises Israeli supremacy over Palestinians.</p><p data-start=\"604\" data-end=\"771\">The Israeli government has created 35 new positions and allocated 244.1 million shekels (nearly $79m) for the land registration project from 2026 to 2030.</p><p data-start=\"773\" data-end=\"1192\">The process outlined in the proposal is not new in itself. It is a process that has been frozen since 1967, and the most recent resumption is a continuation of Israel’s longstanding plan to take over Palestinian lands. While Israel suspended the land registration process in 1967, it did not suspend its practices of ethnic cleansing, colonial violence and de facto land annexation.</p><p data-start=\"1194\" data-end=\"1524\">For Palestinians, this decision does not mark a new escalation but a solidification of the Israeli presence in the West Bank. While it may seem like mere paperwork, it is actually a milestone in Israel’s gradual takeover of the West Bank, the last remaining territorial obstacle to the completion of Israel’s colonial project in Palestine.</p><h2 id=\"bureaucracy-as-annexation\">Bureaucracy as annexation</h2><p data-start=\"1560\" data-end=\"1895\">This shift cannot be understood without revisiting the Oslo Accords. Under the 1993 and 1995 agreements, the West Bank was carved into Areas A, B and C as an “interim” arrangement that was never meant to become permanent. Area C, the largest area containing the most land and resources, remained under full Israeli control while Areas A and B were left as fragmented Palestinian islands with limited Palestinian authority.</p><p data-start=\"1560\" data-end=\"1895\">That made Area C the real battlefield.</p><p data-start=\"1560\" data-end=\"1895\">As part of the new policy, land registration in Area C, which constitutes more than 62 percent of the West Bank, is to take place through the Land Title Settlement Administration, part of Israel’s Ministry of Justice. What this in effect does is shift Area C from military administration into direct Israeli civilian governance.</p><p data-start=\"1897\" data-end=\"2013\">These measures should not be taken lightly. They are telling of Israel’s latest annexation strategy: governance.</p><p data-start=\"2015\" data-end=\"2453\">On February 8, a week before the Israeli cabinet’s approval to register West Bank lands as state land, Israeli authorities adopted new measures that open land purchase mechanisms for settlers while reducing oversight. That same day, Israeli authorities also moved to further erode Palestinian Authority powers in Areas A and B, which under international agreements signed by Israel should be under full administrative Palestinian control.</p><p data-start=\"2948\" data-end=\"3133\">Taken together, these measures mark a new phase of Zionist territorial conquest in the 21st century – one that relies less on overt warfare and more on administrative consolidation.</p><p data-start=\"3135\" data-end=\"3338\">In 1948, Zionist militias pursued territorial conquest through large-scale warfare, mass displacement and the redrawing of borders. Today, conquest increasingly operates through clerical mechanisms.</p><p data-start=\"3340\" data-end=\"3795\">It is not accidental that a minister as vocally racist as Smotrich explained the plan as an attempt to end “current chaos that is bad for everyone – Jews and Arabs alike”. While Israel’s goal of taking over Palestinian lands has remained unchanged, the post-Oslo era and the reputational damage Israel has sustained during its genocidal war on Gaza mean that visible and large-scale violence is not sustainable for long-term achievements in the West Bank.</p><p data-start=\"3797\" data-end=\"3990\">So rather than tanks, bombs and dramatic declarations of territorial conquest, Israel is lowering both regional and international alarm by consolidating land through perceived bureaucracy.</p><h2 id=\"from-paperwork-to-dispossession\">From paperwork to dispossession</h2><p data-start=\"4032\" data-end=\"4333\">Israel is pushing its West Bank policies as neutral cadastral clean-up when in reality they are large-scale land grabs carried out through administrative means. It is an act of state building that allows Zionist Israelis to determine whose claims over Palestinian lands are legal and whose vanish.</p><p data-start=\"4335\" data-end=\"4543\">This is precisely why land registration matters: Once land is entered into the Israeli registry as “state land”, it becomes a legal reality far more difficult to reverse than a temporary military seizure.</p><p data-start=\"4545\" data-end=\"4799\">For Palestinians, this policy signals serious danger because we have seen it before. After the large-scale dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their lands in 1948, about 150,000 Palestinians remained in what became Israel.</p><p data-start=\"4801\" data-end=\"5115\">These Palestinians were put under military rule until the 1960s despite holding Israeli citizenship. This was not done for security; it was done to ensure territorial restructuring. Lands that did not have Palestinians physically present on them were absorbed through the Absentees Property Law.</p><p data-start=\"5117\" data-end=\"5761\">A similar dynamic is unfolding today in the West Bank, where physical displacement and restricted access are again being converted into legal dispossession. In the West Bank, the last two years have seen alarming rates of settler violence that have pushed thousands of Palestinians off their lands while other areas have been taken and declared closed military zones. This denied Palestinians access to their homes, farmlands and properties. Under Israeli law, these can all be considered absentee lands, even if their rightful owners are just a few metres away and unable to reach their lands due to Israeli hostilities.</p><p data-start=\"5763\" data-end=\"6120\">Through this, Israel is creating a system in which the default legal outcome produces territorial absorption. The bureaucratic aspect of this means that annexation becomes irreversible. It is no longer a temporary military seizure operation; it is transforming territory into property operating within a state system, in this case the Israeli legal system.</p><p data-start=\"6122\" data-end=\"6321\">More dangerously, historical evidence shows that Israel has not only absorbed Palestinian lands through bureaucracy but also coerced Palestinians to engage with Israeli legal structures as a final avenue.</p><p data-start=\"6323\" data-end=\"6734\">Still today, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship in areas such as Ein Hod are in legal battles over land. Not only were they displaced from their village, which now serves as a Jewish artist colony, but Palestinians are also just a few kilometres away, holding Israeli citizenship. Decades later, they remain in legal battles to secure building permits to live on the nearby lands they were forced to move to.</p><h2 id=\"why-the-world-enables-administrative-conquest\">Why the world enables administrative conquest</h2><p data-start=\"6790\" data-end=\"6961\">It is important to realise that all of this was made possible by the international community’s refusal to address the criminality of the Israeli regime as a whole.</p><p data-start=\"6963\" data-end=\"7414\">Condemnations of individual Israeli settler attacks in the last two years and refusal to disarm Israel despite having committed genocide are precisely what is allowing Israel to persist in its colonial expansion. For years Palestinians, as well as international human rights organisations, have warned not only of rising Israeli settler violence but also of a clear synchronisation of efforts by the army and armed Israeli militias in the West Bank.</p><p data-start=\"7416\" data-end=\"7734\">Palestinians shared reports, tried to tell the stories of trees uprooted by the thousands, of water pipelines being destroyed by Israelis, of large-scale arson attacks and pogroms across different cities and towns, of settlers being armed with military-grade weapons and trained by the army in illegal settlements.</p><p data-start=\"7736\" data-end=\"8098\">However, the world defined violence only when it came in the shape of bullets and bombs, which is what allowed Israel to shift strategies in the West Bank. While Palestinians are disarmed in the West Bank, all that was left were outcries and calls for media coverage. Violence enacted against Palestinians was reduced to random and exceptional acts of hostility.</p><p data-start=\"8100\" data-end=\"8591\">Yet in the West Bank, Israel did not choose dramatic war; it chose subtlety. In the last two years, the battlefield in the West Bank has diffused into everyday life and relocated into the nervous system. Violence no longer depends on constant lethal force but on permanent anticipation of a settler attack, a military raid or a court demolition order. Constant surveillance, drones overhead, incessant home invasions, arrests and checkpoints every few metres hold the body captive.</p><p data-start=\"8593\" data-end=\"8887\">All of these practices paved the way for the ongoing displacement and dispossession of Palestinians from their lands. More importantly, they are precisely why Israel is able to push renewed policies to register lands as state lands and to allow Israelis to buy lands with little oversight.</p><p data-start=\"8889\" data-end=\"9032\">What this must teach us is that sometimes war exists in the subtleties, and the absence of relentless bombing does not mean the absence of war.</p><p data-start=\"8889\" data-end=\"9032\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
