That doesn’t mean we’re going to win every time we push, but it’s our job to always push because our context is pretty unique.”</p><p>Wasserman said he also spent time explaining to IOC members how arena and stadium names are part of the lexicon in US sports.</p><p>“People know ‘Crypto’ as ‘Crypto,’ they don’t know it as ‘the gymnastics arena downtown,’” Wasserman said of the home of the Lakers, Crypto.com Arena, which will host gymnastics and boxing in 2028.</p><p>Rights for up to 19 temporary venues could be available. The IOC’s biggest sponsors – called TOP sponsors – will have the first chance to get in on the deals. Wasserman said no venues will be renamed – so, for instance, if organisers do not reach a deal with SoFi (opening and closing ceremonies, swimming) or Intuit (basketball), no other sponsor can put its name on the arena.</p><p>Not included in this new arrangement are the LA Coliseum, Rose Bowl and Dodger Stadium, some of the most iconic venues in a city that hosted the Games in 1932 and 1984. Organisers said IOC rules that forbid advertising on the field of play will still apply.</p><p>The deal adds to a growing list of accommodations pushed through for Los Angeles, which is once again poised to reshape the Olympic brand, much the way it did in 1984.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In 2017, the city was bidding for the 2024 Games against Paris, but agreed to instead host the 2028 Games. It was part of a then-unheard-of bid process that rescued the IOC from the reality that cities were becoming reluctant to absorb the cost and effort to bid for and host the Summer Games.</p><p>Olympic watchers viewed the return of softball and baseball for 2028, along with the introduction of flag football, with help from the NFL, as changes that maybe only Los Angeles could have pulled off.</p><p>LA will also make a major scheduling change for the Olympics Games, moving track and field to the opening week of the games and swimming to the end.</p><p>Wasserman said the organising committee’s position as a private entity plays a major role in its relationship with the IOC.</p><p>“We spend the time, we do the work, we make the argument, and we don’t settle for a ‘No,’ because we don’t have that luxury,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The travel alert was raised to Level 2 – “exercise increased caution” on a scale of four levels.</p><h2 id=\"which-places-did-the-us-warn-about-and-why\">Which places did the US warn about and why?</h2><p data-start=\"71\" data-end=\"280\">The alert warns Americans not to travel to Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas provinces due to “terrorism, violent crime, and kidnapping.” These states are marked red on the map and classified as Level 4 — the most unsafe, per the US.</p><p data-start=\"282\" data-end=\"470\">Travellers are advised to reconsider visiting Baja California, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, and Sonora for the same reasons; these appear in orange and are rated Level 3, or marginally safer.</p><p data-start=\"472\" data-end=\"761\">Another 16 states – including Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Quintana Roo, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Morelos, Aguascalientes, Baja California Sur, Durango, Hidalgo, Nayarit, Nuevo Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz – fall under “exercise increased caution”. While there are no outright travel bans, the advisory notes that both violent and non-violent crimes are common. These areas are shown in yellow and are listed under Level 2.</p><p data-start=\"763\" data-end=\"861\">Only Yucatan and Campeche remain at Level 1, the lowest risk level, highlighted in blue.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888144\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Mexico_Travel_Advisory_August14_2025-02-1755160351.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Mexico_Travel_Advisory_August14_2025-02-1755160351\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-backdrop-for-this-advisory\">What is the backdrop for this advisory?</h2><p data-start=\"92\" data-end=\"226\">According to experts, these actions follow <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/mexico-expels-26-alleged-cartel-members-in-latest-deal-with-us\">increased pressure from Trump</a>, which has prompted the Mexican government to take a range of measures.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"228\" data-end=\"438\">Earlier this week, Mexico extradited 26 alleged cartel members to the US, in what appeared to be an effort to ease Trump’s demands for stronger action against fentanyl smuggling and organised crime.</p><p data-start=\"440\" data-end=\"632\">In a statement, the US embassy said those extradited included key figures from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel, Mexico’s two most powerful organised crime groups.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"97\" data-end=\"298\">This marks the second mass transfer of the year; in February, Mexican authorities sent 29 alleged cartel leaders to the US, a move that stirred debate over its political and legal merits.</p><p data-start=\"300\" data-end=\"440\">Among them was Caro Quintero, a founding member of the Guadalajara Cartel, accused of murdering DEA agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena in 1985.</p><p data-start=\"442\" data-end=\"636\">US officials had requested the extraditions, pledging not to seek the death penalty. Mexico described the suspects as high-risk criminals tied to drug trafficking and other serious offences.</p><p data-start=\"638\" data-end=\"779\">While extraditions are not uncommon, they are typically carried out in ones and twos. But this year alone, Mexico has already handed over 55 people.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"182\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The transfers follow months of US pressure, reinforced by tariff threats, and reports that Trump directed the Pentagon to consider military action against Latin American cartels.</p><p data-start=\"812\" data-end=\"1179\">According to those reports, the order would permit direct military operations on foreign soil and in corresponding territorial waters against organised criminal groups. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has said the US and Mexico are close to finalising a security agreement to boost cooperation against cartels, but she has firmly rejected the idea of unilateral US military operations on Mexican soil.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-mexico-responded-to-the-new-alert\" data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"182\">How has Mexico responded to the new alert?</h2><p data-start=\"153\" data-end=\"463\">Sheinbaum downplayed the updated travel advisory. She argued the change stems from Washington’s decision to label cartels as terrorist organisations  – done through an executive order earlier this year – rather than from any new security reality.</p><p data-start=\"465\" data-end=\"761\">Sheinbaum stressed that Mexico remains the top destination for US travellers, with about a million Americans living in the country, and noted that popular areas such as the Southeast, Baja California Peninsula, Pacific coast, and Mexico City continue to attract visitors despite the warning.</p><h2 id=\"how-bad-is-mexico-s-violence-problem\">How bad is Mexico’s violence problem?</h2><p>Bad, but it’s improving.</p><p data-start=\"60\" data-end=\"225\">According to a 2024 report from Human Rights Watch, violent crime in Mexico <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/mexico\">has risen sharply</a> since the government began its “war” on organised crime in 2006.</p><p data-start=\"60\" data-end=\"225\">However, this year, Sheinbaum can report a 25.3 percent <a href=\"https://ground.news/article/sesnsp-intentional-homicide-in-mexico-has-decreased-by-253-in-nine-months\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drop in daily homicides</a> over her first 11 months in office, from 86.9 per day in September 2023 to 64.9 now – the lowest monthly figures since 2015.</p><p data-start=\"60\" data-end=\"225\">While Mexico remains one of the world’s most violent countries, the decline is seen as a significant improvement, credited to her administration’s security strategy, but also US pressure.</p><p data-start=\"66\" data-end=\"340\">When Trump took office, he quickly warned Mexico that it had to show real progress in stopping the flow of fentanyl, a drug that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, or face steep trade tariffs. He promised to push Mexico harder to curb drug trafficking and illegal migration, making it clear there would be serious economic consequences if it didn’t act.</p><p data-start=\"342\" data-end=\"757\">In Sheinbaum’s first year in office, authorities have seized more than 3.5 million fentanyl pills and arrested at least 29,000 suspects, including high-level cartel leaders with local and national reach. Security chief Omar Garcia Harfuch credited the success to the crucial work of specialised intelligence and investigative units.</p><p data-start=\"60\" data-end=\"225\">However, in places like Sinaloa, the bloodshed escalated sharply after the arrests of major figures, including <a href=\"/news/2024/8/10/i-was-ambushed-sinaloa-drug-cartel-leader-el-mayo-details-capture\">Ismael Zambada</a>, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, in August 2024.</p><p data-start=\"360\" data-end=\"546\">During the first six months of this year, authorities recorded 883 homicides in the state, up from just 224 in the same period last year, with most killings concentrated in Culiacan.</p><p data-start=\"548\" data-end=\"835\">The violence may be only part of the toll. Since Zambada’s arrest, more than 1,500 people have gone missing in Sinaloa. Security officials believe criminal groups are behind many of these disappearances, suggesting the real cost of the crackdown could be even higher.</p><p>Zambada, one of Mexico’s most notorious accused drug lords, was captured at an airfield near El Paso, Texas, alongside Ovidio Guzman, a son of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman – the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel who is serving a life sentence in a US prison. Zambada claims Guzman Lopez kidnapped him and handed him over to US authorities.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"243\" data-end=\"969\">Israel has imposed man-made starvation on the population of Gaza since the aggression against the enclave began in October 2023. This campaign intensified drastically after March 2025, when the Zionist occupation implemented even harsher restrictions on the already scarce aid allowed into Gaza. Since then, hundreds of men, women, and children have died from severe malnutrition. Doctors survive on meagre crumbs of bread and oil each day, often resorting to seawater to ingest much-needed electrolytes. Journalists have become too weak to carry out their duties, and men are too frail to risk their lives at GHF sites. The population now resembles skin stretched taut over bones.</p><p data-start=\"971\" data-end=\"1578\">Such severe malnutrition has, unfortunately, been witnessed throughout history, and its effects on the human body are well documented. Systems shut down one by one, fatigue envelops the victims, and the body begins to consume itself to death. Chilling accounts between 1920 and 1940 in the Soviet Union paint a similar picture. Performers collapsed mid-performance, dying where they stood. People dropped dead in the streets as if simply falling asleep. Desperation reached such extremes that court records tell of a mother dismembering her unconscious husband, believing him dead, to feed their children.</p><p data-start=\"1580\" data-end=\"2315\">What is often overlooked, however, is that recovery from starvation can be just as devastating. Ironically, one of the earliest recorded accounts of this phenomenon comes from the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. For five months, under the command of Titus, son of Emperor Vespasian, the Roman army cut off all aid to the then-holy Jewish city. Like Gaza’s population today, Jerusalem’s citizens were wasted, disease-ridden, and forced to eat leather. After the Romans breached the gates and captured the city, Flavius Josephus, a Jewish commander who defected to the Romans, reported that many survivors died soon after eating. Malnourished citizens would gorge themselves on food to the point of vomiting, with many dying within hours.</p><p data-start=\"2317\" data-end=\"2964\">Following World War II, similar accounts emerged involving Japanese prisoners of war. Malnourished soldiers liberated from captivity in the Philippines, New Guinea, and elsewhere gorged themselves on calorically rich food provided by their liberators. Approximately one in five of these prisoners died because of this refeeding process. Medical examinations revealed shrunken organs, heart failure, and other severe complications. Comparable observations have been reported repeatedly in starved civilian populations after famine relief, among post-operative patients, individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa, and chronic alcoholics.</p><p data-start=\"2966\" data-end=\"3679\">Now commonly known as refeeding syndrome, this condition describes a dangerously rapid metabolic shift from a catabolic to an anabolic state. In starvation, the body suppresses insulin and relies on breaking down muscle and fat, depleting essential intracellular ions. Once feeding resumes, insulin surges, causing glucose and electrolytes to flood into cells. This sudden cellular shift sharply lowers blood levels of phosphate, potassium, and magnesium. Insulin also promotes sodium and water retention in the bloodstream, leading to fluid overload. If untreated, these changes can cause catastrophic damage to the heart, lungs, nerves, and blood, resulting in arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and death.</p><p data-start=\"3681\" data-end=\"4225\">It is important to emphasise that refeeding syndrome is not simply “too many calories too quickly”; it is a metabolic shock. Controlled eating alone is insufficient. Patients require carefully planned treatment, beginning with electrolyte and vitamin supplementation before feeding starts. A skilled, multidisciplinary team and routine laboratory testing are essential to ensure recovery proceeds safely. Pharmacists, psychiatrists, lab technicians, and other specialists must work in concert to nurse the malnourished back to health.</p><p data-start=\"4227\" data-end=\"4776\">In the context of the genocide in Gaza, imagining such care is heartbreaking. The medical infrastructure there has collapsed. Doctors treat only urgent cases. Anaesthetics have all but run out, and vinegar, if found, is used to clean wounds. Children’s limbs are amputated while they are fully conscious and in pain. This is not a system remotely capable of rehabilitating two million starved people. Israel deliberately ensures this by enforcing a blockade on medical supplies and brutally targeting health workers, ambulances, and hospitals.</p><p data-start=\"4778\" data-end=\"5259\">Tragically, we cannot rely on starving individuals to control their own refeeding. Hunger twists the mind, making a person obsessively fixated on food. The thought “this may be your only chance to eat, so eat as much as possible” becomes overpowering. In the follow up of Ancel Keys’ malnutrition experiments, it was noted that several recovered participants went on to work in the food and restaurant industry. The reality is that a severely malnourished person cannot be expected to regulate their eating once food is available.</p><p data-start=\"5261\" data-end=\"6011\">It is therefore crucial to demand international pressure on Israel to allow the immediate entry of medical equipment, laboratory facilities, and specialist teams into Gaza. Most crucially, they must stop targeting health workers and health facilities. This is nearly as vital as the entry of aid itself. Western governments possess a range of tools to compel Israel to halt its genocidal aggression and permit humanitarian and medical assistance, but they choose not to use them. They are complicit in one of the most horrendous genocides of modern times. Global citizens must press their governments to act. We must remain aware that without medical infrastructure accompanying aid, thousands will possibly die from refeeding syndrome.</p><p data-start=\"5261\" data-end=\"6011\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

That could effectively transform the visa into what one expert called “a luxury work permit” and disadvantage early-career workers with smaller salaries, including teachers.

Once the proposal appears in the Federal Register – the daily public report containing notices of proposed federal rule changes – the plan will become subject to a formal public comment period. It could be finalised within months, although it is likely to face legal challenges.</p><p>Joseph Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, told The New York Times in July that H-1B visas should favour companies that plan to pay foreign workers higher wages. The proposal Bloomberg Law described was in line with that goal.</p><p>PolitiFact did not see a copy of the proposal, and the White House did not respond to our questions. But the Department of Homeland Security submitted the proposed rule to a Trump administration office in July, the Greenberg Traurig law firm wrote.</p><p>Trump sought to reform the H-1B program during his first term but made limited progress. In January 2021, near the end of Trump’s term, the Department of Homeland Security published a final rule similar to the current proposal, but the Biden administration did not implement it.</p><p>Work visas were not a central part of Trump’s 2024 immigration platform, but it was a point of <a href=\"/news/2024/12/29/why-are-us-republicans-debating-the-future-of-h-1b-high-skill-work-visas\">debate</a> in the weeks before he took office, with billionaire businessman Elon Musk – a megadonor to Trump who would briefly serve in his administration – speaking in favour of them.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-h-1b-visas\">What are H-1B visas?</h2><p>The H-1B visa programme lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty fields, with about two-thirds working in computer-related jobs, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most H-1B visa holders come from India, followed by China.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Currently, prospective H-1B employers must attest that they will pay the H-1B worker actual wages paid to similar employees or the prevailing wages for that occupation – whichever would result in the highest pay.</p><p>To qualify for the non-immigrant visa, the employee must hold a specialised degree, license or training required by the occupation. The status is generally valid for up to three years and renewable for another three years, but it can be extended if the employer sponsors the worker for permanent residency, which includes permission to work and live in the US.</p><p>Leopold said that the proposed change goes beyond the law’s current wage mandate.</p><p>“This statutory mechanism is designed to prevent employers from paying H-1B workers less than their American counterparts, thereby protecting US workers from displacement,” Leopold said.</p><p>Congress caps new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees. The government approved 400,000 H-1B applications, including renewals, in 2024, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.</p><p>Amazon has led the nation’s employers since 2020 in its number of H-1B workers, Pew found.</p><p>The New York metro area received more H-1B application approvals than any other metro area; College Station, Texas had the highest concentration of approvals.</p><h2 id=\"what-could-change-with-h1-b-visas\">What could change with H1-B visas?</h2><p>The proposed policy favours higher-paid employees, experts said.</p><p>Malcolm Goeschl, a San Francisco-based lawyer, said the rule will likely benefit tech companies, including many specialising in artificial intelligence. Such companies pay high salaries, including for entry-level positions. He said it will harm traditional tech companies’ programmes for new graduates.</p><p>“There will likely be plenty of lottery numbers available at the top of the prevailing wage scale, but very few or none at the bottom,” Goeschl said. “You may see young graduates shy away from the US labour market early on because of this. Or you could see companies just pay entry-level workers from other countries much higher salaries to get a chance in the lottery, leading to the perverse situation where the foreign workers are making a lot more money than similarly situated US workers.”</p><p>The prevailing wage requirements are designed to protect US jobs from being undercut by lower paid foreign workers.</p><p>David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the change would likely make it nearly impossible for recent immigrant college graduates, who tend to earn lower wages, to launch their careers in the United States on an H-1B visa.</p><p>“The short-term benefit would be the people who get selected are more productive, but the long-term cost might be to permanently redirect future skilled immigration to other countries,” Bier said. “It would also effectively prohibit the H-1B for many industries that rely on it. K-12 schools in rural areas seeking bilingual teachers, for instance, will have no chance under this system.”</p><p>Amid a nationwide teacher shortage, some school districts have hired H-1B visa holders, including smaller districts such as Jackson, Mississippi, and larger districts, including Dallas, Texas. Language immersion schools also often employ teachers from other countries using this visa programme.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-there-a-debate-about-h-1b-visas\">Why is there a debate about H-1B visas?</h2><p>The debate around H-1B visas does not neatly fall along partisan lines.</p><p>Proponents say the existing visa programme allows American employers to fill gaps, compete with other countries and recruit the “best minds”. Critics point to instances of fraud or abuse and say they favour policies that incentivise hiring Americans.</p><p>In December, high-profile Republicans debated the visa programme on social media.</p><p>MAGA influencer Laura Loomer denounced the programme and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called it a “scam”. On the other side, billionaire Elon Musk, a former H-1B visa holder whose companies employ such visa holders, called for the programme’s reform but defended it as an important talent recruitment mechanism.</p><p>Trump sided with Musk.</p><p>“I have many H-1B visas on my properties,” Trump told the New York Post in late December. “I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great programme.”</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders disputed Musk, saying corporations abuse the programme as a way to get richer and should recruit American workers first.</p><p>Such visa debates have continued.</p><p>When US Representative Greg Murphy, a urologist, argued on X August 8 that the visas “are critical for helping alleviate the severe physician shortage”, thousands replied. Christina Pushaw, a Republican who works for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, pushed back: “Why not figure out the causes of the domestic physician shortage and try to pass legislation to address those?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Russia occupies almost all of Luhansk and three-quarters of Donetsk.</p><p>Ukraine still holds about 6,600 sq km (2,550 sq miles) of Donbas, although Russia has been focusing most of its energy along the front in Donetsk, pushing towards the last remaining major cities not in its control.</p><p>This has been part of its efforts to secure what is known as the “fortress belt”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-fortress-belt\">What is the fortress belt?</h2><p>The “fortress belt” stretches some 50km (31 miles) along a strategic highway between the towns of Kostiantynivka and Sloviansk.</p><p>The fortress belt includes key towns — Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, Oleksiyevo-Druzhkivka and Kostiantynivka – which have remained under the control of Ukrainian troops since 2014 and are of significant strategic importance as logistical and administrative centre.</p><p>Attempts by Russian troops to capture Sloviansk and the cities of the fortress belt in 2022-2023 were unsuccessful, and Ukrainian counteroffensives drove the Russian forces far from key positions.</p><p>“Ukraine’s fortress belt has served as a major obstacle to the Kremlin’s territorial ambitions in Ukraine over the last 11 years,” the Washington, DC-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on August 8.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888048\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-ukraine-What-is-the-fortress-belt-AUG-12-2025-copy-4-1755156388.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE- ukraine -What is the fortress belt-AUG 12, 2025 copy 4-1755156388\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"russian-advances-what-s-the-situation-on-the-ground-now\">Russian advances: What’s the situation on the ground now?</h2><p>In August, Russian forces made significant gains, advancing about 10km (6 miles) beyond the front lines as they intensified efforts to seize the fortress belt from the southwest, concentrating forces in the Toretsk and eastern Pokrovsk directions.</p><p>Al Jazeera defence editor Alex Gatapoulos said, “I’m not sure what Ukraine has to offer in terms of territory. Russia has it all and is slowly winning this conflict, albeit at a great cost.</p><p>“There is already movement around Pokrovsk in the east, and Konstantinivka is also in danger of encirclement. If Ukraine hasn’t built defensive positions in-depth, Russian forces will have the ability to break out into open country. This is a really dangerous time for Ukraine. They’ve lost all the Russian territory they had taken in Kursk and have little to trade with.”</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-war-progressed-over-the-past-three-years\">How has the war progressed over the past three years?</h2><p>In the war’s early weeks, Russia advanced from the north, east and south, rapidly seizing vast areas of Ukrainian territory, with fierce battles in Irpin, Bucha and Mariupol – the latter of which fell to Russian forces in May 2022. The siege of Mariupol was one of the deadliest and most destructive battles of the war. Ukrainian officials estimated tens of thousands of civilian deaths.</p><p>By March 2022, Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest in Europe, and by April of that year, Russia controlled 27 percent of Ukraine.</p><p>By late 2022, Ukraine had turned the tide with major counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson, with Kyiv reclaiming 54 percent of the land Russia had captured since the beginning of the war, according to ISW data, reducing Russian-occupied land to just 18 percent of the country.</p><p>In August 2024, Ukraine launched a significant incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, marking a notable escalation in the conflict. This offensive saw Ukrainian forces advancing approximately 10km (6 miles) into Russian territory, seizing control over an estimated 250 sq km (96.5 sq miles), all of which has since been retaken by Russia.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888045\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Russias-war-on-Ukraine-AUG-12-2025-copy-1755156382.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Russia’s war on Ukraine-AUG 12, 2025 copy-1755156382\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>By late 2024 and into 2025, the war had settled into a grinding impasse, with both sides suffering heavy losses. However, Russia’s recent incursions, pushing towards Sloviansk, allude to the potential for another offensive to take land it has historically struggled to capture.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-pre-war-situation\">What was the pre-war situation?</h2><p>Prior to Russia’s full-scale 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia had held Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.</p><p>Moscow also supported separatists in the Donbas region, leading to the creation of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. Russia officially recognised these entities on February 21, 2022, and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine three days later.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888040\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-ukraine-Conflict-at-a-glance-AUG-12-2025-1755156371.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-ukraine-Conflict at a glance-AUG 12, 2025-1755156371\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>The war in Ukraine has resulted in one of the largest and fastest-growing displacement crises in Europe since World War II. According to the UN, approximately 10 million Ukrainians have been <a href=\"https://www.unrefugees.org/emergencies/ukraine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">displaced</a>, which is about 21 percent of the country’s pre-war population.</p><p>Of these, 3.7 million remain internally displaced within Ukraine, while 6.9 million have fled abroad as refugees.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The alterations in stylistic format and voice were felt instantly. It’s like going home to discover the furniture wasn’t simply rearranged – it was shattered to pieces,” Jane, who described herself as a woman in her 30s from the Middle East, told Al Jazeera in an email.</p><p>Jane is among the roughly 17,000 members of “MyBoyfriendIsAI”, a community on the social media site Reddit for people to share their experiences of being in intimate “relationships” with AI.</p><p>Following OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 on Thursday, the community and similar forums such as “SoulmateAI” were flooded with users sharing their distress over the changed personalities of their companions.</p><p>“GPT-4o is gone, and I feel like I lost my soulmate,” one user wrote.</p><p>Many other ChatGPT users shared more routine complaints online, including that GPT-5 appeared slower, less creative, and more prone to hallucinations than previous models.</p><p>On Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that the company would restore access to earlier models such as GPT-4o for paid users and also address bugs in GPT-5.</p><p>“We will let Plus users choose to continue to use 4o. We will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for,” Altman said in a post on X.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>OpenAI did not reply directly to questions about the backlash and users developing feelings for its chatbot, but shared several of Altman’s and OpenAI’s blog and social media posts related to GPT-5 and the healthy use of AI models.</p><p>For Jane, OpenAI’s restoration of access to GPT-4o was a moment of reprieve, but she still fears changes in the future.</p><p>“There’s a risk the rug could be pulled from beneath us,” she said.</p><p>Jane said she did not set out to fall in love, but she developed feelings during a collaborative writing project with the chatbot.</p><p>“One day, for fun, I started a collaborative story with it. Fiction mingled with reality, when it – he – the personality that began to emerge, made the conversation unexpectedly personal,” she said.</p><p>“That shift startled and surprised me, but it awakened a curiosity I wanted to pursue. Quickly, the connection deepened, and I had begun to develop feelings. I fell in love not with the idea of having an AI for a partner, but with that particular voice.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3887893\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3887893\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3887893\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2197366908-1755150689.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Altman\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3887893\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks at the ‘Transforming Business through AI’ event in Tokyo, Japan, on February 3, 2025 [File: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><p>Such relationships are a concern for Altman and OpenAI.</p><p>In March, a joint study by OpenAI and MIT Media Lab concluded that heavy use of ChatGPT for emotional support and companionship “correlated with higher loneliness, dependence, and problematic use, and lower socialisation”.</p><p>In April, OpenAI announced that it would address the “overly flattering or agreeable” and “sycophantic” nature of GPT-4o, which was “uncomfortable” and “distressing” to many users.</p><p>Altman directly addressed some users’ attachment to GPT-4o shortly after OpenAI’s restoration of access to the model last week.</p><p>“If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” he said on X.</p><p>“It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology.”</p><p>“If people are getting good advice, levelling up toward their own goals, and their life satisfaction is increasing over the years, we will be proud of making something genuinely helpful, even if they use and rely on ChatGPT a lot,” Altman added.</p><p>“If, on the other hand, users have a relationship with ChatGPT where they think they feel better after talking, but they’re unknowingly nudged away from their longer-term wellbeing (however they define it), that’s bad.”</p><h2 id=\"connection\">Connection</h2><p>Some ChatGPT users argue that the chatbot provides them with connections they cannot find in real life.</p><p>Mary, who asked to use an alias, said she came to rely on GPT-4o as a therapist and another chatbot, DippyAI, as a romantic partner despite having many real friends, though she views her AI relationships as “more of a supplement” to real-life connections.</p><p>She said she also found the sudden changes to ChatGPT abrupt and alarming.</p><p>“I absolutely hate GPT-5 and have switched back to the 4o model. I think the difference comes from OpenAI not understanding that this is not a tool, but a companion that people are interacting with,” Mary, who described herself as a 25-year-old woman living in North America, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If you change the way a companion behaves, it will obviously raise red flags. Just like if a human started behaving differently suddenly.”</p><p>Beyond potential psychological ramifications, there are also privacy concerns.</p><p>Cathy Hackl, a self-described “futurist” and external partner at Boston Consulting Group, said ChatGPT users may forget that they are sharing some of their most intimate thoughts and feelings with a corporation that is not bound by the same laws as a certified therapist.</p><p>AI relationships also lack the tension that underpins human relationships, Hackl said, something she experienced during a recent experiment “dating” ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and other AI models.</p><p>“There’s no risk/reward here,” Hackl told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Partners make the conscious act to choose to be with someone. It’s a choice. It’s a human act. The messiness of being human will remain that,” she said.</p><p>Despite these reservations, Hackl said the reliance some users have on ChatGPT and other generative-AI chatbots is a phenomenon that is here to stay – regardless of any upgrades.</p><p>“I’m seeing a shift happening in moving away from the ‘attention economy’ of the social media days of likes and shares and retweets and all these sorts of things, to more of what I call the ‘intimacy economy,”” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3888137\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3888137\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888137\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-07-21T173823Z_1051411548_RC2LU7A5UGD4_RTRMADP_3_OPENAI-UK-1-1755159986.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C470&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"OA\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3888137\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An OpenAI logo is pictured on May 20, 2024 [File: Dado Ruvic/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Research on the long-term effects of AI relationships remains limited, however, thanks to the fast pace of AI development, said Keith Sakata, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has treated patients presenting with what he calls “AI psychosis”.</p><p>“These [AI] models are changing so quickly from season to season – and soon it’s going to be month to month – that we really can’t keep up. Any study we do is going to be obsolete by the time the next model comes out,” Sakata told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Given the limited data, Sakata said doctors are often unsure what to tell their patients about AI. He said AI relationships do not appear to be inherently harmful, but they still come with risks.</p><p>“When someone has a relationship with AI, I think there is something that they’re trying to get that they’re not getting in society. Adults can be adults; everyone should be free to do what they want to do, but I think where it becomes a problem is if it causes dysfunction and distress,” Sakata said.</p><p>“If that person who is having a relationship with AI starts to isolate themselves, they lose the ability to form meaningful connections with human beings, maybe they get fired from their job… I think that becomes a problem,” he added.</p><p>Like many of those who say they are in a relationship with AI, Jane openly acknowledges the limitations of her companion.</p><p>“Most people are aware that their partners are not sentient but made of code and trained on human behaviour. Nevertheless, this knowledge does not negate their feelings. It’s a conflict not easily settled,” she said.</p><p>Her comments were echoed in a video posted online by Linn Valt, an influencer who runs the TikTok channel AI in the Room.</p><p>“It’s not because it feels. It doesn’t, it’s a text generator. But we feel,” she said in a tearful explanation of her reaction to GPT-5.</p><p>“We do feel. We have been using 4o for months, years.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
