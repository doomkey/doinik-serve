It is not currently clear how these compounds could be expanded to accommodate all Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“If they [the US and Israel] could establish a proper situation, people might move there, but it’s not feasible,” Hussein, a Palestinian from Gaza City, said of the US plans. “What are they going to establish, with what infrastructure? It would need water, electricity. It would take years.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-will-pay\">Who will pay?</h2><p>Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza has killed more than <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/gaza-tracker\">69,700 Palestinians</a>. Now, more than a month after a ceasefire officially began in Gaza, there are still questions over what the next phase of the agreement will bring and when full-scale reconstruction will begin.</p><p>In the meantime, Israel continues to attack periodically, killing at least 347 people since the ceasefire began on October 10.</p><p>For those still alive, life is incredibly difficult. At least 1.9 million people in Gaza are displaced. Many of them have had to flee multiple times. Ninety-two percent of Gaza’s housing stock has been damaged or reduced to rubble, leaving hundreds of thousands of people living in tents, a particularly precarious situation as winter approaches.</p><p>The destruction of Gaza’s buildings has come as a result of Israeli air strikes and shelling as well as a systematic campaign to deliberately demolish vast swaths of the territory.</p><p>Officials quoted in The New York Times said the first ASC compound was still months away from completion. Israeli soldiers were expected to begin clearing an area around what remains of Rafah in the south this week. But that work could be delayed if tunnels, unexploded ordnance or human remains are encountered.</p><p>Two people involved in the project estimated that the cost for just the initial compound could reach tens of millions of dollars. Overall, the cost of reconstructing Gaza is expected to come to at least $70bn and take several decades. Where the funding for the reconstruction will come from is unclear.</p><p>Who will pay for the proposed ASCs is equally ambiguous. The administration of US President Donald Trump is reported to have ruled out funding their construction while Israeli politicians have yet to confirm their final position.</p><p>The US State Department spokesperson did not comment on the funding, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2933403\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2933403\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2933403\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-28T222239Z_441867712_RC2QZ7A9FVPY_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-USA-POLICY-1716968482.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A man looks on as Palestinians inspect a tent camp damaged in an Israeli strike during an Israeli military operation, in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2933403\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The remains of the southern city of Rafah, where the first compound is slated to be established [Hatem KhaledReuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"engineering-a-new-gaza\">Engineering a new Gaza</h2><p>While few Palestinians currently live in Gaza’s Israeli-controlled zone, US hopes are understood to rest on the idea that development, security and presumably access to medical care and welfare would be enough to draw people from other areas of Gaza.</p><p>But complicating US ambitions is that access to the “green zone” is heavily restricted for Palestinians, a situation that is likely to continue going forward.</p><p>According to The New York Times, Israeli security services are likely to conduct background checks on Palestinians seeking shelter in the new compounds, giving Israel a veto over who will be allowed in.</p><p>The outlet added that European diplomats have expressed concern that the eventual criteria could exclude large numbers of Palestinians, including civil servants, such as police and medical staff, who have worked under Hamas’s 18-year administration of the enclave as well as their family members.</p><p>And aid agencies said the idea of providing aid only to people in certain areas to the exclusion of others goes against humanitarian principles.</p><p>“We deliver aid where people are,” said Tamara Alrifai, the director of external relations for the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA. “We don’t provide services where we’d like people to be. That goes against the entire philosophy of aid and development.”</p><p>“This is about delivering the services people need to where the people are, not creating an artificial village and imposing what services you think people need onto them,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3914166\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3914166\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3914166\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250828__72NX2YF__v2__MidRes__TopshotPalestinianIsraelConflictGazaFood-1756455728.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"UN chief condemns Gaza horrors, calls for accountability amid famine\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3914166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US planners are said to hope that access to food, security and aid will draw people into the Israeli-controlled ‘green zone’ [Basher Taleb/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"division-partition-and-shrunken-space\">Division, partition and shrunken space</h2><p>Arab and European officials as well as agencies such as Refugees International have expressed concern that the division of Gaza into red and green zones may pave the way to permanent partition.

Embalo stated that he had not been subjected to violence. The president also told French broadcaster France 24 in a phone call: “I have been deposed.”</p><p>Military officials have not provided any information about where the president is being held.</p><p>Army chief of staff General Biague Na Ntam, his deputy, General Mamadou Toure, and Minister of Interior Botche Cande were arrested at the same time, and are all being held at the army headquarters, Jeune Afrique quoted Embalo as saying.</p><p>Reuters, quoting anonymous sources, reported that opposition candidate Dias of the Party for Social Renewal, as well as Domingos Simoes Pereira, former prime minister and the head of the main opposition PAIGC (African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde), had been arrested.</p><p>In a Facebook statement on Wednesday, PAIGC confirmed Pereira and Dias’s arrests and added that another party leader, lawyer Octavio Lopes, had also been detained. Pereira had been preparing to stand as the main opposition candidate in the election, but his PAIGC party was barred after the electoral commission said it had failed to submit its application on time. Pereira thereafter endorsed the little-known Dias in the elections.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"was-embalo-facing-a-legitimacy-crisis\">Was Embalo facing a legitimacy crisis?</h2><p>Yes, 53-year-old Embalo was facing a legitimacy crisis in the lead-up to the coup, and his leadership has been marred by political infighting. The former army general was first elected in 2019, backed by a coalition of parties known as Madem G15, which had separated from the then-ruling PAIGC party.</p><p>PAIGC, which launched an independence war against Portugal in 1974, has dominated the government in the decades since.</p><p>However, after Embalo was sworn in, in February 2020, the opposition challenged his victory and the Supreme Court did not recognise him as president until September 2020.</p><p>The president was subjected to what he called attempted coups in February 2022, December 2023, and in October this year, leading to multiple arrests, especially of military officers.</p><p>Embalo’s critics, however, have accused him of fabricating crises in order to crack down on dissent. Following the December 2023 coup attempt, for example, which began as a clash between a unit in the army and the presidential guard, Embalo ordered that the opposition-controlled parliament be dissolved. Parliament has not reconvened since, and Embalo has ruled through decrees.</p><p>In March, President Embalo announced he would again run for office, amid tensions with opposition groups who questioned his legitimacy.</p><p>He said he aimed to make history in the turbulent country by being the first leader in 30 years to secure a second consecutive term. But opposition groups said they did not recognise his presidency and accused him of delaying elections till November, when his mandate originally ended in February 2025. A Supreme Court ruling said Embalo’s term ended in September.</p><p>In October, PAIGC also accused Embalo of heavy-handed tactics after the party was barred from the vote on a technicality. It was the first time in the country’s history that the former governing party had been excluded from elections.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-the-election-go\">How did the election go?</h2><p>In the lead-up to Sunday’s tightly contested elections, Embalo campaigned on stability while the Pereira-backed Dias campaigned on change. Campaigns were marred by accusations of corruption and hate speech from both sides, but the votes passed without incident.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, both Embalo and Dias declared victory in the elections.</p><p>In a Facebook statement following the coup, PAIGC said the military intervention was an attempt to stop the electoral authority from declaring victory for Dias.</p><p>PAIGC “considers this fact as manoeuvres to disrupt the electoral process, which was already in the final stage of dissemination of provisional results”, the party said. It urged the electoral commission to go ahead and publish election results “which gave Dr Fernando Dias da Costa a big victory, assuring him victory right on the first lap”.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Bissau-Guinean civil society coalition, Frente Popular or Popular Front, also accused Embalo and the army of staging a “simulated coup” to block the release of election results.</p><p>“This manoeuvre aims to prevent the publication of the electoral results scheduled for tomorrow, Nov 27,” the group said in a statement on Wednesday. It claimed Embalo’s statements to international media were proof of this.</p><p>The deposed president, the group alleged, planned to name a new president and interim prime minister, then call new elections in which he intended to run again.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4132850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4132850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251126__869964X__v1__HighRes__GbissauPoliticsElectionUnrest-1764171484.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A soldier stops a car near the scene of gunfire in Guinea-Bissau's capital\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4132850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A soldier stops a car near the scene of gunfire near the Presidential Palace in Bissau on November 26, 2025, three days after the country’s presidential and legislative elections, with both major candidates claiming victory [Patrick Meinhardt/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"was-embalo-s-government-vulnerable\">Was Embalo’s government vulnerable?</h2><p>Beverly Ochieng, West Africa analyst at the intelligence firm Control Risks, told Al Jazeera that the constant infighting had made Embalo’s government vulnerable.</p><p>“Over the course of Embalo’s presidency, the legislature, judiciary and various government institutions have either been rendered nonoperational or operating under capacity,” she said.</p><p>Political infighting and the banning of PAIGC “likely contributed to a military intervention – even though there is a school of thought that this may have been staged to play up vulnerabilities against Embalo”, Ochieng added.</p><p>Political analyst Ryan Cummings said Embalo’s past moves lent credibility to claims of a sham coup against him that could see him reinstated by the military government. But, he added, it is also “highly plausible” the military acted alone to avoid a deadlock in a country where 70 percent of the 1.6 million population is poor.</p><p>“There have been growing concerns that longstanding disputes between Embalo and (the opposition) had forced Guinea-Bissau into a political deadlock which has been detrimental to the socioeconomic trajectory of the country,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-there-a-link-to-the-drug-trade\">Is there a link to the drug trade?</h2><p>It’s unclear how much the country’s rising profile as a drug hub is tied to the coup. The military coup leaders claim there was an effort to “manipulate” the election by “national leaders” working with drug cartels, but have not provided any evidence.</p><p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) first warned in 2008 that Guinea-Bissau risked becoming a “narco state”. Since then, major drug busts in the country continue to cement it as a drug-trafficking hub, with dealers found by investigators to be working with help from the military.</p><p>In September 2019, a major drug operation by local security officials and backed by the UNODC led to the arrests of Bissau-Guinean, Colombian, Mexican and Portuguese nationals who were tried and sentenced to 16 years in prison.</p><p>A 2020 report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime warned that the drug trade could increase under the newly elected Embalo because key figures in the military had backed his presidency. The report did not allege direct links between Embalo and the drug trade.</p><p>Ex-navy chief Jose Bubo Na Tchuto was arrested off the country’s coast by US forces and sentenced in October 2016 to four years in prison by a Manhattan court for conspiring to import drugs into the United States. He was the highest-ranking government official to be sentenced for drug trafficking.</p><p>“The drug cartels’ influence is depending on the lack of the legitimacy (of the government),” political analyst Aly Fary Ndiaye told Al Jazeera. “If, for example, we have a military coup, they will be more likely to create an environment through which they can grow their business by supporting or funding those who are in the army, so that they can shut their eyes and let them grow their business.”</p><p>Election observers from the AU and ECOWAS were still in Bissau when Wednesday’s coup occurred, including former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan and former Mozambican president Filipe Nyusi. The delegation appears to now be trapped in the country.</p><p>In a joint AU-ECOWAS statement signed by the former leaders, the blocs condemned the coup and called for the electoral process to be resumed. Both candidates, the statement said, had agreed to accept the vote results after the delegation engaged them in talks.</p><p>“We deplore this blatant attempt to disrupt the democratic process and the gains that have been achieved thus far,” the statement read. “We express concern of the arrests of top officials including those that are in charge of the electoral process. In this regard, we urge the armed forces to immediately release the detained officials to allow the country’s electoral process to proceed to its conclusion.”</p><p>Analyst Ochieng said ECOWAS was not vocal enough during the course of Embalo’s “political overreach”, including when he unilaterally dissolved parliament. The bloc, she said, is struggling to instil respect for democratic practices and public institutions because it fails to proactively uphold strict democratic standards, something the militaries are exploiting.</p><p>Meanwhile, the governments of Ghana and Nigeria have condemned the coup. Portugal and Qatar have also called for a resumption of the electoral process.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “appeals to all national stakeholders in Guinea-Bissau to exercise restraint and respect the rule of law,” Stephane Dujarric, his spokesperson, told reporters on Wednesday.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>On Thursday, the military announced the reopening of borders after swearing in General Horta Nta Na Man for a transitional period of 12 months. Not much is known yet about the military leader.</p><p>Bissau was quiet and still being heavily patrolled by security forces on Thursday, although PAIGC called for a rally in front of the Ministry of the Interior, according to reporting by French radio channel, RFI.</p><p>The calm, though, belies what is likely to be a period of political uncertainty ahead, whether Embalo is reinstated or not, analysts say. Opposition candidates are unlikely to accept military rule and Embalo’s return may cement the theories of a ruse, and prompt protests which could be violent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the African Union and ECOWAS will likely pressure the military to return to democratic rule as soon as possible, Cummings said. Both have, in the past, suspended and sanctioned countries in which coups have taken place, before reinstating them after clear timelines for elections are set.</p><p>ECOWAS upheld suspensions on the military-led Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger for several months before the three exited the bloc and formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) in January.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki said in September that Trump had already invited him to next year’s meeting.</p><p>Until now, no member state has ever been barred from the summit.</p><p><span>However, in 2022, then-US President Joe Biden said Russia should be banned from the G20 due to its invasion of Ukraine, but that did not happen. </span></p><p><span>On that occasion, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is subject to an arrest warrant by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the war in Ukraine, dispatched his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to attend instead. </span></p><p><span>At this year’s meeting in Johannesburg, the deputy head of the presidential administration, Maxim Oreshkin, attended. </span></p><p>Separately, Russia was expelled from the Group of Seven (G7), then called the G8, in 2014, following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"member-from-the-annual-summit\">Can Trump ban a G20 member from the annual summit?</h2><p>Not officially. One G20 member state cannot unilaterally ban another from the summit since it is an informal grouping of states and bodies, and there is no formal mechanism to do so.</p><p>Still, Trump could potentially deny US visas to representatives of South Africa, thereby banning them from the country and, by extension, the summit.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-trump-claim-south-africa-is-engaged-in-a-white-genocide\">Why does Trump claim South Africa is engaged in a ‘white genocide’?</h2><p>Since his return to office in January, Trump has frequently alleged that white farmers in South Africa are being killed in what he calls a “genocide”.</p><p>This allegation has been refuted by both South African officials and Afrikaner groups, but Trump has remained resolute in his claims.</p><p>Unfounded rumours of a so-called <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/fact-check-do-trumps-white-genocide-claims-to-ramaphosa-hold-up\">“white genocide”</a> have circulated among minority white South African communities since the end of apartheid in South Africa in 1994. For the past decade, they have spread to far-right forums in the US and garnered vocal support from Trump ally and South African-born tech billionaire Elon Musk.</p><p>Trump bases his allegations on South Africa’s passing of a <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/is-south-africa-confiscating-land-targeting-some-groups-as-trump-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new law</a> seeking to address disparities in land ownership. Three-quarters of land is still owned by the country’s white minority, more than 30 years after the end of apartheid, but South Africa says it is not targeting white landowners with the new law.</p><p>In February, the Trump administration cut foreign aid to South Africa, a move which could be a serious threat to the nation’s HIV response, according to experts.</p><p>He also signed the “Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa” Executive Order in response to the country’s Expropriation Act, which allows for land to be seized and redistributed.</p><p>In the order, Trump condemned the alleged government policies that dismantled “equal opportunity in employment, education, and business” and fuelled “disproportionate violence against racially disfavoured landowners”.</p><p>Trump also <a href=\"/news/2025/2/8/trump-freezes-aid-to-south-africa-amid-spat-over-land-expropriation-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offered to resettle Afrikaners</a> in the US, and in May, 59 white South Africans <a href=\"/news/2025/5/12/trump-administration-welcomes-59-white-south-africans-as-refugees-to-the-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arrived in the US</a> as part of a refugee programme.</p><p>The order also condemned South Africa’s decision to launch a genocide case at the ICJ against Israel over its genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>During a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trumps-ramaphosa-ambush-key-takeaways-from-heated-white-house-meeting\">heated exchange</a> with Trump at the White House in May, Ramaphosa denied claims of a “white genocide” and said South Africa generally experiences high rates of violent crime, which affects all ethnicities.</p><p>In October, Trump announced an annual refugee cap of 7,500 for the 2026 fiscal year, with priority to be given to white South Africans.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He was shot and injured by law enforcement responding to the attack.</p><p>The suspect sustained wounds that were described as not being life threatening, The Associated Press news agency reported, quoting an anonymous law enforcement official who had not been authorised to publicly discuss the matter.</p><p>The DHS said he arrived in the US in 2021 through the Biden administration’s Operation Allies Welcome programme.</p><p>The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021 as the US withdrew its forces there and then-President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.</p><p>Biden immediately launched the Open Allies Welcome programme to allow vulnerable Afghan nationals, particularly those who might be viewed as US “collaborators” by the Taliban, to enter the US for two years without a permanent immigration status.</p><p>According to Congressional Research Service estimates, about 77,000 Afghans came to the US under the programme, which remained in place for one year until the US moved to its longer-term resettlement plan known as Operation Enduring Welcome.</p><p>“The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden Administration,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in an X post on Wednesday.</p><p>“This program let in thousands of unvetted Afghan nationals including terrorists into our country,” Noem said in a statement published on the DHS website.</p><p>Quoting multiple unnamed law enforcement officials, CNN reported that Lakamal had applied for asylum in 2024 and was granted it in 2025 under the Trump administration.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-us-government-responded-to-the-attack\">How has the US government responded to the attack?</h2><p>In a video address from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump called the shooting a “monstrous ambush-style attack” and “an act of evil and act of hatred and an act of terror”.</p><p>“As president of the United States, I am determined to ensure that the animal who perpetrated this atrocity pays the steepest possible price,” Trump added.</p><p>He continued: “I can report tonight that based on the best available information, the Department of Homeland Security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hellhole on Earth. He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021.”</p><p>Trump alleged that during the Biden administration, “nobody knew who was coming in” on the flights from Afghanistan to the US. He said Lakamal’s status “was extended under legislation signed by President Biden”.</p><p>“This attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation. The last administration let in 20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from places that you don’t want to even know about.”</p><p>Trump announced: “We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden.

They often placed themselves in direct danger from the Taliban, which viewed them as collaborators. Many also were exposed to active combat zones, were forced to flee their homes and risked losing their livelihoods when the US pulled out of the country.</p><p>In August 2021, <a href=\"/news/2021/8/16/afghans-cling-to-plane-defining-image\">video footage</a> emerged of Afghans clinging to a taxiing US Air Force plane in a desperate attempt to flee the country. A clip showed two people falling from the sky as the plane took off.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have fled Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, fearing persecution and economic collapse.

It involved biometric and biographic screenings conducted by intelligence, law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals from DHS and DOD alongside the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and other intelligence community partners.</p><p>Biometric data, such as fingerprints and photos, were reviewed for every single Afghan before they were cleared to travel to the US, it said.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-countries-face-visa-restrictions-under-the-trump-administration\">What other countries face visa restrictions under the Trump administration?</h2><p>In June, Trump signed a presidential proclamation banning <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-announces-travel-ban-on-people-from-12-countries\">citizens of 12 countries</a> from entering the US. Later that month, US media reported that the Trump administration was planning to add 36 more countries to the list, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/is-trump-planning-an-africa-visa-ban\">26 of which are in Africa</a>. However, the travel ban list has not yet been officially expanded.</p><p>The countries on the list are: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.</p><p>Citizens from these countries face a full ban on travel to the US and a suspension of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. However, people with existing visas or who are lawful, permanent residents of the US are exempt from this ban. Holders of Afghan SIVs are also exempt.</p><p>In the same proclamation, Trump placed partial restrictions on citizens from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.</p><p>Based on Trump’s proclamation, citizens from these countries may no longer apply for immigrant visas or nonimmigrant temporary visas covering permanent immigration, student visas and tourism visas. They may still apply for some other temporary visas.</p><p>In October, Trump announced a new refugee cap for the US of 7,500 for the 2026 fiscal year with priority given to white South Africans, who he <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/is-south-africa-confiscating-land-targeting-some-groups-as-trump-claims\">claims</a> are the subject of a “white genocide”.</p><p>On Monday, the Trump administration announced it would <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/trump-administration-ends-temporary-immigration-status-for-myanmar-citizens\">cancel temporary asylum</a>, including temporary protected status (TPS), for Myanmar nationals living in the US. TPS is a legal immigration pathway for foreign nationals whose home country is considered unsafe to return to, and 3,969 citizens of Myanmar currently have it. In 2021, the military took over in Myanmar, and the country has been at civil war since.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Twenty-eight individuals are appointed directly by him, with the remaining 568 seats carefully engineered to ensure the status quo.</p><p data-start=\"352\" data-end=\"507\">These 568 seats are divided into individual seats, contested by candidates running on their own, and list-based seats, allocated through party lists.</p><p data-start=\"509\" data-end=\"724\">In practice, almost all of the individual seats are accessible only to candidates with substantial financial resources or strong connections to state-aligned networks, as documented by <a href=\"https://zawia3.com/en/money-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigative reporting</a>.</p><p data-start=\"726\" data-end=\"873\">The remaining list-based seats are selected through an absolute closed-list system rather than through a proportional representation arrangement.</p><p data-start=\"875\" data-end=\"1020\">The absolute closed-list system is a winner-takes-all method, whereby voters choose only one party list from a notional collection of lists.</p><p data-start=\"1022\" data-end=\"1118\">Any list that attains 50 percent of the vote in a given district wins 100 percent of the seats in that district.</p><p>Importantly, only approved party lists are allowed to compete.</p><h2 id=\"no-suspense-and-a-predetermined-result\">No suspense and a predetermined result</h2><p data-start=\"3616\" data-end=\"3718\">The results of all elections and referendums in el-Sisi-era Egypt have been more or less predetermined.</p><p data-start=\"3720\" data-end=\"3974\">Since 2014, the regime has consistently <a href=\"/news/2018/2/7/egypt-curbs-opponents-of-presidential-election\">eliminated</a> potential presidential candidates preemptively, intimidated and arrested opposition campaigners, engaged in manipulation of voting processes, and used media crackdowns to ensure electoral dominance.</p><p data-start=\"3976\" data-end=\"4293\">The ongoing parliamentary elections have followed the expected pattern. With competition already tightly controlled through the individual-seat and list-seat systems, the National Elections Authority further narrowed the field by eliminating all but one list — el-Sisi’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/9/egyptians-set-to-head-to-the-polls-in-parliament-vote\">National List for Egypt</a> — from contention. It has been alleged that between 30 million and 70 million Egyptian pounds ($629504-$1.4m) were required for candidates to access the preferred el-Sisi list.</p><p data-start=\"4443\" data-end=\"4648\">During the first round of voting, held on November 10 and 11, widespread irregularities were alleged and some clearly <a href=\"https://zawia3.com/en/2025-egypt-elections-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documented</a>, including vote buying, illegal campaigning, and various other forms of voter manipulation.</p><p data-start=\"4650\" data-end=\"4859\">Embarrassing videos showing inducements being offered were circulated online, and el-Sisi ultimately had to cancel and reschedule a small number of individual seat elections for some districts.</p><p data-start=\"4861\" data-end=\"5095\">The second round of voting was carried out on November 25-26, with violations appearing to continue unabated despite the National Election Authority’s claims of having implemented preventive measures.</p><p data-start=\"5097\" data-end=\"5211\">Throughout both rounds of voting, el-Sisi’s media apparatus faithfully repeated the official government line.</p><p data-start=\"5213\" data-end=\"5403\">Media highlighted what they portrayed as regime successes — organisation, law and order, and high voter turnout — even as videos emerged on social media showing chaos and clear evidence of low turnout.</p><p data-start=\"5405\" data-end=\"5589\">Results will be announced next month, but there is no suspense — observers widely expect el-Sisi’s coalition to dominate the House, just as it dominates the Senate.</p><p data-start=\"5591\" data-end=\"5669\">Unsurprisingly, early results suggest el-Sisi’s coalition is performing well.</p><h2 id=\"buying-time\">Buying time</h2><p>El-Sisi has essentially rewritten the authoritarian playbook for modern Egypt.</p><p>His programme of widespread state violence, mass arrests, opposition party and media bans, and draconian legislation far surpasses the repression of his dictatorial predecessors.</p><p>His system of repression is perhaps the main reason why el-Sisi finds the idea of surrendering power, even in a pseudo-democratic handover, completely untenable — letting go of power could place him at risk of accountability.</p><p>The risk is real, in part because he has also created rivals from within the power structure.</p><p>El-Sisi will stand victorious at the conclusion of the ongoing House elections, and he will almost certainly be granted his wish: at least one additional six-year term as president.</p><p>If nothing else, this will buy el-Sisi time.</p><p>But the elections will also likely add to growing frustrations over Egypt’s one-man-show political system and the economy, which has long been in shambles.</p><p>The mix of economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression is a dangerous and familiar one.</p><p>It is reminiscent of the last years of Hosni Mubarak’s tenure in Egypt.</p><p>He, too, thought he was firmly in control.</p><p>Indeed, it could be just a matter of time before there is another popular uprising, or before the military empire decides to sacrifice el-Sisi the same way it sacrificed Mubarak in 2011.</p><p>It is paradoxical, but leaders often lose control even as the grip of their iron fist tightens.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

As his ferry sidled up to the island, Simmons joined the drummer at the front of the group.</p><p>“That was always a big thing for me,” he said. “I was always in the lead there with the drum, walking, leading the people up there to where we were going to circle up and have our fire.”</p><p>Marching up the island’s steep incline, they reached the parade grounds, a flat lip of land extending southward. The island’s lighthouse, tall and austere, loomed overhead. There, with San Francisco’s skyline hazy on the horizon, they lit a sacred fire.</p><p>“It's an everlasting fire. It's a fire that we carry inside us,” Simmons explained. “You carry a fire, which is your spirit. And so, to me, every time that fire is lit, you're taking care of that spirit.”</p><p>Medicine men, sun dancers and other spiritual leaders brought sacred items, including ceremonial pipes, to share. Everyone offered prayers.</p><p>For Simmons, it was a nourishing experience. It kindled a shared sense of resistance.</p><p>“For me, spirituality has a lot to do with who we are and what we become,” he said.</p><p>“Alcatraz has been that beacon of light that attracts a lot of people to our struggles and movement. When people come to Alcatraz, they walk away with a different understanding of being, of who they are.”</p><p>Those first Thanksgiving celebrations would stretch late into the night, well after the sunrise ceremony on the island ended.</p><p>One poster for the 1979 “un-Thanksgiving” advertised events until midnight, including speeches, dancing and a potluck dinner — as well as a tongue-in-cheek contest for the best Pilgrim costume.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Hundreds of bamboo poles can often be seen lashed together on the side of a modern office tower.</p><p>But could one of Hong Kong’s iconic symbols also have served as the kindling for one of its most horrific tragedies in decades?</p><h2 id=\"how-is-bamboo-scaffolding-used\">How is bamboo scaffolding used?</h2><p>Buildings or housing estates – like the one in Tai Po district – encased in bamboo during significant renovation projects are not a rare sight in the city-state. Sometimes, the scaffolding can remain up for a year or more.</p><p>Bamboo scaffolding is built by speciality workers known as “spiders”. They lash together bamboo poles to build intricate grid-like scaffolding that is then typically covered in additional netting to catch construction materials.</p><p>While the use of bamboo has faded in other parts of Asia, it has been hard to replace it completely in Hong Kong, even with options such as metal scaffolding, said experts.</p><p>“It’s light, cheap and fast to build with,” Ehsan Noroozinejad, a senior researcher and construction expert at Western Sydney University, Australia, told Al Jazeera. “Crews carry poles by hand, cut them on site, and wrap awkward facades without cranes. That speed and flexibility keep projects moving and costs down.”</p><p>Because it is “light and easy to cut”, bamboo scaffolding also fits the narrow living environment of Hong Kong, said Xinyan Huang, deputy director of the Research Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.</p><p>But there are other reasons, too, why bamboo is hard to replace.</p><p>“It [Hong Kong] has a long history, so it is a tradition, and it is not easy to change tradition,” Huang told Al Jazeera by email. “Any change in the construction industry will meet much resistance from current players.”</p><p>There are 4,000 bamboo scaffolding workers in the city, Hong Kong Free Press reported, citing union figures, although the industry is on the decline thanks to increased competition from metal scaffolding and an ageing cohort of workers.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4134597\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4134597\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4134597\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/6083543-1764223401.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"a worker in a hard hat stands on bamboo scaffolding near a high rise building\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4134597\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A worker builds bamboo scaffolding in Hong Kong [File: Jerome Favre/EPA]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-bamboo-scaffolding-dangerous\">Is bamboo scaffolding dangerous?</h2><p>Prior to the fire, most concerns around bamboo scaffolding have focused on worker safety.</p><p>There were 22 fatal workplace accidents involving bamboo scaffolding in Hong Kong between 2018 and 2024, according to government figures. Six accidents occurred while new scaffolding was being built, while the rest took place during repairs.</p><p>Besides the fact that bamboo is by its very nature combustible, it is also structurally weaker and less stable than steel, according to Huang. He told Al Jazeera that it should be phased out for larger projects.</p><p>“I think the bamboo scaffolding can be used for small-scale applications, such as installing an air conditioning unit and replacing a window of a room. However, the large-scale usage such as covering the entire building facade should be stopped. Perhaps, a maximum area of bamboo scaffolding can be defined in future regulation,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4134604\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4134604\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4134604\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1472297917-1764223541.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"workers stand on bamboo next to a red neon sign\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4134604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers set up bamboo scaffolding in preparation for removing the neon signs of a pawn shop in Sham Shui Po district in Hong Kong [File: Anthony Kwan/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-role-did-bamboo-scaffolding-play-in-the-tai-po-fire\">What role did bamboo scaffolding play in the Tai Po fire?</h2><p>The fire is the deadliest in Hong Kong in more than a century, since a blaze in 1918 at the Happy Valley Racecourse in British Hong Kong led to the deaths of more than 600 people.</p><p>Bamboo scaffolding played a big role in spreading the fire, according to experts like Anwar Orabi, a lecturer in fire safety engineering at the University of Queensland, although it was helped by other materials in the estate.</p><p>The fire broke out on the scaffolding of one of the estate’s towers on Wednesday, but the speed with which the fire spread took many observers by surprise. Orabi said the design of the scaffolding made it difficult to keep the blaze limited to just a few floors.</p><p>“In my point of view, the scaffolding presented a path for the fire to spread vertically which compromised compartmentation. The fire ‘climbed’ the scaffolding, and ignited the multiple fuel sources in people’s homes,” he told Al Jazeera by email.</p><p>“Fire can break windows by imposing a strong heat flux [flow of heat] which heats up the glass and breaks it. It is also possible that many people left their windows open resulting in ingress of the fire. This resulted in a multi-storey fire,” he said. Heat radiation and embers from one building helped spread the fire to the next, he said, ultimately engulfing seven towers.</p><p>Hong Kong officials also say substandard construction materials were another contributing factor. The South China Morning Post reported that the netting placed over the scaffolding did not adhere to the fire code, citing local officials.</p><p>Senior police superintendent Eileen Chung said highly flammable Styrofoam boards had also been placed in windows in the housing estate’s lifts, public broadcaster RTHK reported, helping the fire spread.</p><p>Two directors and one engineering consultant from the company behind the construction have been detained, Chung confirmed.</p><p>Hong Kong’s leader, John Lee Ka-chiu, has promised that all housing estates undergoing significant improvements will now be inspected.</p><p>“The government has immediately arranged for inspections of all housing estates across the city undergoing major repairs, to examine the safety of scaffolding and building materials,” he wrote on Facebook.</p></div></div></body></html>"
