Hamas sources have also described him as the second-in-command of the group’s armed wing, after Izz al-Din al-Haddad.</p><p>The latest Israeli killings comes as Hamas and Israel are expected to move toward the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/hamas-and-israel-move-towards-phase-two-of-us-backed-gaza-plan\">phase two</a> agreement of the ceasefire which will address Israeli Israeli withdrawal, Palestinian disarmament and the formal end to the war.</p><p>The head of Hamas abroad, Khaled Meshaal, is trying to convince the United States administration to follow the Palestinian group’s own “vision” on how to deal with disarmament and its military arsenal, a major sticking point in the second phase of the group’s two-month ceasefire with Israel.</p><p>Speaking on Al Jazeera Arabic’s Mawazine programme on <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/hamas-has-its-own-disarmament-vision-as-gaza-truce-enters-critical-phase\">Wednesday</a>, Meshaal said Hamas aims to “create a situation with guarantees that war does not return between Gaza and the Israeli occupation”, which included the group potentially handing over its weapons, though it wants input on the process.</p><p>Earlier this month, senior Hamas official Basem Naim said that the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\">US draft</a> of the phase two agreement required “a lot of clarifications”. While the group was ready to discuss “freezing or storing” weapons during the ongoing truce, he said it would not accept that an international stabilisation force take charge of disarmament.</p><p>“We are welcoming a [United Nations] force to be near the borders, supervising the ceasefire agreement, reporting about violations, preventing any kind of escalations,” he said, adding that Hamas would not accept the force having “any kind of mandates” on Palestinian territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That letter became a strange symbol of hope, a reminder that maybe, someday, my life could continue. But everything else was falling apart so quickly that it was hard to believe in anything.</p><p>My family and I were displaced five times as the war intensified. Each time, we left something behind: books, clothes, memories, safety.</p><p>After the first temporary truce, we went home for a short time.

About 130 people could cross at that time, dual-nationality holders, family reunification cases and a handful of others.

The Irish air felt clean, the sky impossibly open. I should’ve been happy, but I was engulfed by crushing guilt, the joy overshadowed by the pain of separation.</p><p>I wasn’t completely alone. A Palestinian colleague from Gaza had arrived in April 2024, and two friends were also in Ireland.

I would lie awake, straining to hear danger.</p><p>The darkness wrapped me like a suffocating blanket, amplifying every creak of the building, every whisper of the wind.</p><p>During the day, people on the street moved quickly, eyes darting, alert.</p><p>Water was a precious commodity; we would line up for hours at distribution points, often only to receive a fraction of what we needed. It was never enough.</p><h2 id=\"no-human-should-live-like-that\">No human should live like that</h2><p>Five times, we fled in search of safety, packed in minutes, hearts racing with fear.</p><p>In one building where dozens of displaced families stayed, people slept on thin mattresses, shoulder to shoulder. Children cried quietly, adults whispered, trying to comfort one another, but every explosion outside sent ripples of panic through the rooms.</p><p>No human being should have to live like that, but millions of us did.</p><p>As I sit in Dublin, I carry the weight of my family’s struggles with me, a constant reminder of the life I left behind.</p><p>The guilt of survival is a heavy burden, but I hold onto hope that one day, I can return and help rebuild what has been lost.</p><p>Even now, far from Gaza, I feel it. You don’t leave war behind; you carry it with you like a second heartbeat.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4172255\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4172255\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4172255\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/rawand-photo-workshop-in-Dublin-1-1765692719.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A workshop at the University of Dublin welcoming the Palestinian students [Courtesy of Rawand Alagha]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4172255\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A workshop at the University of Dublin welcoming the Palestinian students [Courtesy of Rawand Alagha]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"watching-a-world-i-m-not-part-of-yet\">Watching a world I’m not part of yet</h2><p>I often stop in the campus courtyards.

Students laugh over coffee, rush to lectures and complain about assignments. Life moves so seamlessly here.</p><p>I message my family every day. Some days, they reply quickly. Other days, hours pass with no response. Those silent days feel like torture.</p><p>But I’m determined. Being here is about rebuilding a life, about honouring the people I left behind.</p><p>Survival comes with weight.</p><p>I carry the dreams of those who couldn’t leave.

Particularly given the lack of an obvious replacement.</p><p>Alonso, meanwhile, said he hoped Madrid’s current woes could make the team stronger.</p><p>“We are having difficulties, but we can grow,” he said. “If we can get past these tough times, change the dynamic, maybe in a few weeks we’ll look back and think ‘we went through a lot, but it made us stronger.'”</p><p>On feeling the criticism and doubts, Alonso said he is not surprised.</p><p>“You have to live with it, and when you’re the coach of Real Madrid, you have to be prepared to face it bravely, responsibly and self-critically, knowing that things can change,” the former Madrid midfielder said. “Despite the result, I’ve seen positive things individually and collectively. Other things haven’t gone so well, but we’re still in it.”</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-real-madrid-s-last-la-liga-game\">What happened in Real Madrid’s last La Liga game?</h2><p>Los Blancos went into meltdown in their last outing in the Spanish top flight as two players saw red in <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/7/real-madrid-implode-as-celta-vigo-earn-shock-2-0-win-at-the-bernabeu\">the 2-0 home defeat</a> by Celta Vigo.</p><p>Alvaro Carreras and Fran Garcia were sent off, and are suspended as a result for the trip to Alaves.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"are-there-any-glimmers-of-hope-for-real-madrid\">Are there any glimmers of hope for Real Madrid?</h2><p>One player they seem to have recovered, not only from injury but also his form, is winger Rodrygo, as he ended his dismal run against City.</p><p>After 32 games without finding the net, the Brazilian finished superbly to send his team ahead.</p><p>Beyond that, he was back to his electric best, transformed from the diminished figure seen in recent months.</p><p>“It’s one of today’s good pieces of news to see him with that individual quality, that flair, and he also scored, which was important for him,” said Alonso.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-latest-on-vinicius-junior-s-real-fallout\">What is the latest on Vinicius Junior’s Real fallout?</h2><p>On the other flank, Rodrygo’s compatriot Vinicius Junior offered a less convincing display.</p><p>The winger’s anger at Alonso when withdrawn in the Clasico in October was a flashpoint which played its part in Madrid’s season flying off the rails.</p><p>Since that moment, Spanish media have reported a growing rift between the players and the coach, suggesting various complaints about his selection decisions and the tactical work they have to do.</p><p>It appears to be healing, with the support Alonso was offered, although whether Madrid’s stars retain the work ethic they displayed in a glamourous European tie on a wintry Sunday night at Alaves’s Mendizorroza stadium will be a good barometer.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-season-gone-so-wrong-for-real-madrid\">How has the season gone so wrong for Real Madrid?</h2><p>Alonso looked to be off to a good start to his career at Bernabeu, with Kylian Mbappe scoring at will and his team winning its first seven games of the season. Even a loss to Atletico Madrid was partially forgotten after <a href=\"/sports/2025/10/26/mbappe-bellingham-score-as-real-madrid-edge-barcelona-in-fiery-el-clasico\">a victory over Barcelona</a>.</p><p>Then something went wrong. A loss at Liverpool in the Champions League last month sent the team into a nosedive. Losing at Anfield is acceptable for any club; three consecutive draws to Rayo Vallecano, Elche and Girona in La Liga set off the alarm bells at a Madrid that considers itself the best in the world.</p><p>But worse was to come: the humiliating 2-0 defeat by Celta Vigo followed by the 2-1 loss to Pep Guardiola’s City. Both of those losses came in front of some disgruntled fans, who jeered the team at Bernabeu.</p><p>Now all bets are off on Alonso’s future just months after he left Bayer Leverkusen following his exceptional job at the German club that culminated in the Bundesliga title in 2024.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-alaves-faired-this-season\">How have Alaves faired this season?</h2><p>Alaves is strong at home with only two losses in eight games in Vitoria this season, including a 1-0 win over Real Sociedad last round.</p><p>They opened their campaign with just three wins in 10. Their recent run of four wins in seven has seen them climb to midtable, with half an eye on European qualification, although the other four matches in that run were all defeats.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-the-last-time-real-madrid-played-alaves\">What happened the last time Real Madrid played Alaves?</h2><p>Real were 1-0 winners when the sides met in La Liga at Alves on April 13. Eduardo Camavinga scored the only goal after 34 minutes of a game that saw Kylian Mbappe shown a red after 38 minutes.</p><p>The home side were also reduced to 10 men when Manu Sanchez was sent off in the 72nd minute.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This is the 29th meeting between the sides, with Real Madrid winning 23 of the encounters, while Alaves have claimed victory on only three occasions.</p><h2 id=\"alaves-team-news\">Alaves team news</h2><p>Nikola Maras and Facundo Garces will once again be absent due to injury and suspension, respectively</p><p>Jon Guridi has had a knee problem but will be assessed before the match.</p><h2 id=\"real-madrid-team-news\">Real Madrid team news</h2><p>Alonso said Kylian Mbappe is fit to play on Sunday after the forward missed the Champions League defeat by Manchester City.</p><p>“We’ve got Kylian back, he’s ready to play, and we’ll see and decide [if he starts], that’s good news obviously,” Alonso said on Saturday.</p><p>Real Madrid are without several injured players for the game in Vitoria, including Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal and Eduardo Camavinga.</p><p>Garcia, Carreras and Endrick are also suspended. Defender Dean Huijsen is likely to return.</p><p>“Evidently, despite the players we’ve got out, we have strong enough players and a strong enough team,” Alonso added.</p><h2 id=\"alaves-predicted-starting-lineup\">Alaves predicted starting lineup:</h2><p>Sivera; Otto, Tenaglia, Pacheco, Parada; Guevara; Calebe, Ibanez, Suarez, Rebbach; Boye</p><h2 id=\"real-madrid-predicted-starting-lineup\">Real Madrid predicted starting lineup:</h2><p>Courtois; Valverde, Rudiger, Huijsen, Asencio; Guler, Tchouameni, Ceballos; Bellingham; Rodrygo, Vinicius</p></div></div></body></html>"

The military posted a video on social media showing plumes of dense black smoke over what it said was the UN facility.</p><p class=\"p1\">Bangladesh’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, in a statement, said he was “deeply saddened” by the attack, and put the toll at six dead and eight wounded.</p><p class=\"p1\">He asked the UN to ensure that his country’s personnel were offered “any necessary emergency support”.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The government of Bangladesh will stand by the families in this difficult moment,” Yunus added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">The oil-rich Abyei is a disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan. The UN mission has been deployed there since 2011, when South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan.</p><p class=\"p1\">Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan to allow “a comprehensive, inclusive and Sudanese-owned political process” to settle the conflict.</p><p class=\"p1\">Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023, when a power struggle between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country. The conflict has killed more than 40,000 people, though rights groups consider the figure  a significant undercount.</p><p class=\"p1\">The fighting has recently centred on Kodrofan, particularly since the RSF <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/8/after-el-fasher-we-must-refuse-a-new-normal-of-mass-atrocities-in-darfur\">took control of el-Fasher</a>, the military’s last stronghold in the western region of Darfur.</p><p class=\"p1\">The war has wrecked urban areas and has been marked by atrocities, including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings, which the UN and rights groups have said amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur.</p><p class=\"p1\">The war has also created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and pushed parts of the country into famine.</p><p>The attack comes just a month after the UN Security Council <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/un-extends-peacekeeping-mission-in-disputed-abyei-region-for-another-year\">voted to renew</a> the UNISFA peacekeeping mission for another year.</p><p>Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping missions, and its troops have long been deployed in Abyei.</p><p>UNISFA’s 4,000 police and soldiers are tasked with protecting civilians in the region, which has been plagued by frequent armed clashes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
