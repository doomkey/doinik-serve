This is why they found this separatist group in northwestern Somalia,” Fiqi told Al Jazeera.</p><h3>Israel’s military base in Gulf of Aden</h3><p>The Somali minister also accused Israel of seeking to establish a military base on the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea, saying Israel “wants to create a military base to destabilise the region”.</p><p>A Somaliland official said those discussions were taking place, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/somaliland-denies-agreeing-to-host-israeli-bases-resettle-palestinians\">contradicting an earlier denial</a> from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. Deqa Qasim, an official in the ministry, told Israel’s Channel 12 that an Israeli military base is “on the table and being discussed”, though its establishment depends on the terms.</p><p>Houthi leaders have <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/any-israeli-presence-in-somaliland-will-be-a-target-houthi-leader\">said</a> they would consider any Israeli presence in Somaliland, just across from the Gulf of Aden, a threat and a possible military target.</p><p>Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known locally as Cirro, sought to assuage fears among neighbouring countries, saying Israel’s recognition of Somaliland was not directed against anyone, during a speech welcoming the establishment of relations with Israel.</p><p>When Saar <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/israeli-fm-visits-somaliland-after-world-first-recognition-storm\">visited</a> Hargeisa, the capital of the breakaway region, last week, a Somaliland readout said security was among the topics discussed during the meeting.</p><p>The visit drew immediate condemnation from 22 countries and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in a joint statement that called Saar’s January 6 trip a “clear violation” of Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Fiqi’s comments came amid continuing international outcry over Netanyahu’s decision in December to recognise Somaliland, a breakaway part of Somalia comprising the northwestern portion of what was once the British Protectorate.</p><p>On Saturday, the 57-member OIC held an extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia on Israel’s recognition of Somaliland, adopting two resolutions: one condemning Israel’s move and another expressing support for Palestine.</p><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in an interview with TRT Haber that Turkiye, together with several other Muslim countries, had coordinated efforts to prevent other states from recognising Somaliland, suggesting that additional countries had been considering the move.</p><p>Amid claims by Somaliland officials that several countries would follow Israel’s lead, and rumours that India would follow, a spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs pushed back, dampening hopes of any such move.</p><p>“India has longstanding ties with Somalia. We continue to underline the importance of respecting the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>On Friday, President Mohamud <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/top-somaliland-official-defends-israel-ties-amid-arab-backlash\">appealed</a> via a national address to Somaliland’s leaders to engage in negotiations with Mogadishu and change course on ties with Israel.</p><p>He said if the separation of Somalia were the direction they wanted to move in, wider recognition would not be possible without the consent of the Somali government and would leave them in diplomatic limbo.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At the time, they were arrested at SDF checkpoints around Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh and taken into custody,” Smith added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna, reporting from Damascus, said calm has returned to Aleppo, and that the United States was instrumental in brokering the agreement between the SDF and the government.</p><p>“The US is in a unique position, because it enjoys good relations with the SDF and the government,” Oghanna said, noting that Washington has been working with the Kurdish-led force against ISIL (ISIS) for more than a decade.</p><p>With the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad’s government in late 2024, the US has also built close ties with the rebel commander who became Syria’s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa. The Syrian president met US President Donald Trump at the White House last year and has formally joined the US-led coalition against ISIL.</p><p>The fighting in Aleppo began on Tuesday in the predominantly Kurdish neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud, Ashrafieh and Bani Zaid, amid tensions over a failure to implement <a href=\"/news/2025/3/10/syria-merges-kurdish-led-syrian-democratic-forces-into-state-institutions\">a March 2025 agreement</a> to reintegrate the Kurdish forces into state institutions.</p><p>Oghanna, Al Jazeera’s correspondent, said “all this fighting broke out because of a failure to integrate the SDF into government institutions.”</p><p>The deadline for the deal passed at the end of last year, and the SDF refused to leave areas that have been under its control since the early days of the Syrian war, which erupted in 2011.</p><p>Oghanna said that although the fighting in Aleppo has ended, “the fault line, the backdrop for this fighting, remains”.</p><p>“There are many difficult issues in Syria, but the greatest threat to national stability and unity remains this question of whether the SDF join Damascus and be under Damascus’s control,” he said.</p><p>The SDF has a large amount of fighters, estimated at between 50,000 to 90,000. They are mainly in the northeast of the country and control almost a quarter of Syria’s territory.</p><p>Oghanna said the fighting in Aleppo makes the SDF integration “look far less likely”.</p><p>“There are also other sticking points, which might make the SDF refuse to put down their weapons,” he said.</p><p>“The SDF don’t want to cede control of the country’s northeast, and they want to maintain a certain amount of autonomy in order to have the governance in northeastern Syria.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

increasing pressure, especially their new manager, Xabi Alonso.</p><p>Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at a final that carries so much more weight when it holds the tag: El Clasico.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-real-madrid-and-xabi-alonso-under-pressure\">Why are Real Madrid and Xabi Alonso under pressure?</h2><p>Alonso has steadied Real Madrid’s ship in recent weeks after a tumultuous period, but the Spanish Super Cup final seems a make-or-break moment for the beleaguered coach.</p><p>On the brink of the sack after a dire run of form, Alonso responded by leading Madrid to five consecutive victories, the fifth coming on Thursday against Atletico Madrid in the semifinals.</p><p>Beating Super Cup holders Barcelona would bring Alonso the first trophy at the helm.</p><p>A second victory in two matches against Barcelona would buy Alonso time and breathing room.</p><p>But succumbing to Hansi Flick’s side would give Real president Florentino Perez a further excuse to remove a coach he hired in June but has never appeared convinced by.</p><p>Spanish media reported that Perez was set to sack Alonso if the team lost against Manchester City in the Champions League on December 10, which they did, but the team’s improved performance bought the coach another chance.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4229693\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4229693\" class=\"wp-caption

final between Real and Barca?</h2><p>Barcelona trounced Real Madrid 5-2 in last year’s final, which was also in Jeddah.</p><p>It was a damaging blow for then-manager Carlo Ancelotti, while proving a springboard for Hansi Flick – fresh in his role as Barca boss.</p><h2 id=\"how-important-is-spanish-super-cup-to-real-madrid-and-barcelona\">How important is Spanish Super Cup to Real Madrid and Barcelona?</h2><p>Lifting the Super Cup worked for Flick’s fledgling tenure at Barcelona last season, galvanising his team to claim La Liga and the Copa del Rey.</p><p>In the three seasons prior to that, the Super Cup winners also went on to win the Spanish top flight.</p><p>“Two things are clear – as it’s the tournament we’re playing for [now], it’s the most important,” said Alonso.</p><p>“If you ask me about it in terms of order of priority in the season, it’s the fourth.”</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-latest-on-real-madrid-forward-kylian-mbappe\">What’s the latest on Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe?</h2><p>Real are boosted by <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/10/real-star-mbappe-could-face-barcelona-but-madrid-not-kamikaze-over-health\">the return of Mbappe</a> to the squad after he missed <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/8/real-madrid-to-face-barcelona-in-spanish-super-club-after-beating-atletico\">the 2-1 win</a> over Atletico and Sunday’s 5-1 thrashing of Real Betis in La Liga while recovering from a knee sprain.</p><p>The coach said Mbappe has as much chance of starting against Barcelona as anyone else and is confident the forward has recovered, even though he was expected to miss another week.</p><p>With 29 goals in 24 appearances across all competitions, Mbappe is Real Madrid’s top goal scorer this season and their clear, stand-out performer.</p><p>The striker has netted six goals against Barcelona in five games since joining Real Madrid.</p><p>His return could make life trickier for Alonso because the team does not seem to function at its best when Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham line up together.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4229699\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4229699\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

player who has become essential for Alonso in recent weeks is Brazilian winger Rodrygo.</p><p>After a miserable run of 32 games without scoring, the right-winger has burst into life with three goals and three assists in his last five matches.</p><p>On the opposite flank, Vinicius is struggling for form.</p><p>Since finishing second in the 2024 Ballon d’Or rankings, he has dipped far from his top level.</p><p>Vinicius has not scored in his last 16 outings for Real Madrid, and Alonso must decide whether to line up with him against Barca.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-the-last-time-barcelona-played-real-madrid\">What happened the last time Barcelona played Real Madrid?</h2><p>The Catalans beat Madrid four times in four encounters last season, but Alonso’s side beat their rivals 2-1 in October in La Liga.</p><p>“We have to win; we lost two finals against them last year,” urged Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.</p><p>“They have to win, too. After losing the Clasico in La Liga, they’ll want revenge.”</p><h2 id=\"barcelona-ready-for-mbappe-return-for-real-madrid\">Barcelona ready for Mbappe return for Real Madrid</h2><p>Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said Mbappe is the man of the moment, but backed his team to succeed despite his arrival in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“At the moment, Mbappe is the best striker… he’s scored many, many goals, and he’s a world-class player, that’s what I can say,” admitted Flick, whose side <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/8/barcelona-rout-athletic-bilbao-5-0-to-reach-spanish-super-cup-final\">hammered Real Betis 5-0</a> in their semifinal on Wednesday.</p><p>However, the German coach was eager to point out that last season, his side beat Mbappe’s Madrid on all four occasions they met.</p><p>Barca thrashed them 5-2 in last season’s Spanish Super Cup final, as well as winning both La Liga Clasicos and the Copa del Rey final.</p><p>In their one meeting with Alonso’s side this season, Madrid secured a 2-1 league win.</p><p>“How many Clasicos have we played in the last year and a half? And how many did we win? We lost one,” said Flick.</p><p>“I know he’s a fantastic player, and for him, with space behind the [defence], he’s really great…</p><p>“We will adapt something, like we always do, but it’s not especially about Mbappe, it’s about Real Madrid, it’s about how we want to play and how we expect they want to.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3437743\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3437743\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3437743\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-12T213641Z_1579013626_UP1EL1C1O13W3_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-SPAIN-BAR-RMA-REPORT-1736718736.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C554&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soccer Football - Spanish Super Cup - Final - FC Barcelona v Real Madrid - King Abdullah Sports City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - January 12, 2025 FC Barcelona's Lamine Yamal celebrate with the trophy and teammates after winning the Spanish Super Cup REUTERS/Pedro Nunes\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3437743\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Barcelona’s Lamine Yamal celebrates with the trophy and his teammates after winning the Spanish Super Cup last season [Pedro Nunes/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-spanish-super-cup\">What’s the Spanish Super Cup?</h2><p>The Super Cup pits together the winners and runners-up of both the Spanish domestic league, La Liga, and Spain’s domestic cup competition, Copa del Rey.</p><p>Although first played in 1982, between the league and cup winners alone, it was expanded to four teams in 2020.</p><p>Barcelona are the current league champions, with Real Madrid finishing second.

The Saudi-led coalition accused the UAE of helping him escape on a flight that was ‌tracked to a military airport in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>On Friday, the STC delegation, which was in Riyadh for talks, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/yemens-separatist-southern-transitional-council-announces-its-dissolution\">announced the dissolution</a> of the group in an apparent admission of defeat.</p><p>Secretary-General Abdulrahman Jalal al-Sebaihi said the group would shut down all of its bodies and offices inside and outside of Yemen, citing internal disagreements and mounting regional pressure.</p><p>But in a statement issued on Saturday, the STC said it had held an “extraordinary meeting” following the announcement in Riyadh, and declared it “null and void”, saying it had been made “under coercion and ‌pressure”.</p><p>It also reiterated calls for mass protests in southern cities on Saturday, warning against any attempts that target the group’s “peaceful activities”.</p><p>The armed forces of the Yemeni government said on Saturday that it would “strike firmly and decisively against anyone who seeks to tamper with security or disrupt public order”, without ​making any reference to the protests.</p><p>Separately, Al Jazeera’s Ahelbarra said that al-Alimi, the head of the PLC, in his Saturday address also issued a warning that extended beyond southern Yemen, telling the Houthis – who control northern Yemen – that they can “negotiate a settlement with us… or you will face repercussions, including the potential for a military action”.</p><p>The <a href=\"/gallery/2014/9/27/in-pictures-houthis-take-over-sanaa\">Houthis took over Yemen’s capital</a>, Sanaa, in 2014, claiming they were the only legitimate authority across Yemen.

As the team to beat, people will try to find all sorts of reasons to say Morocco has an advantage,” Regragui said after his team’s 2-0 win over Cameroon in the quarterfinals.</p><p>“The only advantage that Morocco has at this Africa Cup is playing in front of 65,000 spectators. The rest is on the field, we speak on the field.”</p><p>On the field, however, Cameroon might have had two penalties if experienced referee Dahane Beida hadn’t decided in favour of the home team.</p><p>Morocco defender Adam Masina was involved in both, appearing to catch Bryan Mbuemo’s right boot after missing the ball when Cameroon was trying to level the match, then, in the final minutes, appearing to strike Etta Eyong’s head with his elbow in the penalty area.</p><p>Beida, who refereed the final at the last edition, also decided not to show Bilal El Khannouss a second yellow card for stopping Danny Namaso on a counterattack shortly before Ismael Saibari wrapped up the win.</p><p>“Many people want to believe or make others believe that we have advantages from the referees. Personally, I saw penalties that could have been awarded to us. As for the referees, I never talk about the referee,” Regragui said.</p><p>The Morocco coach then spoke about a penalty his team was not awarded against South Africa in the previous tournament in the Ivory Coast, and wrongly said he was “suspended for no reason” at that tournament.</p><p>Regragui was suspended for two games at the previous edition for his role in a dispute with Congo captain Chancel Mbemba at the end of their game that led to a melee between players and team officials.</p><p>“The statistics always show us as better than the others,” Regragui said, getting back to this edition. “We create far more opportunities than our opponents. Not a single goal was disallowed for Cameroon, or for any other team. When you want to get rid of something, you find a pretext.”</p><p>Mali and Tanzania also had penalty claims against Morocco rejected in previous games, while Morocco also had a penalty awarded after a VAR check in the draw against Mali.</p><p>Thousands of whistling Moroccan fans tried to help referee Abdou Abdel Mefire make up his mind while he consulted replays before he eventually decided to penalise Mali’s Nathan Gassama for handball. He initially ignored Jawad El Yamiq’s penalty-area foul on Mali’s Lassine Sinayoko before awarding it some minutes later after a VAR check.</p><p>There did not appear to be any VAR checks against Cameroon on Friday.</p><p>Morocco has played all its matches at the nearly 70,000-capacity Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where the vast majority of supporters are shouting for the home team, creating an intimidating atmosphere for opponents and referees.</p><p>“Today, Cameroon played the match they needed to play. I think they lost against a better team. I don’t think any player, coach, or anyone else is going to talk about the refereeing because there were a lot of physical battles today. This is Africa. But today, I think we deserved our victory,” said Regragui, who added his team also deserved to win all its previous games.</p><p>“That’s it. We’re trying to play on that field. I don’t think it’s fair play from those who want to see us fall. The best team will win this tournament, inshallah,” he said.</p><p>Morocco will play Nigeria at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, which is also the venue for the final on January 18.</p><p>The Atlas Lions are among the heavy favourites to win the tournament, having become the first African nation to reach the semifinals of a FIFA World Cup at the Qatar 2022 edition.</p></div></div></body></html>"
