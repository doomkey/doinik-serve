Speaking at the airport, Modi said his visit was a “path-breaking journey” – it was the first time an Indian prime minister had visited Israel. Netanyahu recalled their first meeting in New York in 2014, where, he said, “we agreed to break down the remaining walls between India and Israel”.</p><p>Nine years later, as Modi prepares to fly to Israel on February 25 for his second visit, he can largely claim to have accomplished that mission, analysts say. A relationship that was once frowned upon in India, and then carried out clandestinely, is now one of New Delhi’s most public friendships. Modi has frequently described Netanyahu as a “dear friend”, despite the International Criminal Court having issued an arrest warrant in late 2024 for the Israeli premier over alleged war crimes carried out during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Indian diplomats and officials have justified the country’s pivot towards Israel as a “pragmatic approach” – Israel, with its tech and military expertise, has too much to offer to be ignored, they argue – balanced by efforts from New Delhi to strengthen ties with its Arab allies.</p><p>Yet, it has come at a cost, analysts say: to Palestine, and India’s relationship with it, and, according to some experts, to India’s moral credibility.</p><p>“The so-called realist turn of India has cost its moral power, which it used to enjoy in the Global South,” said Anwar Alam, a senior fellow with the Policy Perspectives Foundation think tank in New Delhi.</p><p>Amid an ongoing war in the Palestinian territory, Modi’s visit “amounts to legitimising the apartheid Israeli state”, Alam told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4328326\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4328326\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4328326 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-15T072243Z_712583578_RC1A37723FE0_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771696568.jpg?resize=770%2C536&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4328326\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi extends his hand for a handshake with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, during a photo opportunity ahead of their meeting at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, on January 15, 2018 [Adnan Abi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"an-ideological-alliance\">An ideological alliance</h2><p>India was a staunch advocate for Palestine in the post-colonial world order, with major leaders backing Palestinian independence. In 1947, India opposed the United Nations plan to partition Palestine. And four decades later, in 1988, India became one of the first non-Arab states to recognise Palestine.</p><p>The end of the Cold War – India leaned towards the Soviet Union despite officially being non-aligned – forced a change in New Delhi’s calculations. Alongside an outreach to the United States, India also established diplomatic relations with Israel in January 1992.</p><p>Since then, defence ties have anchored the relationship, which has also expanded on other fronts in recent years.</p><p>Modi’s rise to power in India in 2014 proved to be the catalyst for the biggest shift in relations. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has an ideology rooted in the vision of making India a Hindu nation, a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – an approach that mirrors, in many ways, Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland. Both Modi and Israel view “Islamic terrorism”, which critics say is also shorthand for justifications needed to pursue broader anti-Muslim policies, as major threats.</p><p>Under Modi, India has become Israel’s largest weapons buyer. And in 2024, as Israel waged its war on Gaza, Indian weapons firms sold Israel rockets and explosives, according to an Al Jazeera investigation.</p><p>Ahead of Modi’s upcoming visit, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding that aims to further deepen defence ties, with India exploring the joint development of anti-ballistic missile defence with Israel. In Jerusalem, Modi is scheduled to address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.</p><p>“Modi’s address is special because of how it underlines the scale of the shift in relations under the Bharatiya Janata Party towards an overtly pro-Israel policy,” Max Rodenbeck, project director at the Washington-based Crisis Group’s Israel-Palestine department, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>But Modi’s visit is also personal for Netanyahu, Rodenbeck said. Israel is months away from a national election that is, in effect, a referendum on Netanyahu’s government – from the intelligence failures that enabled the October 7 attack by Palestinian groups to the war on Gaza that followed, as well as his attempts to weaken judicial independence through reforms.</p><p>The visit appears “as almost a personal favour to Netanyahu by boosting his image as an international statesman just as Israeli election campaigning is getting underway”, Rodenbeck said.</p><p>While several Western leaders have visited Israel since it began its genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023, few leaders from the Global South have made the trip.</p><p>At a time when the Gaza war has shrunk the set of countries willing to be seen as Israel’s friends, especially among emerging economies, Modi’s visit is significant.</p><p>Israel does not “have many friends” globally at the moment, said Kabir Taneja, the executive director of the Middle East office at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “So India is playing that role,” he added. “[Modi’s visit] sort of shows that Israel is not fully isolated.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4283295\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4283295\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4283295 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2017-07-06T123333Z_1290474066_RC152665C200_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-INDIA-MODI-1770028791.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4283295\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attend an Innovation conference with Israeli and Indian CEOs in Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 6, 2017 [Oded Balilty/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-july-2017-visit\">The July 2017 visit</h2><p>In many ways, Modi’s visit to Israel this week will look to build on his July 2017 trip, which was a watershed moment in the bilateral ties, analysts note.</p><p>No Indian Prime Minister had previously visited Israel, but even lower-level diplomats would, until then, pair their Israel visits with parallel engagements in the Palestinian territory.</p><p>Modi broke with that policy. He did not visit Palestine in 2017, only making a trip there in 2018, by which time he had already also hosted Netanyahu in New Delhi. It had also been the first visit by an Israeli premier to India.</p><p>The 2017 Modi visit has been under scrutiny recently. An email released by the US Justice Department as part of the Jeffrey Epstein files showed that the late disgraced financier had advised a billionaire close to Modi during his trip.</p><p>After the visit on July 6, Epstein, a convicted sex offender, had emailed an unidentified individual he referred to as “Jabor Y”, saying: “The Indian Prime minister modi took advice. and danced and sang in israel for the benefit of the US president. they had met a few weeks ago.. IT WORKED. !”</p><p>India’s Ministry of External Affairs has dismissed these claims as the “trashy ruminations” of a convicted criminal.</p><p>Nonetheless, Modi’s visit to Israel solidified the bilateral relationship. Trade between the two nations has grown from $200m in 1992 to more than $6bn in 2024.</p><p>India is still Israel’s second-largest Asian trading partner after China in goods, dominated by diamonds, petroleum, and chemicals. India and Israel signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) in September last year and have both been looking to close negotiations on a free trade deal.</p><p>At the same time, people-to-people ties have grown as well. After Israel banned Palestinians from working in the country following the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, thousands of Indians lined up to work in Israeli construction companies.</p><p>“India and Israel have a fairly deep strategic and economic relationship that has been flourishing since Prime Minister Modi came to office,” said the Observer Research Foundation’s Taneja.</p><p>Modi was also among the first world leaders to condemn the Hamas-led attack and throw India’s support behind Israel.</p><p>“It really, really feeds into India’s posture against terrorism,” Taneja said about the India-Israel ties. “Israel is a country that India sees facing similar crisis when it comes to terrorism.”</p><p>India accuses Pakistan of sponsoring armed attacks on its territory and in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has accepted that its nationals have, in some instances, been behind these attacks, but has rejected accusations that it has trained or financed the attackers.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4328328\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4328328\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4328328 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-17T084710Z_1793531265_RC16D84BE4F0_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771696577.jpg?resize=770%2C572&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4328328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, tie a garland made of cotton threads to the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stands next to them, at Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad, India, on January 17, 2018 [Amit Dave/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"over-the-horizon-a-different-middle-east\">Over the horizon, a different Middle East?</h2><p>Despite its close ties with Israel, New Delhi under Modi has not completely abandoned its position on the Palestinian cause, calling for a two-state solution and peace through dialogue. But it has been increasingly hesitant to criticise Israel over its war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory.</p><p>India’s historical support for the Palestinian cause is rooted in its pivotal role in the non-alignment movement, the Cold War-era neutrality posture adopted by several developing nations. Even before India gained independence, the leader of its freedom struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, decried the “imposition of Jews over Arabs” through the creation of Israel.</p><p>India now no longer calls its approach non-alignment, instead referring to it as “strategic autonomy”.</p><p>“The Middle East is the only geography where this policy actually functions, and also provide[s] dividend[s],” Taneja told Al Jazeera. “India has good relations with Israel, Arab powers and Iran alike. One of the reasons [it works is] because India does not step into regional conflicts and confrontations.”</p><p>But under pressure from US President Donald Trump, India has stopped buying oil from Iran and taken steps to end its work on developing the strategically significant Chabahar port, which New Delhi viewed as a gateway into landlocked Central Asia and Afghanistan.</p><p>Now, Trump is threatening to attack Iran. The US has amassed warships and jets near Iran, even as Washington and Tehran continue to engage in diplomatic talks.</p><p>“I suspect India may be looking over the horizon to a Middle East where Iran has suffered heavy attack from the US and Israel, and no longer projects power in the region. In these circumstances, Israel will emerge as something of a regional hegemon,” said the Crisis Group’s Rodenbeck.</p><p>“India is perhaps positioning itself to benefit. Also, Modi sees Israel as influential in Washington, and may hope that friendliness to Israel wins points with Congress and Trump, which India badly needs.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

And they have to do it quick and they have to do it efficiently, because if not, there is going to be hell to pay in terms of violence,” he said.</p><p>Vigil said the Trump administration has done little to address the US side of the equation, despite pressuring Mexico on drug trafficking.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of weapons flow from the US into Mexico annually – a stark contrast to Mexico’s single military-run gun store, which sells just 6,500 firearms a year – yet the Republican Party has shown no appetite for curbing those exports, he said.</p><p>Similarly, the administration has made no meaningful push to reduce domestic drug demand, he said.</p><p>“If there is no demand or consumption, there’s not gonna be any cartels. It is a big problem,” he said. “But the Trump administration does nothing in terms of drug education, treatment of drug addiction – none of that.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Prominent American conservative journalist Tucker Carlson’s interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has caused quite a stir. Since it was released on Friday, observers from across the political spectrum in the United States have taken to social media to comment.</p><p>Indeed, the interview highlighted — perhaps more than any other political or media spectacle — the growing suspicion that American officials may be more loyal to a foreign country than they are to the US. This may well turn out to be a defining moment for how Americans view their government’s relationship with Israel.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-true-friend\">Israel’s ‘true friend’</h2><p>Huckabee, who is also a Baptist minister and former governor of Arkansas, was confirmed as US ambassador to Israel in April 2025. The news of his appointment was welcomed by the Israeli government and various pro-Israel groups, and he was hailed as a “true friend of Israel”.</p><p>That Israel is quite close to Huckabee’s heart was made clear throughout his interview with Carlson, as he repeatedly parroted Israeli talking points.</p><p>He spoke of Israel’s “biblical right” to the land; referred to the occupied West Bank as “Judea and Samaria”; and even <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/absurd-and-provocative-huckabee-faces-firestorm-for-israel-border-stance\">appeared to approve</a> of Israel expanding its territory to other parts of the Middle East.</p><p>He repeatedly spoke of Israeli interests as US interests, often used “we” seemingly including Israel, and even insisted that the “problem on the border with Lebanon” was an issue Americans should care about. He defended his meeting with Jonathan Pollard, the former American intelligence analyst convicted of spying on the US for Israel, and for advocating for his early release from prison.</p><p>Huckabee went as far as taking a jab at the US Army in his effort to defend the violations of the Israeli military in Gaza.</p><p>When Carlson pressed him about Israel’s killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he appeared to suggest that the Israeli military is more careful about avoiding civilian casualties than the US military.</p><p>After Huckabee argued that Israel’s war on Gaza produced a “lower number of civilians killed” than any modern urban war, Carlson pressed him for a reference point.</p><p>The ambassador offered two US wars — in Iraq and Afghanistan — as comparisons, suggesting that Israeli military commanders have been more concerned about protecting civilian life than their American counterparts.</p><p>A US ambassador publicly arguing that a foreign military is more humane than his own country’s armed forces inevitably raises questions about where his primary loyalty lies.</p><p>But Huckabee is, of course, not the only “true friend of Israel” within the US political elite.</p><p>The US Congress, on both sides of the aisle, has been known to give boisterous standing applause to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu every time he visits.</p><p>Huckabee’s boss, US President Donald Trump, has repeatedly claimed he is “the best friend to Israel… they’ve ever had”.</p><p>Trump’s predecessor, President Joe Biden, has proudly declared he is a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/i-am-zionist-how-joe-bidens-lifelong-bond-with-israel-shapes-war-policy-2023-10-21/\">Zionist</a> and ensured full support and impunity for Israel as it carried out genocide in Gaza.</p><p>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has boasted that he goes to Israel every two weeks “whether I need to or not”.</p><p>Eric Adams, former New York City mayor, chose to visit Israel at the end of his tenure and <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/11/17/us-news/eric-adams-meets-with-netanyahu-on-taxpayer-funded-israel-trip-as-he-rips-mayor-elect-zohran-mamdani/\">said</a> that as mayor of America’s largest city, he had been serving Israel.</p><p>And the list goes on.</p><p>For the longest time, declarations of loyalty to Israel were seen as a political advantage in US politics. But this may well be changing.</p><h2 id=\"a-wake-up-call\">A wake-up call</h2><p>American academics have long been interested in Israel’s oversized influence on US politics. Scholars like John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have written extensively about the issue.</p><p>But for many years, this scrutiny was largely confined to academia or left-wing activist circles. Conservatives and liberals labelled such critics as conspiracy theorists or anti-Semites.</p><p>The Carlson-Huckabee interview has perhaps let the cat out of the bag on the American right.</p><p>What makes the interview important is not simply the substance of Huckabee’s remarks, but the interviewer, venue, audience, and underlying message of the line of questioning.</p><p>A hugely popular conservative media figure travelled to Israel and publicly pressed a sitting US ambassador on whether American interests are being subordinated to Israeli interests. He questioned the theological and historical underpinnings of Zionism, criticised Israel’s treatment of Palestinian Christians, and asked why US tax dollars are sent to Israel.</p><p>In his responses, the ambassador appeared to speak more as a representative of the Israeli government than the United States government.</p><p>Judging by Huckabee’s <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/american-politics/article-887416\">defensive</a> reaction after the interview and its social media fallout, he is learning an important lesson: appearing to put Israel first and America second is no longer an asset, but a liability, for American politicians.</p><p>Elected American officials will be watching the public reaction carefully — especially in light of polling data showing that American public opinion towards Israel has <a href=\"/opinions/2025/9/22/us-public-opinion-on-israel-is-changing-us-policy-will-have-to-as-well\">shifted</a> dramatically in recent years.</p><p>The political incentive that has driven decades of unconditional support for Israel has now been weakened. The political calculus, too, is changing — it may be politically advantageous for American officials to adopt more evenhanded, even openly critical, approaches to Israel.</p><p>This alone marks a significant shift.</p><p>Carlson’s interview with Huckabee did not create that shift, but it brought it into the heart of the American right. If the question “America first or Israel first” can now be asked openly in conservative circles, then important political boundaries have already been broken.</p><p>The Carlson-Huckabee interview could be the wake-up call that American politics needed to break free from the outsized influence of a Middle Eastern country that has long undermined US interests.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They also meet in the English League Cup final on March 22.</p><p class=\"p1\">It proved to be a tough start to life as Tottenham manager for Igor Tudor, who has made a habit of picking up good results early in his tenures at previous clubs.</p><p class=\"p1\">Not this time, though. Tottenham did equalise two minutes after conceding the opener to Eze when Randal Kolo Muani dispossessed Declan Rice and drilled home a finish for 1-1 in the 34th minute.</p><p class=\"p1\">Gyokeres made it 2-1 with a shot from the edge of the area in the 47th, and Eze stretched the lead in the 61st with a rebound after Bukayo Saka’s shot was saved. Gyokeres scored again in stoppage time.</p><p class=\"p1\">Arsenal have 10 league games remaining in their bid for a first top-flight title since 2004.</p><p>Eze has scored six league goals this season, of which five have been against Spurs. Asked why he holds that record against their rivals, he told Sky Sports: “I don’t know. I try to score every single game. It seems to work quite a lot against Tottenham. It’s a feeling you get.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Elsewhere in the Premier League on Sunday, ‌Liverpool midfielder Alexis Mac Allister struck a winner deep into ⁠stoppage time as ⁠his side snatched a scarcely-deserved 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest in their Premier League clash.</p><p class=\"p1\">After a pedestrian ⁠90 minutes in which they barely managed a shot on target, Mac Allister lit the fuse with a stoppage-time effort that was ⁠ruled out for handball before rifling home a rebound in the 97th minute to snatch the win.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, with doubts swirling around the future of Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner, his team dug out a 1-0 win over last-place Wolverhampton thanks to a last-minute goal.</p><p class=\"p1\">Evann Guessand prodded home a far-post finish after coming on as a substitute.</p><p class=\"p2\">Fulham climbed above Sunderland into the top half of the table after becoming just the second visiting side to win at the Stadium of Light this season.</p><p class=\"p2\">Raul Jimenez’s double secured a 3-1 victory for Marco Silva’s men.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And yet, it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”</p><p>According to the US media, the airpower Washington is amassing in the region is the greatest since its invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the past few days alone, the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">US has deployed</a> more than 120 aircraft to the Middle East, while the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, is on its way to join the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group that is already positioned in the Arabian Sea.</p><p>Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi pushed back swiftly.</p><p>“Curious to know why we do not capitulate?” he said in a post on X. “Because we are Iranian.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In a separate television interview on CBS’s Face the Nation, Araghchi described Iran’s nuclear programme as a matter of national “dignity and pride”, noting that the country’s scientists had developed the technology independently after enduring two decades of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\">US sanctions</a>, the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/13/israel-kills-nuclear-scientists-strikes-sites-in-iran-who-did-it-target\">targeted killings</a> of Iranian researchers and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/6/iran-demands-accountability-for-israel-and-us-after-war-of-aggression\">joint US-Israeli strikes</a> on nuclear facilities last June.</p><p>“We have developed this technology by ourselves, by our scientists, and it is very dear to us because we have created it – we have paid a huge expense for that,” he said.</p><p>“We’re not going to give it up. There is no legal reason to do that while everything is peaceful and safeguarded” by the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Araghchi said.</p><p>As a “committed member” of the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/17/what-is-the-npt-and-why-has-iran-threatened-to-pull-out-of-the-treaty\">Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)</a>, which requires states with no nuclear weapons not to seek or acquire them, Iran is “ready to cooperate with the agency in full”, Araghchi added.</p><p>But he stressed that under the treaty, Tehran also has “every right to enjoy a peaceful nuclear energy, including enrichment”.</p><p>“Enrichment is a sensitive part of our negotiations. The American team knows about our position, and we know their position. We have already exchanged our concerns, and I think a solution is achievable,” the minister noted.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-role\">Israel’s role</h2><p>Araghchi said Iran’s delegation was focused exclusively on nuclear issues during the current negotiations, rebuffing efforts by Washington to expand the talks to cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its support for regional armed groups.</p><p>He said Iran was preparing a draft proposal that could “accommodate both sides’ concerns” and suggested any eventual agreement could exceed the terms of the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/iran-says-restrictions-on-nuclear-programme-terminated-as-deal-expires\">2015 nuclear deal</a> brokered under President Barack Obama.</p><p>“There are elements that could be much better than the previous deal,” he said, without elaborating. “Right now, there is no need for too much detail. But we can agree on our nuclear programme to remain peaceful forever, and at the same time, for more sanctions [to be] lifted.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But analysts warned that deep structural obstacles remained.</p><p>Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, told Al Jazeera that Iran is likely to put forward a proposal that goes beyond anything they ever offered, but even that may not be enough.</p><p>“Trump has been sold a narrative by the Israelis that portrays Iran far, far weaker than it actually is. As a result, he’s adopting maximalist capitulation positions that are simply unrealistic based on how the power reality actually looks,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Unless this gets corrected, even if the Iranians put forward a very far-leaning proposal that is extremely attractive to the US, Trump may still say ‘no’, because he’s under the false belief that he can get something even better.”</p><p>A separate fault line has also emerged between the US and Israel over the scope of any potential agreement.</p><p>Mark Fitzpatrick, a former director of the nonproliferation programme at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said Trump appeared focused narrowly on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has pressed for a far broader dismantling of Iran’s military capabilities, including its ballistic missile arsenal.</p><p>“The Iranian nuclear programme is what’s important to Trump. And if he can get no enrichment, he would take that deal,” he said.</p><p>“Israel has a three-pronged goal. Trump just has the nuclear goal. I don’t think he would feel obliged to keep pressing because Netanyahu wanted the other things,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

South Africa in their first cricket match of the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup and now must win their next two games to have a chance of reaching the semifinals.</p><p>The defending champions were bowled out for 111 in 18.5 overs while chasing a target of 188 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India on Sunday.</p><p>It was the cohosts’ first loss of the tournament and also ended their 12-match winning streak in the T20 World Cup that they had carried on from their title-winning run in 2024.</p><p>South Africa’s bowlers put on a near-perfect display against a strong Indian batting lineup, and were backed by their fielders to leave the pre-tournament favourites reeling.</p><p>India lost their in-form opener Ishan Kishan on the fourth ball of the innings to the offspin bowling of South Africa’s captain Aiden Markram while trying to hit against the spin.</p><p>One-down batter Tilak Varma was the next to fall as he was caught behind off the first ball of Marco Jansen’s over.</p><p>India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav and out-of-form star batter Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild their innings until Sharma fell in the fifth over after scoring 15 runs off 12 deliveries.</p><p>Incoming batter Washington Sundar and Yadav were the next two wickets to fall as India failed to build a big partnership in front of a large home crowd.</p><p>A 35-run partnership between all-rounders Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube lifted the Indian run chase briefly, but South Africa’s disciplined bowling and near-faultless fielding resulted in regular dismissals for the home side.</p><p>When Dube fell for 42 off 37, India’s fate was sealed.</p><p>Jansen’s superb bowling earned him four wickets for 22 runs off 3.5 overs , while left-arm spin bowler Keshav Maharaj took three for 24 in his four overs.</p><p>All of South Africa’s bowlers were economical, with Lungi Ngidi leading the way by conceding only 15 runs in his four wicketless overs.</p><p>Earlier, player of the match David Miller’s crucial innings of 63 runs off 35 balls stabilised South Africa’s innings after they were reduced to 20-3 in four overs.</p><p>He shared a 97-run partnership with Dewald Brevis, who scored 45 off 29 balls, as the pair resurrected the Proteas after Markram decided to bat first after winning the toss in the first Super Eight match in Group 1.</p><p>Despite Miller’s dismissal in the 16th over, South Africa were able to post a formidable total of 187-7, thanks to a 24-ball 44 not out by Tristan Stubbs at the end of the innings.</p><p>Jasprit Bumrah picked up 3-15 off his four overs.</p><p>The loss propels South Africa to the top of Group 1 in the Super Eight stage, with India at the bottom with a net run rate of -3.80.</p><p>The defending champions must win their remaining two games to have a chance of qualifying for the semifinals.</p><p>West Indies and Zimbabwe are the other two teams in their group and will face each other on Monday.</p><p>South Africa face the West Indies on Thursday, while India play Zimbabwe on Friday.</p></div></div></body></html>"
