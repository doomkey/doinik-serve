Only six weeks later, as people were still trying to absorb life in post-war northern Gaza, the war returned, even more brutal.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In mid-March, we were woken to the sound of bombs – a sound that had never really left us. This time, Israel added the weapon of starvation, blocking the entry of everything, even aid.</p><p>And so it went: War, bombardment, blood, hunger, and the constant race to secure a single meal.</p><p>Seasons of abundance passed us by, Eid and feast days, while tables were bare. No holiday cookies, no coffee, no chocolate. Nothing.</p><p>People made do by offering water, and some stopped receiving visitors, hiding their poverty.</p><p>This year’s Eid, supermarket shelves had been bare for months.</p><p>A vendor set out a table with thin fingers of sweets his wife had made at home from sugar, sesame, and flour. One little piece sold for 10 shekels (about $3).</p><p>I wasn’t surprised. Sugar and flour were priceless, sold by the gramme, like gold.</p><p>That day, I went from place to place with my children, trying to find any sign of celebration.</p><p>I was surprised at myself for hoping, even subconsciously, that it being Eid might change things, that perhaps food would enter.</p><p>But I told myself: What would it being Eid matter in Gaza? Nothing changes. It’s just another day, the same reality. A day in Gaza means bombs in the sky, and hunger and deprivation of joy on the ground.</p><p>I decided not to go see my family in the north for Eid and turned back home.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3802258\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3802258\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3802258\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-25-at-10.15.25-AM-2-1750975763.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1027&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iyas and Maram\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3802258\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maram Humaid’s son Iyas has lived most of his life in war [Maram Humaid/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Not only because I stood at a street corner for more than an hour and a half looking for a car or even an animal-drawn cart to take us north, but also because I felt joy was dead, no matter how hard I tried. So I returned, broken, my children trailing behind me.</p><p>I had enough money to buy them new clothes, but all my money couldn’t buy them a cookie.</p><p>I collapsed onto a couch at home, wondering at the wrath that seemed to have been unleashed on us in Gaza while the rest of the planet carried on, celebrating Eid as famine consumed us.</p><h2 id=\"the-passing-of-days\">The passing of days</h2><p>As the days passed, they drained us.</p><p>Day after day, I began to lose my desire to work, to write, to keep listening to people’s stories.</p><p>What’s the point of listening to the stories of the hungry when the world has grown accustomed to our protruding bones? What’s the point of covering a massacre that isn’t ending?</p><p>I had no energy left. I would think of a story, but my mind would tell me to conserve what energy remained.</p><p>My days narrowed to counting how much flour, rice, and sugar we had left. I cooked lentils over an open, smoking fire for my children. I worried about the last of the yeast, worried about how to find more firewood, craved a cup of coffee as if it were a dream, and scrolled through photos of once-abundant tables.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>We were seeing people die for a bag of flour or a food parcel, and crowds gathering at night to go to aid distribution points.</p><p>I had never stopped thinking about leaving Gaza throughout the war, but my motivation changed as the thoughts got sharper.</p><p>I was dreaming of taking my children somewhere they could eat whatever they wanted.</p><p>I want to title all this humiliation and suffering in my memory as: “So we do not forget.”</p><p>How could I forget, when even now, whenever I pass a stall full of fruits and vegetables, I gasp and stare, my heart pounding with prayers that this blessing will not disappear again?</p><p>How could I forget, when I still remember my shock and emotion in late September when I entered a supermarket and saw shelves of food? I went into a buying frenzy.</p><p>I took a bit of everything: Canned goods, chocolate, chips, cream cheese, flour, legumes. I felt like I was carrying treasures, even at double the price.</p><p>Since then, whenever I enter a grocery shop, anxiety, fear, and exhaustion overwhelm me. I buy what I need and what I don’t need.</p><p>Food is more available, yet my mind tells me that this abundance will not last.

All of it throws us into a state of emergency, waiting for the sound of a missile.</p><h2 id=\"achievements\">‘Achievements’</h2><p>The other night, just before the end of the year, I was joking with my father and my siblings, who have been sheltering with us since September, when Israel forced people out of the north.</p><p>We wanted to imitate the social media “achievements” trend, where friends and families gather around a cake, and each person lights a candle and details an achievement for the year.</p><p>We began – without a cake – under dim LED lights, because electricity had been cut for months.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>When my turn came, I said my greatest achievement this year was retaining my mental and psychological faculties.</p><p>I hadn’t even finished my sentence before everyone burst into laughter.</p><p>“Who told you that you still have your mental and psychological faculties?” my sister choked out around her laughter.</p><p>I fell silent, stunned by their reaction, then laughed along with them when I realised the weight of what I had said.</p><p>What is this, you fool? What psyche, what sanity? God forgive you, Maram.</p><p>After what you mentioned above, and what you didn’t mention, and everything you will never mention, is there still room to speak of mental and emotional stability?</p><p>It was the most honest ending to this year.</p><p>An ending where I fully understood the limits of my strength and that I had reached the end of it, yet somehow I managed to keep going.</p><p>This is not defiance, nor strength.

But it is said to harbour plans to carve out its own nation in southern Yemen, causing conflict with its partner, the internationally recognised Yemeni government led by the PLC.</p><p>The Saudis have accused its coalition partner, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), of arming the STC, whose military operation is now threatening to split Yemen into three, while also posing problems to Riyadh’s own national security.</p><p>The UAE has denied those allegations, insisting that it supports Saudi Arabia’s security.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday, the UAE expressed its “deep concern” over the ongoing escalation and called on the Yemenis “to prioritise wisdom and exercise restraint to ensure security and stability in the country”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Saudi-backed coalition was formed in 2015 in an attempt to dislodge the Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen’s north.</p><p>But after a brutal, decade-long civil war, the Houthis remain in place while the Saudi and Emirati-backed factions attack each other in the south.</p><p>On Friday, air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition killed 20 people, according to the STC.</p><p>Late on Friday, the UAE announced the return of all Emirati armed forces personnel from Yemen, signalling a possible detente with Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The UAE’s defence ministry said that the withdrawal of its forces from Yemen is in accordance with its decision “to conclude the remaining missions of counter-terrorism units”.</p><p>“The process has been conducted in a manner that ensured the safety of all personnel and carried out in coordination with all relevant partners,” the ministry said in a statement published on the Emirates News Agency website.</p><p>Amid the UAE’s announcement of a withdrawal, the STC unilaterally declared that it aims to hold <a href=\"/news/2026/1/2/yemeni-province-launches-operation-to-take-bases-back-from-separatist-stc\">a referendum on independence</a> from the north in two years.</p><p>In an interview with Al Jazeera, former Yemeni diplomat and parliament member Ali Ahmed al-Amrani, however, dismissed the idea of secession as a solution to the Yemeni crisis, saying it “does not reflect a national consensus”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hisham Al-Omeisy, a political and conflict analyst focusing on Yemen with the European Institute of Peace, warned that if not resolved, the latest violence in the south could mark the start of a dangerous new phase in the war, with rival forces seeking to reshape control on the ground.</p><p>“We’re going to be basically seeing a bloody conflict, at least in the coming few days, to draw a new map in the south,” he added.</p><p>“This is prolonged fighting,” Al-Omeisy told Al Jazeera, describing a situation in which “warring factions are trying to gain territory and secure the upper hand.</p><p>“This is a proxy war within a proxy war,” he said, adding that the consequences could extend far beyond Yemen’s borders.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The definition provides 11 examples of anti-Semitism, six of which involve Israel.</p><p>They include “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor” and “applying double standards” to Israel.</p><p>“I think it’s wonderful that Mayor Mamdani took measures on day one to reinforce our rights to free speech, which included our right to criticize and oppose Israeli apartheid and genocide,” said YL Al-Sheikh, a Palestinian-American writer active in the Democratic Socialists of America.</p><p>“The IHRA being implemented as government policy isn’t about combatting antisemitism but about stifling dissent and this should be something all Americans oppose.”</p><h2 id=\"israel-weighs-in\">Israel weighs in</h2><p>The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs decried Mamdani’s moves on Friday, saying that the newly inaugurated mayor is showing “his true face”.</p><p>“This isn’t leadership. It’s antisemitic gasoline on an open fire,” it said in a post on the social media platform X.</p><p>Separately, Amichai Chikli, Israel’s minister of diaspora affairs, deployed Islamophobic language to criticise Mamdani’s decision.</p><p>He called the mayor a “Hamas sympathiser” and drew a connection between him and the Muslim mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.</p><p>“When a Muslim Brotherhood Islamist whose slogan is ‘Globalize the Intifada’ takes control of New York City or London, these are exactly the decisions you get,” Chikli wrote on X.</p><p>Neither Mamdani nor Khan has any known connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p><p>Issa said the intense Israeli response is not about the mayor’s policy moves but is rather aimed at controlling the narrative.</p><p>“Israel’s main approach – at the highest level, at the level of the Foreign Ministry – has been to push for the criminalisation of protected speech through these warped definitions of anti-Semitism like the IHRA,” she said.</p><p>“Since they’re losing in the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/new-poll-shows-plunging-us-public-support-for-israels-war-on-gaza\">court of public opinion</a>, the response now is to push for the criminalisation of dissent.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Issa also called Chikli’s attack on Mamdani “blatant Islamophobia, racism and disinformation”.</p><p>“They’re trying to promote these accusations that have no basis in reality whatsoever,” Issa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But from their perspective, any support for Palestinians, any opposition to Israel’s genocide or the conduct of its military – whether in Gaza or the West Bank, over the last two years, over the last decades – none of that is acceptable.”</p><p>Al-Sheikh said it was “absurd” that Israel is trying to impose its preferences on local policies in New York.</p><p>“Even Americans who aren’t Palestinian or pro Palestine can see this is strange and inhibits our rights,” Al-Sheikh said.</p><p>“It’s also weirdly counterproductive on Israel’s part since it only makes Mamdani look better. A single policy paper that said you can’t criticise a country was repealed and now they claim it is the end of the world, but ‘you should be allowed to criticise any country you want’ is the universal American position.”</p><p>Israel was not alone, however, in denouncing Mamdani’s actions. The administration of President Donald Trump also issued a warning to the Mamdani administration.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said her office would be vigilant “to ANY AND ALL violations of religious liberties” <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-citys-mayor\">in New York</a>.</p><p>“We will investigate, sue, and indict as needed,” Dhillon wrote in a social media post.</p><p>Palestine solidarity activists often stress that criticising Israeli abuses should not be conflated with attacking Judaism.</p><h2 id=\"mamdani-s-rise\">Mamdani’s rise</h2><p>Mamdani has been a vocal critic of Israeli policies against Palestinians, prompting accusations of anti-Semitism from Israel’s supporters.</p><p>But he has repeatedly promised to protect Jewish residents. During his inauguration ceremony, he pledged to continue the Mayor’s Office to Combat Anti-Semitism (MOCA), an Adams-era development, and he told reporters his administration would “celebrate and cherish” Jewish New Yorkers.</p><p>The new mayor, 34, took the oath of office on a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-city-mayor\">copy of the Quran</a> at the turn of the new year, becoming the first Muslim mayor of America’s largest city.</p><p>The Democratic socialist, who formerly served as a state legislator, had minimal name recognition when he first announced his candidacy late in 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But he steadily grew his base of support with a message focused on affordability and housing.</p><p>Last June, he defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo to win the Democratic nomination, in one of the most stunning political upsets in recent US history.</p><p>Mamdani then defeated Cuomo again in the general elections in November, after the ex-governor relaunched his campaign as an independent with Trump’s support.</p><p>Adams was elected as a Democrat in 2021, but his administration faced numerous scandals during its four-year term, including accusations that Adams had entered into a quid pro quo with representatives from the Turkish government.</p><p>Earlier in 2024, Trump’s Justice Department dropped the federal bribery charges he faced. Adams had launched a re-election campaign as an independent, but he ultimately suspended his bid and backed Cuomo before the elections.</p><p>While Mamdani’s platform was largely focused on local issues, some of his supporters <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/mamdanis-new-york-victory-boosts-pro-palestine-politics-in-us\">have argued</a> that his vocal support for Palestinian rights helped propel his campaign amid the growing anger at Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p></div></div></body></html>"
