According to meteorologist Laith al-Allami, this is the third such system to affect the territory in the past few weeks, with a fourth which hit on Monday, Anadolu Agency reported.</p><p>One of the previous two was <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/whats-causing-gazas-war-damaged-homes-to-collapse-in-winter\">Storm Byron</a>, which brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Gaza as well as parts of Israel and the wider eastern Mediterranean region earlier this month.</p><p>Israel was placed on high alert for that storm – halting military leave, reinforcing emergency teams and safeguarding power supplies. But the UN said 55,000 Palestinian households in Israel lacking basic services and government support were left <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/israel-prepares-for-storm-byron-but-not-all-citizens-will-get-help\">exposed</a>.</p><p>At least <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/fourteen-palestinians-including-children-die-in-gaza-amid-storm-byron\">14 Palestinians</a> in Gaza were killed in the storm, and several were injured. Among the victims was a newborn baby in al-Mawasi, who succumbed to freezing temperatures.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Morocco</h3><p>Earlier this month, Morocco launched a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/morocco-launches-nationwide-emergency-relief-after-floods-kill-dozens\">nationwide emergency</a> relief operation to support people affected by severe flooding as the country battled freezing conditions, torrential rains and snowstorms.</p><p>Flash floods killed at least 37 people and damaged about 70 homes and shops in the town of Safi, 300km (186 miles) south of the capital, Rabat.</p><p>Prosecutors are investigating whether shortcomings in infrastructure, such as poor drainage, played a role in the disaster.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4177000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4177000\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4177000\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251215__887D6HW__v2__HighRes__MoroccoFloods-1765863724.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Moroccans looks at a destroyed vehicle and other debris following a flash flood.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4177000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moroccans inspect debris following a flash flood in the coastal town of Safi, 300 km (186 miles) south of the capital, Rabat, on December 15, 2025 [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h3>Indonesia</h3><p>Floods hit Indonesia in December, killing at least <a href=\"/news/2025/12/8/indonesia-counts-human-cost-as-more-climate-change-warnings-sounded\">961 people</a> in Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra. More than 20 villages across the ‍three provinces were completely swept away by the floods.</p><p id=\"homes-rice-fields-dams-and-bridges-were-destroyed-leaving-many-areas-inaccessible\">Homes, rice fields, dams and bridges were destroyed, leaving many areas inaccessible.</p><p>Illegal logging – often linked to the global demand for <a href=\"/news/2019/2/15/indonesia-land-burning-fines-unpaid-years-after-disastrous-fires\">palm oil</a> – along with forest loss due to mining, plantations and fires, both exacerbated the disaster in Sumatra.</p><p>Flooding was also reported in <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/12/9/satellite-images-show-the-scale-of-destruction-from-asia-floods\">neighbouring Malaysia</a> around the same time.</p><h3>Thailand</h3><p>At least 276 people have been killed in flooding in Thailand in December. The floods badly affected eight provinces in the central plains, four in the south and two in the north, according to the Thai Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation.</p><h3>Sri Lanka</h3><p>In late November, floods and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/sri-lanka-landslides-floods-death-toll-rises-to-56-offices-schools-shut\">landslides</a> killed at least 56 people as Cyclone Ditwah, a deadly tropical storm, swept across Sri Lanka.</p><p>The heavy downpour which accompanied the storm destroyed four houses and damaged more than 600. It also caused trees and mud to fall and block multiple roads and railway lines.</p><p>Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who took office in September 2024, inherited painful austerity measures imposed by his predecessor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, as part of a bailout loan package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hampering rescue efforts.</p><p>“The storm poses a significant challenge to the government that is just beginning to address the social and economic concerns of the people,” Ahilan Kadirgamar, a senior lecturer at the department of sociology, University of Jaffna in Sri Lanka, told Al Jazeera in November.</p><h3>Nepal</h3><p>In October, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/7/what-caused-nepals-devastating-flood-damage-and-how-was-it-contained\">severe floods and landslides</a> hit parts of Nepal and India’s eastern Himalayan city of Darjeeling, killing at least 50 people.</p><p>This year’s rainfall was not record-breaking – overall, there was actually slightly less rain than in 2024, when the Kathmandu Valley saw its heaviest downpour since 2002. In the capital Kathmandu, some districts received just more than 145 mm of rain this year, compared with about 240 mm in late September 2024.</p><p>Damage was severe, however, because of “ultra-localised”, heavy rains.</p><p>The floods came one month after Nepal’s “Gen Z” protests in Kathmandu and other cities against corruption and nepotism. The protests prompted the deployment of the military and, ultimately, the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/10/3/nepals-leaderless-gen-z-revolution-has-changed-the-rules-of-power\">resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli</a> and his replacement by former Chief Justice Sushila Karki, 73, as interim PM.</p><p>While experts praised Karki for her interim government’s prompt early weather warnings before the flooding, widespread damage to critical infrastructure during the protests hindered rebuilding and relief operations.</p><p>“To prevent future disasters, a major shift in policy and practice is urgently needed. This must prioritise comprehensive watershed management, focusing on stabilising slopes and managing water run-off, which has been a persistently neglected area in our current approach to disaster risk reduction,” Bhattarai, the engineering professor, told Al Jazeera at the time.</p><h3>Mexico</h3><p>In October, floods hit Mexico, killing at least 66 people. Tropical storms caused flooding in <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/mexico-flooding-death-toll-rises-to-64-with-dozens-still-missing\">five states</a> in the country: Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi.</p><p>More than 16,000 homes around the country were damaged.</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>Between June and August, several regions of <a href=\"/news/2025/8/21/whats-causing-pakistans-deadly-floods\">Pakistan experienced flooding</a> triggered by torrential rains. More than 700 people were killed around the country.</p><p>Floods devastated the Buner district in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and the southern city of Karachi also suffered major flooding caused by high-intensity rains over a short period of time.</p><p>Rainfall continued in Pakistan and neighbouring countries until <a href=\"/gallery/2025/8/31/pakistans-punjab-evacuates-half-a-million-people-stranded-by-floods\">late August,</a> and floods prompted the evacuation of 500,000 people in the Punjab province.</p><p>On August 31, a magnitude-6 <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/9/1/afghanistan-earthquake-live-hundreds-feared-dead-after-magnitude-6-quake\">earthquake</a> hit Afghanistan near its border with Pakistan, killing more than <a href=\"/news/2025/9/1/deadly-earthquake-hits-afghanistan-what-we-know-so-far\">1,400 people</a>, according to the government. Efforts to rescue people affected by the earthquake were hindered because flash floods had affected the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.</p><h3>United States</h3><p>As of last week, more than 40 million Americans had been placed under winter storm warnings or weather advisories. Another 30 million have been alerted to flood or storm advisories in <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/25/atmospheric-river-storm-causes-flooding-across-southern-california\">California</a>, where a so-called “atmospheric river” has brought a deluge of rain.</p><p>An atmospheric river is a long, narrow band of air in the atmosphere that carries large amounts of water vapour.</p><p>Last week, thousands of flights in the US were cancelled because of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/over-1500-flights-cancelled-as-winter-storm-devin-hits-us-holiday-travel\">winter storm Devin</a>, which caused blizzards in the Midwest and northeast and heavy snow forecasts across parts of both regions.</p><p>Earlier in the year, several US states, including Texas, West Virginia, New Mexico and New Jersey, were hit by flash floods – sudden and rapid flooding of low-lying areas – in July.</p><p>These floods were mostly caused by heavy rainfall over a short period of time.</p><p>Flash floods in Texas <a href=\"/news/2025/7/5/texas-floods-death-toll-rises-as-rescuers-search-for-missing-children\">killed more than 100 people</a> in July 2025. Within two hours of flooding, the Guadalupe River breached its banks, with waters rising higher than two-storey buildings to about 9 metres (30ft).</p><p>Twenty-five girls and two counsellors were killed, and other people went missing when the floods hit the riverside Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls.</p><p>The river has previously experienced major floods in 1936, 1952, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1987, 1991 and 1997, according to a guide prepared by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, a Texas state agency dedicated to conserving the water resources of the river basin.</p><p>The 1987 deluge was particularly disastrous and also hit a summer camp, killing 10 teenagers at the Pot O’ Gold Christian Camp near Comfort, Texas, according to local media. But the National Weather Service (NWS) said in July this year, the Guadalupe River <a href=\"/news/2025/7/7/texas-flooding-what-happened-what-went-wrong-and-whats-the-death-toll\">rose beyond</a> 1987 levels.</p><h2 id=\"so-were-the-2025-floods-worse-than-in-previous-years\">So, were the 2025 floods worse than in previous years?</h2><p>In some places, yes.</p><p>In the US, for example, flooding does appear to have worsened steadily for the past few years. The period between January and September 2025 saw the highest number of flood and flash flood events and the highest number of associated human casualties in five years, Nasir Gharaibeh, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Texas A&amp;M University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>From January to September, there were 7,074 floods in the US, which caused 242 deaths, according to the Storm Events Database, which is managed by the US National Weather Service (NWS) of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p><p>For the same period last year, there were 6,551 floods, which resulted in 151 deaths. In 2023, there were 5,783 floods, which caused 93 deaths for the same period. In 2022, 4,548 floods caused 102 deaths.</p><p>However, experts said that in other regions in the world, 2025 was not much worse than previous years.</p><p>“There have been equally dramatic years in South Asia and East Asia,” Daanish Mustafa, a professor in critical geography at King’s College, London, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Nowhere did I hear that any flood flow record was broken. It’s just that flood plains were more urbanised, rivers more regulated, where the regulatory infrastructure failed, as in Sri Lanka and India,” said Mustafa.</p><h2 id=\"why-were-floods-so-severe-in-2025\">Why were floods so severe in 2025?</h2><p>Flooding was worsened by a variety of factors in 2025, experts told us throughout the year. “Flooding is a complex hazard. It occurs because of interactions between many variables related to weather, infrastructure, land cover and topography and other factors,” Gharaibeh said.</p><p>Climate change is a major factor in causing weather events, researchers say. “The specific triggers varied from city to city in 2025, yet a single, universal force magnified them all: Climate change, which supercharges rainfall extremes,” said Bhattarai.</p><p>Climate change is causing monsoon rains to intensify, for example, resulting in more frequent extreme precipitation events. This is because rising temperatures cause the atmosphere to hold more moisture, leading to heavier downpours during storms.</p><p>In northern Pakistan, these higher temperatures are also accelerating glacial melting, which increases the likelihood of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/why-is-pakistan-so-vulnerable-to-deadly-flooding\">glacial lake outburst floods</a> (GLOFs).</p><p>Furthermore, Abdullah Ansari, a research professor at the Earthquake Monitoring Center at Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat, Oman, told Al Jazeera, “research has shown that seasonal rains and weather conditions can intensify earthquake-induced vulnerabilities by triggering landslides, damaging access routes and disrupting communication lines.”</p><p>“The year was further distinguished by unusual patterns, including late-season monsoon floods, rare cyclonic activity, and extreme rainfall in regions not traditionally prone to flooding,” Bhattarai said.</p><p>But climate change is not the full story.</p><p>“This global driver met a local vulnerability: Urban landscapes fundamentally unequipped for the new reality. The result was a surge in flash floods – where overwhelming water meets inflexible design – turning sudden downpours into city-wide disasters,” Bhattarai said.</p><p>“While climate change plays a critical role in intensifying flooding events in Pakistan, other factors such as urbanisation, deforestation, inadequate infrastructure, and poor river management also contribute significantly,” Ayyoob Sharifi, a professor and urban scientist at Hiroshima University in Japan, told Al Jazeera in August.</p><p>Additionally, a lack of adequate drainage systems and early warning systems can exacerbate the effects of flooding.</p><p>A rise in the number of flash floods has also caused greater damage.</p><p>“In the US, we are seeing a higher number of flood-related casualties, in part due to an increase in rainfall-induced flash flooding,” Gharaibeh told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Flash floods often occur with little warning, and the flood water flows with high velocities and destructive force, making them among the most dangerous natural hazards,” he added, explaining that the level of danger is measured by the ratio of deaths to people affected.</p><p>Overall, Bhattarai described the catastrophic flooding of 2025 as “a collision of intense meteorological events and long-term human decisions”.</p><p>“On the weather side, the primary drivers have been cloudbursts and stalled rain systems. These phenomena deliver short-duration, high-intensity rainfall, resulting in record daily rainfall totals that overwhelm drainage systems in a matter of hours.”</p><p>But human development has dramatically amplified the damage caused by floods, he said.</p><p>“Decades of river encroachment and floodplains converted into urban land have eliminated nature’s safety buffers. Rivers, now constricted and unable to spread out, surge with greater force and speed into populated areas that were once natural absorption zones.</p><p>“Essentially, we have built cities in the path of the water and then removed all its escape routes, turning heavy rain into disastrous floods.”</p><h2 id=\"how-can-we-improve-flood-responses-in-future\">How can we improve flood responses in future?</h2><p>Experts say governments will have to adapt to new weather patterns, which are resulting in more frequent and intense rainfall and flooding – and will have to change their approach to surviving floods.</p><p>Mustafa said: “Societies are continuing on their path of trying to fight floods, regulate rivers and build obstructive infrastructure in flood plains. All of these efforts have always failed and caused destruction and always will. But I fear the societies will continue apace.</p><p>“Don’t try to fight floods; learn to live with them. Don’t try to control and restrict river flows, give rivers room to flow,” he advised.</p><p>“Societies can and have engineered away high-frequency, low-intensity events. But in the process, they’ve made low-frequency, high-intensity events much worse. And this is particularly destructive in the climate change present, where all of your historical patterns, which are the basis of infrastructural design, are meaningless.”</p><p>Mustafa explained that infrastructure such as dams, levees and barrages are built to handle floods of a certain size and frequency.</p><p>He explained that these are built for 100-, 500- or 1,000-year events, meaning events with 1 percent, 0.5 percent or 0.1 percent chance of recurrence in any given year, respectively. He added that most infrastructure is designed for 100-year events.</p><p>Engineers use records of natural disasters to build this infrastructure.</p><p>“Assumption is that historical trends will continue into the future. With climate change, that assumption doesn’t hold,” Mustafa said.</p><p>Bhattarai said the 2025 floods underscored the need for faster, community-focused responses with clear local warnings, stronger coordination, urban-specific plans, protection of vulnerable groups and safer rebuilding that reduces future flood risks.</p><p>Gharaibeh said appropriate solutions will vary, depending on which part of the world is experiencing the flooding.</p><p>“Some parts of the world should start investing in their flood control infrastructure, including roadway systems, where roads are used as ‘drainage channels’. Other parts of the world should invest in building better warning systems.”</p><p>Gharaibeh explained that since funding is usually limited, controlling floods requires prioritisation of investment.</p><p>“Countries like the United States and Japan, for example, have built – and continue to build – robust flood control infrastructure because they have a long history of flooding issues.”</p><p>Even so, recent flash flood events, such as the flood that affected Texas in 2025, indicate that countries like the US should invest more in building better warning systems.</p><p>“On the other hand, Middle Eastern countries, for example, appear to lack the necessary infrastructure to control flooding. These countries should start investing in their flood control infrastructure.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

After their <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/trumps-pakistan-embrace-tactical-romance-or-a-new-inner-circle\">first meeting in June</a>, the US president said he was “honoured” to meet the Pakistani military chief.</p><p>That public warmth towards Pakistan’s army chief underscores how Munir emerged as a central driver of the country’s rising geopolitical profile in 2025, analysts say, with some crediting him for reviving the nation’s diplomatic standing, and resurrecting Pakistan’s previously strained ties with Washington.</p><p>The US-Pakistan relationship, which was in the doldrums just a few years ago, has since expanded beyond security cooperation to include economic engagement, such as discussions on <a href=\"/news/2025/9/25/strategic-handshake-how-pakistan-is-wooing-trump-with-critical-minerals\">crypto mining</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/9/25/strategic-handshake-how-pakistan-is-wooing-trump-with-critical-minerals\">critical minerals</a>.</p><p>Many experts trace this shift to the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/10/india-and-pakistan-agree-ceasefire-what-does-it-mean\">four-day armed conflict</a> between Pakistan and India in May 2025, arguing that it marked a decisive turning point.</p><p>India and Pakistan both claimed “victory” in the air war. But irrespective of who won, Islamabad managed to use the backdrop of the conflict to further its interests, analysts say. The view is also echoed by many in Pakistan’s political and diplomatic circles.</p><p>The conflict with India “was the decisive factor that raised [the] army chief’s profile internationally,” Khurram Dastgir Khan, Pakistan’s former foreign affairs and defence minister, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“<span>The victory precipitated many trends that had been gathering force for some time, some of these due to the specific character of the US president, Trump.” </span></p><h2 id=\"short-war-lasting-consequences\">Short war, lasting consequences</h2><p>India and Pakistan, the two nuclear-armed neighbours who have fought several wars and have remained locked in rivalry for decades, plunged the region into crisis earlier this year after an April attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed <a href=\"/news/2025/4/23/act-of-war-what-happened-in-kashmir-attack-that-killed-26-tourists\">26 civilians</a>.</p><p>India blamed Pakistan, which denied the allegation and called for a “credible, independent, transparent” investigation.</p><p>On May 7, <a href=\"/news/2025/5/7/why-did-india-strike-pakistan-all-we-know-about-operation-sindoor\">India launched strikes</a> inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan responded with air operations, claiming it shot down at least six Indian fighter jets. India confirmed aircraft losses days later, but did not specify the number.</p><p>The conflict escalated over the next three days as both sides exchanged drone attacks and, on May 10, launched missiles at each other’s military targets. The fighting ended only after intense backchannel diplomacy, particularly involving the US, produced a ceasefire.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4205706\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4205706\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4205706\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25127091989374-1767142893.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Debris of an aircraft lie in the compound of a mosque at Pampore in Pulwama district of Indian controlled Kashmir, Wednesday, May 7, 2025.

New Delhi has long argued that any dispute between India and Pakistan can only be resolved bilaterally.</p><p>But since May, Trump has repeatedly invoked the conflict, insisting on more than four dozen occasions that he brokered the ceasefire. He has also, at various points, echoed Pakistan’s claim of downing Indian aircraft.</p><p>“[New] Delhi’s sullen refusal to credit Trump with the ceasefire opened a space that army chief Munir and PM Sharif moved swiftly to utilise,” Khan, who is also a member of Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party, said.</p><p>Salman Bashir, a former Pakistani foreign secretary, agreed, calling the May conflict a “definite turning point”.</p><p>Bashir said that Trump is an “unusual president”, and his affinity for Munir, combined with the clash with India, helped reset ties between Islamabad and Washington.</p><p>“Asim Munir is pivotal to the revival of [Pakistan’s] diplomatic fortunes,” Bashir told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"first-signs-of-shift\">First signs of shift</h2><p>Pakistan was once a key US ally and was designated a major non-NATO ally following the September 11, 2001, attacks in the US.</p><p>The relationship frayed in subsequent years, as US officials accused Islamabad of duplicity in the US’s so-called “war on terror”. During his first term, Trump accused Pakistan of giving the US “nothing but lies and deceit” and of harbouring armed groups. His successor, Joe Biden, later described Pakistan as “one of the most dangerous nations”.</p><p>At the same time, US policy pivoted sharply towards India, viewed in Washington as a potential counterweight to China, Pakistan’s closest strategic partner.</p><p>Yet, just two months into his second term, Trump struck a different tone. Addressing a joint session of Congress in March, he thanked Pakistan for arresting one of the alleged perpetrators of the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/5/kabul-bombing-suspect-arrested-what-it-means-for-us-pakistan-relations\">Abbey Gate bombing</a> at Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack killed 13 US service members and dozens of Afghan civilians during the US’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p><p>“I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,” Trump said.</p><p>Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said this had been a signal of the US’s shifting approach towards Pakistan.</p><p>“[The] US always needed an ally who could help them achieve counterterrorism goals, and while they had been supporting India significantly for the past many years, after the Abbey Gate bomber arrest, [the] US realised Pakistan has the capability to help deliver their goals,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“I think the field marshal has emerged as a soldier-diplomat,” he added, noting that Munir had “used his skills of military-diplomacy” to be Pakistan’s “advocate”.</p><p>The army chief’s growing diplomatic clout also mirrors his increasingly elevated domestic profile.</p><h2 id=\"field-marshal-s-choreography\">Field marshal’s choreography</h2><p>Since independence from Britain in 1947, Pakistan’s military, particularly the army, has been the most powerful institution in the country.</p><p>Four coups and decades of direct government entrenched its dominance. Even under civilian governments, the army chief has often been regarded as the most influential figure in national life.</p><p>Following the May conflict with India, Munir was <a href=\"/news/2025/5/21/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-asim-munir-to-field-marshal-why-it-matters\">elevated to field marshal</a>, only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank. Later in the year, a constitutional change created the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/will-pakistans-defence-overhaul-strengthen-or-upset-its-military-balance\">post of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF)</a>, to be held concurrently by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS).</p><p>The move placed the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy under Munir’s authority.</p><p>Though these moves sparked criticism from sections of the opposition and several independent analysts, Pakistan’s foreign relations appeared to gain momentum through the year.</p><p>In South Asia, Islamabad revived ties with Bangladesh following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, widely viewed as close to New Delhi. Several high-level visits followed, including Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/2/why-pakistan-is-rushing-to-mend-fences-with-bangladesh\">trip to Dhaka</a> in August, the most senior Pakistani visit in more than 13 years.</p><p>Pakistani civilian and military leaders, including Munir and Sharif, also engaged counterparts from Central Asia, including Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.</p><p>Perhaps most notably, Pakistan sought to balance relations across the Middle East, maintaining ties with Gulf monarchies while also engaging Iran.</p><p>After meeting Munir in June, Trump remarked that Pakistanis “know Iran very well, better than most”.</p><p>Fahd Humayun, an assistant professor of political science at Tufts University, said that these developments effectively “re-telegraphed Pakistan’s strategic currency as a regional actor” with influence beyond its borders.</p><p>He identified two unrelated but converging developments: Washington’s renewed focus on the Middle East, particularly Gaza and Iran, and the performance of Pakistan’s conventional air defences during the May conflict with India, which Humayun described as a success.</p><p>“Munir moved quickly to capitalise on both, leveraging events, including the conflict with India, the fighting between Israel and Iran in June, and efforts to bring the Gaza war to a close, to engage the highest levels of the Trump administration, while simultaneously consolidating political control at home,” Humayun told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Pakistan has also expressed a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/can-pakistan-join-the-gaza-stabilisation-force-without-facing-backlash\">willingness to participate</a> in the US-led international stabilisation force, a controversial coalition proposed by Trump to oversee the security of Gaza.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4205719\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4205719\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4205719\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-13T181432Z_990526656_RC26BHA616XY_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-EGYPT-SUMMIT-1767143488.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a world leaders' summit on ending the Gaza war, amid a U.S.-brokered prisoner-hostage swap and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, October 13, 2025.

The most <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/watershed-how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-reshapes-regions-geopolitics\">consequential engagement</a> came in September, when Munir and Sharif met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and signed a mutual defence agreement.</p><p>Cheema said that Munir, who made two more visits to the US in August and September, had worked “tremendously hard” to position Pakistan as a regional player beyond South Asia.</p><p>“The US sees that Munir and Pakistan can play a larger role, and they are already engaging with US allies in the region,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"gains-abroad-costs-at-home\">Gains abroad, costs at home</h2><p>Some observers argue that Pakistan’s diplomatic standing has not reached such heights in decades.</p><p>Khan claimed that Pakistan is among the few countries maintaining positive relations with all the major stakeholders in global conflicts, including the US, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Russia.</p><p>“International salience has raised the government’s domestic credibility and consolidated the country’s economic and political stability,” he said.</p><p>Others are more sceptical, and cautious about drawing sweeping conclusions about the trajectory of Pakistani diplomacy in a fast-moving world.</p><p>“Pakistan needs political stability. What that means in today’s world is yet to be seen,” Bashir, the former foreign secretary, said, pointing to concerns that “w<span>e hear less about democracy and more about centralised control” domestically. </span></p><p>Maria Rashid, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Wolverhampton, said that Pakistan’s domestic and foreign politics are deeply intertwined.</p><p>“The US-Pakistan military love affair is, of course, not new. The relationship putters along even during the lows. As always, this time around, it’s an alignment of interests, one that has had disastrous consequences for democracy in Pakistan historically,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Previous periods of close US-Pakistan collaboration include the 1980s, when they both backed the mujahideen in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union, and the post September 11, 2001, period during the US’s “war on terror”. On both occasions, critics argued that US support strengthened the military leaders who governed Pakistan at the time: General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s, and Pervez Musharraf in the 2000s.</p><p>Meanwhile, for all of Pakistan’s mounting diplomatic visibility, violence at home has surged in 2025, particularly in the western provinces bordering Afghanistan, resulting in the highest casualty figures in a decade. Opposition parties and rights groups accuse the government of eroding civil liberties, suppressing the media and engaging in political violence.</p><p>The passage of the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-would-pakistans-27th-amendment-reshape-its-military-and-courts\">27th constitutional amendment</a> earlier this year proved especially controversial. Critics said it granted Munir sweeping powers as the CDF, promised him lifetime immunity and weakened judicial oversight.</p><p>The Sanober Institute’s Cheema argues that power in Pakistan has always been shared between elected and unelected institutions, and that the amendment was necessary for military reform.</p><p>“People may complain about it and say it is [an] accumulation of power,” he said. But he argued that “this was needed for [the] transformation of the armed forces, and [to] improve cohesion”.</p><p>The continued crackdown on the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the party of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, jailed since August 2023, also continued to draw criticism throughout the year, including from the United Nations.</p><p>Rashid, the international relations lecturer, said the May conflict with India came at a crucial moment for Munir and the military, whose popularity had been at a low ebb amid political turmoil and rising violence.</p><p>“The fighting in May resulted in Munir’s resurrection as the strongman who proved his mettle against India,” she said.</p><p>For the military, Rashid added, foreign policy success has helped push uncomfortable domestic issues into the background.</p><p>“Khan’s incarceration, the 27th amendment, the insurgency in Balochistan, all these news items are now relegated to the background against the ‘success’ of Pakistan’s diplomatic and economic relevance internationally,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He added that the UAE side transferred vehicles, containers, and Emirati personnel to the al-Rayyan base without informing Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The spokesman said the coalition adhered to the rules of engagement during the military operation.</p><p>The UAE announced the withdrawal of its forces from Yemen, declaring an end to what it called “counterterrorism” operations there, after Riyadh accused Abu Dhabi of supporting separatists in Yemen.</p><p>The announcement on Tuesday came after Yemen’s internationally recognised government demanded the UAE pull its forces from the country within 24 hours, a call backed by Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Hours earlier, Saudi Arabia-led coalition forces attacked the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla, targeting what Riyadh said was a UAE-linked weapons shipment destined for the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) in Yemen.</p><p>The STC, which initially supported Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Houthi rebels, launched an offensive against the Saudi Arabia-backed government troops this month, seeking an independent state in the south.</p><p>The advance broke years of deadlock, with the STC ‌seizing control of broad swaths of southern Yemen, including the Hadramout and Mahara provinces, in defiance of warnings from Riyadh. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia, and Mahara is close to the border.</p><p>Saudi Arabia on Tuesday said it was disappointed about “pressure exerted by the UAE” on the STC to conduct military operations in the Hadramout and Mahara provinces. Riyadh said it considered the moves a threat to its national security.</p><p>“In this context, the kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat,” it said.</p><p>Following Tuesday’s rapid-fire events, the UAE’s Ministry of Defence said it carried out a “comprehensive assessment” of its role in Yemen and decided to end its mission there.</p><p>“In light of recent developments and their potential implications for the safety and effectiveness of counterterrorism missions, the Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism personnel in Yemen of its own volition, in a manner that ensures the safety of its personnel,” the ministry said in a statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The UAE announcement came amid efforts to tamp down tensions that have erupted in recent days.</p><p>Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed the statements of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which it said reflected a “commitment to prioritising the interests of the region, strengthening the principles of good neighbourliness, and adhering to the foundations and principles upon which the GCC Charter is based”.</p><p>Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the UAE are part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud held telephone conversations with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, discussing “regional developments”.</p><h2 id=\"tensions-over-the-stc\">Tensions over the STC</h2><p>The Saudi-led coalition’s strike on Mukalla revealed widening tensions within a coalition built in 2015 to combat the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen.</p><p>Emirati troops first arrived in Yemen as part of the coalition that year, but the UAE pulled most of its forces out in 2019, leaving only a limited number in the government-run south.</p><p>Following the Mukalla strike, which did not cause casualties, Rashad al-Alimi, the head of Yemen’s Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council, dissolved a defence pact with the UAE and gave Emirati forces 24 hours to leave.</p><p>In a televised speech, al-Alimi said it had been “definitively confirmed ‌that the UAE pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation”, according to the Yemeni state news agency.</p><p>Saudi Arabia backed al-Alimi’s call for the UAE to withdraw its forces from Yemeni territory, and asked that it halt “any military or financial support to any party” in the country.</p><p>The UAE said it had been surprised by the Saudi Arabian air strike, and that the shipments in question did not contain weapons and were destined for the Emirati forces, rather than the STC.</p><p>It said it was committed to ensuring the security of Saudi Arabia and that it was seeking a solution “that prevents escalation, based on reliable facts and existing coordination”.</p><p>Yemeni state television showed what it said was black smoke rising from the port in the early morning, with burned vehicles. Al-Alimi declared a no-fly zone, and a sea and ground blockade on all ports and crossings for 72 hours.</p><p>However, the STC remained defiant, insisting there was “no thinking about withdrawal” from its newly seized positions.</p><p>“It is unreasonable for the landowner to be asked to leave his own land. The situation requires staying and reinforcing,” STC spokesman Anwar al-Tamimi told the AFP news agency.</p><p>“We are in a defensive position, and any movement towards our forces will be responded to by our forces,” he added.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4162354\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE_YEMEN_CONTROL_MAP_DECEMBER-9_2025-1765288083.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE_YEMEN_CONTROL_MAP_DECEMBER 9_2025-1765288083\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

And crucially, Americans are widely pessimistic about their material condition.</p><p>Here are some of the key metrics of the US economy as 2025 draws to a close:</p><h2 id=\"gdp-growth\">GDP growth</h2><p>After a modest expansion in the first half of 2025, gross domestic product (GDP) growth blasted past expectations in the July-September quarter to reach an annualised 4.3 percent.</p><p>That was the strongest performance in two years. It was also well ahead of the US’s fellow developed countries.</p><p>During the third quarter, the eurozone’s and the United Kingdom’s economies grew just 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, on an annualised basis.</p><p>Japan, the world’s fourth largest economy, contracted 2.3 percent during the period.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>While robust, the growth of the US economy has been largely driven by multibillion-dollar investments in artificial intelligence led by a handful of tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet.</p><p>By some estimates, AI-related spending accounted for about 40 percent of all growth in 2025.</p><p>That means a lot rests on AI delivering on its as yet unproven potential to transform the economy.</p><p>While many analysts believe AI will usher in a fourth industrial revolution, others are concerned the tech has been vastly overhyped.</p><p>Campbell Harvey, an economist at Duke University, said 2026 could be the year that AI and decentralised financial technologies begin to deliver substantial gains to productivity.</p><p>“We are at the cusp of technologies like AI being able to very substantially increase productivity,” Harvey told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This means higher growth. We have not seen realisations of this higher growth yet from AI.”</p><h2 id=\"consumer-sentiment\">Consumer sentiment</h2><p>While the US economy is strong on paper, Americans are broadly unhappy with the state of their finances. In fact, consumer sentiment is near record lows.</p><p>The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment stood at 53.3 in December, up slightly from the previous month, compared to 50 in June 2022 when inflation was at a four-decade high.</p><p>Yet Americans are continuing to spend.</p><p>Consumer spending grew 3.5 percent during the July-September quarter, the fastest pace since the final quarter of 2024.</p><p>The splurge has shown no signs of slowing down either. Mastercard’s annual report on the Christmas season showed spending up 3.9 percent compared with last year.</p><p>The reason for the disconnect between spending and sentiment? The diverging fortunes of wealthy Americans and those of more modest means.</p><p>The top 10 percent of earners now account for roughly half of spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics.</p><p>Harvey said he would give the economy an overall rating of six out of 10.</p><p>“Many believe that the US is stuck in the 2 percent real GDP growth regime. The third quarter showed that higher growth is possible. I think many are too pessimistic. We need more ambition,” he said.</p><p>Rolf J Langhammer, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany, said he would rate the economy a six “at best”, noting that the International Monetary Fund had forecast a 2.7 percent growth rate at the start of Trump’s tenure.</p><p>“The current strength is visibly lower, around 2 percent only,” Langhammer told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"us-stock-market\">US stock market</h2><p>After wild swings earlier in the year during Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements, stocks are finishing out 2025 on a high note.</p><p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 18 percent, easily beating the average annual return of 10.5 percent.</p><p>While most Americans own stocks, the gains have disproportionately benefitted wealthier households.</p><p>Stock ownership ranges from as high as 87 percent in households earning at least $100,000 per year to as low as 28 percent of households earning less than $50,000, according to Gallup.</p><h2 id=\"inflation\">Inflation</h2><p>Despite fears that Trump’s tariffs would fuel inflation, prices have grown at a moderate pace – though still above the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent.</p><p>Year-on-year inflation came to 2.7 percent in November, down from 3 percent in September.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>While inflation is way down from its recent peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, when then-President Joe Biden faced a similarly glum public mood over the economy, Americans are still feeling the pinch.</p><p>In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted this month, 70 percent of respondents said the cost of living in their area was unaffordable.</p><p>Some economists have also cautioned that the full impact of tariffs may have been delayed by companies that stockpiled imports in anticipation of higher costs.</p><p>Langhammer said the jury was out on whether living costs would remain stable in the coming year.</p><p>“Front-loading of imports is fading out, and the effects of tariffs on inflation are likely to become more visible in 2026 in addition to the weak dollar,” Langhammer said, noting that the average effective tariff rate, 17 percent, was about five times higher than before Trump took office.</p><p>However, Harvey said he believed the tariffs have had a minimal economic impact.</p><p>“The US trade sector is very small compared to other countries. Measuring trade intensity as the sum of exports plus imports divided by GDP, the US ranks as one of the least trade-intensive countries in the world,” he said.</p><p>“Another way of looking at this is to look at the size of imports relative to GDP, and you’ll see that it’s about 14 percent. This is why I believe that the economic impacts of tariffs are less important than the attention they get in the media.”</p><h2 id=\"employment\">Employment</h2><p>Despite Trump’s pledge to restore the manufacturing glory of the US, unemployment has risen steadily since the start of his second term in January.</p><p>The official jobless rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.6 percent in November, up from 4 percent in January.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><p>While Trump has attributed the rise to cuts in government jobs undertaken by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), those layoffs account for only a small proportion of the total number of jobless people.</p><p>Whereas DOGE cut about 300,000 federal employees, one million more Americans were classified as unemployed in November compared with January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For the roughly 500 families who live there, in houses of nipa grass and rattan, the developments spell disaster.</p><p>“We were here before the Americans, even before the Spanish,” said Petronila Capiz, 60, the chieftain of the Aeta Hungey tribe in Sapang Kawayan. “And the land continues to be taken from us.”</p><p>Historians say American colonisers, who seized the Philippines from Spain in 1898, took over the 32,000-hectare (80,000-acre) tract that became Clark Air Base in the 1920s, dispossessing the Aetas, a seminomadic and dark-skinned people thought to be among the archipelago’s earliest inhabitants.</p><p>Many were displaced, though some moved deeper into the jungle inside the base and were employed as labourers.</p><p>The US turned over the base to the Philippine government in 1991, some four decades after granting the country independence. Since then, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority, or BCDA, has managed the complex. Some 20,000 Aetas are thought to remain in the Clark area today, spread across 32 villages.</p><p>But most of their claims to the land are not recognised.</p><p>In Sapang Kawayan, residents fear the government’s development boom means they could be pushed out long before they can establish such claims. The community – along with other Aeta villages in Clark – is working with researchers from the University of the Philippines to expedite a long-pending application for a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title, or CADT — the only legal mechanism that would allow them to assert rights to their territory and its resources.</p><p>In January, July and September, Aetas young and old gathered under makeshift wooden shelters in Sapang Kawayan, assembling family trees and sharing stories and photographs. Volunteers documented each detail in hopes of demonstrating that the community there predates colonial rule.</p><p>Their 17,000-hectare claim overlaps with nearly all of the 9,450 hectares designated for New Clark City, while 14 kilometres to the south is the airport complex where the new railway line, runway and stadium are slated to rise.</p><p>Together, the new city and airport complex “will eat up the fields where we farm, the rivers where we fish and the mountains where we get our herbs”, Capiz said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194888\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194888\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194888\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/geneaology-gathering-3-1766643752.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"As part of a requirement to claim their ancestral lands, the Aeta Hungey gather in the village of Sapang Kawayan to trace their genealogy back hundreds of years ago.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aetas work with researchers at the University of the Philippines to expedite their application for an ancestral land title [Michael Beltran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"taylor-swift-ready\">‘Taylor Swift-ready’</h2><p>The Philippine government first announced plans for New Clark City under then-President Rodrigo Duterte, promoting it as a solution to the crippling congestion in Metro Manila. The BCDA describes the development as a “green, smart and disaster-resilient metropolis”.</p><p>Construction began in 2018 with major roads and a sports complex that hosted the Southeast Asian Games in 2019.</p><p>Designed to accommodate 1.2 million people, the city is expected to take at least 30 years to complete.</p><p>The BCDA is now building three highways linking New Clark City to the airport complex, where the “Taylor Swift–ready” stadium is planned. Officials have hyped that the stadium, to be built by 2028, will lure Swift after she skipped the Philippines during the South Asian leg of her Eras tour last year.</p><p>“One of the main elements that make Clark so attractive to investors is its unmatched connectivity,” the BCDA’s president, Joshua Bingcang, said this year, citing the airport, a nearby seaport and major expressways. “But we need to further build on this connectivity and invest more in infrastructure.”</p><p>That expansion has come at a cost for Aeta communities.</p><p>Counter-Mapping PH, a research organisation, and campaigners estimate that hundreds of Aeta families have been displaced since construction of the city began, including dozens of families who were given just a week in 2019 to “voluntarily” vacate ahead of the Southeast Asian Games.</p><p>They warn that thousands more could be uprooted as development continues.</p><p>The BCDA has offered financial compensation of $0.51 per square metre as well as resettlement for affected families. In July, it broke ground on 840 housing units, though it is unclear whether they are intended for displaced Aetas.</p><p>The agency maintains that no displacement has occurred because Aetas have no proven legal claim to the area. In a statement to Al Jazeera, the BCDA said it “upholds the welfare and rights of Indigenous peoples” and acknowledges their “long historical presence” in central Luzon, where Clark is located. However, it noted that Clark’s boundaries follow “long-established government ownership” dating to the US military base, and that the New Clark City does not encroach on any recognised ancestral domains.</p><p>The BCDA also contended that it is the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) that deals with the applications for a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title, and stressed that it respected “lands awarded to Indigenous peoples”.</p><p>The Clark International Airport Corporation, which oversees the airport complex, offered similar assurances, stating that “there are no households or communities existing in the said location”. The group added that while the extended Clark area has Aeta communities, none exist within the airport complex itself.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194931\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194931\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194931\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20190719__1IX3GU__v1__HighRes__Seagames2019Phi-1766644683.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Labourers work on buildings in the games village for this year's Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) in New Clark City in Capas town.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194931\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Labourers work on buildings in the games village for the Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) in New Clark City in Capas town, Tarlac province, north of Manila, on July 19, 2019 [Ted Jibe/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"since-time-immemorial\">‘Since time immemorial’</h2><p>Only a handful of Aeta tribes have been awarded CADTs.</p><p>Two certificates have been granted on the outskirts of Clark, while the application filed by Sapang Kawayan and other villages inside the base have languished since 1986.</p><p>Marcial Lengao, head of NCIP’s Tarlac office, told Al Jazeera that to grant Aetas in Clark a CADT they must “prove that they have been there since time immemorial”, meaning, during or before the arrival of the Spanish colonisers to the archipelago 400 years ago.</p><p>The commission, he said, specifies minimum requirements for a CADT: a genealogy of at least five clans dating back at least three generations or to the precolonial period, testimonies from elders, a map of the domain and a census of the current population.</p><p>Lengao said Sapang Kawayan’s application has yet to complete these.</p><p>But even if the application is granted, the village faces another unique hurdle. Because the BCDA owns land rights to Clark, any CADT approved by the commission in the area must then be deliberated by the executive branch or the president’s office.</p><p>“They will be responsible for finding a win-win solution,” Lengao said.</p><p>Activists, however, denounced the NCIP’s requirements as onerous and warned that the longer Aetas remain without a CADT, the more vulnerable they are to losing their lands.</p><p>“Without a CADT and without genuine recognition from the government, the Aetas will continue to be treated like squatters on their own land,” said Pia Montalban of Karapatan-Central Luzon, a local rights group.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"among-the-most-abused-indigenous-filipinos\">‘Among the most abused Indigenous Filipinos’</h2><p>The Aetas, who rely on small-scale subsistence farming, are among the most historically disenfranchised Indigenous peoples in the Philippines. No official data exists on the Aeta population, but the government believes them to be a small subset of the Philippines’s Indigenous peoples, numbering in the tens of thousands nationwide.</p><p>The Aeta Tribe Foundation describes them as among the “poorest and least educated” groups in the nation.</p><p>“They are among the most abused Indigenous Filipinos,” said Jeremiah Silvestre, an Indigenous psychology expert who worked closely with Aeta communities until 2022 while teaching at the Tarlac State University. “Partly because of their good-natured culture, many have taken advantage of Aetas. Worse, they live off a land that is continuously taken from them.”</p><p>Silvestre, too, described the CADT process as “unnecessarily academic”, saying it required Indigenous elders to present complete genealogies and detailed maps to government officials in what he likened to “defending your dissertation”.</p><p>Changes in government personnel can restart the entire process, he noted.</p><p>A World Bank report last year found that Indigenous peoples in the Philippines “often face insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles in their efforts to process CADTs”. The report called recognising and protecting Indigenous land rights a “crucial step in addressing poverty and conflict”.</p><p>For the families of Sapang Kawayan, experts fear the lack of formal recognition could lead to displacement and homelessness.</p><p>“There’s no safety net,” Silvestre said. “We may see more Aetas begging on the street if this continues. Systemic poverty will also mean the loss of an Indigenous culture.”</p><p>Victor Valantin, an Indigenous Peoples Mandatory Representative for Tarlac Province, which includes parts of Clark, fears that the territory for the Aetas in the former base is shrinking as the new projects accelerate.</p><p>“We’ll have to move and move,” he said. “Shopping centres won’t move for us.”</p><p>Valantin went on to lament what he sees as a familiar imbalance.</p><p>“BCDA projects happen so fast,” he said. “But anything for us will be awfully slow.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Throughout the war, it accused the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, of being infiltrated by Hamas and Hamas of using UNRWA’s facilities and taking its aid. The UN has denied that.</p><p>In October, the International Court of Justice issued an <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/icj-says-israel-must-allow-aid-into-blockaded-gaza-provide-basic-needs\">advisory opinion</a> saying Israel must support UN relief efforts in Gaza, including those conducted by UNRWA.</p><p>The court found Israel’s allegations against UNRWA – including that it was complicit in the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel – were unsubstantiated.</p><p>The court also said Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure the “basic needs” of the Palestinian population of Gaza are met, “including the supplies essential for survival”, such as food, water, shelter, fuel and medicine.</p><p>A number of countries halted funding for UNRWA after Israel’s accusations, jeopardising one of Gaza’s most desperately needed lifelines.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3637339\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Interactive_Gaza_foodaid_timeline-1742987531-1744365779.webp?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C963&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"[Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"
