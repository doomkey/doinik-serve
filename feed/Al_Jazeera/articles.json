Pyongyang did not respond to the offer.</p><p>At that time, Trump had just approved South Korea’s plan to build a nuclear-powered submarine.</p><p>Since Kim’s 2019 summit with Trump collapsed over the scope of denuclearisation and sanctions relief, Pyongyang has repeatedly declared itself an “irreversible” nuclear state.</p><p>Kim has since been emboldened by Russia’s war on Ukraine, securing critical support from Moscow after sending thousands of troops to fight alongside Russian forces.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was ultimately enough to seal a maiden win for Mozambique in this tournament at the 17th attempt, despite Gabon’s Alex Moucketou-Moussounda pulling one back.</p><p>Elsewhere in the group, defending champions Ivory Coast ‍took ‍a lead that lasted only five minutes before Cameroon equalised to secure a 1-1 ⁠draw in their heavyweight clash on Sunday.</p><p class=\"p1\">Amad Diallo scored for a second successive game to ‍open ⁠the scoring for the Ivorians in the 51st minute, but full-back Junior Tchamadeu levelled for Cameroon with the help of a deflection ​in the 56th ‌minute at Marrakesh Stadium.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, who have eight AFCON titles ‌between them, now share the lead in ‌Group F with ⁠four points apiece, followed by Mozambique on three.</p><p>Gabon need to win their final group game to have any chance of reaching the knockout stages as one of the best third-placed teams.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Algeria have secured their place in the last 16, after a Riyad Mahrez penalty gave them a 1-0 victory over Burkina Faso.</p><p class=\"p1\">Captain Mahrez converted from the spot midway through the first half at the Moulay El Hassan Stadium in Rabat on Sunday, and Algeria then held on to win a bruising contest against a determined Burkina outfit.</p><p class=\"p2\">The penalty that decided the game was awarded when Manchester City’s Rayan Ait-Nouri was bundled over.</p><p class=\"p1\">Mahrez made no mistake with his 23rd-minute kick as he followed his brace in the opening 3-0 defeat of Sudan to take his tally at this Cup of Nations to three goals. The former Leicester City and Manchester City winger, appearing at his sixth AFCON, now has nine goals at the tournament, an Algerian record.</p><p class=\"p1\">Pierre Landry Kabore, the Hearts’ striker, came close to equalising for Burkina Faso with a header from a corner, before Mahrez teed up Mohamed Amoura for a shot that was saved by goalkeeper Herve Koffi at the end of an Algerian breakaway in the first half of stoppage time.</p><p class=\"p1\">Bayer Leverkusen’s Ibrahim Maza twice failed to convert good opportunities in the second half, while substitute Georgi Minoungou fired just over as Burkina Faso pushed unsuccessfully for an equaliser.</p><p class=\"p1\">Algeria, African champions in 1990 and in 2019, have the maximum six points after two games in Group E and are yet to concede a goal, with Vladimir Petkovic’s side living up to their billing as one of the pre-tournament favourites.</p><p class=\"p1\">Burkina Faso and Sudan come next on three points each, but they play each other in the final round of group games on Wednesday.

Certainly, that’s one of the big issues, and… it’s unresolved,” Trump said.</p><p>Zelenskyy reiterated his position that the issue of territory should be decided by the people of Ukraine and said that different aspects of the peace plan could be put to the public in a number of referenda.</p><p>“Of course, our society has to choose … because it’s their land … not of one person. It’s the land of our nation, for a lot of generations,” he said.</p><p>Following their talks, Trump and Zelensky held a joint phone call with key European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><p>Trump has been trying to end the nearly <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/will-the-russia-ukraine-war-end-in-2026\">four-year war in Ukraine</a> since returning to the White House in January, showing irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of resolving the conflict.</p><p>Before his meeting with Zelenskyy on Sunday, Trump said the sides were in the “final stages of talking” and they had the “makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, good for everybody.”</p><p>Russia <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/russia-hammers-ukraines-capital-ahead-of-trump-zelenskyy-meeting\">intensified its attacks</a> on Ukraine’s capital in the days before the Florida meeting.</p><p>During talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators in Berlin earlier this month, the Trump administration agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO.</p><p>The proposal came after Zelenskyy said he could agree to no longer seek membership of the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like guarantees to protect the country from Russian attacks.</p><p>Oleksandr Kraiev, an analyst with the think-tank Ukrainian Prism, said the people of Ukraine were “quite cynical” about the US-brokered talks.</p><p>“We tried this in 2015, 2016, 2017, and unfortunately each time the Russians broke even the ceasefire regime, not even talking about the peace process,” Kraiev told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“So we have little faith that a proper peace process will take place. As of now we’re striving for a ceasefire as a precondition for any kind of talks… We cannot trust the Russians with a peace deal, but a ceasefire is something we’re working on.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"blindsided-yet-again\">‘Blindsided yet again’</h2><p>Trump’s optimistic tone comes despite widespread scepticism in Europe about Putin’s intentions after Russia carried out heavy bombardment of the Ukrainian capital just as Zelenskyy headed to Florida.</p><p>Before Zelenskyy arrived, Trump spoke with Putin by phone for more than an hour and said he planned to speak again after the Zelenskyy meeting – catching Ukrainian leaders off guard, reported Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi.</p><p>“From what we’re hearing, the Zelenskyy delegation here have been blindsided yet again by Donald Trump. And according to the Russians, it was at the Americans’ insistence there should be a call with Vladimir Putin the hour before Zelenskyy arrived,” said Rattansi, speaking from Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the call with Putin as “very good” and “productive”.</p><p>The Kremlin offered a more pointed account in its readout of the call, saying Trump agreed that a ceasefire “would only prolong the conflict” as it demanded Ukraine make concessions on territory.</p><p>Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland if Russia also pulled back and the area became a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/ukraine-accepts-demilitarised-zone-to-end-russia-war-but-do-dmzs-work\">demilitarised zone</a> monitored by international forces.</p><p>Putin has stated that all areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, should be recognised as Russian territory. The Russian leader has also demanded that Ukraine withdraw from parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces have not occupied.</p><p>Kyiv has publicly rejected those demands.</p><p>Trump has appeared sympathetic to some of Putin’s demands, arguing that the Russian president could be persuaded to end the fighting if Kyiv gives up Ukrainian land in the Donbas region, and if Western countries welcome Russia back into the global economy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>I am a Palestinian. And increasingly, that fact alone is treated as a provocation.</p><p>In recent months, I have watched anti-Semitism — a real, lethal form of hatred with a long and horrific history — be stripped of its meaning and weaponised to silence Palestinians, criminalise solidarity with us, and shield Israel from accountability as it carries out a genocide in Gaza. This is not about protecting Jewish people. It is about protecting power.</p><p>The pattern is now impossible to ignore.</p><p>A children’s educator, Ms Rachel, whose entire public work is built around care, learning, and empathy, is branded “Anti-Semite of the Year” — not for her engaging in any form of hate speech, but for expressing concern for Palestinian children. For acknowledging that children in Gaza are being bombed, starved, and traumatised. For expressing compassion.</p><p>As a Palestinian, I hear the message clearly: even empathy for our children is dangerous.</p><p>Then there is Palestine Action, a protest movement that targets weapons manufacturers supplying Israel’s military. Instead of being debated, challenged, or even criticised within a democratic framework, it is proscribed as a “terrorist” organisation, casually equated with ISIL (ISIS) – a group responsible for mass executions, sexual slavery, and genocidal violence.</p><p>This comparison is not just obscene. It is deliberate. It collapses the meaning of “terrorism” so completely that political dissent becomes extremism by definition. Resistance becomes pathology. Protest becomes “terror”. And Palestinians, once again, are framed not as a people under occupation, but as a permanent threat.</p><p>Language itself is now being criminalised. Phrases like “globalise the Intifada” are banned without any serious engagement with history or meaning. Intifada — a word that literally means “shaking off” — is torn from its political context as an uprising against military occupation and reduced to a slur. Palestinians are denied even the right to name their resistance.</p><p>At the same time, international law is being actively dismantled.</p><p>Staff and judges at the International Criminal Court are <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/us-sanctions-more-icc-judges-citing-ruling-on-israeli-war-crime-probe\">sanctioned</a> and intimidated for daring to investigate Israeli war crimes. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on Palestine, has not only been sanctioned, but also relentlessly smeared — because she uses the language of international law to describe occupation, apartheid, and genocide.</p><p>When international law is applied to African leaders, it is celebrated.<br>\nWhen it is applied to Israel, it is treated as an act of hostility.</p><p>This brings us to Australia — and to one of the most revealing moments of all.</p><p>After the horrific Bondi Beach attack, which shocked and horrified people across Australia, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Australian government of encouraging anti-Semitism. Not because of any incitement, not because of inflammatory rhetoric — but because Australia had moved towards recognising Palestine as a state.</p><p>Read that again.</p><p>The diplomatic recognition of Palestinian statehood — long framed as essential to peace and grounded in international law — is presented as a moral failing, even as a contributor to anti-Semitic violence. Palestinian existence itself is treated as the problem.</p><p>What makes this moment so disturbing is not only that Netanyahu made this claim, but that so many centres of power ran with it rather than challenged it.</p><p>Instead of forcefully rejecting the idea that recognising Palestinian rights could “encourage anti-Semitism”, governments, institutions, and commentators allowed the premise to stand. Some echoed it outright. Others stayed silent. Almost none confronted the dangerous logic at its core: that Palestinian political recognition is inherently destabilising, provocative, or threatening.</p><p>This is how moral collapse happens — not with thunder, but with acquiescence.</p><p>The result is not safety for the Jewish people, but erasure of the Palestinian people.</p><p>As a Palestinian, I find it devastating.</p><p>It means my identity is not merely contested — it is criminalised. My grief is not simply ignored — it is politicised. My demand for justice is not debated — it is pathologised as hatred.</p><p>Anti-Semitism is real. It must be confronted seriously and without hesitation. The Jewish people deserve safety, dignity, and protection — everywhere. But when anti-Semitism is stretched to include children’s educators, UN experts, international judges, protest movements, chants, words, and even the diplomatic recognition of Palestine, then the term no longer serves to protect Jewish people.</p><p>It protects a state from accountability.</p><p>Worse still, this weaponisation endangers Jews by collapsing Jewish identity into the actions of a government committing mass atrocities. It tells the world that Israel speaks for all Jews — and that anyone who objects must therefore be hostile to Jews themselves. That is not protection. It is recklessness masquerading as morality.</p><p>For Palestinians like me, the psychological toll is immense.</p><p>I am tired of having to preface every sentence with disclaimers.</p><p>I am deeply pained by watching my people starve while being lectured about tone.</p><p>I am angry that international law seems to apply only in certain politically convenient cases.</p><p>And I am grieving — not just for Gaza, but for the moral collapse unfolding around it.</p><p>Opposing genocide is not anti-Semitism.</p><p>Solidarity is not “terrorism”.</p><p>Recognising Palestine is not incitement.</p><p>Naming your suffering is not violence.</p><p>If the world insists on calling me an anti-Semite for refusing to accept the annihilation of my people, then it is not anti-Semitism that is being countered.</p><p>It is genocide that is being justified.</p><p>And history will remember who helped make that possible.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In September, he also <span><a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/trump-to-meet-netanyahu-as-ending-israels-gaza-war-reaches-pressure-point\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">met with Trump</a> in Washington, DC, after</span> the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-relationship-between-trump-and-netanyahu-been-like-so-far\">What has the relationship between Trump and Netanyahu been like so far?</h2><p>Netanyahu often says Trump is the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House.</p><p>During his first term, Trump pushed US policy further in favour of Israel’s right-wing government. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognised and claimed Israeli sovereignty over Syria’s occupied <a href=\"/news/2022/3/25/three-years-on-us-still-views-syrias-golan-as-israeli-territory\">Golan Heights</a> and cut off funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).</p><p>Since returning to the White House this year, Trump has shown a greater willingness to publicly disagree with Netanyahu. Still, his administration has provided unflinching support for Israel, including the decision to renew the genocidal war on Gaza in March after a brief ceasefire.</p><p>Trump joined the Israeli attack on Iran in June to the dismay of some segments of his base. And he pushed to secure the current truce in Gaza.</p><p>The US president also opposed the Israeli <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/9/13/how-will-israels-attack-on-doha-affect-the-us-and-gulf-states\">attack on Doha</a> in September. And he swiftly lifted sanctions against Syria despite some apparent Israeli reservations.</p><p>The ties between the two leaders have seen some peaks and valleys. In 2020, Trump was irked when Netanyahu rushed to congratulate Joe Biden on his election victory against Trump, who has falsely insisted the election was fraudulent.</p><p>“I haven’t spoken to him [Netanyahu] since,” Trump told the Axios news site in 2021. “F*** him.”</p><p>The strong ties between the two leaders were rekindled after Trump won the presidency again in 2024 and unleashed a crackdown on Palestinian rights activists in the US.</p><p>In November, Trump formally asked Israeli President Isaac Herzog to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/trump-formally-asks-israeli-president-to-pardon-netanyahu-after-gaza-truce\">pardon Netanyahu</a>, who is facing corruption charges at home.</p><p>The two leaders, however, are not in complete alignment, and cracks in their positions are showing up over issues that include Gaza, Syria and the US partnerships with Turkiye and the Gulf states.</p><p>During his US visit, Netanyahu may seek to flatter Trump and project a warm relationship with the US president to advance his agenda and signal to his political rivals in Israel that he still enjoys support from Washington.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-netanyahu-dealt-with-the-us-since-october-7-2023\">How has Netanyahu dealt with the US since October 7, 2023?</h2><p>Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Netanyahu has asked for unchecked US diplomatic and military support.</p><p>Then-President Biden travelled to Israel 11 days after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, and he declared that support for the US ally is “vital for America’s national security”.</p><p>His “bear hug” of Netanyahu on arrival at the airport in Tel Aviv would set the stage for the US backing of Israel as it unleashed horror and destruction on Gaza, which has translated into more than $21bn in military aid and multiple vetoes at the UN Security Council over the past two years.</p><p>Netanyahu has seized on the notion that Israel is an extension of US interests and security structure. In a speech to the US Congress last year, the prime minister argued that Israel is fighting Iran indirectly in Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p>“We’re not only protecting ourselves. We’re protecting you,” he told US lawmakers.</p><p>Throughout the war, there have been countless reports that Biden and Trump have been displeased or angry with Netanyahu. But US weapons and political backing for Israel have continued to flow uninterrupted. And Netanyahu makes a point of always expressing gratitude to US presidents, even when there may be apparent tensions.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"where-does-the-us-stand-on-the-gaza-truce\">Where does the US stand on the Gaza truce?</h2><p><span>US Secretary of State <a href=\"/features/2025/2/20/marco-rubio-a-traditionalist-hawk-in-the-age-of-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marco Rubio</a> said last week that the top priority for the Trump administration is to complete the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire and move from mere cessation of hostilities to long-term governance, stabilisation and reconstruction of the Palestinian enclave.</span></p><p>Israel has been violating the ceasefire in Gaza regularly, recently killing at least six Palestinians in an attack that targeted a wedding.</p><p>But Trump, who claims to have brought peace to the Middle East for the first time <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-state-of-the-nation-address\">in 3,000 years</a>, has focused on broadly moving the truce forward rather than on Israel’s daily conduct.</p><p>“No one is arguing that the status quo is sustainable in the long term, nor desirable, and that’s why we have a sense of urgency about bringing phase one to its full completion,” Rubio said last week.</p><p>The top US diplomat has also suggested that there could be some flexibility when it comes to disarming Hamas under the agreement, saying the “baseline” should be ensuring that the group does not pose a threat to Israel rather than removing the guns of every fighter.</p><p>But Israel appears to be operating with a different set of priorities. Defence Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/israel-will-never-fully-withdraw-from-gaza-defence-minister-says\">Israel Katz</a> said on Tuesday that the country is looking to re-establish settlements in Gaza, which are illegal under international law.</p><p>He later walked back those comments but stressed that Israel would maintain a permanent military presence in the territory, which would violate the Trump plan.</p><p>Expect Gaza to be a key topic of discussion between Netanyahu and Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"can-a-syria-agreement-be-reached\">Can a Syria agreement be reached?</h2><p><span>Trump has literally and figuratively embraced Syrian President <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a> over the past year, lifting sanctions against the country and beginning security cooperation with his government’s security forces.</span></p><p>But Israel is pursuing its own agenda in Syria. Hours after the collapse of the government of former President Bashar al-Assad a year ago, Israel began expanding its occupation of Syria beyond the Golan Heights.</p><p>Although the new Syrian authorities stressed early on that they did not seek confrontation with Israel, the Israeli military launched a bombardment campaign against Syria’s state and military institutions.</p><p>Israeli forces have also been conducting raids in southern Syria and abducting and disappearing residents.</p><p>After the Israeli military killed 13 Syrians in an air raid last month, Trump issued a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/trump-says-israel-must-seek-strong-and-true-dialogue-with-syria\">veiled criticism</a> of Israel.</p><p>“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous state,” he said.</p><p>Syria and Israel were in talks earlier this year to establish a security agreement short of full diplomatic normalisation. But the negotiations appeared to collapse after Israeli leaders insisted on holding onto the land captured after al-Assad’s fall.</p><p>With Netanyahu in town, Trump will likely renew the push for a Syria-Israel agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-iran-back-in-the-headlines\">Why is Iran back in the headlines?</h2><p>Netanyahu’s visit comes amid louder alarm bells in Israel about Iran rebuilding its missile capacity after their 12-day war in June.</p><p>NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/netanyahu-plans-brief-trump-possible-new-iran-strikes-rcna250112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> last week that the Israeli prime minister will brief the US president about more potential strikes against Iran.</p><p>The pro-Israel camp in Trump’s orbit seems to be already mobilising rhetorically against Iran’s missile programme.</p><p>US Senator Lindsey Graham visited Israel this month and called Iran’s missiles a “real threat” to Israel.</p><p>“This trip is about elevating the risk ballistic missiles pose to Israel,” Graham told The Jerusalem Post.</p><p>Trump authorised strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites during the June war, which he said “obliterated” the Iranian <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-says-its-strikes-degraded-irans-nuclear-programme-by-one-to-two-years\">nuclear programme</a>.</p><p>Although there is no evidence that Iran has been weaponising its nuclear programme, fears about a possible Iranian atomic bomb were the driving public justification for the US involvement in the conflict.</p><p>So it will be hard for Netanyahu to persuade Trump to back a war against Iran, said Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy.</p><p>The president is portraying himself as a peacemaker and prioritising a possible confrontation <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/un-experts-condemn-us-naval-blockade-of-venezuela-as-illegal-aggression\">with Venezuela</a>.</p><p>“It could just as well backfire on Netanyahu,” Toossi said of the push for more strikes against Iran. But he underscored that Trump is “unpredictable”, and he has surrounded himself with pro-Israel hawks, including Rubio.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-state-of-us-israel-relations\">What is the state of US-Israel relations?</h2><p>Despite growing dissent on the left and right of the US political spectrum, Trump’s support for Israel remains unwavering.</p><p>This month, the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/us-senate-passes-901bn-defence-bill\">US Congress passed</a> a military spending bill that includes $600m in military aid to Israel.</p><p>The Trump administration has continued to avoid even verbal criticism of Israel’s aggressive behaviour in the region, including Gaza ceasefire violations and the expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank.</p><p>At a White House Hanukkah celebration on December 16, Trump bemoaned the growing scepticism of unconditional support for Israel in Congress, falsely likening it to anti-Semitism.</p><p>“If you go back 10, 12, 15 years ago, at the most, the strongest lobby in Washington was the Jewish lobby. It was Israel. That’s no longer true,” Trump said.</p><p>“You have to be very careful. You have a Congress in particular which is becoming anti-Semitic.”</p><p>Despite Trump’s position, analysts said the gap between the strategic priorities of the US and Israel is growing.</p><p>While Washington is pushing for economic cooperation in the Middle East, Israel is seeking “total dominance” over the region, including US partners in the Gulf, Toossi said.</p><p>“Israel is pushing this uncompromising posture and strategic objective that I think is going to come to a head more with core US interests,” Toossi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next-for-the-us-israel-alliance\">What’s next for the US-Israel alliance?</h2><p>If you drive down Independence Avenue in Washington, DC, you will likely see more Israeli than American flags displayed on the windows of congressional offices.</p><p>Despite the shifting public opinion, Israel still has overwhelming support in Congress and the White House. And although criticism of Israel is growing within the Republican base, Israel’s detractors have been pushed to the margins of the movement.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> is leaving Congress; commentator Tucker Carlson is facing constant attacks and accusations of anti-Semitism; and Congressman Tom Massie is facing a Trump-backed primary challenger.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is filled with staunch Israel supporters, including Rubio, megadonor <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/who-is-miriam-adelson-the-pro-israel-donor-trump-lauded-at-the-knesset\">Miriam Adelson</a> and radio show host Mark Levin.</p><p>But amid the erosion of public support, especially among young people, Israel may face a reckoning in American politics in the long term.</p><p>On the Democratic side, some of Israel’s strongest supporters in Congress are facing primary challenges from progressive candidates who are centring Palestinian rights.</p><p>The most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), is increasingly becoming <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/centrist-us-democrat-says-he-returned-aipac-donations-cites-netanyahu-ties\">a toxic brand</a> for Democrats.</p><p>On the right, the faultlines in the consensus in support of Israel are growing wider. That trend was put on display at the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/turning-point-usa-held-its-americafest-conference-heres-what-happened\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">right-wing AmericaFest</a> conference this month when debates raged around support for Israel, a topic that was a foregone conclusion for conservatives a few years ago.</p><p>Although the Trump administration has been pushing to codify opposition to Zionism as anti-Semitism to punish Palestinian rights supporters, Vice President JD Vance has presented a more nuanced view on the issue.</p><p>“What is actually happening is that there is a real backlash to a consensus view in American foreign policy,” Vance recently told the UnHerd website.</p><p>“I think we ought to have that conversation and not try to shut it down. Most Americans are not anti-Semitic – they’re never going to be anti-Semitic – and I think we should focus on the real debate.”</p><p>Bottom line, the currents are changing, but the US commitment to Israel remains solid – for now.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Eritrea separately called on China to take action at the UN Security Council, drawing parallels to the Taiwan issue.</p><p>The European Union issued a statement calling for respect for Somalia’s sovereignty, but stopped short of condemning the Israeli move. It urged the authorities in Mogadishu and Hargeisa to engage in dialogue.</p><p>Israel’s move to recognise Somaliland came during a more than two-year genocidal war in Gaza, in which more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p><p>Israel is currently being investigated by the International Court of Justice over allegations of genocide, and Netanyahu is the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court on accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p>Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 after a civil war under military ruler Siad Barre.

A committee member told Al Jazeera that both countries agreed to transfer the aircraft’s flight recorder to a neutral country for a full investigation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-dreadful-scene\" class=\"p1\">‘A dreadful scene’</h2><p class=\"p1\">After visiting the site of the crash, sources from the Libyan military committee told Al Jazeera it was a “dreadful scene”, with body parts scattered everywhere.</p><p class=\"p1\">Identification was so difficult that authorities had to perform DNA testing on the body parts to identify which of the aircraft passengers they belonged to.</p><p class=\"p1\">It was only after the long, painstaking process was completed that the bodies were finally repatriated to Libya.</p><p class=\"p1\">A Turkish military ceremony was held in their honour early on Saturday morning, then the bodies were put on an aeroplane for the journey to Libya, but matters became complicated at that point.</p><p class=\"p1\">The seemingly straightforward matter of holding ceremonies for the deceased became an issue as details like where they would be held were debated hotly in the fractured country.</p><h2 id=\"is-general-al-haddad-replaceable\" class=\"p1\">Is General al-Haddad replaceable?</h2><p class=\"p1\">The Tripoli government is overseen by the Presidential Council, a three-member body that serves as the supreme commander of the military, according to the Libyan Political Agreement.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, Libya’s rival authorities in the east, controlled by renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, do not recognise them, despite the eastern-based parliament signing the agreement.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195892\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195892\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4195892\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/000_88YD8WG-1766685211.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Libyan military delegation members arrive at the wreckage site following the crash of a Libya-bound business jet carrying Libyan Chief of Staff General Muhammad Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, in Ankara on December 24, 2025.

The Presidential Council appointed his deputy, General Salah al-Namroush, temporarily.</p><p class=\"p1\">During his eulogy, al-Namroush “bid farewell to the men of the nation who carried the nation’s burdens and made discipline a way of life and leadership a responsibility”.</p><p class=\"p1\">He said he would follow in the footsteps of al-Haddad, and pledged “to continue unifying the army”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Although it will be difficult, political analyst Mohamed Mahfoudh told Al Jazeera: “Discussions are already under way; given the importance of the position, I expect a decision to be made within the next 10 days.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Libya has seen widespread frustration and recent protests against the government over the economic situation, prompting officials to announce a plan to reshuffle the cabinet earlier this month.</p><p class=\"p1\">The shuffle was scheduled to be announced on December 24, but al-Haddad’s death postponed that.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4193508\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4193508\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4193508\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap_694ba5a05aca8-1766565280.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Libya's army chief of staff Gen.

Misrata city officials announced the day as an official holiday to give people time off to attend the funeral.</p><p class=\"p1\">Abdullah Allafi, a tribal leader from al-Rajban in the Nafusa Mountains of western Libya, left home at 3am to drive hundreds of kilometres to pay his respects.</p><p class=\"p1\">When asked about al-Haddad’s death, he said: “It’s a huge loss. Mohamed al-Haddad’s death is a loss for all of us and for Libya. He was a true patriot. May Allah rest his soul.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Our presence here is a symbol of unity. Enough divisions, it’s time to come together and build a nation and a united military.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It did not give details about when or where she died.</p><p data-start=\"781\" data-end=\"1034\">Bardot rose to international fame in 1956 with her role in And God Created Woman, a film that sought to project female sexuality on screen. She went on to appear in about 50 films, becoming one of the most recognisable faces of post-war French cinema.</p><p data-start=\"1036\" data-end=\"1341\">In the early 1970s, Bardot quit acting at the height of her fame, turning her attention to animal protection. While her campaigning earned admiration from supporters, her public life grew increasingly controversial as she embraced far-right politics and made repeated racist and inflammatory remarks.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4199750\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4199750\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4199750\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP23108352888792-1766920097.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"French actress Brigitte Bardot poses\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4199750\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">French actress Brigitte Bardot poses with a huge sombrero she brought back from Mexico, as she arrives at Orly Airport in Paris, France, on May 27, 1965 [AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p data-start=\"1343\" data-end=\"1550\">Her activism hardened into open support for France’s far-right National Front, now known as National Rally, and the party’s longtime leader Marine Le Pen. Over the years, French courts convicted Bardot multiple times for inciting racial hatred.</p><p data-start=\"1552\" data-end=\"1844\">In 2022, a court fined her 40,000 euros ($47,000) after she described people from Reunion, a French overseas territory, as “degenerates” who had “kept their savage genes”. It marked the sixth time authorities had sanctioned her for racist and hate speech. Muslims and immigrants were among her frequent targets.</p><p data-start=\"1846\" data-end=\"2129\">Born in Paris in 1934, Bardot grew up in a conservative Catholic household and trained as a ballet dancer at the Conservatoire de Paris. She began modelling as a teenager, appearing on the cover of Elle at 15, which led to early film roles and her marriage to director Roger Vadim.</p><p data-start=\"2131\" data-end=\"2479\">Despite later being hailed by some as a trailblazer for women in cinema, Bardot dismissed complaints about sexual harassment in the film industry.</p><p data-start=\"2131\" data-end=\"2479\">“Many actresses flirt with producers to get a role. Then when they tell the story afterwards, they say they have been harassed. … In actual fact, rather than benefit them, it only harms them,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"2131\" data-end=\"2479\">“I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a pretty little a**. This kind of compliment is nice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The deaths continued even after many families were forcibly displaced and sought shelter in tents and makeshift camps, it said.</p><p data-start=\"1890\" data-end=\"2132\">The syndicate cited a recent case near Khan Younis, where the bodies of journalist Hiba al-Abadla, her mother and about 15 members of the al-Astal family were recovered nearly two years after Israeli aircraft bombed their home west of the city.</p><p data-start=\"2134\" data-end=\"2338\">“Hundreds of children, women and the elderly were killed because of a family member’s professional connection to journalism, in flagrant violation of all humanitarian and legal norms,” the committee said.</p><p data-start=\"2340\" data-end=\"2620\">According to the findings, Israeli attacks have repeatedly struck journalists’ homes, places of displacement and areas known to house media workers and their relatives. In some cases, entire families have been wiped out, leaving journalists alive to bear witness to their annihilation.</p><p data-start=\"2622\" data-end=\"2895\">The committee described this as a “qualitative shift” in Israel’s behaviour, moving from individual targeting to collective punishment.
