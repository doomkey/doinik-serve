If it wasn’t Turkiye, it would be Iraq. If it wasn’t Iraq, it would be Hezbollah. If it wasn’t Hezbollah, it would be the Muslim Brotherhood. It doesn’t matter who. There just always needs to be a threat.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"worsening-relations\">Worsening relations</h2><p>Israel has existed in a heightened state of war since the attack led by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Since then, Israel has carried out a genocide in Gaza, invaded Lebanon, bombed Yemen, occupied parts of Syria, launched a war against regional power Iran, and most recently defied global opinion and international law by moving closer to annexing territory in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Against this background, analysts explained, talk of more threats – such as the one from Turkiye – and fresh alliances are cast from the same mould. Despite being political opponents, Netanyahu and Bennett are both right-wing Israelis who are completely opposed to a Palestinian state, and who share similar beliefs on pushing for Israeli regional hegemony.</p><p>“This has always been what Naftali Bennett has been about,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said.</p><p>“Liberal [Israelis] have been projecting their own hopes onto him for years, simply because he was an opponent of Benjamin Netanyahu. That’s to miss the point,” he said, referencing both men’s apparent contempt for Palestinians. “He isn’t even pretending now. He’s just trying to overtake Netanyahu on his right.”</p><p>But a focus on Turkiye as a threat is both complicated – the two countries have a decades-long relationship, and Turkiye is a member of NATO – while also an understandable objective for an Israeli right keen to ensure that a new bogeyman exists.</p><p>While Israel has had an antagonistic relationship with Iran since the latter’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Israel-Turkiye relations have been more pragmatic, with Israel’s continued repression of Palestinians historically often a point of negotiated dispute, rather than open threats spurring aggressively hostile rhetoric.</p><p>However, since coming to power in the early 2000s, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been increasingly critical of Israel.</p><p>Israel’s attack on a flotilla travelling to Gaza in 2010, ultimately killing 10 Turkish activists, was one of the defining moments in the relationship’s downturn, with fierce political rhetoric and diplomatic downgrades following.</p><p>Subsequent Israeli military operations in Gaza and Syria have further fuelled public and government anger in Turkiye, with Ankara adopting an increasingly confrontational stance to Israel’s genocide and territorial ambitions, leaving bilateral ties strained and the suggestion of Turkiye’s involvement in Gaza’s proposed interim security force politically toxic in Israel.</p><p>But beyond their clear opposition to Israel, comparisons between Ankara and Tehran border upon the ludicrous, analysts said.</p><p>“Israel has worked alongside Turkiye numerous times,” said Pinkas. “It wasn’t all that long ago that policymakers in Israel talked of the Middle East being overseen by two superpowers, Israel and Turkiye, in opposition to Iran. And now they’re trying to supplant Iran with Turkiye? What are they talking about, armed conflict? Turkiye is a NATO power.”</p><p>Pinkas noted further points of difference. “Has the leadership in Turkiye ever denied Israel’s right to exist, or threatened to wipe it from the map?” he asked.</p><p>“No,” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hexagonal-alliances\">Hexagonal alliances</h2><p>While the alliance with the US is ultimately Israel’s biggest protection, it has also sought to broaden its network.</p><p>At the forefront of this, Netanyahu explained, would be the support of India’s Modi and what he described as a “hexagon” of allied states, including India, the aforementioned Greece and Cyprus, and various unspecified Arab, African, and Asian nations.</p><p>“The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye to eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis,” Netanyahu said, without specifying the “radical” states he was referring to.</p><p>Netanyahu stressed that his proposed new hexagon of alliances was intended to complement, rather than replace, Israel’s typical reliance on the US. But <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/some-israel-question-influence-over-us-iran-war-decision-nears\">some believe</a> – as support for Israel is becoming more politically toxic in the US – that Tel Aviv now needs to hedge its bets.</p><p>Political analyst Goldberg called the moves by Netanyahu “desperate”.</p><p>“All of this because we’ve burnt through past alliances with Russia and now the United States, so we’re [now] claiming that India will be leading this hexagon of ‘moderate states’,” Goldberg said. “Not even people in Israel, not even the most deluded, have any belief that Israel might still be a moderate state.”</p><p>And the talk of the Turkish threat and hexagonal alliances was evidence that Israel is not as central to decision-making on any US attack on Iran, said Yossi Mekelberg, an expert with Chatham House.</p><p>“It’s all deflection; there just isn’t any honesty, and it just gets worse and worse,” Mekelberg said of Netanyahu’s framing of events. “The big issue is Iran. [That is] what they’re interested in. Turkiye is just so much noise.”</p><p>While the intention may be to distract by talking up the Turkish threat, it still carries risks, Mekelberg cautioned.</p><p>“Most leaders, at least the devious ones, can separate rhetoric and reality, so there’s no real chance of one spilling over into the other,” he said. “The risk is that as Israel ramps up its rhetoric against Turkiye, it risks making it a genuine opponent.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

currency revenues yielded from selling the country’s vast oil resources, something that has worsened an ailing economy marked by rampant inflation and a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/irans-currency-drops-to-record-low-against-dollar-as-tensions\">depreciating national currency</a>.</p><p class=\"s7\">In an interview in mid-February that has since captured much attention in local media, a senior former oil executive described a major shift in how Iran’s oil money was handled as hopes faded for resurrecting the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/iran-says-restrictions-on-nuclear-programme-terminated-as-deal-expires\">2015 nuclear deal</a> with world powers and lifting sanctions.</p><p class=\"s7\">Ali Akbar Pour Ebrahim, a former CEO of Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO), the arm of the Ministry of Petroleum that sells most of Iran’s crude oil, told the semiofficial Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) the ministry has lost its agency in handling the funds.</p><p class=\"s7\">He explained that during the administration of former President Hassan Rouhani – when US President Donald Trump started his “maximum pressure” sanctions in 2018 after unilaterally reneging on the nuclear accord – the ministry directly handled oil proceeds, but it was sidelined during the administration of his successor <a href=\"/news/2024/5/20/who-is-irans-president-ebrahim-raisi\">President Ebrahim Raisi</a>.</p><p class=\"s7\">“They forced the Petroleum Ministry to shut down its own trustees and created bank trustees who operated under the purview of the country’s commercial banks, which operated under the Central Bank,” Pour Ebrahim said without identifying the people and entities responsible.</p><p class=\"s7\">The official, who is now a banking and investment executive, said “we knew from the start” the trustees would take the money for themselves, adding that as much as $11bn was not returned after being handled by them.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to Pour Ebrahim, the trustees “mushroomed” after taking the money and using nationals from neighbouring Pakistan and Afghanistan to open bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates and funnel the funds through shell companies.</p><p class=\"s7\">He said Raisi was following up on the issue before his death in a 2024 <a href=\"/news/2024/9/1/iran-probe-finds-bad-weather-caused-ex-president-raisis-helicopter-crash\">helicopter crash</a> and President Masoud Pezeshkian was also informed and ordered a review but no thorough investigation has been conducted.</p><p class=\"s8\">“Through the country’s oil money, these people became Rolls-Royce owners in the UAE overnight and are now living in penthouses of expensive hotels there,” Pour Ebrahim said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"s7\">Hossein Samsami, a member of the parliament’s economic commission, confirmed to state-affiliated media that some of the agent banks have been colluding with the trustees to declare receipt of oil money to the Central Bank even when no funds were deposited.</p><p class=\"s7\">Mahmood Khaghani, a career oil official who formerly led the Caspian and Central Asia department of the Petroleum Ministry, was quoted as saying by state media on Saturday that if an independent audit is allowed, it would emerge that the misappropriated money amounts to much more than $11bn.</p><p class=\"s7\">He said the trustee-based system was originally created about two decades ago when a “shadow government” emerged as international pressure grew over <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/netanyahu-calls-for-dismantling-irans-nuclear-programme-in-any-us-deal\">Iran’s nuclear programme</a>, leading to the country eventually being hit with United Nations sanctions.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to the official, experts were sidelined at the Petroleum Ministry and other bodies in favour of actors affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other unelected state bodies.</p><p class=\"s7\">“In effect, a number of people in the parliament, judiciary, government, and security and intelligence apparatuses entered oil deals,” Khaghani said. “This did not remain limited to selling oil. … The mafia is not active exclusively in oil but everywhere.”</p><h2 id=\"food-importers-become-oil-traders\" class=\"s3\">Food importers become oil traders</h2><p class=\"s7\">A Tehran-based oil expert, who spoke with Al Jazeera on background, said the nontransparent trustee model only begets corruption as powerful interest groups are given large sums with little to no accountability.</p><p class=\"s7\">E<span>conomist Morteza Afghah told the reformist Shargh newspaper that the misappropriated funds could have played a crucial role in bringing some stability to the country’s currency markets and reducing</span><a

class=\"s7\">“Allocating a strategic and complicated commodity to actors outside of their technical areas – under sanctions and faced with a currency crunch, without any transparent guarantees for the return of funds – appears neither logical nor low risk,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332307\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332307\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

plans to increase its reliance on the so-called trustees as authorities put in place contingencies for war.</p><p class=\"s7\">Agriculture Minister Gholamreza Nouri Ghezeljeh announced this month that importers of essential goods, including food, will now be officially given oil to sell and will be allowed to barter the oil for food.</p><p class=\"s7\">“From next year [starting in late March], it has been decreed that importers of essential goods will be introduced by the agriculture ministry to the Petroleum Ministry so they can get oil shipments,” he said, adding that the new trustees will be able to barter up to $1.5bn.</p><p class=\"s7\">This comes weeks after the Pezeshkian administration launched an initiative to eliminate a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/irans-government-budget-reveals-tough-road-ahead-as-currency-hits-new-low\">preferential currency exchange rate</a> for imports of essential goods, based on the rationale it was breeding corruption.</p><p class=\"s7\">With the new scheme by the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad, the same importers who had their profits slashed with the elimination of the cheaper currency rate will now benefit on a new level after becoming oil trustees.</p><p class=\"s7\">According to state-affiliated media, the Mostazafan Foundation of Islamic Revolution could be among the new recipients of Iranian oil, but the head of the top <a href=\"/news/2018/10/16/us-sanctions-network-supporting-irans-basij-resistance-force\">state-run bonyad</a>, or charitable trust, said last week it has received no shipments so far.</p><p class=\"s7\">In late January, Pezeshkian convened the governors of Iran’s border provinces and announced on state television he is <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/iran-delegates-import-powers-as-us-war-threats-keep-economy-unstable\">delegating some authority</a> to them.</p><p class=\"s7\">The empowered governors may import “all goods

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For many years, the global “rules-based order” was presented as a benign system of global governance established by the West. True, its origins went back to the colonial world and many of its systems reflected colonial racial inequalities, but it was held up as the harbinger of global prosperity and order. In it, the West had magically transformed from a colonial villain to a saviour.</p><p>But for much of the Global South, the era looked very different. It was experienced as genocide, plunder and displacement. Across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, colonial administrations disrupted and suppressed local systems and industries, engineered cash-crop economies vulnerable to global price shocks, and redrew political authority to prioritise imperial control.</p><p>Eventually, demands grew for a more accurate accounting of the catastrophe the West inflicted on the rest, for acknowledgment of its historic crimes from extermination to enslavement, and for recompense. That coincided with a reordering of global power that left the West increasingly unsure of itself – no longer the saviours of us, the good guys of history they had long pretended to be.</p><p>There was some mealy-mouthed acknowledgment of this. In Kenya’s case, revelations of the existence of British torture camps during the 1950s fight for independence produced expressions of regret without apology from the British government, and penny-pinching compensation.</p><p>Similarly, Germany accepted that it committed a genocide against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in Namibia in the first decade of the 20th century, but continues to refuse to pay any compensation, instead offering $1.3bn to be paid through aid programmes out over 30 years as “a gesture of reconciliation”.</p><p>These were just crumbs, but marked an important turning point. Movements around the world from Black Lives Matter in the United States to Rhodes Must Fall in South Africa pushed to reconstruct historical narratives about white supremacy and Western domination. Critical anti-colonial thought and discourse spilled from academia into popular culture.</p><p>But the backlash came soon enough. In some quarters, there was outright rejection of “white guilt”, which was picked up by politicians and included in political campaigns. Colonial revisionism proved popular and electable. It has also quickly made it to international forums.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent speech at the Munich Security Conference is a case in point. He spoke of the pre-1945 imperial order with praise. For him, it was a time when “the West had been expanding – its missionaries, its pilgrims, its soldiers, its explorers pouring out from its shores to cross oceans, settle new continents, build vast empires extending out across the globe.”</p><p>Rubio framed Western dominance as an era of prosperity and moral leadership, arguing that the West should not be ashamed of its past. Colonialism, in this telling, was not racial hierarchy and extraction but stewardship, order, and civilisation. Its decline, implicitly, is something to regret.</p><p>What Rubio and the likes of him are calling for is for the West to fully embrace its role as the villain. Not rhetorically, of course – bad guys rarely proclaim themselves as such – but practically, by rehabilitating empire and abandoning guilt and shame for historical wrongs. They see historical reckoning as weakness, even self-hatred. And rather than address the wrongs of the past, they propose to use power to suppress remembrance.</p><p>This is a clear attempt at redemption through the conquest of memory. This is not about merely debating the past. It is about shaping the moral vocabulary of the present. It is also about moving away from the current “rules-based order” and towards a reality where there are no rules for “might makes right”.</p><p>If empire is benevolent, then contemporary hierarchies can be reframed as responsible leadership. Unequal trade regimes become stability. Military pressure becomes guardianship. Interventions become stewardship. Colonialism, as we have seen in the case of US President Donald Trump’s so-called “Board of Peace”, is rebranded not as domination, but as necessary order and a prelude to prosperity. Multipolarity is framed not as structural adjustment, but as destabilising decline.</p><p>This is politically useful in a moment when Western dominance faces challenges from rising powers and shifting alliances. Nostalgia for uncontested supremacy offers clarity and replaces discomfort with pride. It transforms demands for justice into accusations of ingratitude. And its grammar mirrors the familiar pattern. Empire harms but ultimately saves. It errs but redeems itself. Its centrality remains unquestioned.</p><p>There is no need for structural reckoning or restitution. The focus shifts from the material consequences of colonial rule to the emotional burden of Western shame. The story becomes about restoring confidence rather than confronting inequality.</p><p>Rubio’s speech was meant for a Western audience, but for the rest of us, it should set off alarm bells. It is tempting to treat such rhetoric as the moral failing of a few bad men – easily caricatured and just as easily ignored. That would be a grave error.</p><p>We must recognise that they are reconstituting the architecture of colonialism: a legal, economic and epistemic system designed to privilege Western interests, its oppression codified in law, its dictates enforced through coercion, and its benefits distributed along racial lines.</p><p>Thus, the rehabilitation of empire is not nostalgia. It is preparation. It is the construction of a moral framework in which the hierarchies of the present need no justification because the hierarchies of the past have been absolved. And while the past cannot be undone, it can be misremembered.</p><p>We have been living with the terrible consequences of doing so in our economies, within our borders and in our bodies, and just as we start to discard the scales from our eyes, there is an attempt to blind us again. We must not acquiesce to the revisionism, but rather actively resist it by speaking our truth, insistently and without apology, until it cannot be drowned out.</p><p>Memory is not passive. It is a choice made every day, and the choice belongs to us as much as to anyone.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In his view, Mexico’s government had simply been “doing its job” in the “<a href=\"/opinions/2021/6/17/as-the-drug-war-turns-50-the-us-is-still-public-enemy-number-one\">war on drugs</a>” by eliminating El Mencho, and the US had nothing substantial to do with it.</p><p>Indeed, much like her predecessor and mentor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Sheinbaum has perfected the art of doing the gringos’ dirty work while purporting to act in a “<a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/29/if-cuba-falls-the-global-south-is-to-blame-too\">sovereign</a>” fashion – and even to defy the imperial overlords to the north.</p><p>Granted, she does not have a whole lot of room to manoeuvre given the <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/3/venezuela-american-regime-change-with-a-trumpian\">recent kidnapping</a> by the US of Venezuelan head of state Nicolas Maduro – and the fact that Trump has made it known that he is beholden to no law, whether domestic or international.</p><p>But while Sheinbaum may have seen no choice but to temporarily placate the Americans and satisfy Trump’s need for blood, Mexicans will pay a heavy price.</p><p>A brief review of contemporary Mexican history confirms as much. No sooner did then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon launch his “drug war” under US guidance in 2006 than homicides and enforced disappearances <a href=\"/opinions/2025/3/28/in-mexico-enforced-disappearance-is-a-way-of-life\">skyrocketed</a> in the country.</p><p>Well over half a million people have since been killed and disappeared, many of them victims of militarised agents of the state who often operate in cahoots with organised crime.</p><p>Nary a dent has been put in the northward flow of drugs while the southward flow of <a href=\"/opinions/2022/2/20/us-gun-companies-are-making-a-killing-in-mexico\">US-manufactured weapons</a> continues unabated.</p><p>The state of Jalisco itself happens to have the highest number of enforced disappearances in all of Mexico and made headlines last year with the discovery of a <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/3/26/how-the-discovery-of-a-mass-grave-sparked-uproar-over-the-missing-in-mexico\">clandestine crematorium</a> on a ranch outside Guadalajara, one of the host cities of the upcoming World Cup.</p><p>The ranch was reportedly used by the CJNG as a recruitment and training centre as well as an extermination site.</p><p>And the removal of El Mencho from the equation will do precisely nothing in terms of pacifying the landscape – just as the respective extraditions to the US of Sinaloa cartel leaders <a href=\"/opinions/2015/7/16/el-chapo-guzman-in-context\">Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman</a> and <a href=\"/opinions/2015/7/16/el-chapo-guzman-in-context\">Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada</a> merely set off an <a href=\"/opinions/2024/12/4/fear-and-loathing-in-culiacan-sinaloa\">ongoing violent battle</a> for power.</p><p>Contrary to lofty soundbites from US officials, the empire is not at all interested in getting rid of either drug trafficking or violence south of the border as both phenomena provide a perennial excuse for US interference in Mexico and beyond.</p><p>Were the gringos actually serious about ridding “Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world” of the whole cartel problem, a decriminalisation of drugs would do much to nip the business in the bud by rendering the movement of drugs far less fantastically lucrative.</p><p>A moratorium on the US’s obsessive manufacture of weapons would also help.</p><p>Obviously, nothing so much as resembling those potential solutions is even on the horizon. If it were, that would be one hell of a “great development” indeed.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Despite the whirlwind operation, relative calm has prevailed in Venezuela since, while faultlines in the country’s leadership remain active under the helm of interim President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a>.</p><p>Rodriguez has shifted from early defiance to a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/venezuelas-rodriguez-vows-release-of-more-prisoners-holds-call-with-trump\">more conciliatory</a> tone towards the administration of US President Donald Trump, in contrast to Gil, who has levelled harsher condemnations of US actions.</p><p>Gil on Monday, addressing the UN council, said the US operation, which he called a “systematic campaign”, resulted in more than 100 deaths. He described Maduro’s abduction as a “political operation disguised as a legal debate”.</p><p>Despite these events of early January, however, the foreign minister stated that Venezuela is not in a state of war with the country that he said has been attacking it for the past decade, noting the US blockade and sanctions imposed on Venezuela for years in “full view of the world”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) described Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian situation as <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/imf-warns-venezuelas-economy-and-humanitarian-situation-is-quite-fragile\">“quite fragile”</a>, pointing to an estimated triple-digit inflation and a sharply depreciating currency. Sanctions have played a role – but so has government mismanagement.</p><p>Earlier this month, the US Department of the Treasury announced it was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/trump-says-planning-to-make-visit-to-venezuela-following-maduro-abduction\">easing some sanctions</a> on Venezuela’s energy sector, the largest reprieve since Maduro’s abduction.</p><p>Gil further stated that Venezuela has begun a process of reconciliation and political coexistence following recent developments in the country, and emphasised that Venezuela will resolve its issues internally, referring to the recently approved <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/venezuela-receives-more-than-1500-amnesty-requests-under-new-law\">2026 Amnesty Law for Democratic Coexistence</a>.</p><p>The law, which was signed on Thursday, could free hundreds of people jailed over protests and political unrest dating back decades. This week alone, it granted amnesty to 379 <a href=\"/news/longform/2026/2/20/a-fragile-freedom-for-venezuelas-released-political-prisoners\">political prisoners</a>. The new regulation marks a considerable shift for the country, which has long denied holding any political prisoners.</p><p>Gil, in his address to the UN rights council, stressed that human rights should not be used as a pretext for war and that the UN forum must remain impartial.</p><p>“Human rights should not be instruments of political war; they should not be selective, and they should not depend on ideological alignment,” said Gil.</p><p>“While some countries are subjected to constant and disproportionate scrutiny, tragedies of enormous magnitude, such as the devastation of the Palestinian people, do not receive the firm and proportionate attention demanded by international law and human conscience,” he added.</p><p>Gil also urged the council to end all punitive measures against Venezuela and to respect the sovereignty of states.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Secondly, they are engaging in meaningful conversation, trying to understand how a potential ceasefire could work from a technical perspective, just to have that frame on the table.</p><p>But meaningful does not mean in good faith.</p><p>Putin believes he can win the war. He believes he’s making progress on the battlefield and that he can manage problems in the Russian economy. His strategy is that Ukraine is going to fall before he does.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Is the current situation something you imagined back in February 2022?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> When war breaks out, your first instinct is to believe that it’s not going to last long … and all you have to do is just to survive the first attack, and then the attacking side will realise that it failed to achieve its goals.</p><p>But while keeping this instinctive scenario on your mind, you always have to also remember that things may last longer than you expect.</p><p>Did I expect the war to last for four years? No, I didn’t. But was I preparing myself for a long war? Yes, somewhere in the back of my mind, I was keeping that option open.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: What does victory mean to you now?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> It started as a nightmare, and by the end of [2022], we captured half of the territories Russia had captured in the first months of the invasion, and we were pushing them back on old fronts. [Russian troops] were struggling to stabilise the front line; a sense of euphoria dominated in Ukraine, both among the decision-makers and the population.</p><p>This was the moment when victory was defined as regaining control of the 1991 border, which had existed before Russia annexed Crimea and intervened in the east of Ukraine in 2014.</p><p>But this hope … did not pass the reality check by the end of 2023, when our big counteroffensive failed to deliver.</p><p>Since then, politicians and people in Ukraine find it more and more difficult to redefine victory and speak about it, which I think is a big problem, because if you do not define what your final goal is, you will never get it.</p><p>So I offer my understanding of victory today, which would be to cease fire along the existing front line to stop hostilities and introduce a provisional truce between Russia and Ukraine to receive a long multi-year programme of military support to Ukraine; to launch a multi-billion recovery plan for Ukraine, and to see Ukraine as a member of the European Union.</p><p>Victory should always be defined, not only against your own goals, but also against the initial goals of your enemy.</p><p>So if I look back at 2022 and assume that Russia’s main objective was the demolition of the Ukrainian statehood and the return of Ukraine under its full control, then … Russia failed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p id=\"do-you-feel-the-west-and-your-vision-are-aligned\"><strong>Al Jazeera: Do you feel the West and your vision are aligned?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> The West doesn’t really exist anymore in the form we are used to thinking about it.</p><p>Europe is aligned. Some countries outside of Europe, which belong to what used to be the West, are aligned as well, such as Japan, Australia, and other nations.</p><p>The United States holds a different view now; they just want to end hostilities at any cost.</p><p id=\"there-s-been-a-lot-of-talk-of-security-guarantees-what-would-you-need-to-see-in-order-for-a-potential-ceasefire-to-hold\"><strong>Al Jazeera: What security guarantees does Ukraine need for a potential ceasefire to hold?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> It would be Russia accepting that Ukraine has a right to exist as an independent, sovereign and European nation.</p><p>Everything in between a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/ukraines-security-guarantees-what-are-they-and-why-might-they-fall-short\">potential ceasefire</a> and the acceptance of this fact will be a conflict, taking one form or another.</p><p id=\"is-there-still-defiance-among-ukrainians\"><strong>Al Jazeera: Is there still defiance among Ukrainians?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> We won the winter battle.

What did you learn about the appeal of some of Russia’s narratives?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> First, Russia’s influence in countries of the Global South is overestimated.</p><p>Russia is not strong on its own. It is strong because it has China behind its back, and China is extremely strong all over the world.</p><p>Secondly, it is not because people in the Global South like Russia. It’s because they don’t like the West or what has been left out of it.</p><p>The anti-Western European, anti-American sentiment is so strong that many prefer to sympathise [with the] Russian narrative simply because it’s anti-European … not because it’s a strong argument in itself.</p><p>The third lesson is that you cannot come and demand anything, because [countries in the Global South] have grown quite a thick skin against those coming to their capitals and demanding.</p><p id=\"did-you-find-that-some-aspects-of-ukraine-s-experience-actually-resonated-with-those-experiences-of-the-global-south-especially-regarding-sovereignty\"><strong>Al Jazeera: Did Ukraine’s experience resonate?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> No, because, for example, if you go to Africa, their understanding of colonialism is set in stone, and it’s a white man oppressing a Black man.</p><p>So for them, a white man oppressing another white man … is a bad thing, but it’s not colonialism.</p><p>I just dropped the argument. These nations are forward-looking. When it comes to countries like Ukraine, they don’t want to hear about grievances and historical parallels.</p><p>They don’t want to hear the stories of how Ukraine, as part, while being part of the Soviet Union, was part of the anti-colonial and anti-apartheid efforts.</p><p>They want to know how they can do business with you, while not alienating Russia.</p><p id=\"how-important-is-the-global-south-in-shaping-a-potential-peace-process-and-also-the-future-of-ukraine\"><strong>Al Jazeera: Is the Global South important in shaping a peace process and the future of Ukraine?</strong></p><p><strong>Kuleba:</strong> We have to be respectful, but honest. I actually doubt it exists as a whole, but let’s say that part of the world that is called the Global South is not willing to risk its involvement in the effort to settle the conflict.</p><p>Some countries do have leverage, and some countries are absolutely fundamental for brokering the peace and making things work.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and [its] role in the global oil market; the United Arab Emirates, who are providing a platform for negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the United States. Some of the players can and should play a role.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It follows the “pink tide” from Hugo Chavez’s 1998 victory in Venezuela through new leaders like Brazil’s Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva and Bolivia’s Evo Morales to the arrival of a new kind of Argentinian woman president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. This was an era of corruption scandals, drug-trafficking, migration crises, and dramatic turns such as Brazil’s polarising swing from Lula to Jair Bolsonaro and back again. It was also a new age of United States interference, from the US’s backing of Alvaro Uribe’s hardline strategies in Colombia to its January 2026 attack on Venezuela and its abduction of President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Now, as Chinese influence grows and Washington’s rhetoric hardens, answers to the question “What path lies ahead for Latin America?” must also consider the pressures on democracy exerted by autocrats, militias, and resurgent authoritarian populism.</p><p>Bringing together first-hand testimony, expert insight, and rare archives, this film reflects on how Latin America’s destiny seems bound to US ambition – yet driven by its own immensely complicated politics of survival, dreams of justice and stability, and peace.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 23 Feb 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">23 Feb 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

He said together, they would unite to collectively stand against what he called “radical” adversaries.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p data-start=\"992\" data-end=\"1144\">“In the vision I see before me, we will create an entire system, essentially a ‘hexagon’ of alliances around or within the Middle East,” Netanyahu said.</p><p data-start=\"1146\" data-end=\"1379\">“The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye to eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis.”</p><p data-start=\"590\" data-end=\"990\">However, no government has publicly endorsed this plan – or its sectarian framing. Two of the three countries Netanyahu named – Greece and Cyprus – are members of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has an <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-israeli-pm-netanyahu-for-war-crimes-in-gaza\">arrest warrant</a> out for Netanyahu for war crimes in Gaza, and would be legally obliged to arrest him if he set foot there.</p><p data-start=\"1381\" data-end=\"1521\">Andreas Krieg, associate professor of security studies at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera that the Israeli prime minister may be overselling his idea.</p><p data-start=\"1523\" data-end=\"1754\">“The ‘unnamed Arab/African/Asian’ component may exist in the form of ad hoc security coordination and transactional diplomacy, but not necessarily in a way that resembles a NATO-style pact or treaty. It isn’t an alliance,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"1756\" data-end=\"1897\">“I’d treat the ‘hexagon’ less as a deliverable alliance and more as a branding exercise for a patchwork of existing relationships,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-netanyahu-mean-by-radical-axes\" data-start=\"1756\" data-end=\"1897\">What does Netanyahu mean by ‘radical axes’?</h2><p data-start=\"97\" data-end=\"348\">Netanyahu is seeking to replicate what he describes as his “victories” against the “Shia axis” – also known as the <a href=\"/video/start-here/2024/11/11/irans-axis-of-resistance-explained-start-here\">“axis of resistance”</a> – an informal, Iran-centred network of allied groups that oppose Israeli and Western influence in the Middle East.</p><p data-start=\"350\" data-end=\"550\">At its core stands Iran, which supports Hezbollah in Lebanon – long regarded as the region’s most powerful non-state actor aligned with Tehran before Israel killed much of its leadership in 2024.</p><p data-start=\"552\" data-end=\"706\">In Iraq, Tehran maintains ties with various Shia armed groups, including factions within the Popular Mobilisation Forces and groups such as Kataib Hezbollah.</p><p data-start=\"708\" data-end=\"858\">More recently, in Yemen, <a href=\"/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide\">the Houthis,</a> a Zaidi Shia movement, have risen in prominence, with Tehran providing material support, training and weapons.</p><h2 id=\"is-netanyahu-right-about-an-emerging-sunni-axis-as-well\">Is Netanyahu right about an emerging ‘Sunni axis’ as well?</h2><p data-start=\"2012\" data-end=\"2361\">Not really. Israel attacked at least six countries in the region in 2025, including Palestine, Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, and conducted attacks linked to Gaza in international waters in Tunisia and Greece.</p><p data-start=\"2012\" data-end=\"2361\">It has also <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/arab-islamic-countries-condemn-netanyahus-greater-israel-remark\">threatened</a> Egypt, <a href=\"/features/2025/9/21/is-turkiye-israel-next-target-middle-east\">Turkiye</a>, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Jordan.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2495\">Rather than forming a unified “Sunni axis” – as Netanyahu describes them – several Sunni-majority states in the region have coordinated diplomatically in response to Israel’s regional belligerence.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2495\">This coordination has included <a href=\"https://web.mfa.gov.so/joint-statement-by-a-cross-regional-group-of-countries-on-israels-illegal-recognition-of-the-somaliland-region-of-the-federal-republic-of-somalia-on-26-december-2025/\">joint statements</a> condemning Israeli efforts to recognise Somaliland as an independent state, condemning Israeli strikes on Syria and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2495\">The need to counter Israeli actions also loomed over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s state visits at the start of February to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Those countries have experienced strained relations in recent years.</p><p data-start=\"2497\" data-end=\"2758\">“We see that there are growing common efforts by regional countries against Israel, joint statements, joint diplomatic efforts, joint military engagements, the exploration of potential for joint defence adventures,” said Omer Ozkizilcik, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.</p><p data-start=\"2760\" data-end=\"2965\">“This alliance is not an alliance or not a collective alliance based on an ideology or based on Sunnism. This is a geopolitical, realistic behaviour and these states happen to be Sunni majority,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331688\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331688\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331688\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20180115__WO7WH__v1__HighRes__IndiaIsraelPoliticsDiplomacy-1-1771837604.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C468&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (R) hugs Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a press conference at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on January 15, 2018.

It simultaneously engages China, Russia and the United States.</p><p data-start=\"3687\" data-end=\"3954\">India also maintains extensive ties across the Gulf. Workers in the region send home billions in remittances annually. New Delhi retains close relations with Iran – describing ties as “<a href=\"https://www.mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/India-Iran-Jan-2025.pdf\">civilisational</a>” – while also expanding <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.jp/en/saudi-arabia/article_145823/\">strategic cooperation</a> with Saudi Arabia.</p><p data-start=\"3956\" data-end=\"4282\">“The danger is in the signalling,” noted Krieg. Netanyahu’s framing as an “axis vs axis” project “risks hardening regional polarisation, giving Israel’s rivals (Iran, but also Turkiye and others) an easy narrative of encirclement, and making some would-be partners more cautious about being seen too close to Israel.”</p><p data-start=\"4284\" data-end=\"4442\">Netanyahu’s rhetoric could pull “India further into Middle East fault lines it generally prefers to manage pragmatically, not ideologically,” Krieg said, noting that India’s main interests lie in defence, technology and trade rather than signing up to Israel’s regional ambitions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4211384\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4211384\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4211384\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/000_88V2346-1767446339.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (C), Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides (L) and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis (R) hold a joint press conference after a trilateral meeting in Jerusalem on December 22, 2025.

Although formally centred on energy and connectivity, the grouping has steadily expanded into security and defence cooperation, in part aimed at Turkiye.</p><p data-start=\"4702\" data-end=\"4971\">Greece approved the purchase of 36 PULS rocket artillery systems from Israel in 2025, valued at approximately $760m. The two sides are holding discussions about a broader defence package estimated at $3.5bn, including an Israeli-built multi-layered air defence system.</p><p data-start=\"4973\" data-end=\"5065\">Cyprus has also received Israeli-made air defence systems, with further deliveries expected.</p><p data-start=\"5067\" data-end=\"5290\">Yet even here, the picture is fluid. Turkiye and Greece have entered a cautious rapprochement. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited Ankara earlier this month in an effort to stabilise relations and expand economic ties.</p><p data-start=\"5292\" data-end=\"5570\">“The truth is that while there are all sorts of tactical partners Israel might have, technical partnerships and alliances Israel might enjoy, nobody wants to touch Israel with a 10-foot pole,” said Ori Goldberg, an independent Israeli analyst and political commentator.</p><p data-start=\"5572\" data-end=\"5766\">“Israel is bad news. The Israeli brand has deteriorated to such an extent that it only brings potential chaos and instability, and in the most literal sense, look at what Israel does,” he added.</p><p data-start=\"45\" data-end=\"310\">On the face of it, Israel’s pitch for a wider regional alliance runs counter to the interests of these countries, which Krieg notes are largely centred on “Eastern Mediterranean security and energy dynamics” rather than a broader Middle East project Netanyahu envisions.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-now\">Why now?</h2><p data-start=\"5786\" data-end=\"5855\">The initiative comes at a politically sensitive moment for Netanyahu, whose legal troubles abroad have been compounded by legal troubles at home.</p><p data-start=\"5857\" data-end=\"6102\">“With elections due later this year, Netanyahu has a clear incentive to project statesmanship and to argue that Israel is not diplomatically isolated and that it can still convene meaningful regional and extra-regional partnerships,” said Krieg.</p><p data-start=\"6104\" data-end=\"6255\">Netanyahu faces domestic pressure over proposed judicial reforms and protests surrounding efforts to recruit ultra-Orthodox Jews into military service.</p><p data-start=\"6257\" data-end=\"6385\">He is also standing trial in <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/beyond-netanyahu-israels-major-political-corruption-scandals\">three corruption cases</a> involving charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust dating back to 2016, which may very well end in jail time.</p><p data-start=\"6387\" data-end=\"6445\">His “hexagon” initiative “reads as a hedge”, Krieg argued.</p><p data-start=\"6447\" data-end=\"6711\">“The Saudi normalisation track has become far more politically costly for Riyadh, and Israel is trying to show it has alternatives and can build ‘minilateral’ coalitions around connectivity, energy and security even without a headline Saudi breakthrough,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"6713\" data-end=\"6848\">Since October 2023, Israel’s economy has faced mounting strain, with business closures rising and credit agencies downgrading outlooks.</p><p data-start=\"6850\" data-end=\"7026\">“The Israeli economy is not doing well … jobs are disappearing, and investments are much costlier than they were. Israel is faltering at best and sailing at worst,” Goldberg said.</p><p data-start=\"7028\" data-end=\"7171\">“Nothing Israel does seems to work. So what’s better than to fully retreat into a fantasy world where you have a hexagonal alliance?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Or is that precisely what he and his fellow proponents of the ideology believe?</p><h2 id=\"how-did-christian-zionism-begin-and-what-are-its-tenets\">How did Christian Zionism begin, and what are its tenets?</h2><p>In 1878, William Blackstone, a student of the prominent American evangelist Dwight Moody and a believer in the biblical restoration of Israel, published a book titled Jesus Is Coming. The best-selling work popularised among Americans a belief held by some Christian leaders: that God had given the land of Israel to the Jewish people.</p><p>This conviction, often taken from a Protestant evangelical perspective, draws on the ancient biblical idea that, nearly four millennia ago, God promised the land to the Jews, who would rule it until the return of Jesus to Jerusalem for the rapture. According to this theology, Christians will be saved upon Christ’s return while non-Christians who do not convert will face damnation.</p><p>The most commonly quoted Bible verse relating to this covenant is Genesis 12:3, in which God tells Abraham: “I will bless those who bless you and I will curse those who curse you and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed,” according to the Religion Media Centre.</p><p>According to ChristianZionism.org, a website run by professors, pastors and leaders of church-related organisations, four themes can be found in Christian Zionist thought: One, the founding of today’s nation-state of Israel in 1948 marked the final human era and signals an end of times. Two, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East is a part of God’s plan with a great and final war preceding the second coming of Christ. Three, God’s covenant with Israel is eternal and unconditional. And four, failing to support Israel’s political dominance today will incur divine judgement.</p><p>Writer and historian David Swift said that although many Christians – evangelical or otherwise – supported the creation of Israel before 1948, they cannot be called Christian Zionists in the modern parlance.</p><p>“This is because Christian Zionism essentially fuses religious belief with a military, strategic and even economic programme,” Swift told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Specifically, Christian Zionism is not just the belief that the biblical land of Israel is the ordained country of the Jewish people but that it is in America’s strategic, military and economic interest to support the expansion of Israel.”</p><p>Fathi Nimer, a policy fellow at Al-Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy Network, described the movement as one that “translates into absolute unquestioning support for the Israeli regime”.</p><p>He described hearing a podcast about a Christian Zionist woman visiting Bethlehem who, after seeing the separation wall, Israeli soldiers and the harsh conditions in Palestinian refugee camps, remarked: “I feel bad for them, but scripture is scripture.”</p><p>“‘Scripture is scripture’ – that overrides everything,” Nimer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“That’s why it’s such a powerful tool for brainwashing.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-many-american-christian-zionists-are-there\">How many American Christian Zionists are there?</h2><p>According to author and academic Tristan Sturm, the largest population of Christian Zionists is in the US, and it numbers more than 30 million. Most are affiliated with evangelical churches in the southeast and south-central regions, often referred to as the “Bible Belt”.</p><p>The biggest organisation is Christians United for Israel, which itself boasts 10 million members, Nimer said.</p><p>“They are overwhelmingly conservative Republicans, found mostly in the Bible Belt, but also other places in the United States, and they form one of the most formidable voting blocs in the Republican Party,” he said.</p><p>Swift stated that only a few million from this group, however, are “fully signed up to the political, military and religious aspects of Christian Zionism”.</p><h2 id=\"what-impact-do-christian-zionists-have-on-us-policy\">What impact do Christian Zionists have on US policy?</h2><p>Nimer argued that Christian Zionists are “deeply intertwined” with American politics. “A lot of the major donors to the Republican Party and also the Democratic Party are Christian Zionists,” Nimer said.</p><p>According to the analyst, Christian Zionists are a cornerstone of Israeli lobbying groups, ranging from the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/aipac-linked-pac-ups-pressure-on-moderate-us-democrat-in-new-strategy\">American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)</a> to the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/5/why-is-adl-the-jewish-advocacy-group-receiving-blowback-from-maga\">Anti-Defamation League</a>, “that work to spread the Israeli narrative” in American society.</p><p>Meanwhile, a lot of members of the US Congress are “openly” Christian Zionist, Nimer said.</p><p>“[Politicians like] Mike Huckabee, … they reached the highest echelons of the state. And they bring these beliefs into their politics, into their policies,” the analyst said.</p><p>US foreign policy on Israel is, therefore, heavily influenced and shaped around the underlying biblical premise that the Jewish people are divinely destined to be restored to Palestine, he argued.</p><p>“When it comes to Palestine and the region in general, as you see right now with the [potential] war in Iran, they’re saying that the ballistic missile programme is now on the table,” Nimer said.</p><p>“It has nothing to do with the nuclear deal, … but the idea is that Israel must be able to maintain its superiority over every country in the region, and that’s a decree by God because if Israel prospers, then that’s another step towards the end of the world.”</p><p>Christian Zionist groups have also backed Israel’s illegal settlement project in the occupied West Bank and other measures that they see as reinforcing Israeli Jewish sovereignty.</p><p>Furthermore, for two decades, organisations such as HaYovel have been bringing in hundreds of American Christian volunteers to work in Israeli settlement agricultural projects, especially during the genocidal war on Gaza, when Jewish Israelis were called for military duty. Many also strongly endorsed US President Donald Trump’s moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017.</p><p>Swift, however, said Christian Zionists have played only a minor role in shaping US support for Israel and their influence is waning.</p><p>He argued that while Christian Zionism is integrated with a “broader neoconservative foreign policy agenda” also tied to the “US defence industry and broader military-industrial complex”, the group does not have much influence in American politics, and, in fact, it is declining.</p><p>Traditionally, US government support for Israel was driven by Cold War considerations and by pressure from the Jewish community within the US and lobbying groups like AIPAC. What played less of a role was support for Israel from evangelical Christians and the smaller community of Christian Zionists, Swift said.</p><p>“The US president is finally de facto abandoning the previous theoretical support for a two-state solution – although not for Christian Zionist reasons. When Trump talks of ethnically cleansing Gaza and turning it into a beach resort, he uses the language of real estate, not the Old Testament,” the historian said.</p><p>According to the analysts, very representative.</p><p>“It is pretty representative: Christian Zionists derive their understanding of the proper borders of Israel from the same place as people like [Israeli National Security Minister] Itamar Ben-Gvir and [Israeli Finance Minister] Bezalel Smotrich: the Old Testament. Therefore, they think Israel should expand to include all of the territory of ‘biblical Israel’,” Swift said, referring to the far-right Israeli cabinet members who have worked to expand and protect Israeli settlements and outposts in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law.</p><p>Nimer said Huckabee’s statement is also not something that can be criticised within the Christian Zionist community.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to criticise that because it’s like you’re criticising prophecy and you’re criticising God and the return of Jesus,” he said.</p><p>Huckabee’s comments, therefore, come as no surprise despite infringing upon the sovereignty of US allies in the Middle East, Nimer said.</p><p>On Monday, Smotrich said Israel would eventually occupy the Gaza Strip and establish a Jewish settlement there despite a “ceasefire” that went into effect in October.</p><p>“We are giving US President Donald Trump the opportunity to do it in his own way. If he does not succeed in eliminating Hamas, the Israeli army will get international legitimacy and American support to do it,” he said in statements to Israeli radio.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-do-jewish-israelis-view-christian-zionists\">How do Jewish Israelis view Christian Zionists?</h2><p>Mimi Kirk, the director of the Institute for the Study of Christian Zionism and the associate director of Georgetown University’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, <a href=\"/opinions/2020/2/16/christian-zionist-archaeology-a-tool-of-palestinian-subjugation\">writes</a> that “despite the matter of their supposed end-of-times demise according to this view, Jewish Israeli leaders have embraced the money and influence on US foreign policy that Christian Zionists offer,” especially as its adherents include top officials from the first Trump administration, including former Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p><p>Nimer said it’s a rather “cynical relationship”, given that the Christian Zionist worldview, which sees all non-Christians going to hell, is “anti-Semitic to the bone”.</p><p>“But they support Israel, so it’s fine,” the policy analyst said.</p><p>“They care about what they can get out of them right now as the biggest support base in the West currently.”</p><p>Israel is further banking on this support because it is quickly losing its “progressive facade” of a “liberal democracy” with “all these progressive rights”, Nimer added.</p><p>“This has completely faded over the last few decades, and especially since the genocide in Gaza, this has become completely unacceptable.”</p><h2 id=\"how-do-christians-in-palestine-view-christian-zionists\">How do Christians in Palestine view Christian Zionists?</h2><p>Palestinian Christians have long voiced concern that the Christian Zionist position threatens their existence, further entrenching Israel’s occupation while marginalising their community and undermining the historic churches of the Holy Land.</p><p>Just last month, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/jerusalem-patriarch-churches-say-christian-zionism-threatens-christianity\">Patriarchs and Heads of the Churches in Jerusalem said</a> activities by local individuals advancing “damaging ideologies, such as Christian Zionism” “mislead the public, sow confusion, and harm the unity of our flock”.</p><p>The Christian leaders warned that these efforts could undermine the Christian presence not only in the Holy Land but across the wider Middle East.</p><p>The statement came amid growing concern among Palestinian Christians that Israel’s policies – including land confiscation, settlement expansion and pressure on church property – are accelerating the erosion of one of the world’s oldest Christian communities.</p><h2 id=\"are-there-critiques-of-christian-zionism-among-other-christians\">Are there critiques of Christian Zionism among other Christians?</h2><p>Criticism of Christian Zionists from within Christianity is abundant.</p><p>In the US, the Institute for the Study of Christian Zionism was created to critique and combat the movement through liberation theology, seeking justice for Palestinians and a resolution to the ongoing conflict.</p><p>Swift pointed out that many of the world’s most Catholic countries, from Ireland to those in South America and Southern Europe, “tend to be quite pro-Palestinian”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Palestinian Christian scholars “have written very detailed theological critiques of Christian Zionism”, Nimer said, as have pastors from other parts of the Global South.</p><p>A prize awarded by the Nelson Mandela Foundation last year was explicitly aimed at initiatives working against Christian Zionism, and a conference next month in Turkiye is being organised to combat the ideology, Nimer said.</p><p>“The world is waking up to how insidious this ideology is and how it creeps into societies and makes it impossible to have any kind of solidarity with Palestinians as long as they believe it,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is rumoured that he was a police officer before he became a drug lord.</p><p>He rose in the ranks of Mexico’s drug-trafficking underworld in the 1990s. In 1994, he was convicted in the US of heroin trafficking and served nearly three years in prison before returning to Mexico.</p><p>There are plenty of stories about El Mencho’s methods of dealing with adversaries.</p><p>He once sent a severed pig’s head in an ice chest to a Mexican attorney as a threat, Rolling Stone magazine reported in 2015, quoting an unnamed former field agent with the US Drug Enforcement Administration.</p><p>A recording of a call captured him threatening a local police commander with the call sign “Delta One”, promising to kill him “and even your dogs” if his officers didn’t back off, then ending with a nonchalant “Sorry for the bad language.”</p><p>As El Mencho rose to become a powerful drug dealer, he began to heavily invest in submarines, which he used to transport drugs from South America to the US, Rolling Stone reported. The magazine quoted the former DEA agent as saying El Mencho hired Russian naval engineers to help design the submarines.</p><p>He became one of Washington’s most wanted fugitives, and the US had offered a $15m reward for information leading to his arrest.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-known-about-the-jalisco-new-generation-cartel\">What is known about the Jalisco New Generation Cartel?</h2><p>El Mencho founded the cartel in about 2009 and rapidly expanded it, using online recruitment and diversifying its income streams through fuel theft, extortion, timeshare scams and other rackets.</p><p>The US has identified the Jalisco cartel along with the Sinaloa Cartel as the organisations primarily responsible for trafficking <a href=\"/news/2023/10/5/whats-fentanyl-and-why-have-deaths-due-to-drug-overdose-spiked-in-the-us\">fentanyl</a> into the US in recent years. The DEA considers the Jalisco cartel to be as powerful as Sinaloa with a presence in all 50 US states. The DEA said it is active in 21 of Mexico’s 32 states.</p><p>The Jalisco cartel has become notorious for its assaults on Mexican security forces. In 2015, it shot down a military helicopter in Jalisco.</p><p>In 2020, it tried to assassinate then-Mexico City Police Chief Omar Garcia Harfuch, who now serves as the federal security secretary.</p><p>In February last year, Mexico <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/why-has-mexico-handed-over-drug-cartel-leaders-to-us-who-are-they\">handed over</a> senior Jalisco cartel leader Antonio Oseguera Cervantes, El Mencho’s brother, to the US.

Authorities said he was killed during the operation.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-operation\">What do we know about the operation?</h2><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on X on Sunday that the Secretariat of National Defence reported the operation had been carried out by federal forces.</p><p>“My recognition to the Mexican Army, National Guard, Armed Forces, and Security Cabinet,” Sheinbaum wrote.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X that the US had provided intelligence to the Mexican government to assist with the operation.</p><p>“In this operation, three additional cartel members were killed, three were wounded, and two were arrested,” Leavitt posted. Authorities have not confirmed their identities.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-significant-is-the-us-involvement\">How significant is the US involvement?</h2><p>Benjamin Smith, a professor of Latin American history at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, told Al Jazeera that the most recent captures of Mexican drug bosses have been backed by the US. “This is not new,” he said.</p><p>Vanessa Rubio-Marquez, associate dean for extended education for the School of Public Policy at the London School of Economics, said the US involvement in the operation “speaks about the need to have permanent and effective dialogue and cooperation between both countries”.</p><p>“As a transnational activity that includes import of precursors, production, trafficking, consumption, money laundering, flow of arms, extortion and corruption from both sides of the border, both countries need to work together to combat these organisations and their unlawful activities and being able to protect citizens,” said Rubio-Marquez, who has represented Mexico in various international fora, including the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-happened-since-el-mencho-s-killing\">What has happened since El Mencho’s killing?</h2><p>Violence erupted on Sunday in at least 20 Mexican states, including Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan, Nayarit, Guanajuato and Tamaulipas.</p><p>Officials in Jalisco, Michoacan and Guanajuato reported that at least 14 people were killed in Sunday’s violence, including seven members of the national guard.</p><p>Jalisco’s capital, Guadalajara, which is to host several matches in this year’s FIFA World Cup, was largely shut down on Sunday night as residents sheltered indoors. Four high-level football matches planned for Sunday were <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/23/football-matches-postponed-in-mexico-after-drug-cartel-leader-killed\">postponed</a>.</p><p>Videos on social media showed passengers running in panic through Guadalajara’s airport and smoke rising over the resort city of Puerto Vallarta. Governor Pablo Lemus urged people to stay home and suspended public transport while schools were closed on Monday in several states.</p><p>The US embassy in Mexico issued a security alert for US citizens in Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon, advising them to stay indoors.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-mexicans-reacted\">How have Mexicans reacted?</h2><p>Analysts said the Mexican public is mostly supportive of the government’s actions to rein in the cartels.</p><p>The government reported in December that the average number of killings per day in Mexico had dropped by 37 percent since <a href=\"/news/2024/10/1/claudia-sheinbaum-sworn-in-as-mexicos-first-female-president\">Sheinbaum took office</a> in October 2024.</p><p>“She’s extremely popular,” Smith said. “And Mencho was broadly loathed.”</p><p>Sheinbaum had an approval rating of about 70 percent as of late January, according to the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, New York-based organisations focused on promoting cultural and political understanding and business ties in the Americas. The rating has been consistent since Sheinbaum was elected.</p><p>“It was widely known – and criticised – that President Claudia Sheinbaum’s predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador followed a policy of ‘hugs not bullets’,” Rubio-Marquez said.</p><p>“This is a clear U-turn to this former policy by a Morena [Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum’s party] government and an implicit recognition that crime has to be confronted with decision and a sophisticated strategy that includes information, intelligence and cooperation with the US and coordination and training with actors at the different levels of government.”</p><h2 id=\"what-might-happen-next\">What might happen next?</h2><p>The operation that killed El Mencho could benefit Mexico in its negotiations with US President Donald Trump’s administration, which has threatened to impose tariffs or even resort to military action if Mexico does not clamp down on drug cartels.</p><p>However, experts said the operation could spark a new wave of violence in Mexico because cartels may retaliate against security forces. Smith said the operation could result in “more public murders”.</p><p>“For the last year, the Mexican state has managed to bring down homicides. I suspect this killing will reverse that trend,” he said.</p><p>It is unclear what the future holds for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel because El Mencho’s death has left a power vacuum and it is unknown who will succeed him.</p><p>“The fight against criminal actors is not only about getting rid of leaders and bringing them to justice,” Rubio-Marquez said. “It implies a complex strategy that includes prevention, the combat of powerful arms used by cartels, the disarticulation of their multi-layered networks, security and protection for citizens, and effective policies towards social inclusion and social cohesion, economic development.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
