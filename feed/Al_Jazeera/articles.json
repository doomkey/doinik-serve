Thousands more have since sought asylum by making treacherous journeys across the world to traverse the US southern border.</p><p>Some have relocated via so-called <a href=\"/news/2024/3/15/advocates-fear-special-us-visas-for-afghans-could-run-out-despite-dangers\">Special Immigrant Visas</a> (SIVs), reserved for individuals who worked directly with the US military in Afghanistan, under a notoriously backlogged programme.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Others have been resettled through a special State Department programme, known as Priority 1 (P1) and Priority 2 (P2), launched by the administration of President Biden, meant for Afghans who face persecution for having worked in various capacities on behalf of the US government or with a US-based organisation in Afghanistan.</p><p>Adam Bates, a supervisory policy counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Programme, explained that some of those pathways, most notably the SIV and refugee programmes, provide a clear course towards US residency and, eventually, citizenship.</p><p>But, he clarified, others do not – a fact that advocates have warned leaves members of the population subject to perpetual uncertainty and political whims.</p><p>“A lot of the advocacy to the Biden administration officials was about finding more permanent legal pathways for Afghans,” Bates told Al Jazeera. “That was with one eye towards the potential of giving the Trump administration this opportunity to really double down and target this community.”</p><h2 id=\"pressure-on-afghans-in-the-us\">Pressure on Afghans in the US</h2><p>During Trump’s new term, his administration has taken several concrete – and at times contradictory – moves that affect Afghans living in the US.</p><p>It <a href=\"/news/2025/4/12/trump-officials-end-temporary-protected-status-for-afghans-cameroonians\">ended</a> “temporary protected status” (TPS) for Afghans already in the country at the time of the Taliban takeover, arguing the country shows “an improved security situation” and “stabilising economy”, a claim contradicted by several human rights reports.</p><p>At the same time, the Trump administration added Afghanistan to a new <a href=\"/news/2025/6/9/us-travel-ban-takes-effect-amid-la-protests-against-immigration-crackdown\">travel ban</a> list, restricting visas for Afghans, saying such admissions broadly run counter to US “foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism”.</p><p>These actions underscore that “the situation in Afghanistan seems to be whatever it needs to be, from the Trump administration’s perspective,” according to Bates.</p><p>Trump has offered his contradictory messaging, <a href=\"/news/2024/8/30/afghanistan-is-a-us-election-issue-will-its-refugees-voices-be-heard\">criticising</a> the Biden administration on the campaign trail for its handling of the withdrawal, and as recently as July, pledging to “save” evacuated Afghans subject to deportation from the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, the administration terminated a special status for those who entered the US via the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/10/trump-administration-relaunches-cbp-one-asylum-app-for-self-deportation\">CBP One app</a> in April, potentially affecting thousands of Afghans who entered via the southern border.</p><p>Advocates warn that many more Afghans may soon be facing another legal cliff. After being evacuated in 2021, tens of thousands of Afghans were granted humanitarian parole, a temporary status that allowed them to legally live and work in the US for two years, with an extension granted in 2023. That programme is soon set to end.</p><p>While many granted the status have since sought other legal avenues, most often applying for asylum or SIVs, an unknown number could be rendered undocumented and subject to deportation when the extension ends. <a href=\"/news/2022/9/9/afghan-adjustment-act-what-does-it-mean-for-refugees-in-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Legislation</a> creating a clearer pathway to citizenship has languished in Congress for years.</p><p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not publicly released how many evacuated Afghans remain in the US on humanitarian parole, and did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for the data.</p><p>Evacuated Afghans’ unease has been compounded by Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, which has increasingly seen <a href=\"/news/2025/6/4/as-trump-raises-deportation-quotas-advocates-fear-an-expanding-dragnet\">those without criminal histories</a> targeted for deportations and permanent residents targeted for their <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/who-are-the-students-trump-wants-to-deport\">political advocacy</a>.</p><p>“It’s just an escalation across the board and a compounding of fear and instability in this community,” Bates said. “It’s hard to make life decisions if you aren’t sure what’s going to happen tomorrow or next week or in a year”.</p><h2 id=\"pulled-the-rug-out\">‘Pulled the rug out’</h2><p>Meanwhile, for the thousands of Afghans continuing to seek safety in the US from abroad, pathways have been severely constricted or have become completely blocked.</p><p>The Trump administration has paused asylum claims at the US southern border, citing a national emergency. It has almost completely suspended the US Refugee Program (<a href=\"/news/longform/2025/3/20/as-trump-seeks-systemic-change-does-the-us-have-an-obligation-to-refugees\">USRAP</a>), allowing only a trickle of new refugees in amid an ongoing legal challenge by rights groups.</p><p>Advocates say the special P1 and P2 programme created for Afghan refugees appears to have been completely halted under Trump. The administration has not published refugee admission numbers since taking office, and did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for data.</p><p>“It feels as if we have pulled the rug out from many of our Afghan allies through these policy changes that strip legal protection for many Afghans in the US and limit pathways for Afghans who are still abroad to come to the US safely,” Kristyn Peck, the chief executive officer of the Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>She noted that the SIV pipeline has continued to operate under Trump, although there have been some limitations, including requiring those approved for relocation to pay for their own travel.</p><p>Meanwhile, resettlement agencies like Lutheran have been forced to seriously curtail their operations following a stop-work order from the administration on January 24. As of March, Peck said, the organisation has been forced to let go of about 120 of its staff.</p><p>Susan Antolin, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women, a non-profit organisation that offers mental health, legal and social support to Afghans in the US, said organisations like hers are also bracing for sustained uncertainty.</p><p>“We are diversifying our funding and trying very hard, as so many other organisations are, to find other avenues to bring in that funding to continue to support our programmes,” she told Al Jazeera. “As organisations that deal with this kind of work, we have to step up. We have to do 10 times more, or 100 times more, of the work.”</p><h2 id=\"no-more-a-priority-for-the-world\">‘No more a priority for the world’</h2><p>The unstable situation in the US reflects a broader global trend.</p><p>The Taliban government, despite promising reforms in a push for international recognition, has continued to be <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165484\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> of widespread human rights abuses and revenge killings. Still, it has upgraded diplomatic ties with several governments in recent years, and in July, Russia became the first country to formally recognise the group as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.</p><p>At the same time, the governments of Pakistan and Iran have <a href=\"/news/2025/4/15/pakistan-accelerates-deportation-of-afghans-un\">accelerated</a> expulsions of Afghans back to Afghanistan, with more than 1.4 million Afghans either being <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/inside-irans-crackdown-on-afghan-migrants\">expelled or leaving</a> Iran alone from January to July of 2025, according to UNHCR.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Reuters news agency also reported in July that the UAE had notified Washington that it had begun returning evacuated Afghans.</p><p>Germany, too, has begun deporting Afghans back to Afghanistan, in July, it conducted its second deportation flight since the Taliban came to power, despite continuing not to recognise or maintain diplomatic ties with the group.</p><p>The collective moves send a clear message, evacuee Girowal said: “We know that Afghanistan is no more a priority for the world.”</p><p>Still, she said she has not abandoned hope that the US under Trump’s leadership will “not forget its allies”.</p><p>“I know the resilience of our own Afghan community. We are trained to be resilient wherever we are and fight back as much as we can,” she said.</p><p>“That’s one thing that gives me hope.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

An entrepreneur who made his fortune in cement, Medina now owns hotels and Burger King restaurant franchises in Bolivia.</p><p>In the 1990s, he also served as a minister of planning under President Jaime Paz Zamora.</p><p>The founder of the right-of-centre National Unity Front, Medina previously made three failed attempts to run for president: in 2005, 2009 and 2014.</p><p>He likely faces his stiffest competition from fellow also-ran, the right-wing Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga.</p><p>Like Medina, Quiroga has been a presidential candidate three times before: in 2005, 2014 and 2020. But he briefly ascended to the presidency himself after being elected as the country’s youngest vice president in 1997.</p><p>He shared a ticket at the time with the country’s former military dictator Hugo Banzer, whose government in the 1970s was associated with abuses such as torture and enforced disappearances.</p><p>As president, Banzer decided to leave office in 2001 after he was diagnosed with lung cancer, and Quiroga served the final year of Banzer’s term.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3887577\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3887577\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3887577 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25130779241512-1755124063.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Andronico Rodriguez in a felt hat and flower garlands.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3887577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bolivian Senate President Andronico Rodriguez waves to supporters at a rally in La Paz, Bolivia, on May 10 [Juan Karita/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-there-any-contenders-on-the-left\">Are there any contenders on the left?</h2><p>Yes, but they have not been polling as strongly as their conservative counterparts.</p><p>Andronico Rodriguez is the leading left-wing candidate, running as an independent.

In 2023 and 2024, the country saw its currency reserves shrink, and its natural gas industry suffered.</p><p>Morales, meanwhile, began to position himself as a critic of Arce’s government. Under Arce’s leadership, Bolivia’s judicial system barred Morales from seeking a fourth term as president, and an arrest warrant was issued against Morales for statutory rape.</p><p>Tensions rose in June 2024, when a general stormed the presidential palace and appeared to attempt a coup d’etat. Arce blamed Morales’s supporters, and Morales claimed Arce had staged the coup to rescue his popularity.</p><h2 id=\"what-role-is-evo-morales-playing\">What role is Evo Morales playing?</h2><p>Bolivia’s election is notable for the absence of one of the country’s most influential figures: MAS founder Evo Morales.</p><p>As a three-term president from 2006 until 2019, Morales oversaw a period of substantial economic growth that made him popular in Bolivia and across the Latin American left.</p><p>But in 2019, Morales sought a controversial fourth term in office. Though official results showed he won, protests, threats and claims of vote tampering forced Morales to leave the country.</p><p>Some have described his exile as a coup, driven by the military and the political right.</p><p>When Arce, his former finance minister, was elected president in 2020, Morales was able to return to Bolivia.</p><p>But the two leaders have fallen out, in part as a result of their rivalry for the presidency, and Morales has rallied his supporters to his side in a split that has fractured the Bolivian left.</p><p>In May, a constitutional court upheld <a href=\"/news/2024/11/9/bolivia-court-bars-former-leader-evo-morales-from-running-for-office\">a ruling</a> that Morales could not run again, due to term limits imposed since he left office.</p><p>But Morales has continued to press for a fourth term in office, and he has urged his supporters to cast null ballots to protest Sunday’s election.</p><p>Polls estimate the combined number of undecided voters and protest votes could amount to between 25 and 34 percent of voters.</p><p>Morales’s supporters have also led <a href=\"/news/2025/6/12/antigovernment-protests-in-bolivia-leave-multiple-people-dead\">demonstrations</a> in protest of the former president’s exclusion from the election. Some have blocked roads. Others have erupted into clashes that left police and protesters dead.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-long-is-a-presidential-term\">How long is a presidential term?</h2><p>Presidents are elected in Bolivia for a term of five years. In recent years, the country’s courts have limited presidents to two consecutive terms in office.</p><p>This has been a source of consternation for Morales, who served three consecutive terms and hopes to gain a fourth.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-election-important\">Why is this election important?</h2><p>Bolivia’s left is likely on track for its first defeat in a presidential race in nearly two decades. That would send shockwaves throughout Latin America, where Bolivia has been a left-wing stronghold for much of the 21st century.</p><p>“The left has been weakened by schisms and personal disputes between Morales and Arce,” analyst Gonzalez Calanche said.</p><p>She explained that those schisms will be reflected in the ballot box, as trade unions and other left-leaning organisations struggle to unite behind a candidate.</p><p>With <a href=\"/news/2025/6/12/antigovernment-protests-in-bolivia-leave-multiple-people-dead\">tensions high</a>, economic conditions deteriorating, and no consensus candidate to lead the country, Gonzalez Calanche fears Bolivia could be heading into a period of uncertainty as it approaches a possible second round of voting.</p><p>“There’s a very dire economic situation, made worse by social and political unrest,” she said. “It’s a cycle that continues to feed itself.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
