Ukraine shot down or electronically suppressed 791 out of 891 drones Russia launched between July 23 and 29, almost 90 percent, but fewer than half the missiles – just 20 out of 42.</p><p>That difference in ratio underscores Ukraine’s difficulty in intercepting ballistic missiles, against which only <a href=\"/news/2025/7/15/will-patriots-promised-by-trump-boost-ukraines-defence-against-russia\">US-made Patriot interceptor missiles</a> are effective.</p><p>Ukraine’s European allies have been signing onto a framework agreement reached this month between the US and Germany, whereby allies donating Patriot systems to Ukraine are given priority placement in purchasing new ones.</p><p>Lithuania said it was ready to help supply $35m in <a href=\"/news/2022/12/15/what-can-the-patriot-missile-do-for-ukraine\">Patriot systems</a> to Ukraine, following Germany, Norway, Denmark and Sweden.

No cause can justify such acts, and we condemn them outright.</p><p>Today, however, we are witnessing the horrifying spectacle of Israel carrying out, on a daily basis, atrocity crimes against the Palestinian people – above all in Gaza, but also in the occupied West Bank, amounting to a systematic campaign of brutalisation, dehumanisation, and displacement.</p><p>The European Union and nearly all of its Member States have failed to respond meaningfully to these horrific events.</p><p>As former ambassadors of the EU we dedicated our professional lives to upholding and promoting core European values and international law, building the reputation of the European Union and defending the interests of its peoples. Those interests and that reputation are now in serious jeopardy as a consequence of EU inaction.</p><p>For over 21 months, the Netanyahu government has pursued a relentless campaign of violence and destruction in Gaza. About ten percent of Gaza’s entire population, including tens of thousands of children, have been killed, maimed and seriously injured by the Israeli military’s indiscriminate bombardments. Most of Gaza has been reduced to rubble. Those who survive bombs and bullets face hunger, malnutrition, disease, and a collapsed health system deliberately targeted by Israel.</p><p>The ongoing siege is starving the population by blocking supplies of humanitarian aid from UN agencies and international NGOs. Replacing UNRWA and other established international providers of aid to Gaza by a politicised and militarised aid operation run by mercenaries is a violation of the UN’s humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, which all UN Member States – including Israel – must respect in their entirety.</p><p>The concrete humanitarian measures reportedly agreed under the deal the EU High Representative Kaja Kallas secured with Israel have not been made public, nor has the arrangement ever been confirmed by the Israeli authorities. To the contrary, since Ms Kallas’ <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/israelpalestine-statement-high-representativevice-president-kaja-kallas_en?\">announcement</a>, hundreds of men, children and women have been killed by Israeli soldiers while desperately seeking food and water for their families. This includes an alarming number of civilian deaths caused by Israeli military shooting at Zikim, one of the key border crossing points, that we understand formed part of the humanitarian EU agreement with Israel.</p><p>Now, with appalling predictability, Israeli leaders are forcing swathes of Gaza’s population into concentration zones – militarised enclosures designed to confine civilians under intolerable conditions, with the clear aim of pressuring them into “voluntary” displacement. This, along with other illegal Israeli policies in the West Bank, constitutes de facto forcible population transfer, a serious war crime under international law. The Israeli ministers of defense, finance and security have all openly called for the permanent removal of Palestinians from Gaza, and a senior “migration administration” has been created to facilitate it. These are calculated steps towards ethnic cleansing.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Meanwhile, in the West Bank, violent Israeli settlers, with full protection by the Israeli military, have waged a campaign of terror against Palestinian communities. Homes are torched, inhabitants are murdered, families expelled, water sources poisoned, herding animals stolen, olive groves destroyed, and land annexed in violation of international law. The perpetrators who act with impunity are armed and encouraged by state officials. These settlers are not rogue actors – they are the front-line agents of a government-driven agenda to annex and ethnically cleanse Palestinian land.</p><p>The evidence of Israeli malfeasance and its flagrant violation of all known humanitarian and human rights laws is overwhelming. The United Nations, humanitarian organisations, and independent observers – including Israeli and Jewish voices – have documented these crimes in detail. The International Court of Justice has determined that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza and that Israel’s prolonged occupation of Palestine is not only unlawful but even constitutes the crime of segregation or apartheid. European public opinion and the majority of young people, including in countries like Germany and Italy, are clearly in favour of their governments acting to stop this horror.</p><p>We welcome the recent condemnation of Israel’s actions in Gaza and the West Bank by 28 Foreign Ministers, including those of 20 EU Member States, but words are not enough. We call urgently on all EU leaders and governments, especially those who prevented the Foreign Affairs Council, 15 July, from acting against Israel’s egregious humanitarian and human rights violations, to take all necessary and feasible measures under international, European, and national law to bring these atrocities to an end. Action should comprise the following:</p><p>1. Resume international aid deliveries immediately at scale and flood the Gaza Strip with humanitarian supplies, in full respect of the core principles of international humanitarian law.</p><p>2. Suspend with immediate effect all arms and dual-use exports to Israel.</p><p>3. Ban trade with Israel’s illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territory and prohibit EU and member states’ commercial and investment relations with any entity or company doing business in or benefiting from Israel’s illegal settlements.</p><p>4. Suspend all preferential commercial arrangements for Israel under the Association Agreement.</p><p>5. Cancel Israel’s participation in Horizon Europe and all dual-use research, academic and technology programmes of the EU.</p><p>6. Impose targeted sanctions on Israeli Ministers, government officials, military commanders, and violent settlers responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, facilitating genocide and carrying out State-sanctioned terrorism.</p><p>7. Support international and national judicial mechanisms – including the International Criminal Court and domestic courts under universal jurisdiction – to bring perpetrators to justice.</p><p>8. Provide political, legal, and financial support to Palestinian civilian victims, human rights defenders, and humanitarian organisations operating under impossible conditions.</p><p>9. Recognise Palestinian statehood to create the necessary prerequisite for a two-state solution.</p><p>On July 17, the Day of International Criminal Justice, the European External Action Service recalled that in regard to crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocides … “history has too many moments when silence followed horror …”</p><p>The world will remember how the EU and its member states respond to this catastrophic tragedy. Silence and neutrality in the face of genocide constitutes complicity. Inaction emboldens perpetrators and betrays every principle the Union and its member states claim to uphold.</p><p>While continuing to call unceasingly for the return of the hostages, a permanent ceasefire and the end to the war, the European Union, long a champion of human rights and the rule of law, must act now in the name of international law, humanity, and justice for the Palestinian people – or risk forfeiting its credibility, influence and moral standing in the world.</p><p>Signatories:</p><p>Mikael Barfod<br data-start=\"13\" data-end=\"16\">Geoffrey Barrett<br data-start=\"32\" data-end=\"35\">Alexander Baum<br data-start=\"49\" data-end=\"52\">Thierry Bechet<br data-start=\"66\" data-end=\"69\">Kenny Bell<br data-start=\"79\" data-end=\"82\">Aad Biesebroek<br data-start=\"96\" data-end=\"99\">Jean-Claude Boidin<br data-start=\"117\" data-end=\"120\">Giorgio Bonacci<br data-start=\"135\" data-end=\"138\">Laurens Jan Brinkhorst<br data-start=\"160\" data-end=\"163\">Jean-Francois Cautain<br data-start=\"184\" data-end=\"187\">Peter Beck Christiansen<br data-start=\"210\" data-end=\"213\">Tim Clarke<br data-start=\"223\" data-end=\"226\">Philippe Darmuzey<br data-start=\"243\" data-end=\"246\">Dominique Dellicour<br data-start=\"265\" data-end=\"268\">Aldo Dell’Ariccia<br data-start=\"285\" data-end=\"288\">Wiepke Van Der Goot<br data-start=\"307\" data-end=\"310\">Michael Doyle<br data-start=\"323\" data-end=\"326\">Sean Doyle<br data-start=\"336\" data-end=\"339\">Giacomo Durazzo<br data-start=\"354\" data-end=\"357\">Michael Emerson<br data-start=\"372\" data-end=\"375\">Manfredo Fanti<br data-start=\"389\" data-end=\"392\">Carlo De Filippi<br data-start=\"408\" data-end=\"411\">Karen Fogg<br data-start=\"421\" data-end=\"424\">Erwan Fouere<br data-start=\"436\" data-end=\"439\">Marc Franco<br data-start=\"450\" data-end=\"453\">David Geer<br data-start=\"463\" data-end=\"466\">Gerardus Gielen<br data-start=\"481\" data-end=\"484\">William Hanna<br data-start=\"497\" data-end=\"500\">Geert Heikens<br data-start=\"513\" data-end=\"516\">Gilles Hervio<br data-start=\"529\" data-end=\"532\">Andrew Jacobs<br data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"548\">Rupert Joy<br data-start=\"558\" data-end=\"561\">Androulla Kaminara<br data-start=\"579\" data-end=\"582\">John Kjaer<br data-start=\"592\" data-end=\"595\">Michael Laidler<br data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"613\">Eneko Landaburu<br data-start=\"628\" data-end=\"631\">Jeremy Lester<br data-start=\"644\" data-end=\"647\">David Macrae<br data-start=\"659\" data-end=\"662\">Christian Manahl<br data-start=\"678\" data-end=\"681\">Brian McDonald<br data-start=\"695\" data-end=\"698\">Hugues Mingarelli<br data-start=\"715\" data-end=\"718\">James Moran<br data-start=\"729\" data-end=\"732\">Francesca Mosca<br data-start=\"747\" data-end=\"750\">Amir Naqvi<br data-start=\"760\" data-end=\"763\">Luigi Narbone<br data-start=\"776\" data-end=\"779\">Attilio Pacifici<br data-start=\"795\" data-end=\"798\">Corrado Pampaloni<br data-start=\"815\" data-end=\"818\">Elisabeth Pape<br data-start=\"832\" data-end=\"835\">Marc Pierini<br data-start=\"847\" data-end=\"850\">Rensje Teerink<br data-start=\"864\" data-end=\"867\">Daniela Tramacere<br data-start=\"884\" data-end=\"887\">Philippe Van Damme<br data-start=\"905\" data-end=\"908\">Marcel van Opstal<br data-start=\"925\" data-end=\"928\">Sven Kuhn von Burgsdorff<br data-start=\"952\" data-end=\"955\">Alan Waddams<br data-start=\"967\" data-end=\"970\">Claudia Wiedey<br data-start=\"984\" data-end=\"987\">Marc F Wolff<br data-start=\"1000\" data-end=\"1003\">Richard Wright</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>CBS’ recent cancellation of the popular The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is yet another case of heavy‑handed political and corporate meddling in the role of media in the US. It occurred just three days after the comedian and talk show host criticised CBS’s parent company Paramount for settling a multimillion‑dollar lawsuit with Trump, with Colbert calling that settlement “a bribe”.</p><p>In its announcement, CBS stated it will end The Late Show after May 2026 due to a declining audience, marking the end of a 33‑year run for the live‑audience series.</p><p>But, lower Nielsen ratings or not, the timing of Paramount’s move to cancel one of its signature series may itself prove that the decision was about more than profit. It cannot be ignored that within a few days of both moves, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finally approved the Skydance‑Paramount merger after months of stalling, an $8bn deal that will add to the mountain of monopolistic moves in US media.</p><p>“This is pure cowardice,” David Letterman, The Late Show’s previous host from 1993 to 2015, said of Paramount’s recent decisions to cancel the show and settle the Trump lawsuit.</p><p>The US news media’s never‑ending coverage of everything Trump over the past decade and the constant back‑and‑forth over his politics, policies and practices have played a significant role in its decline. As the US lurches ever closer towards autocracy, the Fourth Estate has increasingly taken on the role of stenographer, with its normalisation of lies, gossip, craven policies and corruption as “disinformation” and “misinformation”.</p><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"782\">But the age of Trump is just the tip of the iceberg. The combination of constant realignment to ingratiate media corporations with the political class, along with their monopolisation of media in the US over the past 45 years, has simply devastated the field. This retrenchment has severely skewed news coverage and destroyed the idea of a free press.</p><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"782\">The landscape of US media began evolving with the gradual deregulation of both media ownership and the scope of editorial freedom in the 1980s. After 40 years of what was once the Fairness Doctrine in US media law (requiring multimedia broadcasters to air opposing views on topics of national importance, not just one perspective), the FCC voted to abolish the requirement in 1987. This came after Congress had failed to override President Ronald Reagan’s veto of their attempt to codify the doctrine in a bill. Attempts to re‑establish the Fairness Doctrine have failed over the years, including the Restore the Fairness Doctrine Act that the now Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard sponsored in 2019. That bill never made it to the House floor for a vote.</p><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"782\">In a truly bipartisan effort during the 1990s, many of the remaining regulations that protected US media from monopolisation and the influence of billionaires and mega‑corporations were dismantled. The lobbyist‑influenced Telecommunications Act of 1996 made its way through Congress with overwhelming support, with only 16 “No” votes out of 430 in the House of Representatives, and five voting “No” out of 96 in the Senate.</p><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"782\">The deregulations, intended to foster more competition between media corporations and their multimedia platforms, actually did the opposite by extending media monopolisation. Between 1983 and 2015, the number of corporations that collectively owned 90 percent of the entire US media market fell from “more than 50 to just six companies”, including books, newspapers, magazines, mobile and cable television, internet and music, films and professional athletic teams. In the years since, between Viacom’s ownership of CBS and Paramount and Amazon’s huge foray into streaming services and multimedia productions, five megacorporations now control 90 percent of all US media.</p><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"782\">The Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch became a key figure in the monopolisation of US media in all its forms, buying stakes in the New York Post and founding the tabloid paper Star. In 1985, the FCC approved the deal that allowed Murdoch to buy 20th Century Fox and acquire Fox broadcast stations. This occurred after Murdoch had become a naturalised US citizen, as federal regulations at that time limited foreign ownership of and investment in broadcasting. Eleven years later, and just months after the Telecommunications Act of 1996’s passage, Murdoch and media executive Roger Ailes founded Fox News under the ironically deceptive slogan “Fair and Balanced”. With the Fairness Doctrine gone and the need to provide balanced media coverage removed, Fox News’ decidedly biased far‑right slant was deliberate, built solely for profit. “People don’t want to be informed, they want to feel informed,” the late Ailes apparently said more than once in justifying Fox News’ approach to news coverage.</p><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"782\">In recent years, with billionaires buying major news outlets like The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, and The Wall Street Journal and dictating editorial decisions, Americans have long lost trust in the Fourth Estate. Monopolisation and the business pressures that have come with it have led to “fewer journalists, thinner reporting, and increasingly desperate advertising content” over the past three decades. Combined with the rise of social media over television and internet media sites as the number one way Americans get their news (54 percent vs 50 percent and 48 percent, respectively), this trend is telling. There are no signs that monopolisation and biased, fact‑reduced and fact‑free media coverage will stop any time soon.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"587\" data-end=\"1211\">Murdoch’s approach of using deregulation to build a monopoly and usher in the age of fact‑free journalism helped set off this buying frenzy, with profit prioritised over fairness every step of the way. By the end of the 1980s, the reign of conservative and far‑right radio talk shows had begun, with the late Rush Limbaugh leading the pack with his nationally syndicated The Rush Limbaugh Show. His constant barrage of racism, sexism, queerphobia and other hyper‑masculine talking points became an echo chamber for about 15 million listeners for the next 30 years.</p><p data-start=\"94\" data-end=\"1221\">Although centre‑left radio programming like Air America made minor inroads in the 2000s, progressive ventures have often fizzled out. They have frequently lacked sufficient financial support and political protection in an increasingly monopolised and ideologically skewed media world. At the height of MSNBC’s “Lean Forward” days, when critics saw its merely centrist political news coverage between 2010 and 2016 as “liberal”, its executives denied MSNBC was the leftist equivalent of Fox News. Phil Griffin, who ran MSNBC from 2008 through early 2021, once said, “No. We don’t put out talking points all day” like Fox News. “Corporations are … like sharks. They just move toward the money. That’s all they do,” one former executive for the news organisation said. In 2016, eugenicist tech billionaire Peter Thiel essentially destroyed the progressive tabloid Gawker. Furious that Gawker had outed him as queer in 2007, Thiel helped the late wrestler Hulk Hogan win a $140m lawsuit against Gawker for its publication of his sex tape.</p><p data-start=\"693\" data-end=\"1399\">It is often said that good journalism reflects the happenings of the world like a mirror, without bias and with every effort to expose the truth behind news events. If this is truly the definition of what makes good journalism, then US journalism has been staring into a mirror with a multitude of fractures for decades. In 2025, it is not just that many Americans do not believe in the media they consume or only believe the news when it fits their personal narrative. Many in the US know that the nation’s media regularly peddles lies, half‑truths and gossip in a never‑ending search for easy profit, all while dumbing down their consumers.</p><p data-start=\"693\" data-end=\"1399\">Reporting on the spread of autocratic rule, calling out complicity in genocide, or interrogating the ethics of billionaires and mega‑corporations in a monopolised media world? Any efforts towards fairness and truth can easily cost anyone in the media their job, or worse, even someone as influential as Stephen Colbert.</p><p data-start=\"693\" data-end=\"1399\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Perched above the Teesta River, which flows through a gorge just below, Naga is a remote village in India’s northeastern Himalayan state of Sikkim. For centuries, it has been home to the Indigenous Lepcha people.</p><p>“It felt like an earthquake,” the 51-year-old mother of five says of the events of October 4, 2023. “The whole house was shaking. It was raining heavily, there was no electricity, and we couldn’t see anything.”</p><p>In the pitch dark and amid the heavy downpour that night, Lepcha roused her three children, aged 13, 10 and five, and rushed out of the house with her husband, panicking. Together with a few neighbours, they searched for a safe space on higher ground. That’s when they noticed a distinct smell of mud and something like gunpowder.</p><p>Moments later, an enormous, tsunami-like wave surged down with terrifying force. Lepcha didn’t know it at the time, but it was a <a href=\"/gallery/2023/10/6/deadly-floods-in-indias-himalayas-after-lake-bursts-through-major-dam\">glacial lake outburst flood</a> (GLOF), which had been triggered by the sudden avalanche of ice and rock into the South Lhonak Lake – a glacial lake high up in the Teesta basin in North Sikkim.</p><p>The impact breached the lake’s moraine wall, releasing more than 50 million cubic metres of water. The flood <a href=\"/economy/2024/4/18/a-flash-flood-and-a-quiet-sale-highlight-indias-sikkims-hydro-problems\">destroyed</a> the 1,200-megawatt Teesta III dam – Sikkim’s largest hydropower plant, located at Chungthang on the River Teesta, the largest river in Sikkim, which originates in the eastern Himalayas. The dam’s collapse released an additional five million cubic metres (equivalent to 2,000 Olympic swimming pools) of reservoir water.</p><p>The high-velocity flood in the Teesta River valley carried about 270 million cubic metres of sediment and debris along with it, causing widespread devastation across Sikkim, parts of West Bengal and Bangladesh through which the Teesta flows.</p><p>At least 55 people were killed, 74 went missing, and more than 7,025 were displaced. The flood damaged nearly 26,000 buildings, destroyed 31 bridges and flooded more than 270 square kilometres of farmland. It also triggered 45 landslides, damaged four dams and destroyed long stretches of National Highway 10.</p><p>Both Teesta III and Teesta V, another hydroelectric dam near Dikchu in Balutar, have remained shut since they were severely damaged during the flood. Repair work is continuing, but neither of the dams has generated electricity for almost two years.</p><p>Scientists say the scale of the destruction makes it one of the most devastating flooding disasters recorded in the Himalayas in recent decades.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3865634\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3865634\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3865634\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7725-1753877514.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sikkim dam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3865634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tashi Choden Lepcha, whose family lost both their houses in Naga village to the 2023 glacial flood.

The main NH10 road passing through the village has been destroyed with long, deep cracks.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In all, about 150 families lost their homes and land in the flood and now face an uncertain future. Lepcha’s family lost both their houses, which collapsed in the landslides. They, along with 19 other families, are now living temporarily in a government tourist lodge in Singhik, about 10km from their home.</p><p>As the region struggles to recover, and communities along the Teesta remain displaced and vulnerable, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&amp;CC) has approved plans to <a href=\"/economy/2024/4/18/a-flash-flood-and-a-quiet-sale-highlight-indias-sikkims-hydro-problems\">rebuild the Teesta III dam</a> without any public consultation, despite concerns about the risk of future glacial lake outburst floods and the fact that the Himalayan range running across Sikkim is seismically sensitive.</p><p>With the ongoing monsoon season, the Teesta’s water levels have risen significantly. This has already caused several landslides in North Sikkim, washing away the under-construction Sankalang bridge and cutting off large parts of the region.</p><p>Long stretches of roads across North Sikkim are still unpaved, muddy and full of rubble.

Delays were caused by the 2011 earthquake, which destroyed major infrastructure, and also repeated flash floods and landslides.</p><p>The dam faced criticism from environmentalists and the All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF), which described it as a “failed example of public-private partnership” for the massive cost overruns, years of delay, ecological damage and disregard for Indigenous rights and livelihoods.</p><p>The operator, Sikkim Urja Limited (formerly Teesta Urja Ltd or TUL), was forced to sell electricity at half the agreed rate as buyers, including the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, refused to pay higher prices. In 2017, transmission delays caused yet more losses of about Rs 6 crore ($701,000) per day from June to September 2017.</p><p>Following the devastating flooding of 2023, the estimated reconstruction cost for the dam is now Rs 4,189 crore ($490m), but experts question how such a large-scale reconstruction could be completed at less than a third of its original building cost.</p><p>An investigation in May this year renewed concerns about the project. The Sikkim Vigilance Police, a special police force, found irregularities in the process used to select the independent power producer, who, according to the findings of the police investigation, lacked the qualifications for a project of this scale. It was alleged that critical dam design parameters had been compromised as a result.</p><p>Other reports have found that environmental assessments also overlooked key risks. A 2006 biodiversity report [<a href=\"http://www.sikkimforest.gov.in/docs/SACON/Worshop%20Final.pdf\">PDF</a>] from Delhi University had identified the Chungthang region as a highly sensitive ecological zone. Yet the project received swift environmental clearance from the environment ministry based on <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/jiten-development-agression/page/n29/mode/2up\">a report</a> which claimed that little to no significant wildlife existed in the area. The clearance procedure also bypassed the ministry’s own directive that no dams could be approved in Sikkim until a full “carrying capacity study” (a study of an area’s capacity for supporting human life and industry) of the Teesta basin had been completed.</p><p>“What was the hurry to give clearance for rebuilding even before the Central Water Commission and Central Electricity Authority cleared the design?” asks Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), an advocacy group working on the water sector. “The Environmental Impact Report (EIA) used was done before 2006, which didn’t consider the risk of a GLOF. It contributed to the disaster, and now the same flawed EIA is being used again. Even the dam safety report prepared after the collapse hasn’t been made public or considered for this decision.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3865689\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3865689\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3865689\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7818-1753878964.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sikkim dam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3865689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Teesta Bazar in Kalimpong, West Bengal, endured extensive destruction in the October 2023 glacial lake outburst flood [Arunima Kar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>While a “concrete faced rockfill dam” is planned this time – supposedly more resilient to flooding than the old “concrete gravity dam” design – experts and local communities still worry this won’t be enough because, they say, key impact studies are incomplete.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to MoEF&amp;CC with questions about why the Teesta III reconstruction had been approved without a new EIA, despite concerns over safety and ecological impacts. Questions were also sent to Sikkim Urja Ltd regarding reconstruction plans and structural safety and to NHPC about the cumulative impacts of multiple dams along the Teesta. Emails and calls to all these offices remained unanswered by the time of publication.</p><p>Tunnelling and blasting during the original construction of Teesta III, before it opened in 2017, led to landslides, erosion and damage to homes. Yet, no comprehensive assessment has been conducted on seismic risks, reduced river flow or long-term ecological impacts.</p><p>“Our soil is fragile,” says Sangdup Lepcha, president of ACT. “We are seeing more landslides every year. During the GLOF, the soil was completely washed away. If tunnels are dug again under our villages, the area could collapse.”</p><p>Sangdup, who lives in Sanggong village in Lower Dzongu, says the 10km stretch from Namprikdang to Dikchu is the only remaining stretch of the Teesta without any dams.</p><p>Many worry that if the rebuilding of Teesta III continues without safeguards, it will put villages at risk. “We have already seen what happened in Naga,” says Sangdup. “Why is the project getting emergency clearance while affected families are still waiting for rehabilitation?”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3865663\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3865663\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3865663\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7803-1753878375.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sikkim dam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3865663\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Teesta Bazar in Kalimpong, West Bengal, was one of the worst-hit areas downstream of the Sikkim dam during the October 2023 glacial lake outburst flood.

Known for their spiritual ties to the rivers and mountains, the Lepchas from Dzongu have long resisted large-scale hydropower projects in the region to protect their identity, livelihoods and the biodiversity of the region.</p><p>When multiple dams were proposed in the early 2000s along the Teesta basin – a river the Lepchas revere as a living deity – ACT spearheaded protests against dam construction. Their hunger strikes and protests led to the cancellation of four major hydropower projects in Dzongu and four outside.</p><p>“We are animists,” says Mayalmit Lepcha, ACT’s general secretary. “Our traditions, culture, identity, and everything else are tied to Mount Kanchenjunga, Teesta, Rangeet and Rongyong rivers here.”</p><p>Despite their long history of activism, the communities say they were ignored during the public consultation process, even though their land and rivers would be used for the proposed 520 MW Teesta IV hydroelectric project.</p><p>At least 16 villages lie near the potential construction site, across the agricultural belt of North Sikkim. The project would include building tunnels underneath Hee Gyathang and Sanggong villages in Dzongu to carry water to the power station. The siltation tunnel, which will divert sediment-laden water away from the main reservoir, is supposed to run beneath the Tung Kyong Dho, a sacred lake known for its rich biodiversity.</p><p>Songmit Lepcha, from Dzongu’s Hee Gyathang village, told Al Jazeera that she lost her livestock and plantation during flash floods in June last year. “We are scared of rebuilding our homes,” Songmit said, her voice filled with worry.</p><p>Opposition Citizen Action Party (CAP) leader Ganesh Rai told Al Jazeera that he is particularly worried about the new plans to rebuild the dam to a height of 118.64 metres, twice as high as the original. “With climate change intensifying, any future breach could submerge all of Chungthang,” he said. “It won’t just affect Dzongu but everyone downstream.”</p><p>That could include settlements in Dikchu, Rangpo, Singtam and Kalimpong, and Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts in West Bengal, which were severely affected by the 2023 flood. In places like Bhalukhola near Melli, families have been living in makeshift relief camps since the 2023 floods.

It also disrupted his dreams of a professional football career.</p><p>Leboon is now living with his parents in a single, cramped room inside a relief camp along the Teesta highway, which is situated above Bhalukhola. They are sandwiched between works being done to widen the highway in front of their site, and the ongoing tunnel construction work for the Sevoke-Rangpo railway project behind them. The exposed location leaves them at risk of landslides and flooding.</p><p>“If they are rebuilding the dam, they must build protection walls here for our safety,” says the lanky, athletic young man, looking around at what’s left of his village. The fields he played football in as a child, as well as the playground he once ran about in, are now buried under silt and debris. “We only have this land. If we lose it, where do we go?”</p><p>About 10km further downstream in Teesta Bazar, 68-year-old Tikaram Karki lost his house and motorcycle repair shop to the 2023 flooding. His home, built above the riverbank, began cracking and sliding just a few days after the flood.</p><p>“We were hiding in the mountains in the rain. When we came back at 6am, there were no houses, roads, or electricity,” he says, as he stands next to what remains of his house and shop, both of which are leaning steeply towards the Teesta. He smiles even as he talks about his losses since that dreadful night.</p><p>Tikaram now lives in a rented house with his family of four. He is paying Rs 8,000 ($93) monthly rent while struggling with financial losses as he has no way to run his business.</p><p>He received some compensation from the West Bengal state government, but it does not cover all he has lost. “I have been living here for 30 years and spent Rs 30 lakh ($35,000) building my house. I only got Rs 75,000 ($876) in compensation. What will happen with that?”</p><p>Like others here, Tikaram says he believes the destruction was made worse by years of poor planning and unchecked silt buildup caused by the dam, which raised the riverbed of the Teesta.</p><p>“If they had cleared the silt during the dry months, we wouldn’t be so vulnerable now,” he says.</p><p>“I cannot tell the government not to build the dam, but they should build proper protection for all the people still living along Teesta,” adds Tikaram.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3865669\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3865669\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3865669\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7789-1753878506.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sikkim dam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3865669\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tikaram Karki’s home and motorcycle repair shop in Teesta Bazar, Kalimpong, are sinking into the Teesta River following the October 2023 flood, which caused massive destruction to property in the region [Arunima Kar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"rising-risk\">Rising risk</h2><p>In a January 2025 <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads2659\">study</a> by an international team of scientists and NGOs published in the Science journal, researchers warned that South Lhonak Lake is one of the more rapidly expanding and hazardous glacial lakes in Sikkim. The lake expanded from 0.15 square kilometres in 1975 to 1.68sq km by 2023, posing a danger of flooding to the communities downstream.</p><p>“The Teesta-III dam played a significant role in amplifying the downstream impact of the South Lhonak GLOF disaster,” Azam, at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>Azam explains that while the disastrous flood could not have been prevented, its impact could have been significantly reduced through better infrastructure planning and active monitoring of the lake. “Reinforced spillways, sediment handling systems, and early warning systems linked to upstream sensors could have provided critical response time,” he says.</p><p>The night the flood hit, the dam’s power station was still operating. According to Thakkar, authorities had received alerts well in advance, but there were no standard operating procedures or emergency protocols in place about opening spillway gates during such situations. “And there has been no accountability since,” he added.</p><p>Thakkar says he is deeply concerned that the dam is being rebuilt without taking into account the flood potential based on current rainfall patterns.</p><p>“And what happens to the other downstream dams when this one releases excess water during the next flood?” he asked. “None of them are being redesigned to withstand that kind of excess flow.”</p><p>At the end of May, there was a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1392041648660822\">landslide at the Teesta VI dam site in Singtam</a>. “This is happening every monsoon,” said Gyatso.</p><p>Rai criticises the state’s priorities, saying the government was “pushing for more dams instead of strengthening disaster preparedness” at a time when the frequency of extreme weather events is expected to increase.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3865680\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3865680\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3865680\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7700-1753878833.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sikkim dam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3865680\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Once a thriving town, Chungthang in North Sikkim is now strewn with rocks, boulders and a deep layer of sand and debris after the 1,200-megawatt Teesta III dam was destroyed by a massive glacial lake outburst flood from South Lhonak Lake, above, in Lachen [Arunima Kar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"no-future-here\">‘No Future Here’</h2><p>Nearly two years after the October 2023 flood, Tashi Choden Lepcha still has no home.

Her brother used to live next door: he lost everything as well.</p><p>After the disaster, she, her husband and children stayed in a school building in Naga. But when cracks appeared in the school walls, they were shifted to Singhik. The lodge, too, is beginning to show cracks in the kitchen and bathroom.</p><p>Her husband and children have since relocated to Siliguri, about 150km away,  for work and education, while she stayed behind alone because she teaches at Naga Secondary School.</p><p>The government gave them Rs 1.3 lakh ($1,520) in compensation, but most of it went on the cost of moving their belongings to different locations.</p><p>There have been discussions about allocating land higher up in the mountains for the displaced families. But many of them fear it could take years before they are rehoused. “If the government gives us land in a safe location, we can build a house. How long can we live like this? We have no future here,” she says now.</p><p>Most people in the surrounding villages share her fears. They want the dam project scrapped or moved to a safer location.</p><p>Mayalmit echoes this call for caution. “We’re going to have more GLOFs, there’s no doubt,” she says.</p><p>“People will have confidence only if decisions are based on proper impact assessments, considering all factors, and done in a transparent way,” Thakkar adds. “But that’s not happening now, which is why there’s scepticism about hydro projects among locals.”</p><p>He says that Indigenous communities must be part of the decision-making process. “They’re the ones most at risk, and also the most knowledgeable.”</p><p>Praful Rao of Save The Hills, an NGO working in disaster management in North Bengal and Sikkim, has called for joint disaster planning between the two states. “What happens upstream affects us downstream. It is time we work together for science-based disaster planning, not blindly push dam projects for revenue.”</p><p>While hydroelectricity is important for India’s energy future, Rao warns against unchecked expansion. “You can’t build dams every few kilometres. We need to study how many this fragile region can safely support.”</p><p>Mayalmit urges central and state authorities to reconsider the approval. “Don’t act against Indigenous rights, the environment. I speak for the rivers, the birds and the animals here.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

production under wartime conditions.</p><p>While Taiwan’s defence sector has been developing drones since the 1990s, Taiwanese manufacturers have long struggled to compete with the low prices offered by Chinese manufacturers, particularly Shenzhen-based DJI, which holds a more than 70 percent share of the global market.</p><p>The war in Ukraine, which has seen Kyiv make extensive use of drone warfare to hold its own against Moscow, has only reinforced the belief in Taipei that unmanned vehicles could be decisive in fending off its much bigger military foe.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\"

and state-owned National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, which organised June’s drone expo, are tasked with partnering with contractors to produce military-grade drones.</p><p>Under a parallel initiative, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is coordinating a program to help the private sector build and sell “dual-use” drones, which serve commercial as well as military purposes, for both the local and overseas markets.</p><p>Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te has expressed his wish for Taiwan to become an “Asian hub” for drone technology and manufacturing.</p><p>For Taiwan, the bid to become a drone powerhouse is a race against time.</p><p>United States Admiral Philip Davidson, commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, has estimated that the PLA will be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027.</p><p>Despite the pressing need for a formidable drone force, Taiwan’s progress at building up its domestic industry has been uneven at best, experts say, with the problems beginning with overly modest targets that do not match the scale of the threat.</p><p>Taiwan has set a target for local industry to produce 15,000 dual-use drones a month by 2028, while the Defence Ministry has ordered 700 military-grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 3,422 dual-use drones from local manufacturers, according to figures from the government-backed Research Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology (DSET).</p><p>Taiwan also ordered approximately 1,000 UAVs from the US in 2024 and set a new target in May to procure another 47,000 drones over the next four years.</p><p>The newer procurement figures have yet to be accounted for in the national budget, which means they are subject to possible change.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

military-grade UAVs – are small by the standards of modern warfare, according to defence experts.</p><p>During the opening volleys of a conflict with China, Taipei and Beijing would be expected to “churn through thousands of UAVs on a daily, if not hourly, basis”, according to an April report by the US Naval Institute.</p><p>The report estimated that Taiwan’s recent purchase of 291 Altius-600M UAVs, 685 Switchblade loitering munitions, and 4 MQ-9B drones – part of a $21bn backlog in military orders with the US government – would sustain just four to five volleys against the PLA.</p><p>Speaking at a DSET summit on supply chain resilience in Taipei last month, Peter Mattis, president of the US-based Jamestown Foundation, said Taiwan needed to think on a much bigger scale to meet its training and stockpile needs.</p><p>“Maybe it’s appropriate to be thinking about hundreds [of drones] while you’re trying to test things out, but we need to be burning through those, running them through their paces, so that we know when we do scale … we’re actually getting something that can stand the test,” Mattis said.</p><p>Yurii Poita, head of the Asia Pacific section at the Kyiv-based Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, noted that Ukraine plans to manufacture 200,000 a month in 2025, which is about “the same number as Taiwan wants to [produce] over one year”.</p><p>Ukrainian brigades burn through 50 to 100 first-person view drones (FPV) – which give the pilot a real-time view of the battlefield – each day, Poita told Al Jazeera.</p><p><img

including by paying attention to developments in Russia and Ukraine, said Misha Lu, a drone expert at the Taiwanese startup Tron Future.</p><p>“In Ukraine and Russia, drones have already evolved beyond the mere purpose of reconnaissance and strikes,” Lu told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“In Taiwan’s case, military drone applications have not been so diverse yet.</p><p>“Simply put, the Taiwanese military needs to speed up the process of figuring out the role of anti-drone tech in its defence planning and training,” Lu said.</p><p>Still, experts disagree about where exactly Taiwan should be placing its focus, given the wide variety of drone types and its limited resources.</p><p>While a lot of attention has been paid to stopping PLA from landing on Taiwan, there has not been enough discussion of what would happen next, said Lorenz Meier, the founder and CEO of the drone software company Auterion, who argues that Taipei’s drone strategy should take advantage of Taiwan’s unique geography.</p><p>Taiwan is split down its length by the Central Mountain Range, with most of its towns and cities – many of which largely consist of low-rise concrete buildings designed to withstand earthquakes – located on the west coast.</p><p>About 60 percent of the island is covered in dense evergreen subtropical forest.</p><p>“I’m in full favour of pushing USV right now; it also sends a message to China. This is important,” Meier told Al Jazeera on the sidelines of the Su’ao Bay drone expo, where Auterion signed a partnership with the NCSIST.</p><p>“But at the same time, there needs to be, eventually, conversation around the defence strategy, and the fact that we’re not talking about a realistic urban combat scenario shows that there is work to be done.</p><p>“I’ve never seen the government talk extensively about using the hills,” Meier added.</p><p>“If you retreat a force into the jungle, and if you launch drones out of the hills, that is going to be hell to sit at the beach.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3855108\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/INTERACTIVE_TAIWAN-CHINA_MILITYARY_DRILLS_MAY23_2024-copy-2-1753365741.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE_TAIWAN-CHINA_MILITYARY_DRILLS_MAY23_2024 copy 2-1753365741\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Alexander Huang, the chairman of Taiwan’s Council on Strategic and Wargaming Studies and a member of the opposition Kuomintang, said Taipei’s strategy has focused on building an arsenal to the detriment of considering how to deploy it in a conflict.</p><p>“A smart way is for Taiwan to go is to review the specifics of the Taiwan contingency and Taiwan theatre and figure out the operational tempo of the People’s Liberation Army and come up with a kind of drone development strategy with Taiwanese characteristics, rather than just copying the Ukraine model or following the advice of the Pentagon,” Huang told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Taiwan’s Defence Ministry did not reply to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.</p><p>Some of Taipei’s shortsightedness comes from a lack of recent combat experience, according to Jason Wang, the COO of ingeniSPACE, a geospatial intelligence company with offices in Taiwan.</p><p>“Taiwan can produce any hardware that you could possibly imagine and do it cheaply. Modern warfare is not about the hardware. It’s about putting the brains in the drones to give the warfighter options on the battlefield,” Wang told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Understanding the role that different drones play on the battlefield, the logistics necessary to get them there, and the speed of violence necessary to stop your adversary is what Taiwanese manufacturers have a hard time mastering,” Wang added.</p><p>“For Taiwan, mastery of the battlefield is a function of political will, not capability.”</p><p>Taiwan has for decades dealt with Chinese aggression in the form of “grey-zone” tactics – low-grade activity occupying the space between peace and conflict – but has not fought a military battle with Beijing since the 1958 Taiwan Strait crisis.</p><p>Taipei and Beijing have been at odds since the 1940s, when the Republic of China (ROC) government lost the Chinese Civil War to communist forces.</p><p>In 1949, ROC leader Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan, an erstwhile Japanese colony, pledging to one day return to the mainland.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3862915\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3862915\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3862915\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP630523173-1753776401.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1108&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Chiang Kai Shek 1963\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3862915\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Taiwanese President Chiang Kai-shek is seated in the garden of his Shihlin residence, in Taipei, Taiwan, in May 1963 [AP]</figcaption></figure><p>After losing dozens of allies during the Cold War, including the US in 1979, Taiwan is today recognised by just 11 countries and the Holy See.</p><p>Its diplomatic isolation means it cannot officially engage with neighbouring militaries or UN peacekeeping missions.</p><p>Joint military exercises with the US, Taiwan’s main security guarantor, have been held on an unofficial basis without any announcement, to avoid angering China.</p><p>For the same reason, while the US has pledged to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, successive governments in Washington have stopped short of saying whether it would directly intervene in a conflict.</p><p>Taiwan’s military, a symbol of state repression during four decades of martial law that lasted until 1987, has undergone significant investment and modernisation in recent years.</p><p>After Taiwan transitioned to democracy in the early 1990s, the military underwent a period of neglect until the election of President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progress Party in 2016, according to Michael Hunzeker, an associate professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government.</p><p>The DPP saw the military largely as a “tool of authoritarian oppression”, Hunzeker told Al Jazeera, while the opposition KMT did not want to build up military power because it was seeking rapprochement with Beijing.</p><p>Under Tsai and her successor, Lai, Taiwan began to dramatically scale up military spending.</p><p>In 2025, Taiwan’s cabinet allocated defence spending equal to 2.45 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) – up from spending equivalent to 1.82 percent of GDP in 2016 – a budget that was later scaled down by the opposition-controlled legislature.</p><p>Lai has said he ultimately wants to raise spending this year to 3 percent of GDP, though his plans face opposition from the KMT.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, China’s military, the world’s largest in terms of personnel, still dwarves Taiwan’s forces.</p><p>China’s military ranked 3rd in the 2025 Global Firepower Index, which measures the defence capabilities of global militaries, far ahead of Taiwan’s military at 22nd.</p><p>Since 2022, the PLA has conducted regular large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, including drills with drones.</p><p>China does not have an embassy in Taipei, but its embassies in Washington, DC and Tokyo did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Taiwanese drone makers say that access to real-world and timely battlefield intelligence will be essential to designing the best drones for Taiwan and potential clients overseas.</p><p>“Our weak points are that we need to adapt to the conditions on the battlefield that change daily.
