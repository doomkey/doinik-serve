Polite, smiling – and watchful.</p><p>It was late December, and we had just taken an Air Burkina flight from Dakar, Senegal across the Sahel, where a storm of political upheaval and armed violence has unsettled the region in recent years.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Mali sits at the centre of a reckoning. After two military coups in 2020 and 2021, the country severed ties with its former colonial ruler, France, expelled French forces, pushed out the United Nations peacekeeping mission, and redrew its alliances</p><p>Alongside Burkina Faso and Niger, now also ruled by military governments backed by Russian mercenaries, it formed the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2024/7/7/whats-behind-the-creation-of-the-alliance-of-sahel-states\">Alliance of Sahel States (AES)</a> in September 2023. Together, the regional grouping withdrew from the wider Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) bloc, accusing it of serving foreign interests rather than African ones.</p><p>This month, leaders from the three countries converged in Bamako for the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/sahel-summit-what-is-the-biggest-challenge-facing-the-region\">Confederal Summit of Heads of State of the AES</a>, the second such meeting since the alliance was formed. And we were there to cover it.</p><p>The summit was a ribbon-cutting moment. Leaders of the three countries inaugurated a new Sahel Investment and Development Bank meant to finance infrastructure projects without reliance on Western lenders; a new television channel built around a shared narrative and presented as giving voice to the people of the Sahel; and a joint military force intended to operate across borders against armed groups. It was a moment to celebrate achievements more than to sign new agreements.</p><p>But the reason behind the urgency of those announcements lay beyond the summit hall.</p><p>In this layered terrain of fracture and identity, armed groups have found room not only to manoeuvre, but to grow. Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate, has expanded from rural Mali, launching attacks across the region and reaching the coast of Benin, exploiting weak state presence and long-unresolved grievances.</p><p>As our plane descended toward Bamako, I looked out at an endless stretch of earth, wondering how much of it was now under the control of al-Qaeda affiliates.</p><p>From the airport, our minders drove us fast through the city. Motorbikes swerved around us, street hawkers peddled their wares, and Malian pop blared from speakers. At first, this did not feel like a capital under siege. Yet since September, armed groups have been operating a blockade around Bamako, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/29/fuel-crisis-in-mali-spirals-as-armed-group-chokes-off-supplies-to-capital\">choking off fuel</a> and goods, the military government said.</p><p>We drove past petrol stations where long queues stretched into the night. Life continued even as fuel grew scarce. People sat patiently, waiting their turn. Anger seemed to have given way to indifference, while rumours swirled that the authorities had struck quiet deals with the very fighters they claimed to be fighting, simply to keep the city moving.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206536\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206536\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206536\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-03T202021Z_1056089474_RC21NHA2266X_RTRMADP_3_MALI-SECURITY-1767178947.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C501&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mali\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206536\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Motorcycles line up near a closed petrol station, amid ongoing fuel shortages caused by a blockade imposed by al Qaeda-linked fighters in early September, in Bamako, Mali [Stringer/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"to-become-one-country-to-hold-each-other-s-hand\">‘To become one country, to hold each other’s hand’</h2><p>Our minders drove us on to the Sahel Alliance Square, a newly created public space built to celebrate the union of the three countries and its people.</p><p>On the way, Malian forces sped past, perhaps toward a front line that feels ever closer, as gunmen linked to JNIM have set up checkpoints disrupting trade routes to the capital in recent months. In September 2024, they also carried out coordinated attacks inside Bamako, hitting a military police school housing elite units, nearby neighbourhoods, and the military airport on the city’s outskirts. And yet, Bamako carries on, as if the war were taking place in a faraway land.</p><p>At Sahel Alliance Square, a few hundred young people gathered and cheered as the Malian forces went by, drawn by loud music, trivia questions on stage and the MC’s promise of small prizes.</p><p>The questions were simple: Name the AES countries? Name the leaders?</p><p>A microphone was handed to the children. The alliance leaders’ names were drilled in: Abdourahamane Tchiani of Niger. Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso. Assimi Goita of Mali. Repeated again and again until they stuck.</p><p>Correct answers won a prize: a T-shirt stamped with the faces of the alliance leaders.</p><p>Moussa Niare, 12 years old and a resident of Bamako, clutched a shirt bearing the faces of the three military leaders.</p><p>“They’ve gathered together to become one country, to hold each other’s hand, and to fight a common enemy,” he told us with buoyant confidence, as the government’s attempt to sell the new alliance to the public appeared to be cultivating loyalty among the young.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"france-out-russia-in\">France out, Russia in</h2><p>While Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger went through separate political transitions, the paths that brought them into a shared alliance followed a similar pattern.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2023, each country saw its democratically elected leadership removed by the military, the takeovers framed as necessary corrections.</p><p>In Mali, Colonel Goita seized power after months of protest and amid claims that President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita had failed to curb corruption or halt the advance of armed groups.</p><p>In Burkina Faso, the army ousted President Roch Marc Christian Kabore in early 2022 as insecurity worsened; later that year, Captain Traore emerged from a counter-coup, promising a more decisive response to the rebellion.</p><p>In Niger, soldiers led by General Tchiani detained President Mohamed Bazoum in July 2023, accusing his government of failing to safeguard national security and of leaning too heavily on foreign partners.</p><p>What began as separate seizures of power have since become a shared political project, now expressed through a formal alliance. The gathering in Bamako was to give shape to their union.</p><p>One of the key conclusions of the AES summit was the announced launch of a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/burkina-faso-leader-vows-sahel-alliance-crackdown-on-armed-groups\">joint military battalion</a> aimed at fighting armed groups across the Sahel.</p><p>This follows months of escalating violence, as regional armies assisted by <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/wagner-vs-africa-corps-the-future-of-russian-paramilitaries-in-mali\">Russian mercenaries</a> push back against armed groups who have been launching attacks for over a decade.</p><p>Under the previous civilian governments, former colonial ruler France had a strong diplomatic and military presence. French troops, whose presence in the region dates back to independence, are now being pushed out, as military rulers recast sovereignty as both a political and security imperative. The last troops left Mali in <a href=\"/news/2022/8/16/last-french-troops-leave-mali-ending-nine-year-deployment\">2022</a>, but at its peak, France had more than 5,000 soldiers deployed there. When they withdrew, the country became a symbol of strategic failure for France’s Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>But even before that, French diplomacy appeared tone deaf, and patronising at best, failing to grasp the aspirations of its former colonies. The common regional currency, the CFA franc, still anchored to the French treasury, has become a powerful symbol of that resentment.</p><p>Now, French state television and radio have been banned in Mali. In what was once the heart of Francophone West Africa, French media has become shorthand for interference. What was lost was not only influence, but credibility. France was no longer seen as guaranteeing stability, but as producing instability.</p><p>Across the Sahel and beyond, anti-French sentiment is surging, often expressed in French itself – the language of the coloniser is now also the language of resistance.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206519\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206519\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206519\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25357459450133-1767178831.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Traore\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206519\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Captain Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso attends the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) second summit in Bamako, Mali [Mali Government Information Center via AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"like-a-marriage-of-reason\">‘Like a marriage of reason’</h2><p>At the end of the summit, Mali’s Goita was preparing to hand over the AES’s rotating leadership to Traore of Burkina Faso.</p><p>Young, charismatic, and the new rock star of Pan-Africanism, Traore, in particular, has captured young audiences with help from a loose ecosystem of pro-Russian messaging and Africanist influencers. Across social media platforms, short videos circulate relentlessly: speeches clipped for virality, images of defiance, and slogans reduced to shareable fragments.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Burkina Faso, journalists and civil society actors who have criticised the military rules have been sent to the front line under a conscription policy introduced by Traore. Human rights groups outspoken about alleged extrajudicial killings say they have been silenced or sidelined. But much of it is dismissed as collateral, the price, supporters argue, of sovereignty finally reclaimed.</p><p>Before the ceremony, we met Mali’s finance minister. At first, he was confident, rehearsed, assured. But when pressed about financing for the ambitious infrastructure projects the three governments have laid out for the Sahel, his composure faltered and his words stuttered. This was a government official unaccustomed to being questioned. The microphone was removed. Later, away from the camera, he told me, “The IMF won’t release loans until Mali has ironed out its relations with France.”</p><p>The spokesperson, irritated by my questions, took me aside. As he adjusted the collar of my suit, slowly and patronisingly, he said he sometimes thought about putting journalists in jail “just for fun”.</p><p>He did not question the organisation I worked for. He questioned my French passport; my allegiance. I told him my allegiance was to the truth. He smiled, as if that answer confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>In the worldview of Mali’s military government – men shaped by years on the front line, living with a permanent sense of threat – journalists and critics are part of the problem. Creating safety was the challenge. The alliance, the spokesperson explained, was the solution to what they could not find within regional body, ECOWAS.</p><p>The half-century-old West African institution is a bloc that the three countries had once helped shape. Now, the AES leaders say its ageing, democratically elected presidents have grown detached, more invested in maintaining one another in office than in confronting the region’s crises. In response, they are promoting the AES as an alternative.</p><p>As the Sahel alliance grows, it’s also building new infrastructure.</p><p>At its new television channel in Bamako, preparations were under way. The ON AIR sign glowed. State-of-the-art cameras sat on tripods like polished weapons.</p><p>The channel’s director, Salif Sanogo, told me it would be “a tool to fight disinformation,” a way to counter Western, and more specifically French, narratives and “give voice to the people of the Sahel, by the people of the Sahel”.</p><p>The cameras had been bought abroad. The installation was overseen by a French production company. The irony went unremarked.</p><p>To defend the alliance, he offered a metaphor. “It’s like a marriage of reason,” he said. “It’s easier to make decisions when you’re married to three. When you’re married to 15, it’s a mess.” He was referring to the 15 member states of ECOWAS.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-will-survive-this-too\">‘We will survive this, too’</h2><p>Two years into the AES alliance, they have moved faster than the legacy regional bloc they left behind. A joint military force now binds their borders together, presented as a matter of survival rather than ambition. A mutual defence pact recasts coups and external pressure as shared threats, not national failures. A common Sahel investment and development bank, meant to finance roads, energy, and mineral extraction without recourse to Western lenders, offers sovereignty, they say, without conditions. A common currency is under discussion.</p><p>A shared news channel is intended to project a single narrative outward, even as space for independent media contracts at home. And after withdrawing from the International Criminal Court, they have proposed a Sahel penal court, one that would try serious crimes and human rights violations on their own terms. Justice brought home, or justice brought under control, depending on who you ask.</p><p>What is taking shape is not just an alliance, but an alternative architecture, built quickly, deliberately, and in full view of its critics.</p><p>Where ECOWAS built norms slowly, through elections, mediation, and consensus, AES is building structure. Where ECOWAS insists on patience, AES insists on speed.</p><p>To supporters, this is overdue self-determination, dignity restored after decades of dependency. To critics, it is power concentrated in uniforms, accountability postponed, repression dressed up as emancipation.</p><p>From the summit stage as he took over the alliance’s leadership, Traore redrew the enemy: Not al-Qaeda. Not ISIL. Not even France. But their African neighbours, cast as the enemy within. He warned of what he called a “black winter”, a speech that held the room and travelled far beyond it, drawing millions of viewers online.</p><p>“Why are we, Black people, trying to cultivate hatred among ourselves,” he asked, “and through hypocrisy calling ourselves brothers? We have only two choices: either we put an end to imperialism once and for all, or we remain slaves until we disappear.”</p><p>Away from the summit’s “black winter”, under a sunlit sky in Bamako, life moved on with a quieter rhythm. Music drifted through public squares and streets, carrying a familiarity that cut across the tension of speeches and slogans. It was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NRtQmqqfdoc?si=ASMymaIMTlpigrnU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amadou and Mariam</a>, Mali’s most internationally known musical duo, whose songs once carried the country’s everyday joys far beyond its borders. Amadou died suddenly this year. But the melody lingers.</p><p>Its lyrics hold the secret of the largest alliance of all. Not one forged by treaties or uniforms, but by people, across Mali and the Sahel, in all their diversity.</p><p>“Sabali”, Mariam sings.</p><p>“Forbearance.</p><p>“We have survived worse. We will survive this, too.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Those subsidies expire on December 31.</p><p>“The healthcare issue is a big one because people typically have their health insurance premium deducted from their account on the first, second, or third of the month,” said Daniel Hornung, the former deputy director of the National Economic Council during the Biden administration.</p><p>“So, in the next few days, we’re likely to see people in many cases have their health insurance premiums double.”</p><h2 id=\"why-hasn-t-congress-extended-the-healthcare-subsidies\">Why hasn’t Congress extended the healthcare subsidies?</h2><p>Congress has been in gridlock over the issue of whether to extend the ACA subsidies.</p><p>Democrats refused to pass budget legislation in September until Congress acted to extend the healthcare subsidies. But Republican leaders said they would only vote on the subsidies after the budget legislation was signed.</p><p>That impasse led to a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/us-house-passes-spending-bill-ending-longest-govt-shutdown-in-history\">43-day government shutdown</a>, the longest in US history.</p><p>The gridlock ended when a handful of Democrats broke ranks with their party members to pass the budget legislation, on the understanding that there would be a December vote to extend the subsidies.</p><p>But rival proposals from Democrats and Republicans to address the subsidies <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/failure-of-rival-health-bills-underscores-impasse-in-us-politics\">both failed</a> earlier this month.</p><p>The expiration takes effect on New Year’s Day, but Congress does not return from recess until January 5.</p><h2 id=\"how-many-people-will-be-affected-by-the-subsidies-expiration\">How many people will be affected by the subsidies’ expiration?</h2><p>Approximately 2.2 million Americans are projected to lose healthcare coverage because of the increased cost, according to analysis from the Congressional Budget Office.</p><p>Hornung, the former Biden administration official, said that many more stand to be affected by healthcare premium increases.</p><p>“We’re talking about roughly 20 million or so Americans who are on the ACA exchanges, either the national exchanges or the state exchanges, so that’s a major issue,” Hornung said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4205249\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4205249\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4205249\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-01T203214Z_1898224243_RC29MHA6XIC5_RTRMADP_3_USA-SHUTDOWN-HUNGER-1767129322.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A food bank in Texas, with a picture of a Campbell soup can on the wall\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4205249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Critics fear changes in 2026 will reduce accessibility to programmes like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food to low-income households [File: Kaylee Greenlee/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-are-the-new-work-requirements-for-federal-food-assistance\">What are the new work requirements for federal food assistance?</h2><p>Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, there are new work requirements to qualify for <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-administration-threatens-to-withhold-food-assistance-from-21-states\">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP)</a> benefits, which help low-income households afford groceries.</p><p>Able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 64 must now work or participate in school or a training programme for at least 80 hours per month to remain eligible.</p><p>The policy applies to new applicants and renewals, beginning on January 1.</p><p>For current SNAP recipients, implementation timing varies by state. Some states have already notified existing beneficiaries of the pending changes, while others will begin enforcement later. In New York, for example, the new rules are not expected to take effect until March 2026.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/7/2/restaurant-workers-say-no-tax-on-tips-undermined-by-benefits-cuts\">Critics have told Al Jazeera</a> that the new rules may place an additional burden on service-industry workers, many of whom have irregular schedules that make it difficult to guarantee 80 hours every month.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-inheritances-be-affected\">How will inheritances be affected?</h2><p>Among the changes is an expanded estate tax exemption. Under the new policy, individuals inheriting an estate worth less than $15m are exempt from the federal estate tax. For couples, that threshold is $30m.</p><p>Prior to the 2017 law, the cap for untaxed estate inheritances was about $5.5m ($7.2m in 2025, adjusted for inflation) for individuals and $11m ($14m when adjusted for inflation) for couples.</p><p>Critics point out that the higher thresholds allow significant generational wealth transfers without taxation. As a result of the new provision, fewer than 1 percent of taxpayers ever face the estate tax.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-deductions-change-during-the-us-tax-season\">How will deductions change during the US tax season?</h2><p>January 1 will make several provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term — permanent. Many of these provisions benefit higher-income households.</p><p>One of the 2017 provisions that has been extended permits certain businesses to deduct 20 percent of their qualifying income from federal taxes.</p><p>There are also changes to the deduction limits for state and local taxes (SALT).</p><p>Typically, the federal government allows taxpayers to pay less in federal taxes if they can show they are paying a certain amount in income, sales and property taxes on the state and local levels.</p><p>But that reduction is capped at a certain amount. Upon passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the SALT deduction cap rose from $10,000 to $40,000.</p><p>That cap will increase by 1 percent to $40,400 for the 2026 tax year, with additional 1 percent increases through 2029.</p><p>Opponents say those cap increases will disproportionately benefit residents in high-tax states, such as New York and California.</p><p>For 2026, the OBBBA will also prompt a jump in the standard deductions for taxpayers.</p><p>The standard deduction will increase by $350 for single filers, $700 for joint filers, and $525 for heads of households over the 2025 rates.</p><p>For those over the age of 65, the deduction will also increase modestly by $50 for both joint and single filers, compared with last year.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4205252\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4205252\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4205252\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024-08-23T193855Z_1741483687_RC2VL9AAD6CQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-NEVADA-1767129342.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt='Donald Trump rallies in front of a sign that reads, \"No Tax on Tips.\"' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4205252\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump campaigns on the slogan, ‘No tax on tips’, while speaking in Las Vegas, Nevada, on August 23, 2024 [David Swanson/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-there-any-benefits-for-childcare\">Are there any benefits for childcare?</h2><p>During his 2024 re-election bid, Trump made reducing childcare costs a central campaign pitch.</p><p>“Childcare is childcare,” Trump told the Economic Club of New York in 2024. “It’s something you have to have in this country. You have to have it.”</p><p>The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is set to increase the child tax credit marginally.</p><p>In 2026, parents can receive tax credits for up to 50 percent of their eligible childcare expenses.</p><p>Qualifying expenses, however, are capped at $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more. That is up from a maximum of $2,200 per child in 2025.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-trump-s-campaign-promise-no-tax-on-tips-or-overtime\">What about Trump’s campaign promise, ‘No tax on tips or overtime’?</h2><p>Some tax code changes are already in place, including the collection of no federal income tax on tips and no federal tax on overtime, both of which are retroactive for income earned after January 1, 2025.</p><p>Income earned in 2026 and beyond will not be taxed, and taxes paid on eligible 2025 income will be refunded through annual tax returns.</p><p>Workers can deduct up to $25,000 in cash tips, including those paid via credit and debit transactions.</p><p>While this will provide relief to some tipped workers, it will not provide significant relief to many on the lower end of the income scale, especially for those <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/2/restaurant-workers-say-no-tax-on-tips-undermined-by-benefits-cuts\">who work in food service</a>.</p><p>Roughly two-thirds of workers in the sector do not make enough money annually to meet the threshold needed to file federal income taxes, which is $15,750 in 2026. The new law would ultimately not benefit them.</p><p>The no-tax-on-overtime policy, meanwhile, allows workers to deduct up to $12,500 in overtime income per year.</p><p>“Policies like ‘no tax on tips’ or ‘no tax on overtime’ do not address the core problem facing millions of workers across the country, which is that wages are simply too low to begin with,” said Saru Jayaraman, the founder of One Fair Wage, a nonprofit advocacy organisation.</p><p>“A policy that keeps base wages low and unstable while offering tax relief many workers will never see does not solve the affordability crisis.”</p><p>These tax exemptions are also not permanent and are scheduled to expire in 2028, Trump’s final year in office, unless extended by Congress.</p><p>The no-tax-on-tips provision applies only to federal income tax. State and local taxes still apply.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The difference had been simmering for years away from the spotlight until it exploded publicly over the past few days.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and the UAE are key members of the Arab military coalition in Yemen, formed to confront the Houthis, who took full control of the capital, Sanaa, by force in 2015 and later imposed their own government.</p><p>This conflict of interest between Saudi Arabia and the UAE has been escalating gradually since the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) formed in 2017 as a separatist political and military force seeking an independent state in the south – South Yemen – an independent state between 1967 and 1990.</p><p>Earlier in December, the STC forces crossed red lines by controlling all southern governorates, including Hadramout and al-Mahra governorates. That did not go down well in Saudi Arabia, which considered the move a threat to its national security.</p><p>Hadramout also represents economic depth for Yemen with its oil and gas resources and related infrastructure, and also has a vital border crossing with Saudi Arabia, making it part of the equation for border security and trade.</p><p>The latest public fallout between Saudi Arabia and the UAE will cast a dark shadow over the situation in Yemen politically, economically, and militarily. The Yemeni political circles were divided into two camps, with the government members each following one of the external parties to the conflict – Saudi and Emirati.</p><p>The clearest outcome of the differences would be seen in the eight-member PLC, an internationally recognised body, which is already divided into camps loyal to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p>One camp is headed by Rashad al-Alimi, the PLC president, and includes Sultan al-Arada, Abdullah al-Alimi Bawazir, and Othman Hussein Mujalli. The second is led by the head of the STC force, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, and includes Abdul Rahman al-Mahrami (also known as Abu Zaraa), Tariq Mohammed Saleh, and Faraj Salmin al-Bahsani.</p><p>The leaders of both camps issued two different statements regarding the calls made by al-Alimi for the UAE to withdraw from Yemen following the Saudi strike on the ships carrying weapons to the STC. One was in favour of the UAE’s exit from Yemen, and the other was against — showing they are representing the interests of regional players and at the same time confirming that Yemen is a venue for a proxy war.</p><p>Within the Yemeni political landscape, the quick developments and successive events are pushing Yemen into a new phase of an internal war among political and military components that make up the legitimate government, with new internal fighting among many armed factions.</p><p>It is also taking the focus away from the Houthi rebellion in the north, which controlled Sanaa and the most populous provinces in Yemen.</p><p>The main goal for the legitimate Yemeni government and the Saudi-led Arab coalition was to confront the Houthis’ takeover. Now, the country is on the brink of collapse and a new phase of turmoil after more than a decade of armed conflict, which could help the Houthis to expand their influence beyond their current areas of control.</p><p>The latest event will weaken the Saudi-led coalition further and cast doubt over its cohesion and ability to achieve its declared joint goals for Yemen.</p><p><strong><em>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</em></strong></p></div></div></body></html>"

Schwartz argues that the Trump administration’s actions violate laws like the Privacy Act, marking a “dangerous” shift away from Nixon-era protections.</p><p>“The number-one problem with the federal government in the last year when it comes to surveillance is the demolition of the Watergate-era safeguards that were intended to keep databases separated,” he said.</p><p>Schwartz noted that Trump's consolidation efforts have been coupled with a lack of transparency about how the new, integrated data systems are being used.</p><p>\"Just as the current administration has done a great leap forward on surveillance and invading privacy, so it also has been a less transparent government in terms of the public understanding what it is doing,\" Schwartz said.</p><p>Already, on March 20, Trump signed an executive order that called on government agencies to take \"all necessary steps\" for the dissolution of what he called \"data silos\".</p><p>Shortly afterwards, in April, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) inked a deal with the IRS to exchange personal information, including the names and addresses of taxpayers.</p><p>The memo was seen as an effort to turn private taxpayer data into a tool to carry out Trump's goal of deporting immigrants.</p><p>A federal court in November paused the agencies' data-sharing agreement. But other efforts continue.</p><p>In June, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of giving DOGE access to sensitive Social Security data. And just this month, the Trump administration pressured states to share information about the recipients of food assistance, or else face a loss of funding.</p><p>While immigrants appear to be one of the main targets of the data consolidation project, Venzke said that Americans of all stripes should not be surprised if their personal information is weaponised down the line.</p><p>“There is no reason that it will be limited to undocumented people. They are taking a system that’s traditionally limited to non-citizens and vastly expanding it to include all sorts of information on US citizens,” Venzke said.</p><p>“That was unthinkable just five years ago, but we're seeing it happen now, and consequently, its potential abuses are widespread.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

operations of international humanitarian agencies providing support to Palestinians.</p><p>In 2024, the Israeli parliament passed a law banning the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from operating within Israel, citing allegations that some of its locally engaged staff had participated in the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel.<strong> </strong></p><p>UNRWA – the principal provider of aid, education, health and social services to Palestinian refugees across Gaza, the occupied West Bank and neighbouring countries for decades – strongly denied these allegations. Since Israel controls access to Gaza and the occupied West Bank, the ban crushed UNRWA’s operations in the Palestinian territory.</p><p>In October, the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/after-icj-ruling-can-un-relief-agency-unrwa-resume-full-gaza-operations\">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a> found that Israel’s allegations against UNRWA were unsubstantiated.</p><p>Nevertheless, Israel’s claims prompted the United States, historically UNRWA’s largest donor, to end funding.

But over the past two years, Israel’s genocidal war has demolished what Palestinians in Gaza painstakingly built, despite the odds.</p><p>According to the latest United Nations data, Israel has killed 579 aid workers – including nearly 400 from UNRWA – since October 7, 2023.

Washington claims the vessels are part of a “shadow fleet” of tankers smuggling sanctioned oil.</p><p>Since August, the US has amassed the largest military presence in the Caribbean Sea in decades, causing alarm among governments there. The Trump administration claims this is warranted because the trafficking of drugs to the US constitutes a national emergency, but multiple reports have shown that <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">Venezuela is not a major source of drugs</a> being transported across borders.</p><p>On September 2, the US began striking small boats in the Caribbean that it alleges were trafficking drugs. It is thought it has struck more than 30 vessels since then. The Trump administration says the vessels are operated by Venezuelan “terrorist” organisations, including the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/20/fact-check-is-tren-de-aragua-invading-the-us-as-trump-says\">Tren de Aragua</a> group and the Colombian National Liberation Army.

Abuja denies allegations of genocide and says Muslim and Christian communities alike are affected by the violence.</p><p>Furthermore, alleged <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/us-bombs-target-isil-in-nigeria-whats-really-going-on\">attacks on Christian farmers</a> in Nigeria have taken place in a completely different part of the country. US Senator Ted Cruz first accused Nigeria’s government of enabling a “massacre” against Christians in October 2025, citing a rising number of <a href=\"/news/2025/4/19/herder-farmer-clashes-in-nigeria-kill-at-least-17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attacks</a> against the community in the country’s central Middle Belt region, which is separate from the violence in the north.</p><p>Even though these two issues are separate, Abuja, under pressure, agreed to the US military operation in the north of the country on December 25.</p><p>Details of that strike are still emerging. The US Africa Command said in a statement that “multiple ISIS terrorists were killed in the ISIS camps”, and Nigeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the strike was “successful”.</p><p>It appeared to target the newly emerged “Lakurawa” group, which conflict monitors say is made up of armed fighters from Mali and Niger who may be linked to ISIL or al-Qaeda.</p><p>The group is known to operate in forested corridors between Sokoto and Kebbi states. At least one US missile, or debris, hit Jabo town in Sokoto. The Nigerian military, speaking to local media, later confirmed strikes on armed group hideouts in Buani Forest, but did not reveal casualty numbers.</p><p>The US and Nigeria have a long history of security collaboration through training and intelligence sharing, but the Christmas strikes marked the first known kinetic US military action in the West African nation.</p><p>It was timed, analysts say, to appease Trump’s Christian supporters as Washington doubles down on a narrative of “saving” Nigerian Christians, although Nigerian authorities insist the strikes are not about any one religion.</p><p>Trump said more strikes will follow.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4197213\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4197213\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4197213\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sokoto-1766760230.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Police stand with yellow tape\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4197213\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police barricade the scene of a US strike in Jabo, Sokoto State, northwestern Nigeria, December 26, 2025 [Qosim Suleiman/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"somalia\">Somalia</h2><p>The US has long trained Somali forces and conducted air attacks in the region against armed groups, including al-Shabab, a group affiliated with al-Qaeda, which has launched several attacks in Somalia and in neighbouring Kenya.

In the past year, 7,289 people have been killed by armed group activity, according to the US-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies.</p><p>In his first term as president, Trump withdrew most US troops from the country, but the Biden administration redeployed them in May 2022.</p><p>In Trump’s second term, the US has remained active in the country, at Somalia’s urging. Washington has dramatically <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/us-dramatically-escalates-air-strikes-on-somalia-under-trump-this-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">intensified</a> air attacks since February, according to the New America Foundation.</p><p>Overall, at least 111 strikes have been recorded this year, surpassing the number carried out under the George Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden administrations combined, monitors say.</p><p>Civilians have been killed in the Somalia attacks. Investigative site Drop Site News revealed in December that at least 11 civilians, seven of them children, were killed in a strike in the Lower Juba region, in Somalia’s southwest, just last month.</p><p>The US does not reveal the number of civilian deaths in Somalia.</p><h2 id=\"syria\">Syria</h2><p>US strikes on 70 ISIL-positions in Syria on December 19 were carried out in retaliation for a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/joint-syrian-us-patrol-comes-under-attack-near-palmyra-state-media\">shooting in Palmyra</a> which killed two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter a week earlier.</p><p>Three other Americans and two members of the Syrian security forces were injured in the shooting. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Trump placed the blame on ISIL.</p><p>Syria’s Ministry of Interior Affairs later said an individual who targeted the US troops had been a member of the state security service slated for dismissal for hardline views.</p><p>The US retaliatory operation, dubbed “Hawkeye” in reference to Iowa, the “Hawkeye State” where both killed soldiers were from, damaged several ISIL weapons storage facilities in locations across Syria, an official told CNN.</p><p>“I am hereby announcing that the United States is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible,” Trump posted on Truth Social on December 19.</p><p>“We are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated,” he added, warning against further attacks on US service members.</p><p>Hegseth said in a post on X on the same day that the strikes represented a “declaration of vengeance” on ISIL.</p><p>US troops have long been stationed in Syria to target ISIL, which once controlled large areas of land across Syria and Iraq in the mid-2010s.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, about 900 US troops were stationed in the country until December 2024, when the Pentagon said numbers were temporarily doubled to fight ISIL, amid the collapse of the Bashar al-Assad government. The US has carried out more than 80 operations aimed at neutralising armed operatives in Syria, according to the US military’s Central Command.</p><p>At the time, Trump, as the president-elect, warned against US interference. He posted on Truth Social: “Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

More than 1,100 Iranians and 28 Israelis were killed during the open hostilities.</p><p>But during his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week, Trump threatened to hit Iran again.</p><p>“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” he said, referring to the nuclear programme. “We’ll knock the hell out of them.”</p><p>Iran is forbidden from developing nuclear weapons as a signatory to the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 2015, it also signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Western powers, including the US, agreeing to limit uranium enrichment levels in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>However, Trump withdrew the US from that pact in 2018 – during his first term as US president – claiming it had been badly negotiated under the Obama administration.</p><h2 id=\"yemen\">Yemen</h2><p>Since January 12, 2024, the US has targeted Yemen’s <a href=\"/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide\">Houthis</a>, an Iran-aligned group that controls much of Yemen’s populous northwest, in a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/2/yemens-houthis-launch-missiles-at-israel-army-says-it-intercepts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">series of air and naval attacks</a>.</p><p>The US says strikes were carried out in retaliation for Houthi attacks on Israeli-linked vessels passing through the Red Sea, in solidarity with Gaza.</p><p>The strikes escalated to daily attacks in March 2025 under the new Trump administration, under a mission codenamed Operation Rough Rider.</p><p>Dozens of people were killed, and the attacks extensively destroyed infrastructure, including ports, airports, radar systems, air defences, ballistic launch sites, and even migrant holding centres in Sanaa and Hodeidah.</p><p>The US strikes finally came to an end on May 6, following a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/6/trump-says-bombing-of-yemen-to-stop-as-oman-confirms-us-houthi-ceasefire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">truce</a> brokered by Oman.</p><p>Casualty counts from both sides differ: The US claims to have killed about 500 Houthis, while Yemen’s Houthi-run Ministry of Health said 123 people, most of them civilians, had been <a href=\"/news/2025/4/14/us-attacks-on-yemen-killed-123-people-since-mid-march-health-authorities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">killed</a> by April, following the US escalation.</p><p>As many as 247 people, including many women and children, were injured, the ministry said.</p><h2 id=\"iraq\">Iraq</h2><p>The US launched air strikes on Iraq’s al-Anbar province on March 13, killing a high-profile ISIL member, according to the US military’s Central Command (CENTCOM).</p><p>The group’s second-in-command, Abdallah “Abu Khadijah” Malli Muslih al-Rifai, and another unnamed operative were reported to have been killed in the strikes.</p><p>CENTCOM claimed both men were wearing unexploded “suicide vests” and were holding weapons at the time of the strikes. The US also said the strikes were carried out jointly with Iraqi intelligence, and that both sides confirmed the deaths through DNA tests.</p><p>In a celebratory post on Truth Social the day after, Trump praised US troops for the action.</p><p>“Today, the fugitive leader of ISIS in Iraq was killed,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“He was relentlessly hunted down by our intrepid warfighters.

However, as I was scheduled to study in Italy that fall, I was not in New York at the time but rather in Austin, Texas, where my family then resided.</p><p>I spent the day at the office where I had been employed for the summer, watching apocalyptic replays of the incoming planes on a large projector screen set up by my colleagues specifically for that purpose.</p><p>Outside, American flags began to proliferate across every available surface, as the country went about appointing itself the number one victim of terrorism in the history of the world – and never mind the quite literal terror the US had been inflicting on other nations for decades, from <a href=\"/opinions/2025/4/30/from-gaza-to-vietnam-what-is-the-value-of-a-photo\">Vietnam</a> and Laos to <a href=\"/opinions/2021/6/17/as-the-drug-war-turns-50-the-us-is-still-public-enemy-number-one\">Nicaragua</a> and <a href=\"/opinions/2024/1/24/letter-from-panamas-little-hiroshima\">Panama</a>.</p><p>That evening, I visited my boyfriend, whose three housemates were morosely gorging themselves on the living room floor amid copious buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken, which, they explained to me, was “comfort food” meant to help assuage the pain of national tragedy.</p><p>Suffice it to say that, for the countless civilians soon to be on the receiving end of US bombs, massive fast-food takeaway orders generally were not an available antidote.</p><p>From Austin I flew to Rome via New York, where I watched on Italian television as my country went about “saving civilisation itself” by bombing the daylights out of Afghanistan. This exercise in mass slaughter paved the way for the <a href=\"/news/longform/2023/4/5/iraq-war-20-years-on-visualising-the-impact-of-the-invasion\">Iraq War in 2003</a>, a nation already well acquainted with the phenomenon; by 1996, it was estimated that <a href=\"/opinions/2022/3/25/lets-remember-madeleine-albright-as-who-she-really-was\">half a million</a> Iraqi children had perished on account of US sanctions.</p><p>In a rare and presumably unintended moment of lucidity, Bush would remark: “You know, one of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on terror.”</p><p>And while commander-in-chief Bush may have ultimately been better known for his grammatical incompetence than for his ability to strike existential fear into the hearts of Americans, he was flanked by <a href=\"/opinions/2021/7/1/donald-rumsfeld-was-a-criminal-in-a-suit-and-tie\">other, more formidable creatures</a> such as the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/5/dick-cheney-and-the-sanitising-of-a-war-criminal\">recently departed Dick Cheney</a> – aka “the Darth Vader of the administration” and Bush’s vice president – who were far more serious about manufacturing threats to justify war forevermore.</p><p>Bush was succeeded as leader of the global superpower by premature Nobel Peace Prize recipient Barack Obama, who, in his final year in office alone, managed to drop no fewer than <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-many-bombs-did-united-states-drop-2016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">26,172 bombs</a> on seven different countries.</p><p>One of these countries was Yemen, where Obama’s illegal <a href=\"/news/2021/1/28/yemenis-seek-justice-for-unlawful-us-drone-strike-killings\">drone strikes</a> had made a name for themselves, killing Yemeni <a href=\"/features/2014/5/21/yemenis-seek-justice-in-wedding-drone-strike\">wedding attendees</a>. When Donald Trump took over from Obama in 2017, the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-04-27/us-air-campaign-hammers-yemen-with-almost-a-strike-a-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> more US strikes on Yemen in the first 100 days of his presidency than in the previous two years combined – with Trump changing up the rules to allow the military to “authorise strikes without running them through the White House security bureaucracy first”.</p><p>Joe Biden, who served as president in between the two Trump administrations, distinguished his time in office by expanding Washington’s traditionally egregious support for Israeli massacres of Palestinians to <a href=\"/opinions/2024/5/9/give-or-take-a-few-bombs-us-complicity-in-genocide-remains-ironclad\">underwrite an all-out genocide</a> in the Gaza Strip with the help of <a href=\"/news/2024/4/24/biden-signs-law-securing-billions-in-us-aid-for-ukraine-israel\">billions of dollars</a> in US taxpayer money.</p><p>Israel, which jumped on the whole “war on terror” bandwagon from the post-9/11 get-go, now <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/israeli-forces-kill-palestinian-in-gaza-carry-out-raids-across-west-bank\">continues to slaughter</a> Palestinians left and right in Gaza under the guise of a Trump-brokered <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/trump-announces-gaza-ceasefire-deal-what-we-know-and-whats-next\">ceasefire</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s resumption of control over imperial “counterterror” operations has been characterised by even less restraint this time around, as his newly rebranded <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/us-department-of-defense-to-be-renamed-department-of-war-report\">Department of War</a> goes about <a href=\"/opinions/2025/9/8/distraction-101-blow-them-up\">blowing up boats</a> willy-nilly off the coast of Venezuela and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/five-killed-as-us-military-destroys-two-more-vessels-in-pacific-ocean\">extrajudicially murdering</a> the folks on board.</p><p>Whereas during the old Bush-Cheney days the US at least concerned itself with presenting a semi-coherent narrative to justify aggression abroad, Trump can hardly be bothered to waste too much time constructing a veneer of legality, preferring instead to randomly fling about absurd allegations of Venezuelan “narcoterrorism” and oil “<a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">theft</a>”.</p><p>Now, US military might is becoming increasingly harnessed to the whims of a man whose spontaneous and haphazard <a href=\"/opinions/2025/6/22/by-bombing-iran-the-us-continues-to-make-the-world-safe-for-war\">bombing of Iran</a>, Yemen, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/trump-says-us-launched-large-scale-attacks-on-isil-in-syria\">Syria</a>, and elsewhere mimics his pathological <a href=\"/opinions/2025/10/13/what-trump-said-and-did-not-say-at-the-knesset\">stream-of-consciousness style of discourse</a>.</p><p>And as we embark on the second quarter of a 21st century that is already defined by the catastrophic legacy of US militarism, one cannot help but recall those unfortunate “marching orders” that started it all: “My fellow Americans, let’s roll.”</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Another year has passed, and life in Gaza is still trapped between Israel’s killing machine and the growing indifference of the world. It is another year added to our unique calendar of loss, destruction and death.</p><p>In March, I wrote about my fears that Israel might go even further in its genocidal drive than what it had already done. And it did. Israel went beyond even my darkest expectations, reaching an unimaginable level of evil. That evil marked the whole year for us in Gaza.</p><p>As I see many people posting recaps of their favourite 2025 moments, I thought I’d share my own version. Here’s what this year looked like for me.</p><p>It started with a 45-day ceasefire; the short respite from the bombs was not even enough for us to mentally process the 15 months of nonstop killing and destruction that preceded it.</p><p>In February, I met many of the Palestinian captives who were set free as part of the truce and listened to the horror stories they recounted about their time being forcibly disappeared by the Israeli army. Among then was my high school teacher, Antar al-Agha. When I first saw him, I could not believe it was him. He was so pale and gaunt that he couldn’t stretch his arm to shake my hand.</p><p>He told me about the long time he spent in what they called the “scabies room” in the Israeli detention centre – a room designated to be an incubator for scabies. “At one dawn, I was finally allowed to wash my hands, but it didn’t turn out to be a relief for me. Once the water touched my hand, the skin started to peel as if it were a hot boiled potato. The blood burst from all over my hands. I can still feel the pain,” he recounted.</p><p>In March, Israel resumed the genocide, killing more than 400 people in a single blow in the middle of that month. It blocked all crossings into the Strip.</p><p>In April, the first signs of mass starvation started appearing.</p><p>In May, the Israeli army forcibly displaced me and my family from our house in eastern Khan Younis.</p><p>By the end of that month, Israel orchestrated a new creative form of mass murder and humiliation, cynically calling it the “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation”. Launched with the help of the United States, this entity started distributing food to starved Palestinians in the form of “hunger games”.</p><p>In June, because of extreme hunger, I, too, went to a GHF point. There, I saw my people crawling on the blazing hot sand to get food. I saw a young man protect himself from bullets by taking cover behind another person. I saw young men stabbing each other to death over a kilo of flour.</p><p>In July, the Israeli army flattened my house, along with my entire neighbourhood.</p><p>In August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) officially confirmed that Gaza was experiencing famine. By then, there was nothing left for us to eat, not even flour. We were making thin-layered bread by grinding red lentils or rice bird feed. A piece of that was my only meal for the day.</p><p>In September, the Israeli army ordered another mass displacement from northern Gaza to the south, throwing hundreds of thousands into the misery of having to relocate yet again.</p><p>In October, another ceasefire agreement was announced. By then, I had no energy to feel anything. I had already been consumed by grief over losing many of my relatives and close friends, my home and my entire city. I lost both of my freelance content writing contracts as I couldn’t keep up with work due to the inhumane conditions of displacement.</p><p>Deep down, I knew that Israel would not abide by its side of the truce deal, and this wouldn’t be the final thread of loss.</p><p>In November, my suspicions were confirmed. Israel continued to bomb us. The genocide was just transformed from a high, loud and intense campaign of killing into a quieter version. The Israeli land-grabbing continued, with the so-called “yellow line” constantly expanding and swallowing more and more land, including what remained of my neighbourhood. That month, the world’s indifference was made even more apparent with governments refusing to condemn Israel’s ceasefire violations and instead showering it with rewards, like a $35bn gas deal.</p><p>In December, the cruel winter hit, flooding tents and collapsing buildings. Babies started dying of hypothermia.</p><p>If I were able to remove from my memory one event of this year of misery, it would be my trip to the GHF site. The scenes I saw there were what I believe is peak level of evil. I still cannot shake off the feeling of fear when I walk by places that I passed on my way to the GHF site and on the way back.</p><p>Today, as I wander the rain-flooded narrow alleys of my tent camp, I ask myself: What makes all these people keep clinging onto life after losing their homes, jobs, and loved ones?</p><p>For all I know, it’s not hope; it’s a mixture of helplessness and surrender to fate.</p><p>Perhaps it is because in Gaza, time has frozen. Here, the past, the present, and the future happen simultaneously.</p><p>Time here is not an arrow – it does not fly. It is a circle that merges beginnings and ends, and between them lie infinite episodes of horrifying agony.</p><p>Similar to the fundamental laws of physics, which make no distinction between the past and the present, tragedy in Gaza makes no distinction either.</p><p>A movement of a pendulum from right to left is the same movement in the opposite direction, with the same energy and momentum. Unless we initiate the process, the past and future would not be identifiable.</p><p>Recently, I started entertaining the idea of retrocausality in Gaza, where the future affects the past, or where the effect occurs before the cause. Watching buildings collapse on their own, I imagine how Israeli planes bomb them sometime in the future, but we see them disintegrate now.</p><p>Of course, one would argue that buildings are still collapsing in Gaza because they were already damaged by Israeli bombardment. But it is also true that Israel keeps bombing what Palestinians rebuild. The same building would be bombed and restored over and over again, so it is not too much of a stretch of the imagination to see how Palestinian rubble at present is destroyed in the future by an Israeli bomb.</p><p>As the world looks to a new year and a better future, we in Gaza dread what is to come. We are caught between a past we don’t dare to remember and a future we don’t dare to imagine.</p><p>We can’t even make New Year’s resolutions because we have no control over our lives.</p><p>I want to eat less sugar, but Israel might do this for me by blocking all food from entering Gaza again.</p><p>I want to learn how to swim, but Israel might shoot me if I set foot in the sea.</p><p>I want to replant my back yard, but I can’t even get near it.</p><p>I want to take my mother to Umrah, to visit Masjid al-Haram, the Great Mosque of Mecca, but Israel is not allowing us to travel.</p><p>Probably the only New Year’s resolution I can make is to get used to chilly showers; the lack of gas and firewood may make that wish that much easier to fulfil.</p><p>In Gaza, there is nothing to plan for, and there is everything to wish for.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Not one.</p><p>Every day, I meet women who are exhausted beyond words, whose bodies starve while their hearts refuse to give up. In Gaza, a mother’s love has become an act of resistance against Israeli oppression.</p><p>“I hold my baby close all night long, fearing the cold will take my child away from me, or the rain will sweep him away. I can’t sleep,” Suzan told me. She was displaced in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, surviving in a fragile tent for more than two years.</p><p>“We only have three blankets,” she continued. “We share them. It’s OK if I can’t warm myself. My children can’t survive this cold without them.”</p><p>I hear versions of this sentence everywhere I go. Mothers who erase themselves so their children can survive.</p><p>During the height of the famine, I witnessed unconditional love in the rawest of forms.</p><p>I will never forget how, without exception, every mother told me she deprived herself of food so her children could eat.</p><p>“I cut one flatbread into pieces for my sons and daughters,” Maysoun told me. “When they eat, it’s as if I ate.”</p><p>Maysoun is representative of the mothers of Gaza. Different faces, different stories, but the same sacrifice.</p><h2 id=\"every-cycle-a-nightmare\">Every cycle a nightmare</h2><p>For more than two years, displaced women have not been able to access toilets or privacy, deprived of safety and dignity. These women grew up sheltered, with safe spaces to pray, eat and wash. Sharing a toilet with 1,000 people is something you never become accustomed to.</p><p>They have to manage menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and illness while living in overcrowded shelters, tents, or the open air, without the basic necessities needed to sustain life.</p><p>I was not spared from this reality. I, too, couldn’t find sanitary pads or painkillers post-surgery.</p><p>Every menstrual cycle is a nightmare – a monthly reminder of how fragile dignity becomes in war. How pain becomes something we are expected to endure silently.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"thousands-were-widowed-during-the-war\">Thousands were widowed during the war</h2><p>Living without a husband adds another layer of vulnerability for many. Many women have told me how empty they feel after losing the love of their lives. Others describe the struggle of managing their families under relentless bombardment and displacement.</p><p>Widowhood in Gaza is not just loss – it is exposure, fear and isolation.</p><p>While the Israeli-US aid distribution point, GHF, was in operation, thousands of Palestinians were either shot or killed while waiting for aid.</p><p>The Israeli policy of preventing aid or commercial supplies from entry forced women to risk death while trying to secure food rations for their families.</p><p>Israeli-inflicted hunger pushed these women into kill zones. Many who went were injured. Many were killed.</p><p>Nearly everyone in Gaza is malnourished, including new mothers who struggle to breastfeed their newborns, despite their own bodies weakened after months of prolonged hunger.</p><p>Many are physically unable to produce milk, and with infant formula unavailable or unaffordable, mothers are forced to feed their babies with whatever they can find – choices no mother in Gaza had to make before the war began.</p><p>At Al-Aqsa Hospital, I met a woman with a bullet lodged in her stomach; she was shot at a GHF distribution point. While holding my gaze, she lifted her shirt and showed me her wound, asking if I thought the scar would disfigure her body. She continued to tell me of the pain of being stitched up without anaesthesia.</p><p>I was jerked back to my own memory of waking up after gall bladder surgery without painkillers.</p><p>I cried. I screamed. All I wanted was something to numb the pain, something to make it stop.</p><p>I thought of the many pregnant women I reported on, giving birth without anaesthesia, without pain relief, without even a clean room to give birth in.</p><p>Women screaming into the void, bringing life into the world while surrounded by death and destruction. And to think, if there were enough political will among Israel’s Western allies, none of this would be happening.</p><p>There are more untold stories that must be told. Rasha, a breast cancer patient waiting endlessly for the Rafah crossing to open so she could leave Gaza for treatment, told me she believed she had developed cancer after being trapped under the rubble of her bombed-out home for hours.</p><p>“I inhaled all the toxins, all the dust,” she said, tears streaming down her sunken face. “This is why I think I have breast cancer now. I was healthy before this war.”</p><p>And while I continue to report on the horrors faced by the women of Gaza, I, too, feel like my own erasure. I try to provide whatever solace I can, but I know my words cannot provide the comfort these women need, the relief they deserve.</p><p>How do you respond to that as a reporter?</p><p>Another woman who will never leave my mind is Hala, who miscarried while being forcibly displaced from the north to the south.</p><p>“I was pregnant with twins,” she told me. “I miscarried one and saved the other.”</p><p>She paused. “I was bleeding the whole way, while carrying my belongings. I was forced to pack up whatever I could from our home and flee or risk death by bombardment.”</p><p>I remember her voice – how it trembled but did not break.</p><p>I remember how helpless I felt standing in front of her, my only weapon my notebook, my camera, my voice.</p><p>Everywhere I go, I carry the voices of these women with me.</p><p>They echo in my head and my heart. I hear them when I try to sleep, and when I report on air. I hear them when I am silent.</p><p>Every woman I met entrusted me with her pain, her story, her truth. And none of them will ever leave my mind. I will carry them with me for the rest of my days.</p><p>Because to be a woman in Gaza is to endure the unendurable – and to keep loving anyway.</p></div></div></body></html>"
