            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For many years before becoming president, Donald Trump publicly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cheney-criticism-insurrection-capitol-election-cc4b74dcb34f1df516aa89169a8650d5\">criticised</a> the George W Bush administration over its decision to launch the war on Iraq. And yet, today, in his second term as president, he finds himself presiding over a military debacle that is quite reminiscent of Bush’s.</p><p>Trump ordered a military intervention to remove an antagonistic foreign leader, based on a flimsy argument of national security, with the goal of accessing that country’s oil. In both cases, we see a naive confidence that the United States can simply achieve its goals through regime change. US intervention into Venezuela reeks of the same <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hubris-Inside-Story-Scandal-Selling/dp/0307346811\">hubris</a> that surrounded the Iraq invasion two decades ago.</p><p>Yet there are also important differences to consider. The most important distinguishing feature of the operation in Venezuela is its lack of an overarching vision. On Saturday after Trump finished an hour-long news conference alongside his secretaries of defence and state, it was not clear what the plan was for Venezuela going forward, or if there was a plan at all. His statements threatening more attacks in the following days brought no clarity either.</p><p>Past instances of US-led regime change fit into the larger ideological visions of the incumbent US commander-in-chief. In 1823, President James Monroe declared the Western Hemisphere off-limits to European colonialism. As the United States spent the 20th century consolidating its sphere of influence across the Americas, the Monroe Doctrine would justify various interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Cold War added new justifications for the United States to overthrow leftist regimes and install friendly governments in the Americas.</p><p>As the Cold War ended, President George HW Bush sought to serve as a caretaker for a “new world order” in which the US had emerged as the world’s lone superpower. When Bush sent troops to Somalia in 1992 and his successor Bill Clinton reversed a military coup in Haiti in 1994, they did so under the paradigm of “humanitarian intervention”. When George W Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, it was done under the umbrella of the post-9/11 “war on terror”. When President Barack Obama intervened against the forces of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, he was guided by the “<a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/19/remarks-president-libya\">responsibility to protect</a>” doctrine concerning civilians in danger.</p><p>But in the case of the US attack on Venezuela, there has been no ideological justification. Trump and his team have haphazardly thrown around references to humanitarianism, counterterrorism and more to justify the attack. The president even brought up the Monroe Doctrine. But just as it seemed that he was grounding his foreign policy in a larger ideology, albeit one borrowed from two centuries ago, he made a joke of the concept.</p><p>“The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal,” Trump explained on Saturday. “But we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a lot. They now call it the Donroe Doctrine.” Trump did not make up this pun; it was used by the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/january-8-2025/\">New York Post</a> a year ago to describe Trump’s aggressive foreign policy as he threatened to annex Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal.</p><p>The president’s decision to embrace the tongue-in-cheek term illustrates a disturbing reality of his foreign policy: Any notion that he is promoting an ideological vision is a joke.</p><p>The truth is Trump is pursuing an increasingly aggressive and militaristic foreign policy in his second term, not because he wants to impose a grand vision, but because he has discovered he can get away with it.</p><p>Striking a variety of foreign “bad guys” who have little capacity to fight back – ISIL (ISIS) affiliates in Nigeria who are “persecuting” Christians and “narcoterrorists” in Latin America – appeals to members of Trump’s base.</p><p>After he mentioned the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua during Saturday’s news conference, he went on a minutes-long tangent to brag about his military interventions into US cities. While the president’s inability to stay on topic may be concerning for those questioning his health and mental fitness, this digression into domestic affairs had some relevance for his Venezuelan intervention, at least as far as he was concerned: His increasingly militarised war on drugs and crime abroad justifies an increasingly militarised war on drugs and crime at home.</p><p>Past presidents have used US power to pursue a wide variety of ideologies and principles. Trump appears to be paying lip service to past ideologies to justify the use of US power. Many times, the “good” intentions of previous  presidents paved the way to hellish outcomes for the peoples who found themselves on the receiving end of US intervention. But those intentions at least created a level of predictability and consistency for the foreign policies of various US administrations.</p><p>Trump, by contrast, seems driven solely by immediate political concerns and short-term prospects for glory and profit. If there is a saving grace of such an unprincipled foreign policy, it may be the ephemeral nature of interventions conducted without an overarching vision. An unprincipled approach to military intervention does not foster the kind of ideological commitment that has led other presidents to engage in long-term interventions like the Iraq occupation.</p><p>But it also means that Trump could conceivably use military intervention to settle any international dispute or to pursue any ostensibly profitable goal – say assuming control of Greenland from Denmark.</p><p>Last year, he decided <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/how-are-countries-and-markets-reacting-to-trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were a potent tool for asserting his interests and started applying them almost indiscriminately on allies and adversaries alike. Now that Trump has grown comfortable using the US military to achieve a range of goals – profit, gunboat diplomacy, distraction from domestic scandals, etc – the danger is that he will grow similarly haphazard in his use of force.</p><p>That does not bode well for the US nor for the rest of the world. At a time when multiple global crises are overlapping – climate, conflict and impoverishment – the last thing the world needs is a trigger-happy superpower without a clear strategy or a day-after plan.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 50 people, most of them Muslims, were killed in the worst violence in Delhi since the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.</p><p>In response, the police filed 758 criminal cases for investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. The Delhi Police, accused of bias against Muslims, blamed peaceful protest leaders, many of them young Muslim activists, of hatching a conspiracy to create religious tensions and to topple the elected government – a claim rubbished by legal and rights experts. At least 18 student leaders and activists were arrested in a case that came to be known as the “main conspiracy case”.</p><p>The students and activists were charged under an “anti-terror” law called the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which makes it virtually impossible to secure bail. This law allows authorities to declare individuals “terrorists” and detain them without trial for months, sometimes years.</p><p>India’s police have been accused of increasingly using “anti-terror” laws against marginalised people, including Muslims.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4216158\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4216158\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4216158\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2020-01-19T164355Z_2015526395_RC24JE9NIWKT_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-CITIZENSHIP-PROTESTS-1767610405.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C487&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"delhi riots\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4216158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Demonstrators attend a protest against a new citizenship law in Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, India, on January 19, 2020 [Danish Siddiqui/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-the-accused\">Who are the accused?</h2><p>Of the 18 students and activists arrested in the conspiracy case, six were released on bail over the years.</p><p>Today, the Supreme Court is deciding on the bail of seven of the defendants.

It [can only be] in defence of a prosecuted people … to prevent genocide, to prevent crimes against humanity,” Barakat said.</p><p>In Iraq, a US-led coalition invoked what turned out to be unfounded allegations of weapons of mass destruction as justification to <a href=\"/news/2023/5/1/the-us-war-on-terror-20-years-after-mission-accomplished\">invade the country</a> and topple President Saddam Hussein without initial UN authorisation.</p><p>Yet “when they captured [Hussein], they did not attempt to extract him from Iraq. They tried him inside Iraq,” he said.</p><p>Post‑9/11, Barakat said, international law has allowed cross‑border actions against “terrorist groups” when such actions are used to prevent “terrorist operations” in the acting state’s territory.</p><p>When Israeli Prime Minister <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/29/this-is-what-happened-after-recent-netanyahu-meetings-with-us-presidents\">Benjamin Netanyahu visited Trump</a> for New Year’s Eve, there were discussions between the pair attempting to link Maduro to Iran, Hezbollah and Palestinian groups in the hopes he could be labelled under the US Terrorism Act, which Barakat called tenuous attempts to “borrow” legitimacy from existing counterterrorism mechanisms.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"jurisdictional-hook\">Jurisdictional hook?</h2><p>International law regards military action on the territory of another state without its consent as a violation of that state’s sovereignty, Barakat said.</p><p>In some conflicts, intervening states justified their actions by asserting consent from a sovereign state, such as in Syria, where operations against ISIL (ISIS) were presented as occurring with the Syrian government’s blessing, he said.</p><p>In Venezuela, the US is instead leaning on a US domestic court indictment from 2020, accusing Maduro of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye\">drug trafficking as a jurisdictional hook</a>.</p><p>But using a US indictment to justify abducting a foreign head of state from his country is problematic, Barakat said. N<span>ormally, a suspect is detained in the state asserting jurisdiction or extradited through Interpol and international agreements.</span></p><p>While Trump has shown “total disregard” for international law and backs Netanyahu, who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC), the US president is now citing ICC processes against Maduro, Barakat added.</p><p>The legality of the US abduction of Maduro will be under the spotlight at the UN Security Council on Monday, but Washington is unlikely to face strong criticism from its allies, who oppose Maduro.</p><p>Russia, China and other Venezuela allies have accused the US of violating international law. European states have called for respect of international law without calling out Washington.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"testing-the-limits-of-international-norms\">Testing the limits of international norms</h2><p>The Venezuela operation carries particular weight in the Middle East, where <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">Israel has conducted</a> abductions for decades, kidnapping individuals abroad (such as Nazi war criminals in Argentina) and trying them in Israel, Barakat said.</p><p>The analyst argued that Israel and the US learn from each other, with one’s impunity reinforcing the other’s confidence in justifying similar actions.</p><p>During Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, Netanyahu invoked US and British actions in Iraq and Afghanistan as precedents for using force against people he dubbed “terrorists”, Barakat explained.</p><p>“Now in the US, I think they will probably use the Israeli precedent as a justification for what they’ve done [in Venezuela],” he said.</p><p>By this logic, other states could also try to detain Israeli leaders for violations of international law. However, while several ICC member states said they would arrest Netanyahu in their countries, they lack the “guts” to conduct a US-style cross‑border extraction, Barakat said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US operation in Venezuela could give Russia and China justification for similar extraterritorial seizures, the analyst said.</p><p>“If I were [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, I would be now thinking, how can I get Zelensky?” said Barakat, adding that China could attempt something similar regarding Taiwan.</p><p>The precedent set in Venezuela fundamentally weakens the current international order, Barakat emphasised.</p><p>If China, as an emerging global power, responds to global crises militarily rather than through economic influence as it has been or if more states pursue nuclear weapons, a genuinely new world order – possibly bipolar and more confrontational – could emerge, the professor said.</p><p>“I think that it seems the only way to independent politics is to have a nuclear weapon. Then things will change dramatically.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Maduro is to appear before US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein.</p><p>A court spokesperson told NBC News that Flores, who is also listed as a defendant in a US indictment unsealed on Saturday, will appear in court on Monday as well.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-charges\">What are the charges?</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1422326/dl\">indictment</a>, the US accuses Maduro of being at the forefront of corruption to “use his illegally obtained authority” to “transport thousands of tons of cocaine” to the US with his coconspirators.</p><p>Additionally, the indictment alleges that Maduro has “tarnished” every public office he has held. It adds that Maduro “allows cocaine-fueled corruption to flourish for his own benefit, for the benefit of members of his ruling regime, and for the benefit of his family members”.</p><p>Maduro faces four counts:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Count 1, narcoterrorism conspiracy:</strong> US prosecutors say Maduro and his coconspirators knowingly provided something of financial value to US-designated “foreign terrorist organizations” and their members. The indictment lists these <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/why-has-mexico-handed-over-drug-cartel-leaders-to-us-who-are-they\">organisations</a> as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a leftist rebel group that signed a peace deal in 2016 but has dissidents who refused to lay down their arms and are still involved in the drug trade; Segunda Marquetalia, the largest dissident FARC group; National Liberation Army, another leftist Colombian rebel group; Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel; Los Zetas/Cartel del Noreste, another Mexican drug cartel; and Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang.</li>\n<li><strong>Count 2, cocaine importation conspiracy: </strong>It accuses Maduro and his codefendants of conspiring to manufacture, distribute and import cocaine into the US.</li>\n<li><strong>Count 3, possession of machineguns and destructive devices: </strong>The indictment accuses the defendants of possessing, carrying and using machineguns in relation to the above drug‑trafficking counts.</li>\n<li><strong>Count 4, conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices: </strong>It further accuses the defendants of conspiring to use, carry and possess those weapons in furtherance of drug trafficking.</li>\n</ul><p>The indictment also says Maduro and his codefendants should forfeit to the US government any proceeds and assets obtained from the alleged crimes.</p><h2 id=\"is-there-evidence-for-these-charges\">Is there evidence for these charges?</h2><p>There is <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">little evidence</a> that drugs are trafficked from Venezuela on a large scale. The 2023 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime World Drug Report said global cocaine production hit a record of 3,708 tonnes, up nearly one‑third from 2022, with most coca cultivation taking place in Colombia, followed by Peru and Bolivia.</p><p>Trafficking routes into the US in 2023-2024 primarily passed through Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, not Venezuela, although it does serve as a minor transit corridor for Colombian cocaine moving into the eastern Caribbean.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-named-in-the-indictment\">Who is named in the indictment?</h2><h3>Maduro</h3><p>Maduro, 63, who became Venezuela’s president in 2013, was declared the winner of 2024’s election. His re-election was rejected as fraudulent by the US and independent observers, such as the Carter Center. A UN expert panel said the 2024 vote failed to meet international standards.</p><p>Nine Latin American countries called for a review of the results with independent oversight.</p><p>Maduro defended the election results and accused his opponents of undermining the country’s sovereignty.</p><p>Since returning to the White House nearly a year ago, US President Donald Trump has expanded sanctions and punitive measures against Maduro and senior officials in his government.</p><p>The Trump administration ramped up military pressure starting in August when it deployed warships and thousands of its service members in the Caribbean near Venezuela. It has since carried out dozens of air strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats, killing more than 100 people.</p><p>Maduro has pushed back by mobilising Venezuelan military personnel.</p><p>During this time, the Caracas-based news network <a href=\"https://www.globovision.com/nacional/43343/maduro-denuncio-que-eeuu-se-dedica-a-fabricar-mentiras-extravagantes-estrafalarias-y-estramboticas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Globovision</a> quoted Maduro as saying: “From the north, the empire has gone mad and, like a rotten rehash, has renewed its threats to the peace and stability of Venezuela.”</p><p>But a day before Saturday’s US attack on the country, Maduro had offered to hold talks to combat drug trafficking.</p><h3>Flores</h3><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/who-is-cilia-flores-venezuelas-first-combatant\">Flores</a>, 69, has been married to Maduro since 2013.</p><p>Known as the “first combatant” rather than first lady, Flores is a veteran lawyer and politician who rose to prominence by defending future President Hugo Chavez after his failed 1992 coup. She helped secure his release and later became a key Chavismo figure and the first woman to preside over Venezuela’s National Assembly. Chavismo, which promotes socialism and anti-imperialist politics, is the political movement started by Chavez, Maduro’s mentor.</p><p>The indictment accuses Flores of joining Maduro’s cocaine importation conspiracy.</p><h3>Other defendants</h3><p>The indictment names four other people as Maduro’s coconspirators, namely Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela’s interior minister; Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, former Venezuelan interior minister; Nicolas Maduro Guerra, Maduro’s son and a Venezuelan politician; and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, the leader of Tren de Aragua, which was designated as a “foreign terrorist organization” by the US in February. But most experts do not define Tren de Aragua as a “terrorist organisation”.</p><p>It is not clear yet who will represent Maduro, Flores and the other defendants.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-the-judge\">Who is the judge?</h2><p>Hellerstein was born in 1933 in New York. He was appointed to the federal bench in 1998 by former President Bill Clinton.</p><p>He is likely on Monday to advise Maduro and Flores about their rights and ask them if they want to enter a plea.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-at-stake\">What’s at stake?</h2><p>Maduro’s freedom is primarily at stake. If convicted, he could face 30 years to life in prison.</p><p>“This is less about Maduro as it is about access to Venezuela’s oil deposits,” Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera. “This is the number one target. Trump is not content with just allowing US oil firms to get concessions but to ‘run’ the country, which entails absolute and indefinite control over Venezuela’s resources.”</p><p>Venezuela’s oil reserves are concentrated primarily in the Orinoco Belt, a region in the eastern part of the country stretching across roughly 55,000sq km (21,235sq miles).</p><p>While the country is home to the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a> – at an estimated 303 billion barrels as of 2023 – it earns <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">only a fraction</a> of the revenue it once did from exporting crude due to mismanagement and US sanctions.</p><p>Last month, Trump accused Venezuela in a post on his Truth Social platform of “stealing” US oil, land and other assets and using that oil to fund crime, “terrorism” and human trafficking.</p><p>Trump repeated his false claims after Maduro’s arrest. During a news conference on Saturday, Trump said the US would “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be carried out.</p><p>“Given the opposition of all South American states, save for Argentina, to US dominance in the region, Trump’s plan requires a vast military deployment. We need to see how countries like Brazil and Colombia react to this, including also BRICS,” said Bantekas from Hamad Bin Khalifa University.</p><p>In a joint statement released on Sunday, the governments of Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay said the US actions in Venezuela “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population”.</p><h2 id=\"was-maduro-s-abduction-legal\">Was Maduro’s abduction legal?</h2><p id=\"this-case-is-unusual-because-there-are-key-questions-about-how-maduro-was-captured-and-whether-that-was-legal-maduro-was-captured-during-a-us-military-operation-in-venezuelan-capital-caracas\">This case is unusual because there are questions about how Maduro was captured and whether it was legal. Russia, China and other Venezuelan allies have accused the US of violating international law.</p><p>“If there was an armed conflict between Venezuela and the USA and, given that Maduro is the head of his country’s armed forces, then he would be a legitimate target,” Bantekas said.</p><p>“However, under the circumstances, there is no armed conflict between the two countries, and in the absence of an armed attack by Venezuela against the US, the latter’s invasion in Venezuela violates article 2(4) of the UN Charter, as does the abduction of the country’s president. It is a blatant act of aggression.”</p><p>Article 2(4) of the UN Charter bars UN members from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.</p><p>A UN Security Council meeting on Monday will discuss the legality of the US abduction of Maduro.</p><p>“Given that Maduro is already in US custody and in the USA, it is in the interests of all parties that he appear before a court. At the very least, Maduro can challenge the legality of his arrest and the jurisdiction of the court,” Bantekas said.</p><p>“The court itself has an obligation to decide if it has jurisdiction and as a preliminary issue decide whether Maduro enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution. If these issues are dispensed, the court nonetheless finds that it has jurisdiction and that Maduro does not enjoy immunity, then the prosecution must prove its case.”</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>The Trump administration has not explicitly stated a clear plan for Venezuela, and analysts said it has sent out confusing signals.</p><p>In an interview with NBC News on Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that Washington will not govern Venezuela on a day-to-day basis. He also told ABC News the US would “set the conditions” to ensure that Venezuela is no longer a “narcotrafficking paradise”.</p><p>On the same day, Trump told reporters that the US is ready to carry out a second military strike on Venezuela if its government refuses to cooperate with his plan to “resolve” the situation there.</p><p>Interim President Delcy Rodriguez could “pay a very big price” if she “does not do what’s right”, Trump said.</p><p>A day earlier, Trump said Rodriguez had told Rubio that she would do what the US needs her to do. “She really doesn’t have a choice,” Trump said.</p><p>On Monday, Rodriguez offered to cooperate with Trump. In a statement posted on social media, she invited Trump to “collaborate” and sought “respectful relations”.</p><p>“President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war,” she wrote.</p><p>Her conciliatory tone came a day after she appeared on state TV declaring that Maduro was still Venezuela’s sole legitimate president.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For oil markets, the response has been muted. For the Middle East and North Africa, the implications run deeper, touching on energy security, geopolitical precedent and the uncomfortable question of whether oil still reshapes the world order in the way it once did.</p><h2 id=\"oil-riches-and-production-ruin\">Oil riches and production ruin</h2><p>Venezuela sits atop an estimated <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">303 billion barrels</a> of proven oil reserves, about 17 percent of the global total and more than Saudi Arabia, whose reserves stand at about 267 billion barrels.</p><p>Yet, oil production by the two nations tells a starkly different story.</p><p>According to data from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Venezuela produced 934,000 barrels per day in November, less than 1 percent of global demand and a shadow of the more than 3 million barrels a day it used to pump in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p>The drop-off began under former President Hugo Chavez and carried on with Maduro. Then came <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/us-imposes-more-sanctions-on-tankers-transporting-venezuelan-oil\">US sanctions</a> in January 2019 on Maduro’s second inauguration as president.</p><p>The sanctions were aimed at forcing a change in Venezuela’s government. Their core mechanism was to sever the state’s oil income by closing a critical loophole – oil-for-debt swaps – that triggered the final, steep collapse of the country’s economy and oil industry.</p><p>The US also imposed a full embargo on all transactions with the PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, threatening secondary sanctions on any foreign entity doing business with it. The sanctions halted oil exports to Venezuela’s key remaining markets like India and the European Union, and prevented the import of diluent chemicals needed to process Venezuela’s heavy crude.</p><p>So when the Venezuelan government was starved of its source of hard currency, it resorted to having the central bank print more money, triggering a wave of hyperinflation that obliterated salaries and savings. The ensuing humanitarian crisis was a primary driver behind the mass exodus of nearly 8 million Venezuelans that began in 2019.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Carole Nakhle, CEO of Crystol Energy, an energy advisory firm, said Venezuela’s oil industry was already hollowed out long before the sanctions.</p><p>“The collapse predates sanctions,” she told Al Jazeera. “Chronic mismanagement, politicisation and underinvestment weakened the industry long before restrictions were imposed. Sanctions then accelerated and deepened the decline by restricting finance, operations and market access.”</p><p>Years of capital flight, loss of technical expertise and decaying infrastructure left PDVSA struggling to maintain even basic operations.</p><h2 id=\"why-didn-t-the-markets-panic\">Why didn’t the markets panic?</h2><p>Despite the US military intervention, oil prices fell. Brent crude slipped to about $60 a barrel while West Texas intermediate (WTI) dropped below $58. On Monday, oil stocks dipped in the Asian markets as investors weighed the impact of the US abduction of Maduro.</p><p>The explanation behind the drop lies in oversupply.</p><p>New barrels are entering the market from Brazil, Guyana, Argentina and the US. OPEC+ has begun unwinding voluntary cuts totalling nearly 4 million barrels a day while the International Energy Agency projected supply could exceed demand by as much as 2 million barrels per day in 2026.</p><p>The markets’ lack of reaction allows the US intervention to be framed as a clean, surgical and necessary act. It masks the long-term reality.</p><p>Rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry is the work of a decade, requiring hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and technological transfers that its new US-aligned managers will be eager to provide. When those barrels finally come, they will aim to structurally weaken OPEC+ and, as some analysts predicted, deliberately crash prices to cripple rivals like Russia.</p><p>Cornelia Meyer, chairperson and chief economist of LBV Asset Management, said expectations of a near-term Venezuelan shock are misplaced.</p><p>“Even a full return of sanctioned Venezuelan barrels would represent less than 1 percent of global supply,” she told Al Jazeera. “Markets would absorb it rather than be flooded by it.”</p><h2 id=\"the-kind-of-oil-that-still-matters\">The ‘kind of oil’ that still matters</h2><p>Yet Venezuela’s significance is not about volume alone. It is about quality.</p><p>Most Venezuelan crude is “heavy”, similar to that from Canada’s tar sands. Many US Gulf Coast refineries were originally built to process this type of oil. While some have adapted over time, heavy crude remains critical to the US refining system.</p><p>Despite being the world’s largest oil producer, the US still imports large quantities of crude. About 70 percent of US crude imports are heavy oil, and roughly 60 percent of that comes from Canada.</p><p>Nakhle noted that this is where Venezuela could re-enter the system – slowly.</p><p>“A meaningful short-term increase is unlikely,” she said. “Activity is largely limited to stabilising existing output. Any material growth would require sustained capital, technology transfer and institutional reform.”</p><p>Not everyone shares that caution.</p><p>Tony Franjie, head of energy fundamentals at SynMax Intelligence, believes the US intervention will fundamentally change the trajectory of the oil market.</p><p>“I would not underestimate the ability of US oil companies to increase Venezuelan production faster than anyone predicts,” he told Al Jazeera. “Chevron will be the main player, and these refineries were built for Venezuelan crude.”</p><p>“Get ready for sub-$50 WTI,” he said. “The oil market is already oversupplied, and this just adds pressure.”</p><p>Franjie argued that Venezuela’s return could push oil prices sharply lower and Canada would be the biggest casualty.</p><p>Meyer, however, remained sceptical. “Upstream production is not a light switch,” she cautioned. “Even with political change, infrastructure constraints do not disappear overnight.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4215711\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4215711\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4215711\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-US-Venezuela-relations-in-2025-JAN-4-2026-1767593147.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - US-Venezuela relations in 2025 - JAN 4, 2026-1767593147\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4215711\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-the-middle-east\">What does it mean for the Middle East?</h2><p>For oil markets, Venezuela is a footnote in an age of abundance. For the Middle East, it is a reminder that interventions rarely stay contained and oil, while diminished, still pulls geopolitics in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye\">dangerous directions</a>.</p><p>For Middle Eastern producers, increased Venezuela production does not pose an immediate threat.</p><p>Countries like Saudi Arabia and Iraq operate at a scale Venezuela cannot match in the foreseeable future. Even optimistic projections would leave Venezuelan production too small to materially affect Middle Eastern export strategies.</p><p>What matters more is the “precedent” the US action sets.</p><p>Interventions in Iraq and Libya triggered long-term instability that rippled across the region. Venezuela, with a population of 30 million people, risks a similar fate.</p><p>Nakhle warned that instability, not oil supply, is the real risk.</p><p>“Markets can handle Venezuelan barrels,” she said. “They cannot easily price prolonged political disorder.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"beyond-oil-strategic-undercurrents\">Beyond oil: Strategic undercurrents</h2><p>Washington has insisted the Venezuela operation was not just about energy.</p><p>China controls more than 90 percent of the global refining capacity for rare earth minerals. China has deep economic ties to Venezuela, backing PDVSA financially and embedding itself in mining operations producing critical minerals used in advanced weapons systems.</p><p>Iran reportedly established drone manufacturing facilities on Venezuelan soil while Russia deployed military advisers – developments that align closely with the threats outlined in Trump’s 2025 US National Security Strategy, which marks a shift from post-Cold War US policy because it rejects global hegemony for an America First realism.</p><p>From Washington’s perspective, Venezuela has become a strategic outpost for rival powers in the traditional US sphere of influence.</p><p>The intervention has revived longstanding claims that challenges to the dollar-denominated oil trade invite US retaliation. Venezuela had increasingly accepted yuan and other currencies for crude while seeking closer alignment with the BRICS bloc, which includes Russia and China.</p><p>But experts cautioned against overstating this. Oil today trades in multiple currencies, and the dollar’s dominance rests more on financial depth and trust than enforcement.</p><p>As Meyer put it: “The petrodollar is evolving, not collapsing. Venezuela alone cannot end it.”</p><p>Trump said US companies will help rebuild Venezuela’s oil industry. History and his country’s track record offer little reassurance.</p><p>Iraq and Libya are proof that a change in government does not guarantee a recovery. Oil infrastructure takes years to rebuild. Institutions take even longer.</p><p>Venezuela’s reserves remain underground. Whether they become a source of stability – or another chapter in oil’s long history of conflict – is far from settled.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Some also see it as a potential sign of easing restrictions.</p><p>But fears remain strong. Many worry the opening will be limited and temporary, benefitting only a few.

Its estimated output was 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, less than 1 percent of the world’s total, compared with 3.7 million bpd during peak production in 1970.</p><p>The oil sector’s decline has been blamed on the combined effects of US sanctions and years of underinvestment, mismanagement and corruption under Maduro and his left-wing predecessor, Hugo Chavez.</p><p>While the Trump administration could boost supply in the short term by lifting sanctions, restoring Venezuela’s output to anything near peak levels would require huge investment and likely take years, according to energy analysts.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"venezuela-s-oil-infrastructure-is-in-poor-shape\">‘Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is in poor shape’</h2><p>Oil prices moved only slightly in trading on Monday amid market expectations that output would remain largely unchanged for the foreseeable future.</p><p>“Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is in poor shape overall, due to lack of maintenance for both equipment and oilfield wells,” Scott Montgomery, a global energy expert at the University of Washington, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The state oil company, PDVSA, is well known to suffer from corruption and lack of expertise – many well-trained people have left the country to work elsewhere – and has been unable to invest in the country’s petroleum sector,” Montgomery added.</p><p>Thomas O’Donnell, an energy and geopolitical analyst based in Berlin, Germany, estimated that Venezuela could return to peak production in five to seven years in the “absolute best” circumstances, including a peaceful transfer of power.</p><p>“Longer term, if things are sorted out, yes, Venezuela can become one of the world’s biggest producers of oil. As far as how long that takes, that has all to do with the transition and what is put in place to manage that – both the country’s security and also to manage the investments,” O’Donnell told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"mixed-messaging-from-trump-administration\">Mixed messaging from Trump administration</h2><p>Trump’s administration has provided conflicting messages on Washington’s exact plans for Venezuela and its oil reserves.</p><p>On Saturday, Trump said the US would “run” Venezuela and that US oil companies were ready to invest billions of dollars to build up the country’s dilapidated infrastructure and “get the oil flowing”.</p><p>In interviews with US media on Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to downplay Trump’s remarks about controlling the country, saying the president was referring to “running policy” and his plans related to spurring private investment, “not securing the oilfields”.</p><p>Trump later on Sunday said Washington was “in charge” of the country and was “dealing with” members of the acting administration without providing details.</p><p>Under international law, the US has no claim of ownership over Venezuela’s oil reserves, as sovereign states possess the right to control and use their natural resources under the United Nations-endorsed Principle of Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources.</p><p>Foreign investors, however, can claim compensation when authorities seize their assets.</p><p>ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were awarded $1.6bn and $8.7bn, respectively, in international arbitration following the Chavez government’s 2007 nationalisation of the oil sector. Caracas did not pay out in either case.</p><p>US oil giants, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips, have not commented directly on Trump’s claims about planned investments in Venezuela.</p><p>Chevron is the only large US oil company currently operating in Venezuela, the result of an exemption to US sanctions first granted by the administration of former President Joe Biden.</p><p>Consultancy Rystad Energy, based in Oslo, Norway, has estimated that Venezuela’s oil sector would need about $110bn in capital investment to return to its mid-2010s output of about 2 million bpd.</p><p>Patrick De Haan, an analyst at energy price tracker GasBuddy, said companies may be reluctant to commit to large investments in the country when global oil prices are hovering around $60 a barrel due to a glut of supply.</p><p>“It will take a longer amount of time than many likely realise. Oil companies in a low-priced environment of today would likely be cautious investing billions with oil prices already low,” De Haan told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“In addition, Trump seizing Maduro could lead to loyalists sabotaging efforts to increase output. A lot would have to go right to yield the most optimistic timelines.”</p><p>US companies are likely to carefully weigh political developments in Venezuela following their experiences with the Chavez government’s expropriation of their assets.</p><p>“Oil companies are not likely to rush into a situation where the state is in turmoil, security is lacking, and no clear path forward for political stability exists,” the University of Washington’s Montgomery said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"maduro-due-in-court-in-new-york\">Maduro due in court in New York</h2><p>Interim President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a>, who was Maduro’s deputy, is now leading the country following a ruling by Venezuela’s Supreme Court.</p><p>Maduro is scheduled to appear in a New York court on Monday to face charges related to alleged drug trafficking and working with criminal gangs.</p><p>Venezuela’s government has condemned the Trump administration over Saturday’s bombing and overthrow of Maduro, labelling his capture a “cowardly kidnapping”.</p><p>Russia, China, Iran and Brazil, among other countries, have accused Washington of violating international law, while nations including Israel, Argentina and Greece have welcomed Maduro’s forced removal.</p><p>OPEC, which sets limits on production for its 12 members, including Venezuela, is another factor in the Latin American country’s potential oil output.</p><p>“Venezuela is a member of OPEC, and like many countries, may become more actively subject to quotas if output climbs,” De Haan said.</p><p>Phil Flynn, a market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said reviving Venezuela’s oil production would face “significant challenges”, but he was more bullish about the near-term prospects than other analysts.</p><p>He said the market could conceivably see a couple of hundred thousand more barrels a day coming online in the coming months.</p><p>“We’ve not had a free Venezuela, and sometimes the US energy industry has the capability to do a lot more than people give them credit for,” Flynn told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"
