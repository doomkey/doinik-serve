Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025, the fastest in two years.</p><p>“The shock and awe we anticipated just didn’t materialise,” Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Yaros said the limited fallout could be attributed to the relative lack of retaliation by other countries and the stock market rally that quickly followed Trump’s dialling back of the steepest tariffs announced on “<a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">liberation day</a>“.</p><p>Since Trump’s April 2 announcement, the stock market, which is heavily weighted towards the “magnificent seven” tech companies, has risen nearly 30 percent, boosting Americans’ paper wealth and encouraging households to loosen their purse strings.</p><p>Gains in net wealth have driven almost one-third of the rise in consumer spending since the COVID-19 pandemic, Oxford Economics said in a research briefing in October.</p><p>At the same time, the gains have not been distributed evenly.</p><p>The top 10 percent of earners are now estimated to account for roughly half of all spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics.</p><p>“The gains are going a lot to people in higher income brackets – they are the ones who have the stock portfolios – and are going to people in sectors and occupations tied to AI,” Marcus Noland, executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But, these numbers mask the unevenness in the growth in this economy.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"net-decline-of-workers\">Net decline of workers</h2><p>A careful parsing of the data reveals that unevenness. For instance, despite the impressive GDP numbers, that growth is not being accompanied by an increase in hiring.</p><p>While hospitality and healthcare added workers last year, retail, manufacturing and construction – sectors that rely heavily on migrants – all shed jobs.</p><p>As a result of the Trump administration’s <a href=\"/features/2025/12/19/how-ice-deports-refugees-and-migrants-despite-years-of-good-conduct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mass deportation</a> of undocumented immigrants and tightening of legal migration pathways, the US last year experienced negative net migration for the first time in at least half a century, according to a Brookings Institution analysis.</p><p>“And through this very public and brutal way of going about deportations, they have discouraged illegal immigration, but also intimidated immigrants in the US,” Noland said, adding that the US workforce is projected to see a net decline of two million workers this year.</p><p>The “bifurcation” in the US economy is also being felt across the business world, with smaller companies lacking the deep pockets to stockpile inventories or negotiate with suppliers in the face of increased tariffs.</p><p>“The surge in policy uncertainty this year has had an outsize effect on smaller firms,” Oxford Economics said in a November report.</p><p>These firms are also seeing little benefit from the boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry since revenues have been driven by capital-intensive chip manufacturing and cloud services.</p><p>While AI proponents believe the world is on the cusp of huge gains in productivity that could dramatically raise living standards, there are concerns about large numbers of people being put out of work.</p><p>“This could be the new norm – jobless growth. That’s one reason people are not feeling so great,” Yaros said.</p><p>“While a lot of hype about AI and productivity benefits from AI are still to come, we think that is a risk to the labour market if it continues to hold back hiring.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He has won some of the world’s most coveted musical awards – including Oscars, Grammys and a Golden Globe. His song Jai Ho (May You Win), which won him an Oscar, became a celebrated anthem. The 59-year-old “Mozart of Madras” has also been honoured with Padma Vibhushan, India’s third highest civilian award, for his contribution to music.</p><p>But last week, when Rahman, a man of few words, shared in a TV interview that he potentially has lost work due to “communal” bias in Bollywood, India’s Hindi film industry, he was subjected to a massive online backlash from Hindu right-wing voices.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“People who are not creative have the power now to decide things, and this might have been a communal thing also but not in my face,” Rahman told the BBC Asian Network in the interview aired on Friday.</p><p>“It comes to me as Chinese whispers that they booked you, but the music company went ahead and hired their five composers. I said, ‘Oh, that’s great, rest for me. I can chill out with my family,’” he said in the 90-minute interview.</p><p>Right-wing commentators and activists questioned Rahman’s patriotism and talent, accusing him of playing the “victim card”.</p><p>Vinod Bansal from the far-right organisation Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) demanded an apology from Rahman for “defaming” the country.</p><p>“We are proud of him and whatever he has done for the country. But for someone who has earned his living from the Indian industry, the way he is trying to defame the country is highly objectionable,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Barring a few outspoken voices, industry insiders have closed ranks, offering no solidarity and distancing themselves from the remarks.</p><p>Within a day, the composer was forced to tender an explanation amid an unrelenting stream of social media trolling. In a video posted to his Instagram account, Rahman said: “I understand that intentions can sometimes be misunderstood, but my purpose has always been to uplift, honour and serve through music.”</p><p>He stressed that he remained grateful to the nation and noted that he had thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his support of India’s entertainment industry and young creatives and was working on the background score for the upcoming film Ramayana, based on the Hindu epic, with German composer Hans Zimmer.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252302\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252302\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252302\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2241632287-1-1768834135.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Khans\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan speak on stage during the ‘EAST TO WEST: The Global Rise of Bollywood’ panel at the 2025 Joy Forum at SEF Arena on October 17, 2025 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

No matter how many patriotic songs, movies or tweets. They’ll all live through the cruelty of it.”</p><p>Online trolling helps manufacture majoritarian consent, according to Debasish Roy Chowdhury, coauthor of To Kill a Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism.</p><p>He argued that when enough noise is generated on social media, it seeps into mainstream coverage and starts to look like the dominant social mood.</p><p>“The loudest voices then drown out tolerance and reason until hate is all that is heard and can be falsely claimed as representative of society,” said Roy Chowdhury, who has written about Bollywood being used as a propaganda tool.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1755836\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1755836\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1755836\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/000_328E9BX.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protestors hold placards during a demonstration against anti-Muslim violence and hate crimes in New Delhi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1755836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">India has seen the rise of anti-Muslim violence under the rule of Prime Minister Modi [File: Sajjad Hussain/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hindu-right-s-influence-on-art-and-cinema\">Hindu right’s influence on art and cinema</h2><p>Rahman isn’t known for being outspoken about politics or talking about his Muslim identity. He has worked on a fair share of nationalist films, including Roja, released in 1992 and celebrated for its patriotic themes and portrayal of the armed rebellion in India-administered Kashmir in the 1990s.</p><p>Rahman’s 1997 song Maa Tujhe Salam (Salute to You, Mother) on his album Vande Mataram was seen as unifying the diverse nation of 1.4 billion people.</p><p class=\"p1\">The composer started his career in the southern Tamil film industry. He is based in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state.</p><p>The Oscar winner’s comments last week raised questions about the Hindu right’s influence on art and cinema in India, particularly in Bollywood.</p><p>The Hindi film industry has been called out for producing films that echo Hindu supremacist narratives, works that vilify Muslims and secular leaders, or even glorify Hindu extremists.</p><p>Some argued that this has happened because of a sustained culture war on Bollywood, pressuring it to abandon its pluralist, liberal ethos and pushing it towards Hindu majoritarian narratives, aligning cinema closely with the ruling party ideology.</p><p>The Kashmir Files (2022) triggered anti-Muslim hate across India while the Kerala Story (2023) was accused of spreading Islamophobia by portraying Muslims as potential “terrorists”.</p><p>More recently, Rahman composed music for the film Chhaava, which was accused of demonizing Muslims. The film portrayed Mughal ruler Aurangzeb as a brutal and violent ruler. Rahman, in his BBC interview, admitted the film was “divisive”.</p><h2 id=\"vilification-of-muslims\">‘Vilification of Muslims’</h2><p>Raja Sen, a screenwriter and film critic, said: “We’re seeing a kind of vilification of Muslims on our screens.”</p><p>“Earlier, it was just like an anti-Pakistan narrative. Now, there’s a different kind of narrative,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Hindi cinema has traditionally cast Pakistan as the enemy, focusing on topics of war, ‘”terror” and espionage, which are shaped by decades of hostility. The two neighbouring countries have fought several wars over the disputed Kashmir region. They were briefly engaged in a four-day war in May after gunmen killed 26 tourists in India-administered Kashmir.</p><p>Films that once centred on a foreign adversary now increasingly frame Indian Muslims as an internal threat.</p><p>Sen claimed that a major filmmaker changed an upcoming film’s Muslim protagonist’s name to a Hindu name, fearing controversy.</p><p>“They must have thought, why make the protagonist, a good, heroic guy, a Muslim. It’s perhaps similar to what used to happen in post-9/11 America in terms of how the stereotyping was being done,” Sen added.</p><p>Bollywood’s once largely secular ethos presented Muslim characters as positive, even if stereotypical. They were loyal friends, brothers or benevolent poets and singers in films like Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) and Coolie (1983).</p><p>In recent years, however, Muslims increasingly have appeared as debauched (Animal), regressive (Haq), “terrorist” (A Wednesday) or violent (Kalank), mirroring post-9/11 Hollywood films when Muslim identity became shorthand for danger or moral deficiency.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252315\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252315\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252315\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1998-12-08T000000Z_291479725_RP1DRIFRTIAG_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-FILM-1768834406.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C566&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dilip Kumar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dilip Kumar (real name Yusuf Khan – right) was India’s biggest star during the 1950s and 1960s [File: KK/FY/WS]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"muslim-stars-targeted\">Muslim stars targeted</h2><p>Muslim actors, filmmakers and other artists have played a central role in shaping Hindi cinema from its early days to the present.</p><p>The prominence of stars such as Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and Saif Ali Khan has often been cited as evidence of Bollywood’s secular credentials and broad appeal.</p><p>Yet in recent years, the country’s biggest Muslim stars have increasingly found themselves targeted. This has not happened only over their films but also for their opinions expressed publicly on religious intolerance.</p><p>Aamir Khan’s films have repeatedly faced boycott calls from right-wing Hindu groups, including his 2014 film PK for critiquing organised religion, including Hinduism and Islam, and 2022’s Laal Singh Chaddha for his past remarks on intolerance.</p><p>Aamir Khan had to reassure people that he “really loved his country”. He has also been accused of promoting love jihad, a conspiracy theory accusing Muslim men of marrying Hindu women to convert them, a charge amplified by a televised interview with news anchor Rajat Sharma, who questioned him about marrying Hindu women.</p><p>Shah Rukh Khan has been targeted on multiple occasions for remarks and professional choices. In 2015, he was branded “anti-national” for mentioning intolerance. He was also subjected to campaigns questioning his patriotism when his son, Aryan Khan, was arrested in a drugs case in 2021 despite the charges later being dropped.</p><p>More recently, he was labelled a traitor by a ruling party member after his Indian Premier League cricket team signed a Bangladeshi player. The Kolkata Knight Riders, co-owned by Shah Rukh Khan, dropped the Bangladeshi player amid tensions between the two countries.</p><p>In recent years, rights organisations and independent monitors have documented what they described as a systematic campaign of hate and discrimination against Muslims in India, who make up about 14 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion people.</p><p>According to the India Hate Lab Report 2025, there has been a sharp rise in antiminority hate speech – from 668 reported incidents in 2023 to more than 1,300 in 2025 – much of it voiced at political rallies, processions and public events that is then amplified online into mainstream discourse.</p><p>Human rights groups like Amnesty International have also documented demolitions targeting Muslim-owned businesses and homes in several states.</p><p>Beyond studies, lived accounts and news coverage point to systematic exclusion in everyday life from difficulties finding rental housing to practising religion and being lynched over accusations of transporting cow, considered sacred by some Hindus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-chilling-effect\">‘A chilling effect’</h2><p>Such backlash has a chilling effect. Artists said creative freedom in Hindi cinema has narrowed markedly in recent years, mostly by the anticipation of a backlash. Silence and self-censorship, some feel, have become critical for survival in the film industry today.</p><p>“Since 2014, there has been a group within the film industry that works within the influence of government and benefits from it, that boldly and aggressively underlines and creates many of these controversies,” filmmaker Avinash Das said.</p><p>Das revealed how, on several occasions, producers refused to work with him after they found out about his criticism of the government.</p><p>He pointed out that a 1983 satirical film, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, which depicted a Hindu religious performance, cannot be made now.</p><p>According to him, cinema is not just an art form but a business shaped by risk, which makes filmmakers and producers wary of anything that could be seen as controversial. The same extends to those who speak out.</p><p>Indian celebrities seem to be bound by the same code of silence, which explains why so few, regardless of whether they are Hindu or Muslim, speak publicly about the country’s current direction.</p><p>Roy Chowdhury said Bollywood contrasts sharply with Hollywood, where open dissent by celebrities, even disparaging remarks about United States President Donald Trump, is fairly commonplace.</p><p>“But for Muslim celebrities in India, the constraints are even tighter because in new India, Muslims are not meant to be heard,” Roy Chowdhury told Al Jazeera. “They are expected to be voiceless and faceless. They are expected to lurk in the fringes and not take the spotlight.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The reputational damage to African football will linger for a long time.</p><p>A match that promised so much between two high-quality teams produced astonishing scenes of acrimony and chaos in the Moroccan capital, Rabat. When the dust has settled, the inquest will begin.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trouble started brewing as a tight final, locked at 0-0, entered added time. Senegal’s Ismaila Sarr appeared to have scored, only for the goal to be disallowed by referee Jean-Jacques Ndala, who decided Abdoulaye Seck had fouled Morocco defender Achraf Hakimi. It was a decision that clearly incensed Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.</p><p>Then came the chaos. In the final minute of added time, Morocco’s Real Madrid star Brahim Diaz hit the ground and vehemently appealed for a penalty. After a video assistant referee (VAR) review, where Ndala was jostled by scuffling coaches and players, a highly controversial penalty was awarded, and a chance for Morocco to win it at the death.</p><p>It was then that the sparks of conflict turned into a fire. Thiaw felt Senegal had been cheated and had a case, but when he ushered his team off the field and down the tunnel in protest, he pivoted the final into dangerous territory. It took over 17 minutes for play to restart while objects were thrown from the crowd and some fans staged a pitch invasion. Thiaw later admitted he shouldn’t have taken this action, but the damage was done.</p><h2 id=\"diaz-s-panenka-mistake-costs-the-host-nation\">Diaz’s ‘Panenka’ mistake costs the host nation</h2><p>The tension inside the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium could have led to even uglier scenes before attention turned to the penalty spot, and the ball in the hands of Diaz, while Senegal’s players continued to complain bitterly. It was his moment, Morocco’s moment, after a painful 50-year wait to be champions of Africa.</p><p>What Diaz – who was the media darling of AFCON 2025 with a tournament-high five goals – did next encapsulated the craziness of the night.</p><p>Inexplicably, he attempted a “Panenka” chip, but embarrassingly, the Real Madrid winger clipped the ball straight into the arms of Senegal’s goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. The home crowd of over 66,000 at the stadium were struggling to comprehend what had just unfolded.</p><p>And when extra time started, there was another shock for the Moroccan fans, as Pape Gueye scored a brilliant winning goal for Senegal, one which would have been the memorable moment if the final hadn’t already descended into total disorder.</p><p>Senegal became champions of Africa for the second time. In football terms, they deserved it. But the inquests into the final will mean the celebrations will be overshadowed by recriminations.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250380\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250380\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250380\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_696d4ed7-1768771287.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soccer Football - CAF Africa Cup of Nations - Morocco 2025 - Final - Senegal v Morocco - Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, Rabat, Morocco - January 18, 2026 Morocco's Brahim Diaz misses a penalty REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4250380\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brahim Diaz misses a penalty that would have won the final for the host nation Morocco [Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"disciplinary-measures-likely-to-follow\">Disciplinary measures likely to follow</h2><p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who was in attendance at the final, took to Instagram to condemn the “ugly scenes”.</p><p>Infantino called it “unacceptable to leave the field of play in this manner,” and said that “violence cannot be tolerated in our sport,” adding, “the decisions taken by the match officials must always be respected”.</p><p>The final is likely to bring severe disciplinary measures from the tournament’s governing body, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which has seen its big showpiece marred.</p><p>Moroccan coach Walid Regragui called the scenes “shameful” and added that they “do not honour Africa”.</p><p>Strong measures are likely to be taken against Thiaw, whose media briefing had to be cancelled due to further unrest in the press room.  But he’s not the only one who will face scrutiny.</p><p>Before the final, the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) had voiced concerns over the security at the tournament, and said its players and staff were “at risk”. The FSF also raised concerns over the training pitch, hotel and ticket allocation for the final.</p><p>The officiating in the final drew plenty of criticism. While Congolese referee Ndala held his nerve under intense pressure when the Senegal players walked off, there is no escaping that his decision-making in stoppage time was puzzling. Did Seck really foul Hakimi? It felt a harsh call on the Senegal player. And why did the referee not consult VAR?</p><p>Did Morocco’s Diaz then go down too easily from innocuous-looking pressure by Senegal’s El Hadji Malick Diouf? Well, Ndala was initially disinterested, then appeared to cave in to the pressure from a pleading Diaz and the crowd. One such decision in favour of the hosts would be tough to take. Two was inflammatory.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252345\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252345\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252345\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256507736-1768834998.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C473&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gianni Infantino reacts.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252345\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">FIFA president Gianni Infantino, left, looks on during the AFCON final between Morocco and Senegal at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium [Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"claims-of-host-nation-bias\">Claims of host nation bias</h2><p>Morocco coach Regragui had felt the need to publicly reject claims of favouritism towards the host nation that have hung around this AFCON, fuelled by Cameroon having two penalties rejected in Morocco’s quarterfinal victory.</p><p>The conspiracy theories distracted from praise Morocco otherwise received as the host nation of the tournament, with Egypt and Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah thanking organisers and saying: “I have never participated in a competition in Africa with such a high level of organisation.”</p><p>This would have been the last thing on the mind of the tearful Moroccan fans leaving the stadium on Sunday night, and those who had gathered across the country ready to celebrate. None of this was their fault, and it was easy to feel sorry for them. The rain captured the moment. Hopes and dreams were doused. The wait to be champions would go on.</p><p>Right up until the carnage late in the final, it felt as though the prevailing narrative of AFCON 2025 would be about the improved standard of African football, and whether top-tier African teams, not least Senegal and Morocco, can go deep at the FIFA World Cup in June. Maybe even create history.</p><p>After reaching the semifinals in Qatar, and with years of youth football investment still bearing fruit, underestimating Morocco’s potential to defeat the biggest football nations would be careless. The same applies to Senegal, whose players also light up European leagues while coming together as a formidable force when representing the Lions of Teranga.</p><p>But in Rabat, the carelessness came from coaches, players and fans who dragged the ascending reputation of African football into the mud. Infantino has already made it clear that such scenes will not be tolerated in Africa or elsewhere.</p><p>The only man to have enhanced his reputation from the final fiasco is Senegal star Sadio Mane, who appeared reluctant to leave the pitch and seemingly urged his teammates to return. He also tried to calm the fury of Senegalese fans after the two controversial decisions.</p><p>Football fans everywhere should be celebrating the success of Senegal and the quality on display from both finalists. Instead, we’ll remember the dishonourable scenes in a country that co-hosts the World Cup in four years.</p><p>It’s over to CAF, and its disciplinary arm, to have the final word on AFCON 2025.

But the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/18/police-chief-steps-down-after-uk-fallout-from-ban-on-tel-aviv-football-fan\">departure</a> of Craig Guildford, chief constable of West Midlands Police, was the result of political pressure from pro-Israel lobby groups amid heightened sensitivities around the issues of Israel and Palestine, legal and political commentators say.</p><p>In November last year, West Midlands Police recommended that <a href=\"/sports/2025/10/17/israeli-maccabi-tel-aviv-football-fans-barred-from-europa-league-game-in-uk\">Maccabi Tel Aviv </a>football fans should be banned from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham on public order and security grounds.</p><p>West Midlands Police said it had classified the match as high risk based on “current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the <a href=\"/news/2024/11/12/unrest-in-amsterdam-as-further-arrests-made-over-maccabi-clashes\">2024 UEFA Europa League match</a> between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam”.</p><p>“Based on our professional judgement, we believe this measure will help mitigate risks to public safety,” the police force said at the time.</p><p>The decision was ultimately approved by Birmingham City Council’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG), a multi-agency body that brings together police, local authorities and emergency services to assess safety risks at major events.</p><p>There was a public outcry, and numerous media opinion pieces called the ban “anti-Semitic”.</p><p>That pressure has since intensified. Last week, UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/14/police-chief-behind-maccabi-tel-aviv-ban-clings-to-job-despite-home-secretary-wanting-him-to-quit\">publicly</a> stated that she had lost confidence in Guildford following criticism by a police watchdog of how the ban was handled. Guildford resigned on Friday.</p><p>But observers say Guildford’s departure is a sign that policing decisions which intersect with the issue of Israel and Palestine are no longer insulated from political consequences.</p><p>The reason for this, said Chris Nineham, vice-chair of the British group Stop the War Coalition, is that “most politicians are too scared to challenge the pro-Israel mainstream consensus”.</p><p>He believes the fallout from the ban will have lasting consequences for future policing decisions. “I think it will reinforce the tendency for police forces to go along with the establishment bias against Palestine supporters, which is a product of the British ruling class’s support for Israel and is reinforced by Israel’s impressive lobbying operation,” Nineham told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-very-dangerous-precedent\">‘A very dangerous precedent’</h2><p>Frances Webber, a retired barrister who writes on politics, human rights and the rule of law, said the significance of Guildford’s resignation extends far beyond football or crowd control.</p><p>In the UK, “police forces are operationally independent of government, and any case against Guildford should have been pursued judicially, not politically”, she explained.</p><p>The visible role of central government in the fallout from this policing decision, she argued, “sets a very dangerous precedent, not just for police and local authorities but for democracy”.</p><p>Supporters of the ban on Maccabi fans attending the match in Birmingham argue it was rooted in a risk assessment shaped by events abroad and local context.</p><p>In 2024, Dutch authorities reported <a href=\"/news/2024/11/10/israeli-football-fans-pro-palestinians-attacked-in-amsterdam-what-we-know\">serious disorder</a> involving Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters at a match in Amsterdam, with violence both before and after the fixture. In intelligence shared ahead of the Birmingham match, British police said their Dutch counterparts informed them that significant numbers of visiting fans had been involved in organised confrontations and disturbances.</p><p>Birmingham is one of the UK’s most diverse cities, with around <a href=\"https://muslimcensus.co.uk/early-insights-from-the-2021-census-for-muslims\">30 percent</a> of its residents Muslim and more than 40 percent identifying as Asian or from minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2021 Census.</p><p>Officers were therefore concerned that the arrival of large numbers of high-risk, visiting supporters could spark tensions and even retaliatory disorder.</p><p>Nineham argues, therefore, that while procedural mistakes have since been identified by a police watchdog, the underlying policing decision about the match in Birmingham was sound. “The undeniably violent element within the Maccabi fans would have been a risk to the local population,” he said.</p><p>Webber also points to <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2024/11/maccabi-hooligans-amsterdam-media-gaza\">reports</a> that visiting Maccabi fans in Amsterdam had openly celebrated the killing of children in Gaza, and officers would have had to consider this when assessing the risks surrounding the Birmingham football fixture.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252299\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252299\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252299\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-11-08T090056Z_277518430_RC2N0BAVQO3P_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-NETHERLANDS-VIOLENCE-1768834084.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Maccabi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters are guarded by police after violence broke out in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on November 8, 2024.

According to a report in the UK newspaper The Guardian this week, Dutch police said key claims about the violence in Amsterdam relied on by West Midlands Police to reach its decision to ban Maccabi fans did not align with its own experience.</p><p>The report also criticised the police’s reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, erroneous AI-generated material such as a reference to a football match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham that never took place. Guildford later apologised after initially telling MPs that AI had not been used, before <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/51041/documents/282958/default/\">clarifying </a>that the error stemmed from an AI-assisted search tool.</p><p>Since Cooke’s interim report was published, much of the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/police-chief-apologises-for-erroneous-maccabi-tel-aviv-fan-ban-evidence-blaming-ai-13494040\">British media</a> has framed Guildford’s resignation as justified, citing the findings in the report.</p><p>However, the report found no evidence that the ban was motivated by anti-Semitism, despite repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/jan/02/jewish-groups-warned-ban-on-maccabi-tel-aviv-fans-attending-match-could-be-seen-as-antisemitic\">claims</a> to that effect.</p><p>Critics of the report, including Jewish Voice for Labour, however, have argued that there was an imbalance when it came to weighing concerns from different members of the community.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/in-support-of-banning-maccabi-tel-aviv-fans/\">letter</a> to the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, the group said the chief inspector of constabulary met with what his report described as “significant people” including representatives of the Israeli Embassy, members of Birmingham’s Jewish community, and Lord John Mann, the government’s independent adviser on anti-Semitism, but did not meet with any groups representing Birmingham’s Muslim community.</p><p>The group said that this disparity showed that Muslim safety concerns had been marginalised during the process.</p><h2 id=\"a-pro-israel-consensus\">‘A pro-Israel consensus’</h2><p>“It is worrying how the line that this ban was anti-Semitic and that only a tiny minority of Maccabi fans are a problem has been able to take hold, despite the clear evidence to the contrary,” Nineham said, adding that most politicians have appeared unwilling to challenge a pro-Israel consensus once it was formed.</p><p>The fallout that resulted in Guildford’s departure, he believes, was ultimately shaped less by the report’s findings than by concern within the political establishment about the precedent the ban might set.</p><p>“Guildford was forced out because the political establishment didn’t want the decision he made to become a precedent… The message to the police is: don’t make decisions based on a real risk assessment, toe the pro-Israel line,” Nineham noted.</p><p>He said he believes the episode will serve to reinforce a wider tendency within policing and other institutions to avoid decisions perceived as unfavourable to Israel, deepening what he describes as an establishment bias against Palestine supporters.</p><p>Indeed, the implications of Guildford’s departure extend far beyond this single case, warns Webber, with leaders in the police force being placed in an “impossible situation”, expected to weigh foreign-policy sensitivities alongside public safety – something she said is absolutely not their role.</p><p>Guildford’s exit may satisfy political demands for accountability. But it has also sent a clear message: when policing decisions intersect with Israel and Palestine, independence comes at a price, and careers can be the cost.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

They also have a large diaspora population, primarily in Germany but also in other European countries including France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p><p>There are between 30 and 40 million Kurdish people around the globe. Kurds are widely understood to be the largest stateless ethnic group in the world, connected by a shared culture and the Kurdish language.</p><p>Kurdish, a Northwestern Iranian language, has several distinct dialects that vary by region. Most historians agree that Kurds constitute the Iranian branch of the Indo‑European peoples.</p><p>While most Kurds are Sunni Muslims, there are also Kurdish communities that follow Shia Islam, Alevism, Yazidism, Christianity and other faiths.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4251438\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4251438\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4251438\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-WHERE-ARE-THE-KURDS-JAN19-2026-copy-1768814414.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - WHERE ARE THE KURDS - JAN19, 2026 copy-1768814414\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4251438\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-are-the-kurds-stateless\">Why are the Kurds stateless?</h2><p>The Kurds lost their lands in the 1500s when the Ottoman Empire took over most Kurdish-held territory.</p><p>The Ottoman Empire was dissolved by the 1920 Treaty of Sevres, a post-World War I peace treaty.</p><p>Under this, the Allied powers proposed creating an autonomous Kurdistan. This was seen as a major breakthrough for the emerging Kurdish nationalist movement, but the treaty never came into force. Turkiye later renegotiated the post-war settlement with the Allies, and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne dropped the idea of a self-governing Kurdistan altogether.</p><p>Since then, Kurds have repeatedly tried to establish their own state, but those efforts have so far failed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4251646\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4251646\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4251646\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-Who-are-the-main-Kurdish-groups-SDF-Syria-KDP-Iraq-1768819555.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Who are the main Kurdish groups SDF Syria KDP Iraq-1768819555\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4251646\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-do-kurdish-grievances-differ-in-syria-turkiye-iran-and-iraq\">How do Kurdish grievances differ in Syria, Turkiye, Iran and Iraq?</h2><p>In each of the four nations, Kurds have endured years of tricky relations with respective governments.</p><h3>Syria</h3><p>Kurds make up about 10 percent of the population in Syria, according to the CIA World Factbook.</p><p>Syria’s Kurds have experienced repression and unfair treatment.</p><p>In 1962, a special census in al-Hasakah province stripped about 120,000 Kurds of Syrian citizenship. Their children and grandchildren remained stateless, and later estimates from early 2011 put the number of Kurds without citizenship at around 300,000.</p><p>Kurdish land has also been distributed to Arab communities under Arabisation policies.</p><p>The Kurds were initially neutral when the uprising against al-Assad began in 2011 and escalated into a civil war. However, in 2012, Syrian government troops pulled out of many Kurdish areas, and Kurdish groups took control.</p><p>In 2013, fighters from ISIL (ISIS) began attacking three Kurdish areas in northern Syria that bordered the armed group’s territory. The People’s Protection Units (YPG) – a Syrian Kurdish armed group that is the military wing of the Syrian Kurdish political party, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) – fought them off. The YPG was backed by the Turkiye-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).</p><p>In 2014, ISIL seized the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane on the Turkish border. After months of heavy fighting, Kurdish forces, led by the YPG and backed by United States-led air strikes, regained control of the town in early 2015. Later that year, in October 2015, the YPG and allied Arab and other factions formally established the SDF as a broader coalition to fight ISIL across northern and eastern Syria.</p><p>In October 2017, the SDF captured Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIL in Syria, and then pushed into Deir Az Zor, ISIL’s last big stronghold. By March 2019, the SDF had taken Baghouz, the last piece of ISIL-held territory in Syria.</p><p>Al-Assad remained in power until he was ousted in December 2024 by Syrian opposition fighters led by al-Sharaa, who is now the interim president.</p><p>As part of his efforts to unite Syria, al-Sharaa on Friday issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree formally recognising</a> Kurdish as a “national language” alongside Arabic, allowing it to be taught in schools, and restoring citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians. The decree also abolishes measures dating back to a 1962 census in Hasakah province that actively stripped many Kurds of Syrian nationality.</p><p>The decree officially recognises Kurdish identity as part of Syria’s national fabric for the first time and declares Newroz, the Kurdish New Year festival, a paid national holiday.</p><p>It also grants Kurdish Syrians rights, bans ethnic or linguistic discrimination, requires state institutions to adopt inclusive national messaging, and sets out penalties for “incitement to ethnic strife”.</p><p>In a statement, the Kurdish administration in Syria’s north and northeast said the decree was “a first step, however, it does not satisfy the aspirations and hopes of the Syrian people”. It called for more action.</p><p>“Rights are not protected by temporary decrees, but… through permanent constitutions that express the will of the people and all components of a society,” it said.</p><h3>Turkiye</h3><p>Kurds make up 19 percent of the population of Turkiye but, for generations, have experienced erasure, with Kurds displaced and their names and costumes banned.</p><p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) was founded in 1978 by Abdullah Ocalan, with the aim of creating an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkiye. In 1984, the group launched an armed rebellion against the Turkish state, carrying out guerrilla attacks on security forces and state institutions.</p><p>The ensuing conflict between the PKK and Turkish security forces has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced many more in Kurdish-majority areas.</p><p>In the 1990s, the PKK rolled back its demands, instead seeking greater cultural recognition. It continued its armed resistance against the Turkish state, alongside its efforts to build a broader political and social movement through affiliated parties and organisations.</p><p>The SDF’s secular Kurdish leadership is linked to the Turkish-based PKK. Although the PKK signalled in early 2025 that it would lay down its arms and disband, it is still listed as a “terrorist” group by Turkiye, the European Union and the US. Sporadic clashes between PKK fighters and Turkish forces have continued.</p><p>Despite this, the US backed the SDF because it was an effective partner in fighting ISIL, which the SDF and a US-led coalition had defeated in northeastern Syria by 2019.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Iran</h3><p>Kurdish people make up nearly 10 percent of Iran’s population.</p><p>The 1979 Islamic Revolution led to the overthrow of the shah and the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran.</p><p>While the Kurds initially supported the Islamic Republic and briefly controlled parts of Iran, Iran’s mostly Sunni Muslim Kurdish community has often clashed with the Persian-speaking, Shia Muslim government in Tehran over Kurdish demands for political autonomy and cultural and linguistic rights.</p><p>Several Kurdish groups have long opposed the government in western Iran, where they form a majority, and there have been periods of active rebellion against government forces in those areas.</p><p>Kurdish uprisings in Iran in the 1980s and 1990s were met with heavy repression. Key Kurdish parties were pushed out of their strongholds, and many of their leaders and fighters relocated across the border to bases in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Civilian communities were also forced into Iraq, although large Kurdish communities remained inside Iran.</p><p>In 2004, the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) was formed as an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic in Iran. Since then, it has carried out guerrilla attacks and ambushes on Iranian security forces from bases in the mountains along the Iran-Iraq border.</p><h3>Iraq</h3><p>Kurdish people make up between 15 and 20 percent of the population in Iraq. While they have historically enjoyed more rights than the Kurds in neighbouring countries, they have still faced repression in Iraq.</p><p>Kurdish nationalist leader Mustafa Barzani formed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to fight for autonomy in Iraq in 1946. In 1961, he launched a full armed struggle in what is often referred to as the First Kurdish–Iraqi War or the September Revolution.</p><p>The conflict lasted into the 1970s, with on-and-off clashes in the northern provinces of Iraq. Then, in the late 1970s, the government began settling Arabs on Kurdish land and displacing Kurds. Some of them – many Yazidis – settled in “Mujammaat” or army-controlled towns or settlements in northern Iraq.</p><p>In 1991, the year that Iraq lost the Gulf War, Barzani’s son, Masoud Barzani of the KDP, and Jalal Talabani of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led a Kurdish uprising in Iraq. It was violently crushed by the administration of then-President Saddam Hussein. More than 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkiye to escape a crackdown by Hussein’s regime. Turkiye shut its borders in response. Thousands died along the border, and the United Nations set up a “safe zone” for refugees in northern Iraq in April 1991. Eventually, most people returned to their homes in Iraq after the situation stabilised.</p><p>In 1992, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) was formed by the Kurdistan National Assembly, the first democratically elected parliament in Iraq’s Kurdistan region. After the UN guaranteed protection for the Kurds in 1991, Saddam Hussein’s government permitted the KRG to take over administration of what is now the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.</p><p>While the KDP and PUK agreed to share power, they experienced rifts and at times engaged in armed fighting with each other between 1994 and 1998.</p><p>However, in 2003, the two groups cooperated with the US to unseat Hussein. The KRG, led by Masoud Barzani, ruled three provinces: Duhok, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. In 2005, Talabani became Iraq’s first Kurdish president.</p><p>In 2017, the KRG held an independence referendum in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region and in disputed, Kurdish-claimed territories such as Kirkuk, which is south of Erbil in northern Iraq. More than <a href=\"/news/2017/9/27/iraqi-kurds-overwhelmingly-back-split-from-baghdad\">90 percent</a> of voters backed independence, but Baghdad rejected the poll as <a href=\"/news/2017/11/6/baghdad-court-rules-secession-attempt-unconstitutional\">illegal.</a></p><p>The Iraqi Supreme Court ruled that the referendum was contrary to the Iraqi Constitution, which calls for the preservation of Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity.</p><p>Iraqi forces then moved in and retook Kirkuk and other disputed, fragmented areas, depriving the Kurds of key oil revenues and dealing a major blow to their ambitions for statehood.</p><p>In the aftermath of that, Masoud resigned as regional president, and the post remained vacant until 2019, when his nephew, Nechirvan Barzani, was elected president of the KRG.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In the nuclear age, the United States has to refrain from all-out war since it can easily lead to nuclear escalation. Instead, it wages hybrid wars.</p><p>In recent weeks, we have witnessed two such conflicts: in Venezuela and Iran. Both have been waged through a combination of crushing economic sanctions, targeted military strikes, cyberwarfare, stoking unrest and unrelenting misinformation campaigns. Both are long-term CIA projects that have recently escalated. Both will lead to further chaos.</p><p>The US has long had two goals vis-a-vis Venezuela: to gain control over its vast oil reserves in the Orinoco Belt and to overthrow its leftist government, which has been in power since 1999. America’s hybrid war against Venezuela dates to 2002 when the CIA helped to support a coup attempt against President Hugo Chavez. When that failed, the US ramped up other hybrid measures, including economic sanctions, the confiscation of Venezuela’s dollar reserves and measures to cripple Venezuela’s oil production, which eventually collapsed. Despite the chaos sown by the US, the hybrid war did not bring down the government.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has now escalated to bombing Caracas, kidnapping President Nicolas Maduro, stealing Venezuelan oil shipments and imposing a naval blockade, which, of course, is an act of war. It also seems likely that Trump is thereby enriching powerful pro-Zionist campaign funders who have their eyes on seizing Venezuelan oil assets.</p><p>Zionist interests also have their eye on toppling the Venezuelan government since it has long supported the Palestinian cause and maintained close relations with Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cheered on the US attack on Venezuela, calling it the “perfect operation”.</p><p>The United States along with Israel is also simultaneously escalating its ongoing hybrid war against Iran. We can expect US and Israeli subversion, air strikes and targeted assassinations. The difference with Venezuela is that the hybrid war on Iran can easily escalate into a devastating regional war, even a global one. US allies in the region, especially the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">Gulf countries</a>, have been engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts to persuade Trump to back down and avoid military action.</p><p>The war on Iran has a history even longer than the war on Venezuela. The first US intervention in the country dates back to 1953 when democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh nationalised Iran’s oil in defiance of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (today’s BP).</p><p>The CIA and MI6 orchestrated Operation Ajax to depose Mossadegh through a mix of propaganda, street violence and political interference. They reinstated Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who had fled the country, fearing Mossadegh, and helped the shah solidify his grip on power. The CIA also supported the shah by helping create his notorious secret police, SAVAK, which crushed dissent through surveillance, censorship, imprisonment and torture.</p><p>Eventually this repression led to a revolution that swept Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power in 1979. During the revolution, students seized US hostages in Tehran after the US admitted the shah for medical treatment, leading to fear that the US would try to reinstall him in power. The hostage crisis further poisoned the relations between Iran and the US.</p><p>From then onwards, the US has plotted to torment Iran and overthrow its government. Among the countless hybrid actions the US has undertaken was funding Iraq in the 1980s to wage war on Iran, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths but failing to topple the government.</p><p>The US-Israeli objective vis-a-vis Iran is the opposite of a negotiated settlement that would normalise its position in the international system while constraining its nuclear programme. The real objective is to keep Iran economically broken, diplomatically cornered and internally pressured. Trump has repeatedly undercut negotiations that could have led to peace, starting with his withdrawal from the 2016 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that had seen Iran’s nuclear energy activities monitored and economic sanctions removed.</p><p>Understanding the hybrid war tactics helps to explain why Trump’s rhetoric oscillates so abruptly between threats of war and false offers of peace. Hybrid warfare thrives on contradictions, ambiguities and outright deceit.</p><p>Last summer, the US was supposed to have negotiations with Iran on June 15 but supported Israel’s bombing of the country two days earlier. For this reason, signs of de-escalation in recent days should not be taken at face value. They can all too readily be followed by a direct military attack.</p><p>The examples of Venezuela and Iran demonstrate just how addicted the US and Israel are to hybrid warfare. Acting together, the CIA, Mossad, allied military contractors and security agencies have fomented turmoil across Latin America and the Middle East for decades.</p><p>They have upended the lives of hundreds of millions of people, blocked economic development, created terror and generated mass refugee waves. They have nothing to show for spending billions on covert and overt operations beyond the chaos itself.</p><p>There is no security, no peace, no stable pro-US or pro-Israel alliance, only suffering. In the process, the US is also going out of its way to undermine the United Nations Charter, which it brought to life in the aftermath of World War II. The UN Charter makes clear that hybrid warfare violates the very basis of international law, which calls on countries to refrain from the use of force against other countries.</p><p>There is one beneficiary of hybrid war, and that is the military-tech industrial complex in the US and Israel. US President Dwight Eisenhower warned us in his 1961 farewell address of the profound danger of the military-industrial complex to society. His warning has come to pass even more than he imagined as it is now powered by artificial intelligence, mass propaganda and a reckless US foreign policy.</p><p>The world’s best hope is that the other 191 countries of the UN besides the US and Israel finally say no to their addiction to hybrid war: no to regime-change operations, no to unilateral sanctions, no to the weaponisation of the dollar and no to the repudiation of the UN Charter.</p><p>The American people do not support the lawlessness of their own government, but they have a very hard time making their opposition heard. They and almost all the rest of the world want the US deep state brutality to end before it’s too late.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

His decision to step down was prompted by what he described as the “political and media frenzy” surrounding the ban on Israeli fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv from their team’s match with Aston Villa in Birmingham.</p><p>Days earlier, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood publicly stated that she had “lost confidence” in Guildford’s leadership after sustained political and media pressure; it was the first time in two decades a home secretary has done so. Ministers and much of the media framed the ban as a moral outrage, even a national disgrace.</p><p>This was not a scandal involving corruption, brutality or police cover-ups but a risk assessment. The British media and public officials tore apart the internal advice on which the decision to bar Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from Villa Park in November was based. In doing so, the British state in effect sided with the fans of an Israeli football club against its own police.</p><p>West Midlands Police later acknowledged errors in its assessment. Those mistakes should be noted but be kept in proportion. They do not amount to proof of bad faith, conspiracy or prejudice. An independent review found no evidence that officers were influenced by anti-Semitism or malign intent – a finding that has been largely drowned out by the public outrage machine.</p><p>What has also been consistently erased from media coverage is context. A hooligan element within Maccabi Tel Aviv’s fanbase has a long, well-documented history of violent and racist behaviour, including explicitly anti-Palestinian chants. This is neither a marginal claim nor a recent invention. It has been acknowledged for decades, including within Israel itself.</p><p>The police risk assessment was informed by violence surrounding a Maccabi Tel Aviv match in Amsterdam in 2024 when unrest spilled into the city, locals were attacked, racist chants glorifying the Israeli military were heard and Palestinian symbols were targeted. This took place amid Israel’s genocide in Gaza at a time of intense global anger over its mass killing, displacement and starvation. Against that backdrop, the decision to err on the side of caution was neither shocking nor sinister. It was policing.</p><p>Anti-Semitism is real, dangerous and rising globally, and it must be confronted seriously. But collapsing Jewish identity into support for an Israeli football club and treating any scrutiny of its fanbase as suspect does nothing to combat anti-Semitism. Instead, it weaponises it while casting suspicion on Muslim communities and eroding trust in public institutions.</p><p>What makes the political reaction to this case even more revealing is that banning football supporters on safety grounds is not unusual in the UK. British authorities have routinely barred British fans from attending matches at home or abroad based on reputations for violence and disorder.</p><p>These collective, preventive measures have long been accepted as normal public-order policing. No ministers have cried discrimination. No police chiefs have been hounded. No national crisis has been declared.</p><p>The difference here is not principle. It is politics.</p><p>For Palestinians, this episode fits a broader and painfully familiar pattern. For more than two years, Israel has carried out a genocide in Gaza: tens of thousands of people killed, most of the population displaced, homes, hospitals, schools and universities destroyed, and starvation imposed as a method of warfare. International legal experts and human rights organisations have warned of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Britain’s response has been consistent: delay, equivocation and protection.</p><p>There has been no arms embargo. No sanctions. No meaningful accountability for Israel.</p><p>The pattern revealed in Birmingham is the same one that shapes Britain’s response to Gaza. When Israeli interests are inconvenienced, the state mobilises. When Palestinians are killed, it urges restraint. When those in Britain attempt to obstruct the supply chains of genocide, they are prosecuted. Some now sit in prison. Some are on hunger strike.</p><p>This is the reality facing Palestine Action activists today. And it is why the question at the heart of this story cannot be avoided.</p><p>If the British government cannot tolerate a policing decision that inconveniences an Israeli football club, it will never confront Israel over mass killing. If it is willing to undermine its own institutions to demonstrate loyalty, it will not deliver justice to those who challenge that impunity.</p><p>The football controversy matters not because of what happened at a stadium in Birmingham but because it exposes how power works. It shows whose fears are treated as legitimate, whose suffering demands action and whose lives can be explained away.</p><p>For Palestinians, the message is unmistakable. Justice, under these conditions, is not delayed. It is denied.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But a photograph was released by the White House of him receiving the medal from Machado.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2065\" data-end=\"2403\">The right-wing Machado received the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for leading Venezuela’s opposition.</p><p>In 2023, she won the Venezuelan opposition’s presidential primary, placing her in a prime position to challenge longtime leader Maduro in the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>However, Venezuela’s top court, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, upheld a ban stopping Machado from running for office.</p><p>The court-backed government said she supported US sanctions, was linked to a weapons plot through her party, and had helped cause losses to Venezuelan assets like the US-based oil refiner Citgo and chemicals company Monomeros, which operates in Colombia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2065\" data-end=\"2403\">During her visit to Washington, Machado said she offered the medal to Trump “as a recognition for his unique commitment to our freedom”.</p><p data-start=\"2405\" data-end=\"2622\">Trump later confirmed on social media that Machado had left the medal with him, writing: “She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done.”</p><p data-start=\"2624\" data-end=\"2948\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">In advance of the visit, the Norwegian Nobel Institute reiterated that a peace prize cannot be transferred or shared once awarded. Under the statutes of the Nobel Foundation and the will of Alfred Nobel, the title belongs solely to the recipient, even if the physical medal changes hands.</p><p>In December, Gianni Infantino, chief of world football association FIFA, handed Trump the <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/6/infantinos-peace-prize-to-trump-raises-questions-about-fifas-neutrality\">inaugural FIFA Peace Prize</a>, further cementing his embrace of the Republican leader and raising eyebrows globally during a lavish ceremony.</p><p>FIFA has long proclaimed a policy of political neutrality, but has been called into question.</p><p>Infantino’s effusive praise for Trump and the FIFA decision to award a peace prize to the US president triggered a formal complaint over ethics violations and political neutrality days after the football body’s event.</p><p>Human rights group FairSquare said it <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/fifas-gianni-infantino-faces-ethics-complaint-over-trump-peace-prize\">had filed a complaint</a> with FIFA’s ethics committee, claiming the organisation’s behaviour was against the common interests of the global football community.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The more insidious columns in the form ask the respondents to declare if they have relatives abroad, the “outfit” they are associated with, or even the model of their mobile phone and their social media handles.</p><p>A similar form has also been shared with the people running “madrasas” (religious schools) in the region.</p><p>“This is not a place where you can live in peace. Every now and then, we are asked to fill out one form or another,” Nawaz, 41, told Al Jazeera as he sat inside his grocery shop in Jawahar Nagar area of Srinagar.</p><p>“They are asking for unusually detailed information about religious institutions and those linked to them. The form seeks details about sectarian affiliation, funding sources, land ownership, charitable activities, and much more,” he said.</p><p>“I do not understand why the police need this much personal information. Keeping such detailed records is not safe for families like mine. In a conflict area like Kashmir, this can have serious consequences.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4251675\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4251675\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4251675\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Picture-2-1-1768819821.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kashmir police\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4251675\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A police officer in Indian-administered Kashmir collecting data from a mosque in Srinagar [Courtesy: Jammu and Kashmir Police]</figcaption></figure><p class=\"pf0\">Residents say the police exercise feels less like a routine survey and more like an attempt by the state to exert control over Kashmir’s religious institutions that have traditionally managed their own affairs.</p><p class=\"pf0\">The Mutahida Majlis-e-Ulema (MMU), the largest umbrella body of Islamic religious groups in Kashmir, has opposed the profiling of mosques, calling it an attempt to control religious institutions.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Mosques are sacred places meant for worship, guidance and community service, and their internal religious affairs cannot be subjected to intrusive scrutiny,” the MMU said in a statement, urging the government to stop the exercise, which it said “creates fear and undermines trust within the Muslim community”.</p><h2 id=\"makes-you-worry\">‘Makes you worry’</h2><p class=\"pf0\">Hafiz Nasir Mir has been working as an imam for about 15 years and currently leads the daily prayers at a mosque in Srinagar’s Lal Bazar area. He also received the form but has not filled it in yet due to privacy concerns.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“If this were just paperwork, the police would not have been asking for so many personal details again and again,” Mir, 38, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“They also want information about relatives who live outside Kashmir or even outside India. These are private family matters and not things meant for police records … When the authorities start asking for such details at this level, it makes you worry about how the information might be used later.”</p><p>The Himalayan region of Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan, who control parts of it and have fought three wars over it since their independence from British rule in 1947. China also controls a sliver of Kashmir’s land.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><a href=\"/news/2023/12/11/whats-article-370-what-to-know-about-india-top-court-verdict-on-kashmir\">Article 370</a> of the Indian Constitution granted Indian-administered Kashmir partial autonomy over matters related to education, employment and land ownership. In 2019, however, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s right-wing government scrapped the law and divided the region into two federally-governed territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.</p><p>Since then, New Delhi’s direct control over Kashmir has seen restrictions on religious freedoms, including the denial of other rights.</p><p>The region’s main mosque, Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid, was <a href=\"/news/2021/12/16/india-kashmir-srinagar-jamia-mosque-religious-freedom-muslims\">shut for nearly two years</a> in the aftermath of the 2019 move, and still sees frequent closures and limits on the number of people allowed to congregate for Eid prayers.</p><p>India says the restrictions are temporary, calling them preventive measures to maintain law and order and curb “cross-border militancy” – a reference to Pakistan’s alleged support for Kashmiri rebels. Pakistan rejects India’s allegation, saying it provides only diplomatic backing to the Kashmiris’ struggle for self-determination.</p><p>A political analyst told Al Jazeera the profiling of mosques raises serious questions about privacy and <a href=\"/news/2023/9/22/kashmirs-top-pro-freedom-cleric-leads-friday-prayers-after-four-years\">religious freedom</a>.</p><p>“A balanced approach is needed, with clear rules, transparency, judicial oversight and involvement of local communities to maintain trust while ensuring security for everyone,” he said on condition of anonymity over fears of reprisals from the authorities.</p><p>“Many people also see the exercise as discriminatory, saying it places pressure on Muslim institutions without similar scrutiny of other faiths.”</p><h2 id=\"turning-mosques-into-crime-scenes\">‘Turning mosques into crime scenes’</h2><p class=\"pf0\">Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of the region who once led a coalition government with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), criticised the police exercise, calling it “discriminatory” and aimed at “creating fear among Muslims”.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“By doing so, they are turning mosques into crime scenes. Can the government do the same with [Hindu] temples, [Sikh] gurdwaras or churches?” she asked, holding a copy of the police form during a news conference in Srinagar.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Imran Nabi Dar, spokesman for the region’s governing party National Conference, said the party wants the profiling to stop. The region has had an elected government since 2024 – its first since the revocation of Article 370 in 2019 – but most executive powers rest with the New Delhi-appointed lieutenant governor.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“The authorities have already carried out several surveys in the Kashmir valley. There is no need to conduct another one unnecessarily,” Dar told Al Jazeera. “Once government representatives meet the lieutenant governor, we will raise the issue with him. We cannot stop the profiling ourselves because the police are not under our control, as Jammu and Kashmir is a union territory.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">Defending the profiling of mosques, Altaf Thakur, spokesman for the BJP in Kashmir, said surveillance was necessary for accountability and transparency.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Past experience tells us that mosques were used in Kashmir by maulvis [prayer leaders] to ask people to come out and hold pro-Pakistan rallies. Though it was stopped in 2019, some elements still use mosques as a political platform and for propaganda,” he said.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“There is nothing wrong with finding out who funds mosques, the nature of the land they are built on, and the ideology they follow,” Thakur said. “We need to know what is taught in these mosques.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">Mir, the imam at the Lal Bazar mosque, fears the authorities would soon ask them to get their sermons approved by them before the prayers. “I can say we, the prayer leaders, will be asked to deliver mandatory Friday sermons only after getting approval from the concerned police station.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The oil-rich soil of al-Omar, the turbines of the Tabqa Dam and the cautious return of families to towns long abandoned tell a story as old as Syria itself: one of power, survival and the struggle to unify a fractured country.</p><p>Over the weekend, Syrian government forces <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/syrian-forces-capture-tabqa-and-dam-amid-swift-raqqa-offensive\">seized</a> the al-Omar oilfield, the Conoco gas complex – both in Deir Az Zor governorate – and the Tabqa Dam, in Raqqa governorate. The operation was heralded as a military achievement, but its significance reaches far beyond maps and military lines. It touches the very structure of Syria’s political economy, the social contract between state and citizen and the fragile architecture of agreements meant to reconcile formerly hostile actors.</p><p>And the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which previously controlled the areas as well as all of northeastern Syria, soon realised the situation they faced. By Sunday evening, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/syria-announces-ceasefire-agreement-with-kurd-led-sdf-after-heavy-fighting\">announced</a> that a deal had been reached with the SDF.</p><p>“State institutions will enter the three eastern and northeastern governorates – Hasakah, Deir Az Zor and Raqqa,” al-Sharaa said.</p><h2 id=\"heartland-scarred-by-war\">Heartland scarred by war</h2><p>In eastern Syria, hydrocarbons have long been both a lifeblood and a driver of economic leverage.</p><p>Before the beginning of the conflict in 2011, oil and gas accounted for nearly 20 percent of Syria’s gross domestic product (GDP). During the war, these fields became the backbone of the fragmented war economy, exploited by armed groups and redirected to support local militias. Reclaiming these fields is therefore more than symbolic – it is a prerequisite for fiscal recovery.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Labib al-Nahhas, director of the Syrian Association for Citizens’ Dignity, said the rapid territorial losses suffered by the SDF echo the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December 2024.</p><p>“SDF are collapsing in a similar way to [the] regime in Damascus,” he said, arguing that al-Omar, Tabqa and Tishreen are pivotal for economic recovery, not only in terms of recovering resources such as oil and gas, but “because they will have a huge impact on prices and living conditions”.</p><p>Radwan Ziadeh, senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC (ACW), said controlling natural resources alone was not enough to help Syria move forward, but that it was a step in the right direction.</p><p>“It is still very early to say that there are tangible benefits from this advance,” he said.</p><p>“Oil- and gasfields require significant international investment to unlock their full potential. On their own, they cannot deliver recovery. [But] more importantly, this is a significant step towards unifying Syria. This is the first time the country has been unified under one government since 2013. Before that, Syria was divided between Free Syrian Army factions, the al-Assad government, and later ISIL [ISIS], which fragmented the country even further.”</p><h2 id=\"march-agreement\">March agreement</h2><p>In March 2025, Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the SDF who is also known as Mazloum Kobani, and al-Sharaa signed a framework agreement aimed at integrating the group into state structures while protecting local governance and Kurdish rights.</p><p>At the time, Abdi called it “a real opportunity to build a new Syria that embraces all its components”. He emphasised that “there will be no armies outside the state”, reflecting both acceptance of a unified military structure and persistent concern for Kurdish autonomy.</p><p>Al-Sharaa, meanwhile, presented the pact as an affirmation of state sovereignty first, rights second – a point that would prove decisive in the months ahead.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In November, al-Sharaa met United States President Donald Trump at the White House, and Syria became a partner in the war against ISIL. That essentially took the air from the SDF’s argument that it was the only US ally fighting against the armed group. The agreement also provided al-Sharaa’s forces with the opportunity to consolidate their deals with Arab fighters who wanted to switch sides – from the SDF to Damascus. And the Syrian president offered an olive branch to war-weary Kurdish civilians, many of whom also want an end to hostilities.</p><p>However, by late 2025, implementation of the government-SDF agreement lagged. Territorial and administrative disagreements grew, and the Syrian army advanced into SDF-controlled territory.</p><h2 id=\"tribes-decisive-role\">Tribes’ decisive role</h2><p>While foreign policy set the backdrop, local tribal dynamics have proved decisive in reshaping control. Over the past year, Damascus has invested heavily in courting Arab clans in Deir Az Zor and Raqqa who had grown disaffected with the SDF’s Kurdish-led administration. The tribes were also growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of implementation of the March agreement.</p><p>Participants at a January 17 meeting of tribal elders from Syria’s east reviewed the consequences of failing to implement the agreement’s provisions on time, including the potential political and security impacts on the region.</p><p>Several tribal sheikhs at the meeting emphasised the importance of preventing escalation, the necessity of adhering to agreements to achieve stability, and called on the SDF to implement the March deal. The tribes had made clear their dissatisfaction with the SDF, and once the opportunity presented itself, they moved to push the SDF out of their communities.</p><p>A source from the Syrian Tribal Forces, a coalition of Syrian Arab tribes, told Al Jazeera on Sunday: “Areas south of Hasakah, from Sur to al-Shaddadi, are free of SDF forces.”</p><h2 id=\"the-outside-influence\">The outside influence</h2><p>The unravelling of the March deal was also accelerated by changing regional dynamics. The US – a longstanding, primary military partner – narrowed its role to counter-ISIL operations, leaving the Kurdish-led forces without the external military help they had relied on. Without US enforcement, Damascus has had room to assert authority east of the Euphrates River, the backbone of the SDF’s territory.</p><p>Turkiye, for its part, has always remained wary of any SDF autonomy. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been quick to back al-Sharaa’s moves against the SDF and welcomed the news of Sunday’s deal.</p><p>The territory was taken from the SDF not just by force, but with the tacit consent of international and regional allies and communities weary of war, who felt disenfranchised as a result of Arab-Kurdish divisions.</p><h2 id=\"energy-water-as-levers-of-state-authority\">Energy, water as levers of state authority</h2><p>Control of the al-Omar oilfield, the Conoco gas complex and the Tabqa Dam is not just symbolic.</p><p>Tabqa Dam, the country’s largest hydroelectric facility, now governs power and irrigation across much of northern and eastern Syria. Electricity in this region is literally life-sustaining, powering hospitals, schools and industrial activity.</p><p>Yet the full potential of these assets remains unrealised. Reconstruction and international investment are necessary to convert regained infrastructure into long-term state capacity.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, the SDF’s loss of control over resource-rich areas reduces their financial independence and constrains governance in formerly autonomous zones. As ACW’s Ziadeh noted, this moment is less about immediate economic gain than the consolidation of state authority and territorial unification.</p><p>The SDF, it seems, will have to retreat from most Arab majority areas towards Hasakah governorate. That is where the historic roots of Syria’s Kurdish minority remain and provide the force with manpower, political backing and economic viability.</p><h2 id=\"human-and-social-changes\">Human and social changes</h2><p>The Syrian government’s advance eastwards is reshaping communities. Thousands have been displaced from Aleppo, Raqqa and Tabqa.<br>\nKurdish populations face the tension between guaranteed citizenship as promised by al-Sharaa in a presidential decree issued on January 16, and the erosion of the SDF’s political autonomy.</p><p>Arab tribes, meanwhile, are recalibrating alliances, balancing local interests with new state authority.</p><p>Main tribes, including al-Ukaidat, al-Bakara, al-Jabour, Anza, Shammar, Bani Khalid, al-Bu Shaaban, al-Buhamad and al-Baggara, essentially run the governorates of Deir Az Zor, Raqqa and Hasakah in northeastern Syria. Their loyalties are often transactional, depending on who runs that region. Al-Sharaa’s forces seem to have the upper hand now.</p><p>The social contract – fragile before the war – is being renegotiated in real time, amid both material deprivation and political promises.</p><p>To keep new allies happy and prevent defections, Damascus will have to care – and be seen to care, as well. The likelihood of more people tilting to the government’s side will depend on what kind of improvements they see in terms of security, inclusion and the economy.</p><p>Al-Nahhas expects the impact on living conditions would be “massive” but not immediate, stressing that expectation management is essential because recovery will take time. Central control and stability, he added, could incentivise foreign investment in oil, gas and electricity, provided corruption is minimised and governance improves.</p><p>He said after regaining vital energy sites, electricity costs and availability could also improve, but warned that outcomes depend on management – how quickly authorities can make facilities operational, given that infrastructure is not optimal, how effectively control is asserted, and how transparently assets are managed.</p><h2 id=\"no-oil-windfalls-soon\">No oil windfalls soon</h2><p>Mohamad Ahmad, economist and energy specialist at Karam Shaar Advisory Limited, said while the al-Omar field was “technically feasible for investment”, production had collapsed to about 14,200 barrels per day and reservoirs were stressed.</p><p>“The government’s recent takeover in late 2025 reclaims a critically impaired asset; its rehabilitation faces immense technical and financial hurdles, underscoring the long-term economic cost of the war,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ahmad added that the capture of the oilfield highlights the depth of damage inflicted over the years of conflict.</p><p>“As Syria’s flagship oilfield, al-Omar’s trajectory from a high-potential asset to a war-torn symbol is both tragic and indicative of the conflict’s devastation,” he said.</p><p>“We’re looking at a field that once produced nearly 90,000 barrels per day, with original reserves of 760 million barrels of high-quality light crude. However, over a decade of conflict, which included its use as a financial engine for ISIS and subsequent targeted air strikes, has inflicted catastrophic damage – well over $800m – to its core infrastructure.”</p><h2 id=\"unification-still-fragile\">Unification still fragile</h2><p>In Deir Az Zor, Raqqa and Aleppo, energy infrastructure hums unevenly. Across the northeast, Syrians live between the promise of a unified government and the caution of decades of uncertainty – their future tethered to the intersection of energy, politics, and human resilience.</p><p>Yet economic realities, lingering distrust and complex foreign involvement mean that unification is precarious.</p><p>But for the first time since 2013, Syria is largely unified under a single government. Ziadeh added that the inclusion of Kurdish rights and social freedoms elevates this beyond a military or territorial achievement, “with the announcement to include Kurdish rights and social freedoms within the Syrian state framework, this is the first time we are seeing a unifying government in Syria. That is the most important takeaway from this rapid advance.”</p><p>The Syrian government’s battlefield advances demonstrate the return of central authority, the partial reintegration of Kurdish and Arab actors, and the resumption of control over key economic lifelines. Tribal councils have praised inclusive decrees; Abdi continues to navigate a shifting political landscape; and al-Sharaa asserts sovereignty with inclusion.</p><p>But the recovery of Syria’s northeast is not merely about military gains or legal decrees. It is about rebuilding trust, maintaining local support, and carefully managing the delicate balance between unity and autonomy. The oil, the dam, the gas, and the laws are all symbols of what is possible – but also reminders of how tenuous state power remains in a land long fractured by war.</p><p>In Syria, the Euphrates is both witness and arbiter – it remains to be seen whether its eastern and western banks could work together for a united Syria after more than five decades of being ruled by the al-Assad family.</p></div></div></body></html>"
