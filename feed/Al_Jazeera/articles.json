aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Hong Kong firm CK Hutchison has announced the start of international arbitration proceedings against Panama after the country’s top court annulled its contract to operate two ports on the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/panama-court-rules-chinese-control-of-canal-ports-unconstitutional\">strategic Panama Canal</a> amid <a href=\"/video/talk-to-al-jazeera/2025/3/23/trump-threatens-to-seize-panama-canal-chief-defiant\">pressure from the United States.</a></p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The announcement on Wednesday comes as the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) said that Panama’s ruling against CK Hutchison subsidiary – the Panama Ports Company – was “absurd”, “shameful and pathetic”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The Panamanian court had “ignored the facts, breached trust, and seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises in Hong Kong, China”, the HKMAO said on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“China has sufficient means and tools, and sufficient strength and ability to defend a fair and just international economic and trade order,” the office said.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“Heavy prices both politically and economically will surely be paid” by Panama if it insists on going ahead with the ruling, the office warned.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The decision last week by Panama’s Supreme Court to annul the Hong Kong firm’s contract to operate two ports on the canal followed after US <a href=\"/opinions/2025/1/2/donald-trump-and-the-great-panama-canal-tantrum\">President Donald Trump</a> threatened to seize control of the crucial passageway that connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, claiming the waterway was effectively under Chinese control and therefore a security threat to Washington.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Without naming the US, the Chinese statement further said that “some country has … used bullying tactics to force other countries to obey their will,” and that Panama had “willingly succumbed” to hegemonic power.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">John Moolenaar, chairman of the US House Select Committee on China, called the Panama court’s decision a “win for America”.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The Panamanian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding China’s warning.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">CK Hutchison said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Wednesday that its board of directors “strongly disagrees with the determination and corresponding actions in Panama”.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“The group continues to consult with its legal counsel and reserves all rights, including recourse to additional national and international legal proceedings in the matter,” the company said.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Following the court ruling last week, the Panama Maritime Authority (AMP) announced that the Danish firm Maersk will temporarily take over the operation of two ports previously operated by the Hong Kong firm’s subsidiary.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The canal handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and 5 percent of world trade. The canal’s construction was paid for by the US, which operated it for a century before turning control over to Panama in 1999.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Neither did I. But how do you do an agreement, a pact? It’s not as between twin brothers. It’s between opponents,” Petro said.</p><p>Separately, Trump told reporters from the Oval Office that he felt good about the meeting. “I thought it was terrific,” he said.</p><p>On the agenda for the two leaders were issues including the fight against transnational drug trafficking and security in Latin America.</p><p>Here are five takeaways from Tuesday’s meeting.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"a-white-house-charm-offensive\">A White House charm offensive</h2><p>Over the past year, Trump has invited the media to participate in his meetings with foreign leaders, often holding news conferences with the visiting dignitaries in the Oval Office.</p><p>Not this time, however. The meeting between Trump and Petro lasted nearly two hours, all of it behind closed doors.</p><p>But the two leaders emerged with largely positive things to say about one another.</p><p>In a post on social media, Petro revealed that Trump had gifted him several items, including a <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2018764117893406985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commemorative photograph</a> of their meeting accompanied by a signed note.</p><p>“Gustavo – a great honor. I love Colombia,” it read, followed by Trump’s signature.</p><p>In another <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2018772658737869234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>, Petro showed off a signed copy of Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal. On its title page, Trump had scrawled another note to Petro: “You are great.”</p><p>“Can someone tell me what Trump said in this dedication?” Petro wrote jokingly in Spanish on social media. “I don’t understand much English.”</p><h2 id=\"a-turning-point-in-a-tense-relationship\">A turning point in a tense relationship?</h2><p>Petro’s joke appeared to be a cheeky nod to his notoriously rocky relationship with Trump.</p><p>It was only six days into Trump’s second term, on January 26, 2025, that he and Petro <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/2/4/petro-vs-trump-the-diplomatic-standoff-that-could-shape-colombias-future\">began their feud</a>, trading threats on social media over the fate of two US deportation flights.</p><p>Petro objected to the reported human rights violations facing the deportees. Trump, meanwhile, took Petro’s initial refusal to accept the flights as a threat to US “national security”. Petro ultimately backed down after Trump threatened steep sanctions on imported Colombian goods.</p><p>They continued to trade barbs in the months since. Petro, for instance, has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/family-of-man-slain-in-a-us-boat-strike-in-the-caribbean-lodges-complaint\">condemned the deadly US attacks</a> on boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, comparing the strikes with murder.</p><p>He has also criticised Trump for carrying out a US military offensive in Venezuela to abduct then-President Nicolas Maduro. That attack, Petro said, was tantamount to “kidnapping”.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, stripped Petro of his US visa following the Colombian leader’s appearance at the United Nations General Assembly, where he criticised the US and briefly joined a pro-Palestinian protest.</p><p>The Trump administration also sanctioned Petro in October, blaming the left-wing leader for allowing “drug cartels to flourish”.</p><p>After removing Maduro from power on January 3, Trump offered a warning to Petro: he had better “watch his a**”. The statement was widely interpreted to be a threat of military action against Colombia.</p><p>But Trump and Petro appeared to have reached a turning point last month. On January 7, the two leaders held their first call together. Tuesday’s in-person meeting marked another first in their relationship.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"agreeing-to-disagree\">Agreeing to disagree</h2><p>Despite the easing tensions, the two leaders used their public statements after the meeting to reaffirm their differences.</p><p>Trump was the first to speak, holding a news conference in the Oval Office as he signed legislation to end a government shutdown.</p><p>The US president, a member of the right-wing Republican Party, used the appearance to reflect on the political tensions the two leaders had in the lead-up to the meeting.</p><p>“He and I weren’t exactly the best of friends, but I wasn’t insulted, because I’d never met him,” Trump told reporters.</p><p>He added that Tuesday’s meeting was nevertheless pleasant. “I didn’t know him at all, and we got along very well.”</p><p>Petro, meanwhile, held a longer news conference at the Colombian Embassy in Washington, DC, where he raised some points of divergence he had with Trump.</p><p>Among the topics he mentioned was Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which the US has supported, and sustainable energy initiatives designed to be carbon neutral. Trump, in the past, has called the so-called green energy programmes a “scam”.</p><p>Petro, Colombia’s first left-wing leader, also reflected on his region’s history with colonialism and foreign intervention. He told reporters it was important that Latin America make decisions for itself, free from any outside “coercion”.</p><p>“ We don’t operate under blackmail,” he said at one point, in an apparent reference to Trump’s pressure campaigns.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"differing-approach-to-combating-drug-trafficking\">Differing approach to combating drug trafficking</h2><p>One of the primary points of contention, however, was Petro’s approach to combating drug trafficking.</p><p>Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, responsible for 68 percent of the global supply.</p><p>The Trump administration has used the fight against global drug trafficking as a justification for carrying out lethal military strikes in international waters and in Venezuela, despite experts condemning the attacks as illegal under international law.</p><p>It has also stripped Colombia of its certification as an ally in its global counter-narcotics operations.</p><p>Trump’s White House has <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/presidential-determination-on-major-drug-transit-or-major-illicit-drug-producing-countries-for-fiscal-year-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> it will consider reversing that decision if Petro takes “more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking”.</p><p>But Petro has rejected any attempt to label him as soft on drug trafficking, instead touting the historic drug busts his government has overseen.</p><p>He made this argument yet again after Tuesday’s meeting, claiming that no other Colombian administration had done as much as his to fight cocaine trafficking.</p><p>Rather than take a militarised approach to destroying crops of coca, the raw ingredient for cocaine, Petro argued that he has had more success with voluntary eradication programmes.</p><p>This push, he said, succeeded in “getting thousands of peasant farmers to uproot the plant themselves”.</p><p>“These are two different methods, two different ways of understanding how to fight drug trafficking,” Petro said. “One that is brutal and self-interested, and what it ends up doing is promoting mafia powers and drug traffickers, and another approach, which is intelligent, which is effective.”</p><p>Petro maintained it was more strategic to go after top drug-ring leaders than to punish impoverished rural farmers by forcibly ripping up their crops.</p><p>“I told President Trump, if you want an ally in fighting drug trafficking, it’s going after the top kingpins,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4286941\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4286941\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4286941\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26034840917917-1770173498.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gustavo Petro speaks at a podium\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4286941\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Colombian President Gustavo Petro speaks during a news conference at the Colombian Embassy in Washington, DC, on February 3 [Jose Luis Magana/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-trumpian-note\">A Trumpian note</h2><p>Tuesday’s meeting ultimately marked yet another high-profile reversal for Trump, who has a history of shifting his relationships with world leaders.</p><p>Last year, for instance, he lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a public Oval Office clash, only to warm to the wartime leader several months later.</p><p>But Colombia is quickly approaching a pivotal presidential election in May, which will see Petro’s left-wing coalition, the Historic Pact, seek to defend the presidency against an ascendant far right.</p><p>Petro himself cannot run for consecutive terms under Colombian law. But there is speculation that Tuesday’s detente with Trump may help Petro’s coalition avoid US condemnation ahead of the vote.</p><p>Colombia, after all, was until recently the largest recipient of US aid in South America, and it has long harboured close ties with the North American superpower. Straining those ties could therefore be seen as an election liability.</p><p>While Petro acknowledged his differences with Trump during his remarks, at times he expressed certain views that overlapped with the US president’s.</p><p>Like Trump has in the past, Petro used part of his speech on Tuesday to question the role of the UN in maintaining global security.</p><p>“ Did it not show incapacity? Isn’t a reform needed?” Petro asked, wondering aloud if there was “something superior to the United Nations that would bring humanity together better in a better way”.</p><p>But when it came to donning Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” baseball cap, Petro drew a line – or rather, a squiggle.</p><p>On social media, he shared an adjustment he made to the cap’s slogan. A jagged, Sharpie-inked “S” amended the phrase to include the entire Western Hemisphere: “Make Americas Great Again.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

After all, she had started protesting at age 15.</p><p>“They’ve pointed their guns at me, beaten me and almost arrested me. That’s when you realise that these people have no limits: They target the elderly, women and even young girls,” Angel said.</p><p>But the increasing political repression ultimately made her life in Merida, a college town in western Venezuela, untenable.</p><p>After 2024's disputed presidential election, Angel decided to voice her outrage on social media.</p><p>Maduro had claimed a third term in office, despite evidence that he had lost in a landslide. The opposition coalition obtained copies of more than 80 percent of the country's voter tallies, showing that its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, had won the race.</p><p>Protests again broke out, and again, Maduro's government responded with force.</p><p>Military and security officers detained nearly 2,000 people, including opposition leaders, journalists and human rights lawyers.</p><p>When Angel denounced the arbitrary detentions on TikTok, she began receiving daily threats.</p><p>By day, anonymous phone calls warned her of her impending arrest. By night, she heard pro-government gangs on motorcycles circling her home.</p><p>Fearing detention, she fled to Colombia in August 2024, leaving her family and friends behind.</p><p>But living outside Venezuela gave her a new perspective. She came to realise that the threats, persecution and violence she had learned to live with were not normal in a democratic country.</p><p>“When you leave, you realise that it isn’t normal to be afraid of the police, of unknown phone calls,” said Angel, her voice trembling. “I’m afraid to go back to my country and to be in that reality again.”</p><p>For exiled Venezuelans to return safely, Angel believes certain benchmarks must be met. The interim government must end arbitrary detention and allow opposition members, many of whom fled Venezuela, to return.</p><p>Only then, she explained, will Venezuela have moved past Maduro's legacy.</p><p>“Exiles being able to return is a real test of whether a new country is taking shape,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, NATO rejected the offer, and the bombardment of Libya continued.</p><p>By the end of June, the International Criminal Court (ICC) had issued an arrest warrant against Saif al-Islam, but he remained at large until after the <a href=\"/news/2011/10/21/muammar-gaddafi-killed-as-sirte-falls/\">death of his father</a> and his brother, Mutassim, in Sirte, on October 20, 2011.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"prison\">Prison</h2><p>Following long negotiations with the ICC, which had been calling for his extradition, Libyan officials were granted the authority to try Saif al-Islam in Libya for war crimes committed during the 2011 uprising.</p><p>At the time, Saif al-Islam’s defence lawyers feared that a trial in Libya would not be motivated by justice, but a desire for revenge. The UN estimated that up to 15,000 people were killed in the conflict, while Libya’s National Transitional Council placed the figure as high as 30,000.</p><p>In 2014, Saif al-Islam <a href=\"/news/2014/5/11/saif-al-islam-appears-before-libya-court\">appeared via videolink</a> in the Tripoli court where his trial was held, as he was imprisoned in Zintan at the time.

In July 2021, Saif al-Islam gave a rare interview to The New York Times, in which he accused authorities in Libya of being “afraid of … elections”.</p><p>Explaining his underground persona, he said he had “been away from the Libyan people for 10 years”.</p><p>“You need to come back slowly, slowly. Like a striptease,” he added.</p><p>He went on to make his first public appearance in years in November 2021, in the city of Sebha, where he filed to run for the Libyan presidency in an attempt to resurrect the ambitions of his father’s former supporters.</p><p>Initially banned from taking part, he was later reinstated, but the election did not take place as a result of Libya’s tumultuous political situation, with two rival administrations vying for power.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"progressive-face\">‘Progressive’ face</h2><p>A Western-educated and well-spoken man, Saif al-Islam presented a progressive face to the oppressive Libyan government. He received a PhD from the London School of Economics in 2008. His dissertation dealt with the role of civil society in reforming global governance.</p><p>He was prominent in his calls for political reform, and was extremely visible and active in the drive to repair Libya’s relations with the West between the year 2000 and the start of the 2011 uprising.</p><p>The London School of Economics was <a href=\"/news/2011/12/2/lse-slammed-over-gaddafi-ties\">later condemned</a> for having sought a relationship with the Libyan regime, namely for accepting Saif al-Islam as a student, who had signed an agreement for a $2.4m gift from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation on the day of his doctorate ceremony.</p><p>As an internationally prominent negotiator and influencer, Saif al-Islam could claim a number of victories and prominent roles. He played a pivotal role in the nuclear negotiations with Western powers, including the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html\">United States</a> and the UK.</p><p>He was also prominent when negotiating <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2003/08/2008491330697403.html\">compensation</a> for families of victims of the Lockerbie bombing, the Berlin nightclub attack, and the UTA Flight 772, which detonated over the Sahara Desert.</p><p>And he mediated the release of six medics – five of whom were Bulgarian – who were accused of infecting children with HIV in Libya in the late 1990s. The medics were imprisoned for eight years in 1999 and, upon their release, announced that they had been tortured while in detention.</p><p>He had several other proposals, including “Isratine”, a proposal for a permanent resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through a secular one-state solution. He also hosted peace talks between the Philippine government and leaders of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which resulted in a peace agreement that was signed in 2001.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The stock was up 2.1 percent from the market open in midday trading.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Walmart, which has 11,000 stores in 19 countries, joins a slate of nine corporate giants in the so-called trillion dollar club, including Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft, among others. Amazon is the only other retailer that has broken the barrier and is now valued at $2.6 trillion.</p><h2 id=\"trade-deal-bump\">Trade deal bump</h2><p>On Monday, United States President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with India that would slash tariffs to 18 percent from 50 percent and that impacts Walmart, which has strategically shifted supply chain operations to India and away from China.</p><p>On Tuesday, in an interview with CNBC, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said that the White House is still ironing out the details of the deal, but that still hasn’t slowed Walmart’s stock from <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">popping on the looming deal</a>.</p><p>“We have an announcement of an India deal, but still no timeline about when it comes into effect and whether the secondary tariffs, the 25 percent linked to India’s purchase of Russian oil, when those would be removed, so I think there’s still a lot of questions,” economist Rachel Ziemba, founder of Ziemba Insights, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>While there are limited details on the specifics of the deal, markets are responding to tariffs likely to come down.</p><p>“Markets are, of course, forward-looking. I think this sort of reinforces a view in the marketplace that incremental tariffs will be less this year,” Ziemba said.</p><p>The big box retailer jumped from 2 percent of its global exports coming from India in 2018 to 25 percent in 2023, according to a Reuters review of import data in 2023. Walmart hopes to source $10bn in goods from India by next year.</p><p>At the time, the company also decreased its percentage of goods from China to 60 percent from 80 percent.</p><p>Walmart did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), a lobby for exporters, said the cut in US tariffs will significantly boost Indian exports, including textiles and apparel, putting them on par with Asian peers, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.</p><p>According to data from ImportYeti, a platform that tracks import contracts for major companies, Walmart’s biggest import areas are in home fabrics, apparel and toys.</p><p>“Those are the products facing the highest tariffs, while consumer electronics and other categories have largely been shielded. If the India–US deal becomes a reality, it would put tariffs on Indian goods entering the US at roughly the same level as those from Southeast Asia, making that supply-chain realignment more attractive. You also highlight the importance of the Indian market,” Ziemba added.</p><p>While the trade deal is in focus, Walmart has also invested significantly in India domestically, as well, and holds an 80 percent stake in India’s e-commerce giant Flipkart.</p><h2 id=\"c-suite-changes\">C-suite changes</h2><p>The surge also comes concurrently with a shake-up in the C-suite. On Monday, John Furner took over as Walmart’s chief executive, succeeding longtime CEO Doug McMillion who announced his retirement late last year.</p><p>Furner, who started at the company in a job stocking shelves, has climbed up the ladder. Most recently, he served as the CEO of Walmart US, where he focused on key initiatives driving growth, including curbside pick-up. Prior to that, he served as the CEO of Sam’s Club, Walmart’s wholesale chain.</p><p>Furner’s appointment comes as the company grows as an e-commerce giant and intends to double down in AI tech, healthcare services, e-commerce, and hybrid options with its brick-and-mortar footprint.</p><p>“As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members,” Walmart said in a statement last month.</p><p>“Walmart is masterful at brick-and-mortar retail and remains highly competitive with Amazon. I love that because it shows consumerism is still alive and well. Five years ago, the narrative was the fall of the mall and the decline of retail. This confirms the opposite. Walmart also has a clear strategy for retaining consumers and managing the customer experience,” Brett Rose, CEO and founder of United National Consumer Suppliers (UNCS), a distributor that focuses on excess inventories, which it provides to more budget-friendly retailers, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The tech-centric focus comes as e-commerce has grown for the company, which reported a 28 percent jump in e-commerce sales compared with the previous quarter. Walmart is slated to release its next earnings report on February 19.</p><p>“What you need to look at is that Walmart has successfully become a marketplace, not as big as Amazon, but big enough to give it a run for its money,” said Rose.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The fall of its ally in Syria, <a href=\"/news/2024/12/8/syrias-bashar-al-assad-the-president-who-lost-his-homeland\">the al-Assad regime</a>, less than two weeks later, cut off a crucial land supply route used to transport financing and weapons from Iran.</p><p>The ceasefire stipulated that both Hezbollah and Israel would cease their attacks, Hezbollah would pull back its forces from south of the Litani River that runs across south Lebanon, and Israel would withdraw its forces from its northern neighbour.</p><p>But Israel has not stopped attacking Lebanon, and it continues to occupy five points in southern Lebanon. Other issues that are of importance to Hezbollah and the Lebanese state include the fate of Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails and reconstruction, which Israel has prevented through the repeated targeting of construction equipment.</p><p>Still, Hezbollah has only attacked Israel once since November 2024. The lone strike was in December 2024, when Hezbollah responded to repeated Israeli attacks by firing at an Israeli military post. No one was harmed, but Israel responded to that attack by killing 11 people in Lebanon.</p><p>In the months since, Israel has killed more than 330 people in Lebanon, including at least 127 civilians, and a top Hezbollah commander, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel\">Haytham Ali Tabatabai</a>.</p><p>“Hezbollah committed to the ceasefire in order to give the Lebanese state, government, and army the opportunity to implement the ceasefire and achieve demands through diplomatic means, as promised by the President of the Republic [Joseph Aoun],” Kassir said. “Furthermore, it wants to take the time to rebuild and allow people to return to their villages and homes.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-position-to-respond\">‘No position to respond’</h2><p>For years, Hezbollah’s military capacity acted as a deterrent to Israeli aggression. But that changed after the last war.</p><p>Analysts said that should Hezbollah respond, it would likely incur the wrath of Israel’s military, bringing back a scale of violence that displaced more than 1.2 million people and killed thousands.</p><p>“Hezbollah is simply in no position today to respond to Israel,” Lebanese political analyst Karim Emile Bitar told Al Jazeera. “Any retaliation from Lebanon would provoke an uproar in the domestic political arena, and it is also likely to be highly ineffective from a military standpoint. The party is simply too weak to enter into such an endeavour.”</p><p>“Israel has changed the rules of engagement through deep intelligence penetration, cyber-enabled targeting, AI-assisted surveillance, and precision strikes that degrade command, logistics, and leadership,” Imad Salamey, a political scientist at the Lebanese American University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is, however, one scenario that might force Hezbollah’s hand, analysts said. <a href=\"/news/2026/1/31/iranian-official-says-progress-made-on-talks-as-us-iran-tensions-persist\">An attack on Iran</a>, Hezbollah’s longtime benefactor, could kick the group into action.</p><p>On January 26, Hezbollah’s leader Naim Qassem delivered a televised speech addressing his party’s position on US threats to attack Iran.</p><p>“We are determined to defend ourselves,” Qassem said. “We will choose in due course how to act.”</p><p>Hezbollah is a notoriously secretive group. And following a war where the group felt exposed by Israeli intelligence, their secretiveness has likely intensified. Still, reports in local media and some analysts have spoken about a potential divide in the group over its position vis-a-vis Iran, and how disarmament should proceed, if at all.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-s-survival\">Iran’s survival</h2><p>With that in mind, some members of Hezbollah may view the survival of the Iranian government as existential and push them to attack the US’s most fervent regional ally, Israel.</p><p>“The only scenario in which [Hezbollah may attack Israel] is if there is a genuine, clear and present existential danger to the very survival of the Iranian regime and if the Iranian regime orders all its regional proxies to go all in,” Bitar said. “Otherwise, I think Hezbollah is most likely to stay out of it.”</p><p>Salamey said that only a “dramatic external shock” like a regional war including Iran would draw in the group. Otherwise, any response “would likely require a clear crossing of red lines that directly threaten Hezbollah’s core survival, not symbolic or tactical losses.”</p><p>Still, he said, “any response would likely be limited, calibrated, and asymmetric, aimed at signalling relevance rather than triggering full-scale war. Hezbollah currently lacks the strategic confidence, logistical depth, and political cover needed for broad escalation.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Growing tensions between the United States and Iran have left the two countries one spark away from a fire. An unprecedented accumulation of US military forces in the Middle East, coupled with Washington’s reliance on gunboat diplomacy, has distinctly increased the risk of war—one that engulfs Iran and the region, with far-reaching regional and global costs.</p><p>In the aftermath of the recent crackdown on protests in Iran, US President Donald Trump announced that it was time to remove Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His administration then deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and supporting warplanes, along with various air defence assets—including additional THAAD and Patriot missile systems—across the Middle East.</p><p>As military assets have been accumulated, Trump has threatened that if Iran does not agree to a deal, “the next attack will be far worse” than last June’s US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>From the US perspective, a favourable agreement would require Iran to demolish its nuclear enrichment programme and ballistic missile capabilities, while also pulling back its regional influence. Such maximum demands, combined with Tehran’s deep distrust of negotiations with the US, make a deal highly unlikely. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, clarified on Monday that civilian nuclear capability, as well as missile and drone capabilities, represent a “red line” for Tehran.</p><p>This does not necessarily signal a permanent diplomatic stalemate. However, Tehran interprets the US’s maximum demands as a potential threat of regime change—a notion repeatedly emphasised by Trump and hawks in Washington and Tel Aviv. In this context, another US strike would represent an “existential threat” to the Islamic Republic, eliminating any incentive for restraint.</p><p>The impact of any US military action against Iran would principally depend on the attack’s type, scale, and targets, potentially triggering a severe crisis in Iran, across the region, and globally.</p><p>Trump favours surgical and targeted military operations, which would probably combine leadership decapitation with efforts to significantly damage Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) military bases, Basij units—a paramilitary force under IRGC control—and police stations, which the US designates as responsible for firing on demonstrators.</p><p>Any US effort to impose regime change through military means would undoubtedly lead to dangerous outcomes domestically and regionally. In Iran, an attack could lead to the consolidation of power. But it could also lead to a full takeover by the IRGC or even internal conflict.</p><p>An attack on Iran similar to the one last year could well result in the Iranian people rallying behind the flag and rejecting regime change for several reasons. First, the Iranian people are afraid of a scenario similar to Syria and Libya where there is state collapse. Second, there is no credible moderate opposition that can lead change. Third, there is strong sociopolitical cohesion within Iran.</p><p>Political institutions, the military, and the IRGC are well-organised and benefit from substantial resources generated by a sanctions-induced rentier system. Moreover, significant segments of society—particularly the working-class groups often referred to as “revolutionaries”—are aligned with this structure.</p><p>If the attack is successful in targeting senior leadership of the Islamic Republic, this could bring about a succession crisis, create decision-making vacuums, and deepen competition within the regime. Under these circumstances, tensions between state institutions and military-security entities would grow. Given the concentration of hard power in the hands of the IRGC, the probability of establishing a military-dominated state would expand.</p><p>The US and Israel may also try to encourage the outbreak of civil war to geopolitically weaken Iran. Last month, there were calls from some US officials, such as Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, to arm Iranian protesters. That could easily extend to armed groups, and there are a number of those that have clashed with the Iranian authorities that the US can turn to.</p><p>Among them are the <a href=\"/news/2023/6/21/why-was-this-iran-dissident-group-raided-in-europe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mojahedin-e Khalq</a> (MEK), formerly designated as a “terrorist” organisation by the US and the European Union (EU); the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK), an armed Kurdish group looking for the secession of Iran’s western Kurdistan province; <a href=\"/news/2018/9/22/iran-who-was-responsible-for-the-deadly-attack-in-ahvaz\">Al-Ahwaziya</a>, an Arab nationalist movement supporting the separation of the oil-rich Khuzestan province in the southwest; <a href=\"/news/2019/2/16/iran-warns-pakistan-to-crack-down-on-jaish-al-adl\">Jaish al-Adl</a> (Jundallah), an armed group operating in southeastern Iran; and pan-Turkic groups in the northwest chasing the alliance of Turkic populations across Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Iran.</p><p>Facing Washington’s continuing escalatory rhetoric and track record of regime change operations, Iran has adopted a so-called madman strategy, simultaneously issuing conciliatory and confrontational signals. This posture is apparent in Tehran’s expressed openness to establishing a framework of negotiations with the US, alongside Khamenei’s speech on Monday, which <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">warned</a> that any military attack on Iran would cause a “regional war”, underscoring the state’s prevailing priority of thwarting regime change at any cost—even at the risk of regional and global consequences.</p><p>Iran has made clear that it will retaliate, including through allied forces in the region, potentially drawing Israel and Gulf states into a broader regional skirmish. This would trigger political instability and economic vulnerability, which in turn may prompt substantial capital flight, chiefly from the Gulf states, as well as increasing flows of refugees and migrants to Europe.</p><p>Moreover, if Iran attacks shipping in the Strait of Hormuz or Gulf energy infrastructure, there would be a spike in global oil and gas prices, exacerbating market volatility, inflationary pressure from higher energy costs, and a knock-on effect for fragile economies, which would further worsen migration pressures.</p><p>In the current situation, any US military escalation poses a risk not just for Iran but for the whole region. Middle Eastern history demonstrates that once a conflict is triggered, it spreads like a wildfire, destabilising the whole region in unpredictable ways.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

And it “continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters”.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the Iranian authorities.</p><p>Iran’s Tasnim news agency, citing an unnamed source with knowledge of the matter, reported that communication was lost with a drone – which had “successfully” sent data back to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – in international waters.</p><p>Tasnim said an investigation was under way to determine why the disconnection took place.</p><p>After the shoot-down, CENTCOM said that IRGC forces also harassed a US-flagged and US-crewed merchant vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, a Gulf waterway <a href=\"/news/2025/6/14/what-is-the-strait-of-hormuz-could-it-factor-into-israel-iran-conflict\">critical to global trade</a>.</p><p>“Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” it said.</p><p>Iran’s Fars news agency cited unnamed Iranian officials as saying later in the day that a vessel had entered Iranian territorial waters without the necessary legal permits.</p><p>The officials said the vessel was warned and left the area “without any special security event taking place”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"talks-expected\">Talks expected</h2><p>The two incidents did not appear to alter plans for the talks, which are expected to take place on Friday.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, “is set to have conversations with the Iranians later this week”.</p><p>“Those are still scheduled as of right now,” Leavitt said.</p><p>Tasnim quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesperson as saying consultations were under way to select a venue for the meeting, with Turkiye, Oman and several other countries in the region having offered to host.</p><p>The Associated Press news agency, citing an unnamed Turkish official, said foreign ministers from Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have also been invited to attend the talks, if they happen.</p><p>Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was working with contacts in Iran at the highest levels to de-escalate the situation. “All of us in the region collectively… are making the right connections and contacts to make sure we are playing a positive role,” said Majed Al Ansari, a spokesman for the ministry.</p><p>“Qatar is not standing alone on this, we are working together in tandem to make sure we de-escalate and protect our region and make sure there are not more escalations,” he added.</p><p>The Reuters news agency meanwhile reported that Iran is demanding that the talks be held in Oman, not Turkiye, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way negotiations on nuclear issues only. The agency cited an unnamed regional source.</p><p>Last year, US and Iranian officials held five rounds of talks in Oman, until discussions were suspended due to Israel’s 12-day war on Iran, which Washington later joined.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from Tehran, said Iranian officials were “looking for a pragmatic approach to these talks” but that the exact topics of discussion remain unclear.</p><p>Iranian officials have said they want the negotiations to focus on the country’s nuclear programme, while Washington reportedly wants to discuss a range of issues, including Iran’s ties to regional armed groups as well as its ballistic missile and defence programmes.</p><p>“Of course, we’ve also got a trust issue, and we have to remember that there were talks in June, when the US and Israel attacked Iran, targeting its nuclear facilities, nuclear scientists, military headquarters, as well as civilian infrastructure,” he added.</p><p>Analysts, meanwhile, say they do not believe the talks can be fruitful.</p><p>“The question is, will this lead to anything? I have not seen any signals from Washington or Tehran suggesting that either side is willing to, if you will, soften their red lines,” said Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC.</p><p>“So, unless that changes, unless there is a last-minute surprise by either the American or Iranian side, then I can’t really see how holding diplomatic talks might take this crisis in a peaceful direction,” he said.</p><p>Vatanka added that, this time, the US was “flexing muscle” and “posturing” a lot more.</p><p>“The question is, is the US deploying all of these military assets to really get the Iranian attention on the need for a deal soon rather than later? Or is it perhaps preparing for something protracted, in terms of a political project that looks like regime change in the Islamic Republic?” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Violence is ongoing elsewhere – from Myanmar’s civil war to conflict in Nigeria. Drone attacks targeting noncombatants have become commonplace in Ukraine while massacres of civilians across multiple conflicts continue, including in Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Yemen – all with apparent impunity.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The United States, historically the self-appointed world’s police officer, is <a href=\"/news/2025/3/16/is-trump-the-end-of-the-international-rules-based-order\">in retreat</a> and unwilling to uphold the humanitarian laws that for decades have provided some protection for civilians trapped in conflicts. That has left those laws under unprecedented strain around the world, the <a href=\"https://geneva-academy.ch/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WarWATCH-IHL-in-Focus-Report-2024-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> of 23 of the world’s conflicts conducted by the academy concluded.</p><p>“The years 2024 and 2025 proved devastating to civilians with little evidence of willingness among warring parties to limit the barbarity inflicted upon the most vulnerable,” begins the report, War Watch, which tracked breaches of international humanitarian law in the conflicts from July 2024 to December.</p><p>The Geneva academy is a joint initiative of the University of Geneva’s Faculty of Law and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies.</p><p>“Murder, torture, and rape were widespread; civilians and their homes, schools, and hospitals were bombed regularly and sometimes systematically. Genocide – the intended destruction of a protected national, ethnic, religious, or racial group – was found by a United Nations Commission of Inquiry to have been perpetrated against Palestinians in Gaza by Israel. In October 2025, the spectre of genocide was revived in Sudan,” it said in the report, released on Monday, adding that while the threat to international humanitarian law was not yet existential, “it is at a critical breaking point.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"few-consequences\">Few consequences</h2><p>The academy’s report cast the world in an unforgiving light. Over the reporting period, civilians were abused, dispossessed and slaughtered on an almost industrial scale, it said.</p><p>Beyond Israel’s genocide in Gaza, which has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, the research noted the ongoing carnage of Russia’s war in Ukraine, where the killing of civilians is escalating as the conflict grinds on and more people have been killed in the past year than during the conflict’s previous two years.</p><p>Rape and gender-based and sexual violence have been documented across a series of conflicts, from Sudan, where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was <a href=\"/news/2025/10/29/massacre-in-el-fasher-whats-happening-in-sudan-right-now\">accused</a> of massacring civilians in the western city of el-Fasher, to what the report called the “epidemic” of rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p><p>Drone attacks against civilians have become a defining feature in multiple conflicts while, in Myanmar, the military government was accused of continuing to attack civilians. In one village, the report noted, residents who had fled returned to find that the few neighbours who remained behind had been dismembered and their heads placed upon a fence.</p><p>All appeared to be taking place with few consequences for the perpetrators.</p><p>“If you don’t sanction or communicate that there will be a sanction, illegal acts will continue,” the report’s lead author, Stuart Casey-Maslen, told Al Jazeera. “Genocide isn’t new. We saw evidence of genocide in [Sudan’s] Darfur around 2004, but as one of the UN experts that helped launch the report pointed out, extermination is ongoing in multiple areas of Sudan. We’re seeing gang rape being carried out by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the street with impunity, and the US, which could bring pressure on the UAE [which is accused of but denies arming the RSF] isn’t acting.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"decline\">Decline</h2><p>The strain upon international humanitarian law is not the fault of the US alone, Casey-Maslen said,  Equally responsible were other actors, such as Russia, whose disregard for humanitarian law in Ukraine, the report’s authors said, has become almost systematic.</p><p>However, few would doubt that the US’s unquestioning support for Israel in its war on Gaza has gone a long way to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-is-the-rules-based-order-finished\">undermining</a> the principles of the humanitarian law it had historically claimed to champion.</p><p>Through two years of unremitting war, Israel has been accused of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/israeli-attacks-wound-civilians-across-gaza-in-latest-ceasefire-violations\">targetting civilians</a> and engaging in <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/what-we-know-about-the-torture-abuse-of-palestinian-prisoners-by-israel\">torture</a>, including <a href=\"/news/2024/8/9/everything-is-legitimate-israeli-leaders-defend-soldiers-accused-of-rape\">rape</a>, and the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/israel-accepts-gazas-70000-death-toll-a-record-of-denialism-lies\">slaughter</a> of civilians, all with US support.</p><p>“It has been obvious for some time that international humanitarian law has been dying in front of us,” said Geoffrey Nice, a human rights lawyer and former lead prosecutor in the war crimes trial of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. “There has been a time lag between those with prescience but no official responsibility pointing this out and governments with responsibility explaining it to their voters, but here we are.”</p><p>US President Donald Trump’s second term in office has made observers particularly worried about the future of international law as his administration makes clear it is willing to ignore key aspects of it and carry out acts that are at best dubious under international law, such as the <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduction\">abduction</a> of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>And according to Nice, Trump’s policy was already clear from his first term in office.</p><p>“For those paying attention, the first real sign was Trump’s speech to the UN during his first term when [in 2018] he <a href=\"/news/2018/6/20/us-withdrawal-from-un-human-rights-council-what-you-need-to-know\">withdrew</a> from the Human Rights Council and expounded on a theme of sovereignty that seemed to evoke a kind of Westphalian world,” he said, referring to the principle in international relations in which each state retains absolute sovereignty over their own territory.</p><p>In the wake of his attack on Venezuela in early January, Trump went further still, telling The New York Times that the only constraint upon him was, not international law, but his “own morality”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h2><p>Richard Gowan, the International Crisis Group’s programme director, said the report aligns closely with his organisation’s reporting from various warzones.</p><p>”Tragically, we see a growing number of armed groups targeting civilians in the knowledge that they are unlikely to face real political or legal penalties.</p><p>“There is a widespread sense that the laws of war are breaking down, and this is likely to lead to a vicious cycle in which combatants increasingly resort to atrocities to gain tactical or strategic advantage,” he said.</p><p>However, while international humanitarian law has been under unprecedented strain, its centre could still hold, Casey-Maslen suggested.</p><p>Organisations such as the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court still have a huge role to play in ensuring that the protections afforded civilians under humanitarian law are maintained as long as those organisations themselves are respected, funded and not regarded as a convenience.</p><p>Likewise, states that still cling to the idea of international law could still exert influence over how their allies behave, Casey-Maslen said, pointing to the relatively limited number of civilian deaths that Western-equipped Ukraine had been accused of causing in comparison with Russia. What is critical, he said, was to retain the value of international law for all.</p><p>“When we lose international law, everyone loses, ” he said. “The Global South typically pays in lives and blood, and the West loses any sense of moral authority. We all end up poorer as a result.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
