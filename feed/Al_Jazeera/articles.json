At the end of a third round of nuclear talks in Geneva on Thursday, Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi, acting as a mediator, announced that “significant progress” had been achieved and said technical talks were expected to resume on Monday.</p><p>“Iran has agreed to give up its stockpile of enriched material – zero accumulation and allow for full verification by the IAEA of its nuclear programme,” CBS News reported, quoting Albusaidi as saying. “With zero stockpiling, it becomes impossible to build a bomb regardless of enrichment levels,” he added, according to CBS.</p><p>Tehran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, has repeatedly said its nuclear programme was intended for civilian purposes and it has no intention to build atomic weapons.</p><p>Netanyahu has been calling for military action to destroy Iran’s nuclear capabilities, saying that Tehran’s atomic facilities constitute an existential threat to Israel.</p><p>US and Israeli officials have said the attacks on Saturday targeted Iranian officials, missile storage and launching sites, and Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>Iranian media reported strikes on the Ministry of Intelligence, the Ministry of Defence, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran and the Parchin military complex.</p><p>Iran responded with attacks on Israel, as well as on bases used by the US military across the Gulf region, including in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p><strong>Negotiations under threat</strong></p><p>Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history, has long built his career around an objective of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p><p>In 2015, he vehemently opposed a nuclear deal that then US President Barack Obama had reached, together with Western allies, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for easing of sanctions imposed on Tehran.</p><p>Trump officially withdrew from the agreement in 2018, calling it a horrible deal, and reimposed sanctions on Tehran as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign to force Iran to renegotiate the deal.</p><p>Netanyahu found his opportunity to move against Tehran after Trump won his second term in office. With Israel embroiled in its genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, raid on Israel, Netanyahu, with a green light from the United States, launched his attack on Iran on June 13, 2025. The US briefly joined in the campaign, bombing several nuclear facilities.</p><p>Although Trump had proclaimed that US strikes had destroyed Iran’s nuclear capabilities, he had pushed for Iran to completely dismantle its nuclear programme, a demand Tehran rejects.</p><p>The US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford.</p><p>Analysts say that while Trump had spoken about the need to ensure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon, Netanyahu was pushing for Tehran to agree to negotiate its missile capabilities, including reducing their range to a “300-kilometre (185-mile) red line”.</p><p>Netanyahu also demanded that the United States push Tehran to stop supporting proxy allies in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.</p><p>While Israel says it emerged from the 12-day war in June with a strategic victory, Iranian missiles also inflicted heavy damage on Israeli cities. Up to 33 people were killed in the attacks, compared with more than 600 Iranians, while more than 3,000 others were hospitalised.</p><p><strong>What’s next</strong></p><p>While it is clear that Iran’s military capabilities do not compare with those of the United States and Israel, it is too early to predict how this confrontation will end.</p><p>US officials have been wary of the possibility of being drawn into a prolonged conflict in the Middle East, like the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Trump had criticised as a “disastrous mistake”, while Iranian officials have said that the US would find itself in a quagmire if it attacked.</p><p>The Washington Post has reported that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine had warned him of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/iran-says-ready-for-talks-but-will-defend-itself-against-us-aggression\">potential risks of attacking Iran</a>, including becoming entangled in a prolonged conflict and the possibility of US casualties.</p><p>On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance was quoted by The Washington Post as saying that there is “no chance” that US strikes on Iran would result in the United States becoming involved in a years-long, drawn-out war.</p><p class=\"speakable\">“The idea that we’re going to be in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight — there is no chance that will happen,” Vance said on Thursday, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/26/vance-no-chance-us-will-be-drawn-out-war-middle-east/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the outlet</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Once their engines are cut off, the missile follows a predetermined path, re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere in a steep descent before striking its target.</p><p>Ballistic missiles travel at extremely high speeds, allowing them to travel thousands of kilometres (miles) in just minutes.</p><p>The speed at which they travel is measured in Mach, a unit equivalent to the speed of sound; for example, Mach 5 means five times the speed of sound.</p><p>Some, usually shorter-range, ballistic missiles reach supersonic speeds (faster than Mach 1, or about 1,225 kilometres per hour or 761 miles per hour), while others, usually longer-range missiles, can travel at hypersonic speeds – greater than Mach 5 (6,125km/h or 3,806mph).</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340132\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-how-do-ballistic-missiles-work-FEB25-2026-1772104766.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - how do ballistic missiles work - FEB25, 2026-1772104766\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>What makes ballistic missiles especially dangerous is their combination of long range, high speed, and how difficult they are to intercept.</p><p>Their fast, high-flight path gives defence systems little time to react, and when they re-enter the atmosphere, they descend even faster, making interception even more difficult. Some missiles also deploy decoys or other countermeasures to trick radar and missile defences, making them harder to intercept.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-missile-arsenal\">Israel’s missile arsenal</h2><p>Israel has an advanced missile arsenal, including long-range and nuclear-capable systems, developed with decades of support from the US.

The David’s Sling intercepts missiles ranging between 40km (25 miles) and 300km (186 miles).

Israeli media have reported the killing of General Mohammad Pakpour, a commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Ali Shamkhani, adviser to the supreme leader, and Amir Nasirzadeh, Iran’s defence minister.</p><p>Israel is clearly trying to reassure its citizens that it has the capability of reaching deep into Iran’s top layer of leaders.</p><p>But there has been no confirmation of leadership deaths so far from Tehran. Iranian media have claimed that Khamenei and Pezeshkian are safe and has reported instead on an air strike on a girls’ school in the city of Minab, with a death toll of at least 80.</p><p>Unlike the 12-day war last June, when Iran’s retaliation was slow and measured, this time around, the Iranian armed forces retaliated almost immediately. Ballistic missiles were fired at US bases in Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, as well as Israeli cities like Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Eilat.</p><p>The speed of Iran’s retaliation indicates that it had anticipated these attacks and had its retaliation plans ready. The question now is whether Iran can outlast US resolve, which faces both domestic and international pressure.</p><h2 id=\"domestic-dangers\">Domestic dangers</h2><p>Trump launched the war on Iran amid little enthusiasm among Americans for another foreign conflict. A recent poll by YouGov and The Economist suggests that just 27 percent of the US public supports the US using military force against Iran. Another survey conducted by the University of Maryland registered even lower approval: 21 percent.</p><p>The war has significant domestic political ramifications for Trump. As the operation progresses, if Iran fails to surrender, the US president will be caught between getting bogged down in a protracted conflict by escalating, and being seen as weak if he backs down.</p><p>As the midterm elections approach, the war will become a litmus test for Trump’s presidency. If the conflict does not go as the president has envisioned, it could reflect poorly on the Republican Party in the polls. If the GOP loses control of Congress to the Democrats, it would prevent Trump from pursuing his political agenda. Democrats gaining control of Congress could pile more impeachment pressure on Trump.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-victory\">What is victory?</h2><p>No analyst thinks this war will be short. Unlike the 12-day war, which resulted in a ceasefire, this conflict already looks broader and deeper. Iran’s readiness to retaliate across the region suggests it is willing to wage a long war rather than compromise.</p><p>One problem Washington and Tel Aviv are facing is how to keep the pressure on Tehran without creating uncontrollable instability in the region. The other problem they have is that they put regime change as their ultimate goal.</p><p>In his speech announcing the attack on Iran, the US president appeared to suggest that the US army would stick to an aerial campaign and would not deploy troops on the ground. He appeared to put the responsibility for toppling the Iranian government in the hands of the Iranian people, saying “the hour of your freedom is at hand” and calling on them to rebel.</p><p>This call comes two months after Iran witnessed unprecedented mass protests across the country. The Iranian authorities, however, launched a brutal campaign of repression, killing thousands. At the moment, a similar wave of mass protests seems unlikely. That legacy of repression weighs heavily on society, and Iran appears resilient.</p><p>Meanwhile, leadership “decapitation strikes” by the US and Israel will likely continue, but even if successful, they would not produce regime change.</p><p>Eventually, Trump’s generals may advise that prolonged conflict is unsustainable, echoing the lessons of the 12-day war. For Trump, an unwinnable war would invite a familiar exit strategy: Declaring victory on Truth Social and shifting the narrative.</p><p>The challenge then would be how to negotiate a ceasefire. Having been misled twice by the smokescreen of negotiations, Tehran could use this double betrayal to harden its position. If the regime survives, it could exploit US desperation for renewed talks to extract concessions. In that sense, diplomacy’s collapse today may set the stage for Iran to negotiate from a position of strength tomorrow.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Not really because we’re greatly invested in the future of the Iranian people, but because, through the genocide on Gaza, we’ve devalued human life,” he said, referring to the Israeli attacks on the besieged territory since October 2023.</p><p>Returning to shelters around the country is now the stuff of everyday life for most Israelis, he said.</p><p>Israel has been on high alert since it launched a wave of attacks on Iran, the country that its leaders have consistently portrayed as its nemesis for decades.</p><p>Announcing the attack through a video post on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu framed the attack in characteristically apocalyptic terms, saying Israel and the US had launched attacks to “remove the existential threat posed [to Israel] by the terror regime in Iran”, and going on to call upon the Iranian people to rise against their own leaders in response to the US and Israeli unprovoked strikes upon their cities.</p><p>Iran has retaliated with its own waves of missiles and drones against Israel and US assets in the region. At least one person was reported wounded in northern Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But the latest strikes against Iran were met warmly by Israel’s political elite.</p><p>“I want to remind us all: The people of Israel are strong. The IDF [Israeli army] and the Air Force are strong. The strongest power in the world stands with us,” opposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on social media, referring to the US.</p><p>“In moments like these we stand together – and we win together. There is no coalition and no opposition, only one people and one IDF, with all of us behind them.”</p><p>In a subsequent post written in Farsi, he echoed the prime minister’s calls for Iran to enact regime change from within, a longstanding Israeli policy.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-crazy\">‘It’s crazy’</h2><p>Accounts of the relative calm in Israel stand in sharp contrast to previous escalations, when sources described panic and bulk buying before an anticipated Iranian response to the wave of strikes Israel launched against targets in Iran.</p><p>“People here are well trained,” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Palestinian member of the Israeli parliament representing the left-wing Hadash-Ta’al faction, which is almost alone in opposing the strikes, said from her apartment near Haifa, where she had just returned from her shelter.</p><p>“This is what they’re saying all the time in the media: How well-trained and ready we are. It’s crazy. I don’t think any country in the world has experienced more war than we have, so this is what they mean by ‘trained’,” she said, referencing the wars on Iran, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza that Israel has waged since the Hamas-led attack of October 2023.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>As Touma-Suleiman spoke, she was interrupted by an alarm on her phone. “That’s not the alert. That’s a warning on my phone telling me there’s going to be an alert and then I’ll have to return to the shelter,” she explained, laughing drily. “You see what I mean about being well trained?”</p><p>Texting from Israel, Ahron Bregman, a senior teaching fellow at the Department for War Studies at King’s College London, described the relative calm and almost relief felt by many within the country that the uncertainty over war with Iran was at an end.</p><p>“Both Israel and the US are after the Iranian leadership. They hope to weaken it substantially, though I doubt they could topple it from the air,” he said, raising the possibility of a prolonged conflict.</p><p>However, how ready Israel might be for a lengthy war, and to what degree that might be Israel’s choice, was far from certain, Touma-Suleiman said.</p><p>“It will be the United States that determines how long the war will be. They’ll continue until they’ve achieved whatever it is they want,” she said.</p><p>“I don’t think Israel is ready for that. People are exhausted. The army is exhausted. I don’t know if they even have the reserves to manage a long war, and this is what Netanyahu is willing to gamble with, just so he can say to the public before elections: ‘Here is at least one victory.'”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/trump-talks-of-annihilation-elimination-as-us-israel-attack-iran\">pledged to raze Iran’s missile industry</a> and destroy its navy, while urging the Iranian people to overthrow the government.</p><p><strong>Israel</strong></p><p>A senior Israeli defence official told the Reuters news agency the joint US-Israeli attacks had been planned for months, with a specific date set weeks ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the attacks aimed to remove an “existential threat” posed by Iran. He said the attacks would “create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Iran</strong></p><p>Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Israel and the US of violating the United Nations charter with their attacks and pledged a harsh response, as the country waged retaliatory attacks on Israel as well as in several Gulf states that host US military assets, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. “All American and Israeli assets and interests in the Middle East have become a legitimate target,” a senior Iranian official told Al Jazeera. “There are no red lines after this aggression.”</p><p><strong>Hezbollah </strong></p><p>Lebanon’s Hezbollah condemned the US-Israeli attacks as a “blatant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter”, saying it was an attempt to destabilise the region and force its people “to accept domination and occupation schemes”.</p><p>It declared solidarity with Iran and called on people in the region to “confront this aggressive plan and recognise its danger”.</p><p><strong>United Nations </strong></p><p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the “military escalation” and called for an “immediate cessation of hostilities”.</p><p>“The use of force by the United States and Israel against Iran, and the subsequent retaliation by Iran across the region, undermine international peace and security,” he said, warning of the risks of a wider regional conflict with “grave consequences for civilians and regional stability”.</p><p>The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Saturday.</p><p><strong>European Union</strong></p><p>European ⁠Commission President ⁠Ursula von der Leyen and European Council ⁠President Antonio Costa called the conflict “greatly concerning” and urged all parties “to exercise maximum restraint, to protect civilians, ‌and to fully respect international law”.</p><p><strong>Red Cross</strong></p><p>Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, called on countries to respect the rules of war and urged them to find the political will to prevent “further death and destruction”. She warned that “a dangerous chain reaction” of military escalation was under way across the Middle East, “with potentially devastating consequences for civilians”.</p><p><strong>Oman</strong></p><p>The main mediator in ongoing US-Iran negotiations, Oman expressed dismay at the outbreak of violence. Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the conflict would not serve US interests, nor the interests of global peace, and urged Washington “not to get sucked in” further.</p><p>The country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on “all parties to immediately cease military operations” and for “the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to impose a ceasefire”.</p><p><strong>Germany, France, the UK</strong></p><p>In a joint statement, the prime ministers of the three countries said they “condemn Iranian attacks on countries in the region in the strongest terms” and remain committed “to regional stability and to the protection of civilian ⁠life.” They also said they ‌want a resumption of US-Iran negotiations.</p><p>Separately, French President Emmanuel Macron ⁠called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council, ⁠saying the conflict carries “serious consequences” for international peace and security. “The current escalation is dangerous for everyone. It must stop,” he said.</p><p></p><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an address that UK forces “are active and British planes are in the sky today as part of coordinated regional defensive operations”.</p><p>“Iran can end this now,” he said, calling on them to “give up their weapons programmes, and cease the appalling violence and repression against the Iranian people”.</p><p><strong>Qatar</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned Iran for firing missiles at Qatari territory, which is home to the Al Udeid Air Base that hosts US troops. The ministry called the attacks a flagrant violation of Qatar’s national sovereignty and a direct assault on its security. It added that Qatar reserves the right to respond, as per international law.</p><p><strong>United Arab Emirates</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Defence condemned in the “strongest terms” Iran’s attacks on its territory, several of which it said its air defences intercepted. It called the attack “a dangerous escalation and a cowardly act that threatens the security and safety of civilians”, stressing that the UAE has the “full right” to respond.</p><p><strong>Bahrain</strong></p><p>Bahrain confirmed that an Iranian missile attack targeted the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet that it hosts, and called the attack “treacherous”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Kuwait</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the Iranian attack on its soil as a “flagrant violation” of international law and said it had the right to respond. It warned that any additional escalation would only deepen regional instability.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></p><p>Saudi Arabia condemned in the “strongest terms” the Iranian attacks on Gulf Arab states and warned of “dire consequences”.</p><p><strong>Turkiye</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on “all parties” to end the spiral of violence, which it stressed started with US-Israeli attacks on Iran. “The events that began with Israel and the US attacking Iran, and continued with Iran targeting third countries, are of a nature that risks the future of our region and global stability,” said the ministry.</p><p id=\"pakistan\"><strong>Pakistan</strong></p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran and called for an immediate halt to escalation through urgent resumption of diplomacy to achieve a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis”.</p><p><strong>Russia</strong></p><p>Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, accused the US of having used its nuclear talks with Iran as a cover-up before military operations. The country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the international community to swiftly deliver an objective assessment of what it called irresponsible ⁠actions that risk ⁠further destabilising the region.</p><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged “an immediate halt to military actions” and appealed for “the resumption of dialogue and negotiations” to maintain regional peace and stability. It stressed that “Iran’s national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity should be respected.”</p><p><strong>India</strong></p><p>The Ministry of External Affairs called on all parties to “exercise restraint” and “avoid escalation”. It said “dialogue and diplomacy should be pursued” and that “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be respected.” The statement came several days after the country’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/indias-modi-addresses-israeli-parliament-on-first-day-of-visit\">Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Israel</a> and hailed their “vital” partnership.</p><p><strong>Ukraine</strong></p><p>The ⁠Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Iran of being responsible for the chain of events leading to the conflict, including its <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\">crackdown on protests earlier this year</a>. “The cause of the current ⁠events is precisely ⁠the violence and impunity of the Iranian regime, ⁠in particular the killings and ⁠repression of ⁠peaceful protesters, which have become particularly widespread in recent ‌months,” said the Foreign Ministry.</p><p><strong>Norway</strong></p><p>Foreign Minister Espen Barth said the initial attack on Iran by Israel breached standards of international law. “The attack is ⁠described by Israel as a preventive strike, but ⁠it is not in line with international law,” said Barth. “Preventive attacks require an immediately imminent threat.”</p><p><strong>Belgium </strong></p><p>Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said the Iranian people “must not pay the price for their government’s choices. We deeply regret that diplomatic efforts could not lead earlier to a negotiated solution.”</p><p><strong>Canada</strong></p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the country stands with the Iranian people and “reaffirms Israel’s right to defend itself and to ensure the security of its people.” He said Canada supports the US “acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon”.</p><p><strong>Ireland</strong></p><p>Ireland’s prime minister, Michael Martin, strongly urged all parties to “exercise restraint” to avoid escalation and wider conflict.</p><p>“The protection of civilian life in Iran, in Israel and in all neighbouring countries must now be paramount,” he said.</p><p><strong>Venezuela</strong></p><p>The government of Venezuela said that it “condemns and regrets deeply that, in a context in which diplomatic efforts and ongoing negotiations are being developed, the military route was opted for, through attacks against Iran.” It also described Tehran’s response as “undue and condemnable”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

So the thought was very simple, and we are enjoying it.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4288497\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4288497\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4288497\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-STADIUMS-T20-MENS-CRICKET-WORLD-CUP-2026-FEB3-2026-1770220847.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE -STADIUMS- T20 MEN'S CRICKET WORLD CUP - 2026 - FEB3, 2026-1770220847\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4288497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-the-last-t20-between-india-and-west-indies\">What happened in the last T20 between India and West Indies?</h2><p>This will be the first T20 meeting between the sides since the August 2023 bilateral series, which resulted in a 3-2 series win for West Indies.</p><p>West Indies secured a two-wicket win in the final game to clinch the series, with India restricted to 165/9 despite Suryakumar Yadav’s 61 off 45 balls.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This will be the 31st meeting between the sides in T20 internationals, with India winning 19 of the matches so far.
