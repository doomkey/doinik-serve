Asked about the settlement development, a spokesperson for the US State Department said Washington was focused on ending the war in Gaza and ensuring Hamas will never govern that territory again.</p><p>“A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace in the region,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Israeli government for further information.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/8/14/putin-praises-trumps-sincere-efforts-to-end-war-on-ukraine\">said</a> that he believed the US was making “sincere efforts to stop the fighting, end the crisis and reach agreements of interest to all parties involved in this conflict”.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, Yuri Ushakov, one of Putin’s top foreign policy aides, told reporters about Russia’s preparations for the talks. He said it was “obvious to everyone that the central topic will be the settlement of the Ukraine crisis”.</p><p>“An exchange of views is expected on the further development of bilateral cooperation, including in the trade and economic sphere,” he said, pointing out that: “I would like to note that this cooperation has a huge and, unfortunately, untapped potential.”</p><p>Ushakov also announced that in addition to Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s delegation in Alaska would also include the country’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, and Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s envoy on foreign investment and economic cooperation.</p><p>The inclusion of Siluanov and Dmitriev is another sign that the Kremlin hoped to discuss economic matters at the summit.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-russia-us-trade-look-like\">What does Russia-US trade look like?</h2><p>In 2021, before Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, total trade between Russia and the US amounted to <a href=\"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/technology-evaluation/ote-data-portal/country-analysis/2999-2021-statistical-analysis-of-u-s-trade-with-russia/file?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">$36.1bn</a>. This included $6.4bn in US exports to Russia, and $29.7bn in US imports from Russia – amounting to a US trade deficit of $23.3bn.</p><p>For context, Russia was America’s 30th largest trade partner in 2021. Since then, after numerous rounds of American sanctions, trade between Russia and the US has fallen roughly 90 percent.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Incidentally, Russia’s overall trade balance – leaving the US – declined significantly following its decision to invade Ukraine. From 2022 to 2023, its international balance of payments fell by a whopping 70 percent, to just <a href=\"https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Russia/trade_balance_dollars/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">$86.3bn</a>.</p><p>But back in 2021, Russia’s trade surplus with the US was concentrated almost exclusively in commodities. Oil, minerals and base metals like iron and steel made up roughly 75 percent of Russia’s exports. Meanwhile, US exports to Russia were concentrated in manufactured goods.</p><h2 id=\"were-russian-exports-to-the-us-vital\">Were Russian exports to the US vital?</h2><p>The short answer is no.</p><p>By the time Russia invaded Ukraine in <a href=\"/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets\">February 2022</a>, the US – whose energy sector was transformed by <a href=\"/video/people-power/2014/10/1/american-power-and-the-fracking-boom\">hydraulic fracturing</a> and horizontal drilling in the early 2000s – was already the world’s largest oil producer, at <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56540&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com\">11.9 million</a> barrels of oil per day.</p><p>One area where Russia did hold limited significance was in certain types of energy products. Russia supplied certain grades of crude oil – notably Urals – as well as refined products like vacuum gas oil (VGO), residual fuel oil and naphtha.</p><p>Russian VGO was especially important for making gasoline and diesel products in US refineries, which lacked enough domestic feedstock with the optimal chemical and physical properties.</p><p>Elsewhere, the US continues to import limited quantities of uranium hexafluoride, a chemical important in uranium processing, from Russia. Some US utility companies still have supply contracts with Russia, which accounted for about one-third of America’s enriched uranium needs when war broke out.</p><p>As with energy products, however, American firms exposed to Russian uranium supplies have readjusted their supply chains in response to sanctions. What’s more, US companies like X-energy and Orano have invested heavily in domestic production in recent years.</p><h2 id=\"does-russia-have-any-other-leverage\">Does Russia have any other leverage?</h2><p>In the wake of sanctions after February 2022, most Russian commodity shipments were rerouted from Western countries to China at discounted prices, including for energy products and uranium.</p><p>Indeed, trade between China and Russia has grown in parallel with sanctions on Russia. A common border, shared geopolitical perspectives and joint opposition to the US have deepened bilateral relations.</p><p>Russia-China trade saw annual growth of nearly 30 percent in both 2022 and 2023, when it hit $240.1bn, according to the Centre for European Policy Analysis. In 2024, Russia climbed to 7th place among China’s trading partners, up from 13th place in 2020.</p><p>During that time, China has supplied Russia with more high-end products – like advanced electronics and industrial machinery – while Moscow has solidified its position as a top supplier of oil and gas to Beijing.</p><p>What’s more, the two countries conduct regular naval exercises and strategic bomber patrols together. The US has consistently expressed concerns over joint military drills and views the China-Russia alignment as a threat to its global leadership role.</p><p>Putin will be aware of these dynamics heading into Friday’s meeting.</p><h2 id=\"what-else-could-putin-offer-trump\">What else could Putin offer Trump?</h2><p>In March, Putin’s investment envoy – Kirill Dmitriev – claimed that Russia and the US had started talks on rare earth metals projects in Russia, and that some American companies had already expressed an interest in them.</p><p>“Rare earth metals are an important area for cooperation, and, of course, we have begun discussions on various rare earth metals and (other) projects in Russia,” Dmitriev told the Izvestia newspaper.</p><p>China’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/12/why-chinas-rare-earth-exports-are-a-key-issue-in-trade-tensions-with-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">almost total global control</a> over the production of critical minerals – used in everything from defence equipment to consumer electronics – has focused Washington’s attention on developing its own supplies.</p><p>The US Geological Survey estimates Russia’s reserves of rare earth metals at 3.8 million tonnes, but Moscow has far higher estimates.</p><p>According to the Natural Resources Ministry, Russia has reserves of 15 rare earth metals totalling 28.7 million tonnes, as of January 2023.</p><p>But even accounting for the margin of error hanging over Russia’s potential rare earth supplies, it would still only account for a tiny fraction of global stockpiles.</p><p>As such, the US has been pursuing minerals-for-security deals with the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/17/amid-conflict-why-does-the-drc-want-a-minerals-deal-with-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/5/1/what-is-in-the-us-ukraine-minerals-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ukraine</a> in recent months, in an effort to wrestle control of the global supply chain away from China.</p><p>It may try and do the same with Russia.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-russia-want-from-these-meetings\">What does Russia want from these meetings?</h2><p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Western countries have imposed <a href=\"https://www.castellum.ai/russia-sanctions-dashboard\">21,692</a> sanctions on Russia, mostly against individuals.</p><p>Key sanctions on Moscow include import <a href=\"/news/2023/2/5/europe-bans-russian-diesel-and-other-oil-products-over-ukraine\">bans on Russian oil</a>, a <a href=\"/news/2022/12/5/eu-ban-on-russian-oil-imports-and-g7-price-cap-comes-into-effect\">price cap on Russian fuel</a>, and the freezing of Russian central bank assets held in European financial institutions.</p><p>But on July 14, Trump threatened to impose so-called <a href=\"/news/2025/7/15/trump-threatens-tariffs-in-50-days-what-harm-will-it-do-to-russia\">secondary sanctions</a>, that if carried out, would mark a notable shift.</p><p>Since then, he has targeted India – the second biggest buyer of Russian oil – by doubling a 25 percent tariff on its goods to 50 percent, as a penalty for that trade with Moscow. So far, Trump has not imposed similar secondary tariffs on China, the largest consumer of Russian oil.</p><p>But he has suggested that Beijing could face such tariffs in the future, as the US tries to pressure countries to stop buying Russian crude, and thereby corner Putin into accepting a ceasefire.</p><p>Members of Trump’s administration have also indicated that if the Trump-Putin talks in Alaska don’t go well, the tariffs on India could be increased further.</p><p>Meanwhile, lawmakers from both US political parties are pushing for a bill – the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025 – that would also target countries buying Russian oil and gas.</p><p>The bill would give Trump the authority to impose 500 percent tariffs on any country that helps Russia. US senators are reportedly waiting on Trump’s OK to move the bill forward.</p><p>In Alaska, Putin is expected to demand that Western sanctions on Russia be eased in exchange for Moscow agreeing to any peace deal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For all the West’s lofty claims about spreading freedom, prosperity and progress, the world remains scarred by chronic instability and mass hunger. Last month, as part of its wind-down of international food and medical aid, the United States destroyed 500 metric tonnes of emergency food aid in the United Arab Emirates. Over 60,000 tonnes of emergency food aid have remained stockpiled in warehouses around the world due to the shutdown of USAID. Meanwhile, Israel – with US and European Union support – has been systematically starving the nearly two million remaining Palestinians in besieged Gaza, part of the almost 320 million people globally who are malnourished or at risk of starving to death in 2025.</p><p>It’s part of a much larger pattern of hoarding and starvation that has its roots in Western norms around capitalism and settler-colonialism, a crime against humanity that rarely faces meaningful international repercussions. This is not an isolated atrocity: The rise of the West and the US was built on the massive hoarding of food resources for profit and the deliberate use of starvation to cow those already living under oppression.</p><p>It is difficult to miss, in both the international news reports and the desperate social media posts of starved Palestinians begging for money, food and clean water, with many showing themselves and their children reduced to emaciated bodies. It should shame us all, yet Westerners and their allies have all committed themselves to genocide, with ample food mere kilometres away. A recent poll by the Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research at the Israeli Democracy Institute shows that 79 percent of Israeli Jews are “not so troubled” or “not troubled at all” by the reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza.</p><p>Gaza, though, is hardly alone in facing mass starvation as part of a genocidal campaign, whether in 2025 or in recent world history. What has been all too easy for the West to miss are famine-level crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and in Sudan. As of March, “a record 27.7 million people are in the grip of acute hunger … amid ongoing conflict linked to massive displacement and rising food prices” in the DRC, according to the United Nations. The two-year-long conflict in Sudan, which has killed an estimated 150,000 people, many of whose deaths were linked to famine, disease and starvation, has also left nearly 25 million in need of food assistance, including nearly 740,000 in North Darfur’s capital, el-Fasher, where the population faces starvation while under siege.</p><p>To be sure, nearly every major power in human history has attacked or withheld food and water supplies in the process of conquering other nation-states and plundering their resources at one time or another. But the West, as the world knows it today, began its quest for global dominance with the First Crusade in the 1090s, and with it, perfected its tactics for siege warfare and the deliberate starvation of Muslim and Jewish populations in the Holy Land (present-day Syria, Lebanon and Palestine), all in the name of Catholicism. Those first Crusaders, short on food supplies themselves, also died in their thousands from hunger or committed acts of mass cannibalism to survive.</p><p>Denying food and water in this Western-dominated world has always been a political and capitalistic weapon of imperialism, colonialism and nationalism. Western Europe’s plundering of the Western Hemisphere not only formed the foundation of capitalism and the never-ending pursuit of profit worldwide, it also entrenched the use of famine, malnutrition and deprivation as tools to control and exploit subject peoples. From the 16th through the 19th century, the transatlantic slave trade, African chattel enslavement and forced labour of Indigenous peoples helped fill royal coffers in Europe and build great wealth for landowners across the Western Hemisphere. Enslaved and coerced labourers, denied adequate food and water, toiled in the fields to grow cash crops such as sugar, coffee and tobacco, or mined gold and silver, and frequently died from starvation, disease and abuse. One recent study estimated that as many as 56 million Indigenous people died between 1492 and 1600 alone. Outside the eventual United States, seven years was the average lifespan for most of the 12 million Africans who survived the horrors of the Atlantic crossing and arrived in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Beyond the Americas, around 10 million people starved to death during the Great Bengal Famine of the 1770s because the East India Company prioritised collecting food for Europe’s ports and imposing punitive taxes on South Asian peasants over saving lives. This famine, like so many others under colonial rule, was not an accident of nature but the outcome of deliberate economic policies that treated human life as expendable. Between 1904 and 1908, in what is now Namibia and Tanzania, the ruling Germans “directly killed or starved to death” approximately “60,000 Herero” and “10,000 Nama” in Namibia, as well as “up to 250,000 Ngoni, Ngindo, Matumbi and members of other ethnic groups” in crushing colonial uprisings.</p><p>Perhaps the political and psychological impact of famine and bubonic plague in 14th and 15th-century Europe helps to explain both the West’s penchant for colonisation and its weaponisation of food, and the denial of access to it, as punishment. As noted in the results of the 1944–45 Minnesota Starvation Experiment with 36 white men, the participants “would dream and fantasise about food” and “reported fatigue, irritability … and apathy,” including “significant increases in depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis”. Imagine the psychological impact of generations of food insecurity and starvation across an entire civilisation, especially one that believed itself to be religiously and morally superior because of its Christianity. The West has been consistent in denying populations everywhere the fundamental human right to eat.</p><p>As for the United States, the nation that began as the Jamestown colony in 1607 has operated under John Smith’s words for the past 400 years: “The greater part must be more industrious or starve. He that will not work, shall not eat.” America’s own colonial history and post-independence expansion also involved stealing land from Indigenous groups, burning crops and ensuring famine and massive Indigenous population decline. Growing heaps of cash crops such as tobacco, indigo, rice, sugar and cotton left little land for enslaved Black folk to cultivate food for themselves. Enslavers often provided the enslaved with meagre rations such as corn mush and salted pork fatback, hardly enough to sustain life.</p><p>Even when the United States became an agricultural juggernaut, the “work or starve” song remained the same, its classist and racist message only evolving with the times. For the past 40 years, US presidents and Congress have enacted multiple bills requiring the nation’s poor to work for minimal food benefits or go without, including new work requirements for SNAP (food stamps) benefits enacted under the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this year. In 2015, then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell summed up the thinking of US business leaders and the Western world towards those living with food precarity: “They’re doing too good with food stamps, Social Security and all the rest.”</p><p>I can attest to the impact of malnourishment and working just to eat. From the end of 1981 until I went off to college in 1987, one-third of every month at home in Mount Vernon, New York, was spent with little or no food in my belly, often with massive intestinal gas pains bloating my abdomen. It did not matter whether my mother worked full-time for Mount Vernon Hospital or relied on the US welfare system for food aid. Once, I dropped from 83 to 76 kilogrammes on my 188-centimetre frame in the 18 days after finishing my undergraduate degree, while working for Pitt’s Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in 1991. I walked the five kilometres each way to and from work for those three weeks because I only had $30 to get me through. Fantasies of hoarding food and controlling access to resources were definitely part of my experiences with moderate hunger and malnutrition.</p><p>Today, the United States produces enough food to feed more than two billion people, and the world produces enough to feed more than 10 billion every year. Yet the quest for profit and markets for agribusinesses, and the continued deliberate denial of access to food for vulnerable and marginalised populations, all to subjugate them for their land, their resources and even the very food they grow, continues largely unabated. Hunger remains one of the West’s most enduring weapons of control and domination. Geopolitically, there can be no peace in a world full of people whom the West has deliberately helped starve.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The US state is closer to Russia than it is to the US mainland. On the Russian side, it is closest to the autonomous Chukotka district.</p><p>Originally inhabited by Indigenous Americans, the region was first colonised by the old Russian empire in the 18th century. Due to the high costs of maintaining the faraway location, Moscow <a href=\"/news/2025/8/15/why-did-russia-sell-alaska-to-the-united-states\">sold Alaska to the US</a> in 1867 for $7.2m, the equivalent of $162m today. Russian influence still abounds in the region, visible in the Russian Orthodox churches still present, and even in the Russian surnames of some Alaskans.</p><p>The Elmendorf-Richardson base, where the meeting will be held, is also significant: It was originally an air force base built in 1940, during World War II. But its role expanded significantly during the Cold War that followed. The US was worried about possible Soviet attacks on Alaska, and thus built monitors and anti-aircraft systems to counter any threats. The airbase was an important part of that mission. The air squadrons based there are still positioned to intercept any Russian aircraft that might seek to enter US airspace.</p><p>Still, the US has not clarified why it chose Alaska as the venue for the summit.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-agenda\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888040\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-ukraine-Conflict-at-a-glance-AUG-12-2025-1755156371.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-ukraine-Conflict at a glance-AUG 12, 2025-1755156371\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\">What’s on the agenda?</h2><p>The two leaders will discuss the terms for a possible ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>On the agenda is how such a deal could look, including possible territorial concessions on either side.</p><p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Its military currently controls about 19 percent of Ukrainian land across Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson and small parts of Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk provinces.</p><p>Ukraine controlled parts of Russia’s Kursk region from August 2024 but has since lost most of the territory.</p><h2 id=\"what-land-swaps-could-trump-and-putin-discuss\">What land swaps could Trump and Putin discuss?</h2><p>Trump, on Monday, suggested in a news briefing that Ukraine and Russia could swap territory in order to reach a land deal.</p><p>However, he walked back that suggestion on Tuesday at another briefing as his suggestion proved controversial across Europe. Trump promised to get back some Ukrainian territory.</p><p>“Russia occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They occupied prime territory. We’re going to try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine,” he said.</p><p>As part of any swap deal, analysts believe that Putin will press for Ukraine to withdraw from the parts of Donetsk that its troops still control. That would give Russia complete control of the Donbas region, which includes Luhansk and Donetsk – Russia already controls almost all of Luhansk – in addition to Crimea and chunks of Kherson, Zaporizhia and other southern regions. It will also want Ukraine to relinquish the tiny part of Kursk in Russia that Kyiv’s forces occupy.</p><p>In exchange, Russia might be willing to give up the small areas in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions under its control.</p><p>Moscow invaded and illegally occupied Crimea in March 2014. Pro-Russian militias seized parts of the Donbas starting from April 2014, triggering conflict with resisting Ukrainian troops. Much of the region was then taken over by invading Russian forces following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-trump-s-expectations-for-the-summit\">What are Trump’s expectations for the summit?</h2><p>President Trump said on Monday that he expects this meeting to be a “feel-type” conversation between him and Putin, one where he understands what the Russian leader wants.</p><p>A second meeting, he has said, is likely going to come from it soon and will include Zelenskyy and Putin, with Trump likely hosting it.</p><p>However, Trump sounded a more severe tone on Wednesday. He warned that if the Friday meeting ended without Russia agreeing to peace in Ukraine, there would be “very severe consequences” for Russia.</p><p>Trump did not specify what US actions might be. He’d earlier threatened economic sanctions on Russia “within 50 days” if Moscow did not end the war. However, the Alaska meeting was announced as the deadline of August 8 arrived, with no significant action from Washington.</p><p>Presently, Russia is under significant Western sanctions, including bans on its banks and its crude oil. In late July, the US <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trump-hits-india-with-25-tariff-extra-penalty-for-russian-oil-purchases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slammed</a> India with tariffs for buying Russian oil, and this week, US officials have warned of secondary sanctions on that country if Friday’s talks fail.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-russia-said-it-wants-from-the-meeting\">What has Russia said it wants from the meeting?</h2><p>Moscow presented a proposal to the US on August 6, last week, stating its requests, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Russia’s asks remain similar to its stated goals in June 2024. Moscow says it will stop the war if:</p><ul>\n<li>Kyiv drops its ambitions to join NATO, and if the country disarms significantly.</li>\n<li>If Kyiv pulls back and cedes all of the Donbas in return for Russia halting advances on Kherson and Zaporizhia, and handing back small occupied parts of Sumy and Kharkiv.</li>\n<li>If Western sanctions are relaxed as part of a peace deal.</li>\n</ul><p>But Russian officials have since also indicated that they want any movement towards peace to also serve as a launchpad for improved ties with the US. Putin’s delegation for the Alaska summit suggests that Russia might make economic offers – including the promise of investments in the US – to Trump.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3885918\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3885918\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3885918\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/13254939-1755080979.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukrainian recruits undergo training in Zaporizhzhia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3885918\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukrainian recruits undergoing military training at an undisclosed location in the Zaporizhia region, southeastern Ukraine, August 11, 2025, amid the Russian invasion [Handout/Ukraine’s 65th Mechanised Brigade via EPA]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-are-ukraine-and-europe-seeking-from-the-talks\">What are Ukraine and Europe seeking from the talks?</h2><p>Zelenkyy has in the past said that Ukraine will not cede territory.</p><p>He reiterated that on August 9, in light of Putin’s proposal to Trump, and stated that Ukraine would not “gift land to the occupier” and that it was impossible to do so under Ukrainian law.</p><p>Europe, meanwhile, has been nervous about what Trump might agree to. Following the three-way call between Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders on Wednesday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the UK’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined what the European coalition wanted:</p><ul>\n<li>That the US not agree to any territorial deals without Ukraine being present</li>\n<li>Ukraine needs credible security guarantees as part of any peace deal, that is, a guarantee of non-invasion by Russia.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy reiterated those calls and added that Ukraine should still be allowed to join NATO if a ceasefire is reached. He also said sanctions should be strengthened if Russia fails to agree to a peace deal on Friday.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-could-the-outcome-be\">What could the outcome be?</h2><p>Some analysts are hopeful about the prospects of the beginnings of a peace deal emerging from the summit. The big question, they say, is whether Ukraine will agree to a possible deal between the two leaders in Alaska, if its terms are unplatable to Kyiv.</p><p>However, others, like Melvin of RUSI, think this meeting is <a href=\"/news/2025/8/11/putin-will-fool-trump-why-ukrainians-are-wary-about-trump-putin-talks\">ultimately a play</a> by Russia to stall the US from making good on its sanctions threat, while allowing Moscow to keep advancing militarily in Ukraine.</p><p>“Putin believes that he can win [and] is anxious to stall the United States and any further pressure it may seek to put on Russia,” he said. “The most likely outcome of the summit is then that there may be some announcements of steps forward, but the war will continue.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Yet, despite months of treatment with a protein-heavy, ready-to-eat paste, Ali says progress has been slow, and her daughter might require more hospital visits.</p><p>“She gets sick, gets a little better, and then falls ill again,” she said, frustrated. Already, Ali and her family have had to move homes several times because of the Boko Haram conflict. They were displaced from Damboa town, about 89km (55 miles) away, and now live in Maiduguri as displaced persons.</p><p>Adding to her woes is the reduced access to care in recent months as several aid clinics she visits for free treatment have begun to scale back operations, or in some cases, completely shut their services. “Honestly, their interventions were really helpful, and we need them to come back and help our children,” Ali said.</p><p>Amina is only one of some five million children across northeast and northwest Nigeria suffering from <a href=\"https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1159140/?iso3=NGA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malnourishment</a> in what experts have called the region’s <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/malnutrition-in-nigeria-killed-652-children-in-past-six-months-msf-says\">most severe food crisis</a> in years. The troubled northeast region has, for a decade and a half, been in the throes of a conflict waged by the armed group Boko Haram, and prolonged insecurity has disrupted food supplies. In the northwest, bandit groups are causing similar upheavals, resulting in a hunger crisis that state governments are struggling to contain.</p><p>Compounding the problem this year are the massive, brutal funding cuts roiling aid organisations, which have often stepped in to help by providing food assistance to the 2.3 million displaced northeast Nigerians. Many of those organisations were dependent on funds from the United States, which, since February, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/us-senate-approves-cutting-billions-in-foreign-aid-as-trump-demands\">has reduced contributions</a> to aid programmes globally by about 75 percent.</p><p>The World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations food aid agency and the world’s largest provider of food assistance, was forced to shut down more than half of all its nutrition clinics across the northeast in August, Emmanuel Bigenimana, who leads northeast Nigeria operations, told Al Jazeera from the agency’s site in Maiduguri. Some 300,000 children are cut off from needed nutrition supplements, he said.</p><p>Already, in July, WFP doled out its last reserves of grains for displaced adults and families, Bigenimana added, standing by a row of half-empty tent warehouses. A few men removed grain sacks from the tents and loaded them onto trucks bound for neighbouring Chad, a country also caught in complex crises. For Nigeria, he said, which is in the lean season before harvest, there was no more food.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3886854\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3886854\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886854\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-06-at-20.22.34-1755107224.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Men load WFP food truck in Maiduguri, Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3886854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Men load a WFP food truck in Maiduguri, Nigeria [Sani Adamu/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"insecurity-fuels-food-crisis\">Insecurity fuels food crisis</h2><p>Northeast Nigeria should be a food basket for the country, due to its fertile, savannah vegetation suitable for cultivating nuts and grains. However, since the Boko Haram conflict broke out, the food supply has dwindled. Climate shocks in the increasingly arid region have added to the problems.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Boko Haram aims to control the territory and has been active since 2011. The group’s operations are mainly in Borno, neighbouring states in the northeast, and across the border in Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. It gained global notoriety in 2014 for the kidnapping of female students in <a href=\"/features/2024/4/14/nigerias-chibok-girls-kidnapping-10-years-later-a-struggle-to-move-on\">Chibok</a>. Internal fractures and Nigeria’s military response have <a href=\"/news/2016/6/26/nigeria-5000-rescued-from-boko-haram-in-borno\">reduced</a> the group’s capacity in recent years, but it still controls some territory, and a breakaway faction is affiliated with ISIL (ISIS). More than 35,000 people have been killed in attacks by the group, and more than 2 million are displaced.</p><p>Before the insecurity, families in the region, particularly outside the urban metropolis of Maiduguri, survived on subsistence farming, tilling plots of land, and selling surplus harvest. These days, that is hardly an option. The military has hunkered down in garrisoned towns since 2019 to avoid troop losses. It is hard to find cultivating space amid the trenches and security barriers constructed in such places, security analyst Kabir<strong> </strong>Adamu of intelligence firm Beacon Consulting, told Al Jazeera. Those who venture outside the towns risk being targeted by armed fighters.</p><p>In rural areas not under army control, Boko Haram operates as a sort of government, exploiting villagers to generate money.</p><p>“The armed actors collect taxes from them to use land for farming,” Adamu said, adding that for rural farmers, those taxes often prove heavy on the pockets. In more unlucky scenarios, farmers have been killed if they were believed to be military informants. In January, 40 farmers were <a href=\"/news/2025/1/13/armed-groups-kill-at-least-40-farmers-in-nigerias-borno-state\">executed</a> in the town of Baga. Fishermen have similarly been targeted.</p><p>The vicious cycle has repeated itself for years, and the compounding effect is the current food crisis, experts say.</p><p>Just 45 minutes from Maiduguri, in Konduga town, farmer Mustapha Modu, 55, tilled the earth in anticipation of rainfall on a cool weekday. He had just returned from a short journey to Maiduguri, braving the risky highways to buy seedlings in hopes of a good season.</p><p>Even as Modu planted, he worried that harvest might be impossible. There are widespread fears that Boko Haram fighters often lie in wait and then pounce on farmers to seize harvests. At one time, he said, his family of three wives and 17 children depended on handouts, but those hardly reached Konduga any more, so he had to do something.</p><p>“It’s been a long time since we saw them in our village,” Modu said of food aid distributors. “That’s why I managed to go and get some seedlings, even though the insurgents are still on our neck.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3886856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3886856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-08-at-09.47.28-2-1755107230.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modu Muhammad, a farmer, works on a piece of farm in Konduga, outside Maiduguri [Sani Adamu/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3886856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Modu Muhammad, a farmer, works on a farm in Konduga, outside Maiduguri [Sani Adamu/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"aid-cuts-risk-more-violence\">Aid cuts risk more ‘violence’</h2><p>The UN and its agencies were the focus of aid cuts from Washington in April, leading to the WFP receiving zero aid from the US this year, Bigenimana said. Like the US, other donors such as the European Union and the United Kingdom have also cut back on aid, instead diverting money to security as tensions remain high over Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p><p>The agency catered to some 1.3 million displaced people and others in hard-to-reach areas, fringe locations accessible only by helicopter. For children, the agency ran several nutrition clinics and supported government hospitals with ready-to-use food, a protein mixture made mostly of groundnut, which can rapidly stabilise a malnourished child.</p><p>Funding cuts caused the WFP to begin rationing supplies in recent months. In July, resources in Nigeria were completely emptied. At least $130m is required for the agency to speedily get back on track with its operations here, Bigenimana said. Extended lack of support, he said, could push more people into danger.</p><p>“People are attempting to go and get firewood to sell outside the secure points,” the official said. “Even when we delay distribution on normal days, people protest. So we are expecting that, and it could get violent.”</p><p>Multiple other NGOs across the region were also hit by the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/3/13/trumps-usaid-freeze-must-serve-as-a-wake-up-call-for-africa\">Trump aid cuts</a>. They not only provided food aid or nutrition treatment, but also medical services, and crucial <a href=\"/features/2025/8/13/health-champions-local-women-lead-the-fight-against-polio-in-nigeria\">vaccines</a> children need in the first years of life to guard against infectious diseases like measles.</p><p>Analysts like Adamu, however, criticise aid groups for what he said is their failure to create a system where people don’t rely on food aid. In Borno, the state government has, since 2021, gradually shut down camps for internally displaced people and resettled some in their communities. The aim, the government argues, is to reduce dependency and restore dignity. However, the move faces <a href=\"/news/2022/11/2/nigerians-displaced-by-insurgency-struggling-for-food-shelter-hrw\">widespread backlash</a> as aid agencies and rights organisations point out that some areas are still unsafe, and that displaced people simply move to other camps.</p><p>“They should have supported the government on security reforms for the state,” Adamu argued. That, he said, would have been a more sustainable way of empowering people and would have eased the food crisis.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1255575\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1255575\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1255575\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/000_8W492B.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Farmers killed by Boko Haram\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1255575\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mourners attend the funeral of 43 farm workers in Zabarmari, about 20km from Maiduguri, after they were killed by Boko Haram fighters in rice fields near the village of Koshobe in November 2020 [File: Audu Marte/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"rain-time-sick-time\">Rain time, sick time</h2><p>For now, the food crisis looks set to continue, and children in particular appear to be bearing the brunt, especially as heavy rains arrive.</p><p>Muhammad Bashir Abdullahi, an officer with medical aid group Doctors without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, told Al Jazeera that more malnourished children are being admitted to the organisation’s nutrition facility in Maiduguri since early August. It is possible, he said, that the shuttered services in other organisations were contributing to the higher numbers.</p><p>“We used to admit 200 children weekly, but last week we admitted up to 400 children,” Abdullahi said. MSF, which is not dependent on US aid, has recorded more than 6,000 malnourished children in its Maiduguri nutrition centre since January. Typically, children receive the protein paste, or in acute cases, a special milk solution. Abdullahi said more children are likely to be admitted in the coming weeks.</p><p>Back at the government hospital where Ali was seeking treatment for her daughter, another woman stopped outside the clinic with her children, twin baby boys.</p><p>One of them was sick, the mother, 33-year-old Fatima Muhammad, complained, and is suffering from a swollen head. This is the third hospital she was visiting, as two other facilities managed by NGOs were overwhelmed. Unfortunately, her son had not been accepting the protein paste, a sign that medical experts say signals acute malnutrition.</p><p>“His brother is sitting and crawling already, but he still cannot sit,” Muhammad said, her face squeezed in a frown. She blamed herself for not eating enough during her pregnancy, although she hardly had a choice. “I think that’s what affected them. I just need help for my son, nothing more.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
