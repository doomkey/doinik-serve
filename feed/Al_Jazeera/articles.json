By the grace of God, he has returned from the dead,” he said with a smile.</p><p>Barata, 35, who began working on the mines in 2012, was one of the rare survivors.</p><p>Rebel authorities in charge of the town say at least 200 people were killed when the coltan mine in the mineral-rich eastern DRC city collapsed last week.</p><p>Many victims died of asphyxiation due to a lack of oxygen, while others were crushed by the weight of the earth caving in around them.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heavy-rains-landslides\">Heavy rains, landslides</h2><p>Above the mines of Rubaya are hills that rise steep and green. From the flanks of the mountainside, orange‑brown terraces have been carved out, cutting into the slopes.

While the resources they find are to power expensive modern technology, for most of those doing the mining, life is a daily routine of risk and survival.</p><p>Wednesday, January 28, at the Luwowo mining site in Gasasa, on the Rubaya mining perimeter, where the mine collapse happened, was a typical work day.</p><p>That overcast morning, hundreds of people – men, mostly miners, and women who are mainly vendors selling food and local drinks – hurried to the mining site, locals told Al Jazeera.</p><p>By the afternoon, heavy rains lashed the area, which witnesses said caused a landslide at the mining site.</p><p>As a result, the mine collapsed, trapping hundreds of men underground.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4292493\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4292493\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4292493\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1005397964-1770376394.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Grace Barata congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4292493\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grace Barata, 35, survived a mine collapse in Rubaya, eastern DRC [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"i-found-myself-in-darkness\">‘I found myself in darkness’</h2><p>Sitting at his family home in Goma after his return, Barata recounts the day of the collapse.</p><p>“It started raining around 3pm local time, and we took shelter from the rain in the mine,” the survivor told Al Jazeera, speaking calmly with a distant look in his eyes.</p><p>“I heard rocks rubbing together and thought it was pebbles being washed away by the water, and then I found myself in darkness.”</p><p>Below ground, some people were crushed in the collapse, while those who were alive felt afraid.</p><p>“My biggest concern underground was the lack of oxygen,” Barata said, adding that he managed to calm himself down, and soon “we heard the voices of the crowds who came to our rescue.”</p><p>Above ground, local authorities had launched a search and rescue operation to reach those buried under the mine, with locals stepping in to help.</p><p>The typically ordered terraces had become a raw slope of fallen earth, as mud covered what used to be clear pathways between them. Where miners once stood and worked, rescuers were gathered, wading into the thick mud, digging with shovels and bare hands, to haul survivors and dead bodies from the slurry.</p><p>Around the landslide, the community gathered to watch – many faces tight with grief – as they waited for news of survivors.</p><p>After 21 hours underground, rescuers finally pulled Barata from the earth on Thursday at about 1pm.</p><p>He feels lucky to have been rescued alive, along with two of his friends, but says that dozens of others who were with him in the mine shaft did not survive.</p><p>“There were many of us in the same shaft, which I would describe as a tomb,” said Barata, a bandage covering part of his head.</p><p>“We saw the light from afar and knew we would be rescued,” he remembers, but laments that “the others died before our eyes, without saying a word.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4292592\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4292592\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4292592\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25136541152189-1770379448.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4292592\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A coltan mining quarry in Rubaya, DRC [File: Moses Sawasawa/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"trading-blame\">Trading blame</h2><p>Last year, the antigovernment Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) and M23 rebel coalition stormed through eastern DRC, <a href=\"/news/2025/3/13/people-need-a-break-drc-conflict-reignites-dark-memories-of-congo-wars\">seizing</a> key towns and cities from government control, including North Kivu’s Goma and Rubaya.</p><p>The AFC-M23 officials who now control the area reported at least 200 deaths in the Rubaya mine tragedy, but local civil society says the number may rise.</p><p>The Congolese authorities in Kinshasa say M23 and Rwanda – who they accuse of backing the rebels – are behind the deadly mine tragedy.</p><p>According to government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya, the Rubaya mining area is classified as “red status”, which prohibits all mining and commercialisation of minerals, including artisanal mining. He emphasises that digging activities that continue there are in “flagrant” violation of the law and do not comply with any safety standards.</p><p>Kinshasa and regional experts have also accused M23 of smuggling minerals out of the DRC and into Rwanda, to be sold to the international market – an accusation Rwanda rejects.</p><p>“It is clear that the more than 200 percent increase in coltan exports by Rwanda is the result of this illegal and uncontrolled exploitation,” claimed Muyaya.</p><p>The AFC-M23 coalition rejects these accusations, instead claiming that Kinshasa is attempting to “exploit” an accident caused by torrential rains for “political” purposes.</p><p>In a statement on February 1, the group referred to the “irresponsible, politicised and misinformed attitude” of Kinshasa, saying the DRC government is “choosing to manipulate public opinion to mask its appalling record on miner safety”.</p><p>It urged Kinshasa to instead conduct an audit of its own governance, particularly in the mining, flood management, and sanitation sectors.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"natural-wealth-material-poverty\">Natural wealth, material poverty</h2><p>Daniel Kalalizi, an environmental analyst, said the Rubaya collapse is a human tragedy as well as a revealing environmental disaster. Such landslides are also the result of unregulated and illegal mining, he added, because that activity weakens the soil, destroys vegetation cover, and disregards basic safety standards.</p><p>“The responsibility lies with the Congolese state, which is responsible for regulating the mining sector, enforcing environmental laws, and protecting citizens,” he said.</p><p>“The lack of effective control of mining sites contributes directly to this type of tragedy,” he added, calling on miners to focus on safety over profits and saying mineral supply chains must prioritise sustainability in their sourcing.</p><p>Mines in Rubaya produce between 15 and 30 percent of the world’s coltan and are believed to account for over 60 percent of global coltan reserves.</p><p>However, despite the region’s immense natural wealth, observers say the local population still languishes in undignified living conditions, working in extreme and unsafe circumstances just to make a living.</p><p>Barata, who is now recovering in Goma from the trauma of what he endured, says that because of economic concerns, he has no choice but to return to the mines for work.</p><p>But in the meantime, he tries to focus on the fond memories of the miners who were with him underground.</p><p>Although several people he knew died that day, he remembers the last good hours he spent underground with a man named Bosco, a father of two, whose funeral took place on Friday, January 30, in Goma.</p><p>Barata says on the evening before the collapse, the two shared their meals, towels and even sleeping space. When the collapse happened, they talked about whether they would make it out alive.</p><p>“Before the oxygen ran out in the shaft, we told each other to repent so that we would not miss what we had come for or the kingdom of heaven,” Barata remembers.</p><p>Bosco didn’t make it, he says, but “I came back from the dead.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

A brilliant and gifted young doctor specialising in women’s and children’s health, Dr Maisara had returned to serve his besieged and occupied homeland after completing his master’s degree at King’s College London as a Chevening Scholar in 2019. Until the day he was killed, he repeatedly risked his life to provide desperately needed healthcare to his people under relentless Israeli attacks.</p><p data-start=\"966\" data-end=\"1080\">Dr Maisara was just one of more than 1,700 Palestinian healthcare professionals killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023.</p><p data-start=\"1082\" data-end=\"2027\">As I wrote this, I received news from Gaza that paramedic Hussein Hassan Al-Samiri, aged 48, from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, had been killed in an Israeli air strike targeting clearly identified ambulance crews in the al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis. The strike hit the rescue team as they attempted to reach people wounded in an attack on tents sheltering displaced families – an attack that killed 21 people, including five children.</p><p data-start=\"1082\" data-end=\"2027\">Al-Samiri was the fourth healthcare worker killed in Gaza since a so-called “ceasefire” was declared in October 2025 and the second in less than 24 hours. He was killed in a double-tap attack: an initial strike followed by a second, deliberate attack targeting medical responders and rescue teams as they rushed to treat the wounded. This war crime had been in the Israeli playbook for many decades. I personally witnessed double-tap attacks on ambulances and rescue teams in Beirut during the brutal and bloody Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and later in Gaza during innumerable Israeli attacks.</p><p data-start=\"2029\" data-end=\"2135\">In the past two years, many Palestinian health workers were also executed by Israeli forces merely for doing their jobs.</p><p data-start=\"2137\" data-end=\"2503\">Last March, for example, Israeli soldiers <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/3/31/what-happened-to-missing-medics-killed-in-gaza\">executed</a> 15 Palestinian paramedics and civil defence rescuers one by one in the al-Hashaashin area as they rushed to help the wounded at the site of a missile attack, before burying their bodies in a shallow mass grave in an apparent attempt to conceal the crime. <a href=\"/news/2025/4/5/unprecedented-video-shows-last-moments-of-gaza-medics-killed-by-israel\">Video footage</a> of the killings, recovered from the phone of one of the dead rescue workers, later circulated widely across international media.</p><p data-start=\"2505\" data-end=\"2647\">The execution of medical responders in al-Hashaashin marked one of the most extreme manifestations of Israel’s targeting of healthcare workers.</p><p data-start=\"2649\" data-end=\"3001\">The gruesome footage shocked many, but — like irrefutable evidence of double-tap strikes  — it did not prove enough to move Western governments backing Israel into meaningful action. A few issued mournful statements, others delivered stern warnings, but none acted to stop or effectively sanction Israel.</p><p data-start=\"3003\" data-end=\"3652\">Would these governments have remained silent if Palestinian resistance had targeted Israeli healthcare workers and ambulance crews in the same way? Would they have merely paid lip service to human rights or swiftly condemned, sanctioned and punished the perpetrators? We know the answer. The continuation of carnage in Gaza reflects profound racist structural violence sustained by Western indifference. This indifference grants the settler-colony’s genocidal government impunity, and poses a deadly threat not only to Palestinian lives, healthcare and human rights, but also to the credibility of what is described as the rules-based international order, to all of us.</p><p data-start=\"3654\" data-end=\"4218\">The scale of destruction facing Gaza’s population is staggering. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, at least 71,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, with tens of thousands more still trapped beneath the rubble. Civilian death rates exceed 80 percent, with children, women and elderly people forming the overwhelming majority of victims. Life expectancy in Gaza has collapsed from approximately 74 years to around 35 years as a result of military violence, starvation, displacement, disease and the systematic destruction of medical infrastructure.</p><p data-start=\"4220\" data-end=\"4564\">Today, Palestinian healthcare workers continue to operate under unimaginable conditions. Hospitals and clinics have been bombed, invaded or burned, yet their services continue, often at minimal capacity. The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/gazas-medical-students-help-health-system-decimated-by-israels-war\">resilience and bravery</a> of Gaza’s medical professionals is extraordinary, but cannot compensate for the systematic dismantling of the healthcare system.</p><p data-start=\"4566\" data-end=\"5086\">The so-called “ceasefire” that went into effect on October 10, 2025 and presented internationally as a step towards ending hostilities, did nothing to lift Palestinians out of this misery. Their suffering continues under the cloak of this pretend “peace”. Since the “ceasefire”, Israeli military attacks have killed at least 529 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,400 others. Gaza authorities report more than 1,450 violations of the ceasefire between October 2025 and January 2026 through Israeli air strikes, artillery fire and direct shootings.</p><p data-start=\"5088\" data-end=\"5669\">One of the promises attached to this ceasefire charade was safe evacuation routes for the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/gaza-patients-head-to-rafah-crossing-as-people-return-amid-israeli-attacks\">sick and wounded</a>. On January 26, the World Health Organization was able to facilitate the evacuation of just 24 children from Gaza to Jordan, accompanied by 36 caregivers. On February 2, only five critically ill patients were permitted to leave. Meanwhile, nearly 20,000 patients remain trapped inside Gaza, including 4,500 children in urgent need of treatment unavailable within the territory. More than 1,200 patients have died while waiting for permission to leave Gaza for life-saving medical care.</p><p data-start=\"5671\" data-end=\"5878\">Israel has not only devastated Gaza’s healthcare system by destroying hospitals and killing doctors and nurses; it has also trapped the sick and wounded inside what has become an apocalyptic open-air concentration camp.</p><p data-start=\"5880\" data-end=\"6394\">The man-made catastrophe facing Gaza’s healthcare system is not the result of any failure by Gaza’s medical professionals. It is the outcome of 18 years of siege, compounded by more than two years of sustained bombardment, and <a href=\"/news/2024/11/24/dying-in-hell-palestinian-medics-jailed-by-israel\">the detention</a>, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2024/5/6/family-says-al-shifa-doctor-was-tortured-to-death-in-israeli-prison\">torture</a> and targeted killing of medical personnel. The World Health Organization has recorded more than 1,800 attacks on healthcare facilities and staff across the occupied Palestinian territories since October 2023, killing more than 1,000 people and injuring nearly 2,000 others.</p><p data-start=\"426\" data-end=\"953\">These attacks are part of a longer historical pattern. Over the past two decades, at least 3,254 Israeli attacks on healthcare have been documented by WHO across the occupied Palestinian territories, killing or injuring more than 4,200 patients and medical staff. Each cycle of Israeli military assault further erodes Gaza’s already fragile medical system, deepening the exhaustion of a healthcare infrastructure already <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/gaza-patients-facing-death-as-israel-continues-to-block-medical-supplies\">crippled</a> by <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/no-gauze-no-gloves-israels-severe-restrictions-on-medical-aid-to-gaza\">chronic shortages</a> of medicines, equipment, maintenance, fuel, repair capacity and international protection.</p><p data-start=\"955\" data-end=\"1554\">The humanitarian consequences are visible everywhere. Gaza is now enduring its third consecutive winter under conditions of mass displacement. More than 80 percent of buildings have been damaged or destroyed. Families are living in overcrowded shelters, exposed to storms and freezing temperatures. Children have already died from hypothermia. Disease outbreaks are spreading rapidly, with more than 88,600 acute respiratory infections and approximately 11,000 cases of acute watery diarrhoea reported in recent weeks, about 80 percent affecting children, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p data-start=\"308\" data-end=\"927\">Humanitarian assistance itself is under direct attack. Israel has refused to renew operating licences, banning at least 37 internationally recognised humanitarian organisations from working in Gaza, including <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/israel-says-it-will-ban-msf-from-operating-in-gaza\">Doctors Without Borders</a> and the Norwegian Refugee Council. At the same time, Israel’s parliament has passed legislation allowing the cutting of electricity and water supplies to United Nations agencies providing life-saving aid, healthcare and education to more than 2.5 million Palestinian refugees. The consequences are obvious and deliberate: humanitarian collapse, collective punishment and ethnic cleansing as policy.</p><p data-start=\"1913\" data-end=\"2219\">What is unfolding in Gaza is not only a war on a population but a direct assault on the principles of international law, including the obligation to protect civilians and medical services during armed conflict. With consistent backing from the United States, Israel is replacing legal norms with raw power.</p><p data-start=\"2221\" data-end=\"2426\">Europe once vowed “never again” after the Holocaust. That promise was meant to warn humanity that tolerating racist violence leads not to stability but to catastrophe. Today, that warning is being ignored.</p><p data-start=\"2428\" data-end=\"2750\">The genocide in Gaza represents one of the defining ethical tests of our time. Humanitarian aid, while essential, cannot address the root causes of illness and premature death in Gaza and the West Bank. These root causes lie in the structural realities of the Israeli occupation and apartheid, shaping every aspect of Palestinian life.</p><p data-start=\"2752\" data-end=\"3005\">The new year has brought no renewal for Gaza, only the continuation of a slow genocide and the collapse of Western moral leadership. Yet hope remains in the resilience and resistance of the Palestinian people and the growing global solidarity demanding accountability.</p><p data-start=\"3007\" data-end=\"3118\">“Never again,” the world declared in 1945. For Palestinians, the urgency of those words has never been greater.</p><p data-start=\"3007\" data-end=\"3118\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the first time this has happened in our country’s history.</p><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">“Spaniards cannot live in a world where foreign tech oligarchs can flood our phones with propaganda at will simply because the government has announced measures to protect minors and enforce the law.”</p><p>So what is the dispute about, and why has it become so heated?</p><h2 id=\"what-has-sanchez-announced\">What has Sanchez announced?</h2><p>Speaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Tuesday, Sanchez said that by banning social media for children under 16, Spain aimed to “protect them from the digital Wild West”.</p><p>Currently, social media platforms such as Facebook and TikTok require users to be at least 13 years old.</p><p>Sanchez said, “Our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone … We will no longer accept that.”</p><p>Sanchez added that Spain would also devise a law to hold social media company executives responsible for the illegal, hateful or harmful content on their platforms.</p><p>“The power of the state is there to protect democracies from the attacks they suffer and also children and adolescents from that toxic, unpunished world that social media has unfortunately become,” Sanchez said.</p><p>“They won’t break us, because the voice of reason … will not be silenced by these techno-oligarchs of the algorithm.”</p><p>Sanchez also announced that Spain has joined a group of five European countries, which he termed the “Coalition of the Digitally Willing”, to discuss cross-border regulation of social media.</p><p>Sanchez did not provide details of what this collaborative effort could entail, nor did he name which countries would participate, but added that they would meet in the upcoming days.</p><p>“We know that this is a battle that far exceeds the boundaries of any country,” he said.</p><p>The proposed ban would be introduced as an amendment to an existing bill on digital protection for minors that is currently being debated in parliament, the Reuters news agency reported, quoting an unnamed government spokesperson.</p><p>Furiously. On Tuesday, Musk responded to a video of Sanchez’s speech on X, writing: “He is a traitor to the people of Spain.”</p><p>He then reposted the video of the speech, writing, again: “Dirty Sanchez is a tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain.”</p><p>Grok, which is the AI platform on X, was the number one mobile application in Spain last month, Musk claimed.</p><p>However, Musk has been accused of platforming the far-right and white supremacists, particularly in Europe. He addressed a political rally of the far-right <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/2/german-security-service-designates-far-right-afd-as-extremist\">Alternative for Germany (AfD) party</a> in the German city of Halle last year.</p><p>On Wednesday, Telegram founder Pavel Durov also lashed out at Sanchez in a message on Telegram, writing: “These aren’t safeguards; they’re steps toward total control.

He denied any wrongdoing in a statement last March. He was allowed to leave France in March under judicial supervision, but the case remains open.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-people-in-spain-want\">What do people in Spain want?</h2><p>The Ipsos Education Monitor 2025, published in late August 2025, reported that 82 percent of people in Spain support banning social media for children under the age of 14, a rise from 73 percent in 2024.</p><p>The survey was conducted in 30 countries, and a majority of respondents in all 30 countries supported banning social media for children under 14.</p><p>While social media has long provided easy access to unregulated graphic content, misinformation and hate speech, the recent explosion of AI‑generated material poses new risks to the wellbeing of children and young people, experts say.</p><p>The American Psychological Association published an advisory last year warning that generative AI systems can amplify harmful content such as violent or sexual videos.</p><p>It also added that adolescents are less likely than adults to question the accuracy of AI-generated content. “They may also be unaware of the persuasive intent underlying an AI system’s advice or bias,” the advisory stated.</p><p>AI can also <a href=\"/news/2024/3/1/could-ai-exacerbate-inequalities-in-our-world-today?traffic_source=KeepReading\">amplify</a> pre-existing <a href=\"/news/2024/3/9/why-google-gemini-wont-show-you-white-people\">societal prejudices</a>, according to Ayo Tometi, co-creator of the US-based antiracist movement Black Lives Matter.</p><p>Children worldwide are also worried about the misuse of AI for online child sexual exploitation and “deepfakes”, according to UNICEF research on children’s perspectives and AI published in October 2025.</p><p>Governments appear to be taking this seriously.</p><p>Musk’s Grok recently came under fire for allowing users to generate sexually explicit fake images of women and minors.

Under the law, 10 of the biggest platforms will face $33m in fines if they fail to take “reasonable steps” to purge Australian-based users younger than 16.</p><p>As of January 16, social media companies revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia, according to officials.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We stared down everybody who said it couldn’t be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,” Australian Communications Minister Anika Wells told reporters last month.</p><p>Days after Australia’s ban took effect, Reddit, which was one of the 10 platforms required to purge minors, lodged a challenge to the ban in the High Court, while still complying with it.<strong> </strong></p><p>In 2023, France adopted a law mandating that social media platforms obtain parental consent before children under 15 could open accounts. However, local media report that technical difficulties have hampered enforcement.</p><p>In Germany, children aged between 13 and 16 require parental consent to be able to use social media platforms. In Italy, children under 14 need parental consent to set up social media accounts.</p><p>Last year, the Chinese internet regulator Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) introduced a “minor mode” that applies device‑level controls and app-specific rules to limit screen time by age.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In November 2025, Denmark said it would introduce a ban on social media platforms for children under 15.

His political trajectory and election as President of the United States were unprecedented. Without a track record in politics, his first term was, by definition, a foray into the ways of Washington and the conduct of international affairs. The successes of his first term enabled him to master the intricacies of American governance and prepared him for his second, which places greater emphasis on foreign policy.</p><p>One year after his second election, President Trump’s foreign policy doctrine has reshaped the global order and redirected America’s role in the world at lightning speed, from defence alliances to resource security strategy. Critics dismiss the Trump Doctrine as nothing more than a chaotic combination of isolationism, dismantlement of multilateralism, and imperialism. Yet the reality is quite the opposite. President Trump’s vision is methodical and strategically results-driven. Although unorthodox, Trump’s bold and sometimes deliberately provocative pronouncements unnerve adversaries, often leading to concessions and desired outcomes. Whether friend or foe, America-first interests define his agenda and tactics. He aptly practises the “art of the deal” to achieve his goals. Nowhere is this strategy clearer than in Greenland. Trump threatened an invasion, a maximalist bargaining position, if Denmark refused to cede the island, which he deems vital to US security. The result: an agreement in which Denmark and the US will greatly increase their joint military footprint and open investment almost exclusively to the United States while excluding Chinese and Russian encroachment. Mission accomplished: enhanced US strategic access while reinforcing Western security architecture. Trump believes that by placing American interests first, the free world will also benefit, prosper and be more secure. Trump argues that prioritising American strength ultimately stabilises and secures the broader democratic alliance.</p><p>To accomplish his objectives, Trump has discarded what he sees as the role of the United Nations and argues that the 80-year-old organisation is at best ineffective and at worst a forum for anti-Americanism and left-wing activism, frequently paralysed by veto politics and incapable of enforcing meaningful accountability. Instead, his approach is bilateral or regional, reflecting a doctrine that prioritises direct power relationships over multilateral consensus. Regional alliances, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), have been redefined by Trump’s insistence on collective engagement and greater contributions by member states, rebalancing alliance obligations to strengthen deterrence while reducing US overextension. Wealthy allies in Europe and Asia will now shoulder more of the financial burden for their own defence. At its core, the Trump Doctrine rests on two strategic pillars designed to secure peace through strength and prosperity through leverage. First, enhanced American military strength through a proposed doubling of the defence budget to 6 percent of the United States’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP), aimed at restoring overwhelming military deterrence in an era of great power competition. Second, the promotion of investment and equitable free trade. Trade and tariffs are instruments used by Trump not only to achieve equitable trade agreements but also as strategic tools designed to shape global behaviour and advance foreign policy objectives, ranging from curtailing Russian oil purchases in support of Ukraine to combating the global illicit drug trade, demonstrating Trump’s belief that economic leverage can be as decisive as military strength in shaping global outcomes.</p><p>In no region of the world has Trump invested more energy and political capital than the Middle East, which has become a central arena for his foreign policy approach. The Trump Doctrine has reaffirmed and strengthened the American-Israeli relationship while expanding the United States’ historic ties to Arab allies through the Abraham Accords that Trump championed in his first term, positioning them as a framework for broader regional cooperation. President Biden labelled Saudi Arabia a “pariah state”; Trump, in turn, considers the Kingdom a pivotal ally and a cornerstone of regional stability. Trump’s sway with Arab allies, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, was instrumental in achieving a ceasefire in Gaza, using regional alliances to advance negotiations. Trump’s vision for the Middle East is largely based on a philosophy that prosperity and opportunity, particularly for the Palestinians, is the cornerstone to achieve peace. Hence, his references to the development of Gaza and investments to make it prosperous. Trump’s 20-point, three-phase Gaza peace plan and Peace Council seek to balance Palestinian self-rule with Israeli security requirements. By marshaling the resources and commitments of Turkey and key Arab allies in the region, Trump is prepared to take calculated gambles to resolve the long-festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict, applying similar regional coalition-building efforts, just as he has done with the warring parties in Syria and with his support of the Sharaa-led government. Where Trump draws a red line is with respect to Iran. The Trump Administration subscribes to the view that most of the instability in the region is attributable to the Iranian regime’s meddling and support of terrorism and Iranian proxies in Yemen, Gaza, and Lebanon. Beyond being a state sponsor of terrorism, Iran’s nuclear ambitions also pose a global threat and, if successful, would serve to impose Iran’s hegemony over the entire region. Whether by military force or through a verifiable negotiated agreement, Trump is determined to conclusively end the Iranian threat, seeking to contain or dismantle Iran’s strategic capabilities for the long term. Trump is the first American President to strike Iran and is prepared to do so again. With Iran’s containment or with regime change through internal revolution supported by the United States, Trump would have much more leeway to press for a Palestinian state and the necessary security arrangements for both Israel and the Palestinians. In Trump’s vision, the guarantors of such a peace would be the United States and a cadre of Arab leaders representing an expanded Abraham Accords roster that would include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Syria, and Lebanon, alongside other Arab states committed to regional security cooperation.</p><p>It is essential to consider the Trump Administration’s global foreign policy achievements and objectives through a broad lens, recognising them as part of a deliberate and coherent strategic doctrine. The Trump Doctrine’s principles are anchored in an unprecedented expansion of national defence, the pursuit of fair and equitable trade, and steadfast support for American allies. Unorthodox as Trump’s approach may be, its outcomes, according to its supporters, have demonstrated tangible strategic gains. In many respects, Donald Trump is portrayed as a 21st century Theodore Roosevelt, a leader willing to project strength to secure national interests. Both Presidents put America First and carried a big stick, prioritising national power as the foundation of global influence and stability.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The Punjab-born opener has yet to appear in Test or one-day international cricket for India, but has already recorded two centuries and eight fifties for his country in the shortest format.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4290828\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4290828\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4290828\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-09-24T154543Z_1902624916_UP1EL9O17S34H_RTRMADP_3_CRICKET-ASIACUP-IND-BGD-1770310206.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C509&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"India's Abhishek Sharma \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4290828\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">India’s Abhishek Sharma made his international debut in 2024 [Satish Kumar/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"sikandar-raza-zimbabwe\">Sikandar Raza – Zimbabwe</h2><p>An elder statesman at the tournament, Sikandar Raza commands huge respect not only in Zimbabwe but also in Pakistan. Born in Punjab, the 39-year-old switched Asia for Africa with his family just after the turn of the century.</p><p>The right-handed batter, who also bowls both off and leg-break, made his debut for Zimbabwe in 2013 and has 152 appearances across all formats on arrival at the T20 World Cup. It is in the shortest format where he has achieved the most success, becoming a gun player for numerous T20 sides the world over.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291220\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291220\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291220\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25324512211826-1770324530.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zimbabwe's Sikandar Raza plays a shot during the tri-series T20 cricket match between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291220\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza has one T20 international century and 16 fifties to his name [Anjum Naveed/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"abrar-ahmed-pakistan\">Abrar Ahmed – Pakistan</h2><p>Wrist spinners have long been regarded as the key to any successful T20 side and, in Abrar Ahmed, Pakistan have a player capable of turning a match on sixpence. The 27-year-old leg-break bowler only made his Test debut in 2022 and had to wait until 2024 to make his bow in both white-ball formats.</p><p>Then, 116 wickets for his country followed, including 46 in T20 internationals at an average of 17 with an economy just below seven. The greatest challenge for Abrar in his career has sadly been persistent back injuries, which slowed his early years and delayed his international debut. Both he and Pakistan will hope those problems are long behind him now.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291226\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291226\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291226\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26029509272229-1770324612.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistan's Abrar Ahmed celebrates after the dismissal of Australia's Josh Philippe during the first T20 cricket match between Pakistan and Australia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291226\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pakistan’s Abrar Ahmed took six wickets in the recent 3-0 T20 series win against Australia [K M Chaudary/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"harry-brook-england\">Harry Brook – England</h2><p>Arguably England’s most exciting talent, Harry Brook certainly has the ability to be their most explosive. The 26-year-old batter already has 134 caps for his country, with 13 centuries in that time, and claimed a T20 World Cup winners’ medal at the 2022 edition.</p><p>The right-hander was the first Englishman to score a triple century in Test cricket since Graham Gooch’s 333 against India in 1990. Brook’s effort came in Pakistan in 2024 and was achieved at nearly a run-a-ball. He has already represented three teams in the IPL and has 169 T20 appearances to his name in total, with three centuries and 16 fifties at a strike rate of 152.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291237\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291237\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291237\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-01T151224Z_1006274158_UP1EM21168NWU_RTRMADP_3_CRICKET-T20-LKA-ENG-1770324832.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C537&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"England's Harry Brook in action against Sri Lanka\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291237\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">England’s Harry Brook in action [Lahiru Harshana/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"glenn-maxwell-australia\">Glenn Maxwell – Australia</h2><p>Maxwell has long been the darling of white-ball cricket the world over. The best example of his incredible talent came when, severely hampered by injury, he dragged Australia into the semifinals of the 2023 Cricket World Cup with an unbeaten double century.</p><p>The 37-year-old had the nickname “The Big Show” long before that knock, and has been a near ever-present – and one of the highest earners – in the Indian Premier League. Maxwell arrives in India and Sri Lanka with 281 international appearances under his belt, and – even with age against him – one of cricket’s greatest game changers could well have another trick up his sleeve for Australia.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291257\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291257\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291257\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/13266290-1770325404.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C510&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Australia's Glenn Maxwell\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291257\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Glenn Maxwell made his Australia debut in 2012 [Darren England/EPA]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>My name is Krishna Nandi. I am a Hindu. I am a businessman. I am also a parliamentary candidate of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami.</p><p>For many readers, this combination appears unusual. For me, it reflects a deeper truth about politics in Bangladesh that has long been obscured by fear, misinformation and political convenience.</p><p>My nomination has generated national debate because it challenges a long-held assumption that an Islamic political party cannot genuinely represent religious minorities. I welcome this debate. My candidacy exists precisely to confront this assumption directly and openly.</p><p>I want to state clearly what I have said repeatedly to people across my constituency. If Jamaat-e-Islami comes to power, no Hindu will have to leave Bangladesh. No Hindu will be forced to go to India. Instead, Hindus will live in this country with dignity, safety and respect. When I say that Hindus will be treated with honour, I am not speaking symbolically. I am talking about concrete guarantees of security, justice and equal citizenship under the law.</p><p>For decades, fear has been deliberately planted in the minds of minority communities. Hindus have been told that Islamic politics automatically means their persecution. This narrative has been politically useful for some but deeply harmful for national unity. My nomination itself is a living contradiction of this claim, and it has already restored confidence among many who had lost faith in politics altogether.</p><p>I joined Jamaat-e-Islami in 2003, not out of convenience but out of conviction. I found discipline, accountability and moral clarity within the party. Jamaat does not buy votes with money. It does not rely on intimidation, extortion or violence.</p><p>These are not rhetorical claims. They are principles enforced internally. That is why many ordinary citizens, including minorities, are now reassessing their political choices.</p><p>People are losing confidence in traditional political parties. This includes parties that once spoke the language of democracy but gradually normalised corruption, violence and impunity. Citizens are not simply voting against something. They are searching for an alternative that is serious about justice, governance and moral responsibility.</p><p>Jamaat is increasingly being seen as that alternative. In my constituency of Khulna-1, people have suffered for years due to extortion, political violence and fear. Hindus, in particular, have faced targeted attacks, discrimination and economic marginalisation. Many have lost jobs unfairly. Families have lived under constant pressure.</p><p>I have said clearly that these injustices will not be ignored. Those dismissed unfairly will receive justice through lawful procedures. Violence and intimidation against any community will not be tolerated.</p><p>I do not believe in broker-based politics. I do not operate through intermediaries. My phone number is with the people, and it will remain so. Representation should be direct, accountable and continuous — not something activated only during election seasons.</p><p>There have been attempts to intimidate me. Local power structures, including figures linked to established parties, have tried to apply pressure. My response has been firm. I cannot be silenced and I cannot be pushed aside. Fear has dominated our politics for too long. If we surrender to it, nothing will change.</p><p>Another issue that deserves honesty is history. I do not deny that minorities in Bangladesh have suffered at different moments under different governments. That suffering cannot be erased by rhetoric. What matters is whether a political movement is willing to confront injustice rather than deny it.</p><p>My presence within Jamaat-e-Islami is not an attempt to rewrite history but to shape the future. Many ask whether Jamaat is only for Muslims. My answer is straightforward. Jamaat is an Islamic party in values but a national party in responsibility. Justice, accountability and human dignity are not owned by any one religion.</p><p>During the July 2024 uprising in Bangladesh, naturally many amongst minority religious communities felt unsafe and insecure. However, it was members of organisations like Jamaat-e-Islami who gave us protection and safe guarded our temples and places of worship.</p><p>A state governed by justice protects minorities better than a state governed by slogans. When families fall into poverty, Jamaat-linked welfare networks step in without asking about religion or political loyalty. This culture of service explains why many citizens see Jamaat not as a party of slogans but as a party of discipline, structure and responsibility.</p><p>For international observers, I want to be equally clear. This election is not about importing ideology or exporting fear. It is about restoring trust between citizens and the state.</p><p>Bangladesh is a plural society by reality, not by charity. Any political force that ignores that fact cannot govern sustainably. My candidacy is not only about winning a seat, it is also about opening a new political conversation in Bangladesh. A conversation beyond fear, beyond communal suspicion and beyond the idea that identity must divide us.</p><p>I stand as a Hindu candidate, not in spite of Jamaat-e-Islami but because I believe its principles can help build a safer, fairer Bangladesh for all. This country belongs to all of us.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Relations between the two countries have been rocky, however, and last year, Trump instigated a bitter trade <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/trumps-100-tariff-threat-history-of-us-trade-measures-against-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">war</a> with Beijing.</p><p>“The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,” Trump wrote in his post on Wednesday.</p><p>The two leaders were understood to have discussed a planned trip by the US president to Beijing later this year, Trump said, adding that he was “looking forward to it”.</p><p>China reacted in a more muted manner to the call, with state media reporting that both sides discussed opportunities to meet in the coming year. There was no mention of Trump’s visit to Beijing, nor of buying soya beans.</p><p>According to China’s state news agency Xinhua, Xi told Trump that he was willing to “work with you to steer the giant ship of China-US relations steadily forward through winds and storms, and accomplish more big things and good things”.</p><p>While the call indicates that both sides wish to keep talks on an even keel, it does not disguise the competing interests of each, analyst Manoj Kewalramani of the India-based Takshashila Institution told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Implicit in this is the understanding the relationship is likely to remain difficult owing to the underlying strategic competition (between them),” he added.</p><p>Beijing is set to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Meeting in November. The US, meanwhile, is hosting the G20 Summit in December.</p><p>The two leaders last held a phone call in November to discuss several topics, including trade, amid the US’s tariff war. Trump’s erratic trade policies caused Chinese exports to the US to fall, but also saw Beijing’s exports to other countries <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/chinas-trade-surplus-hits-new-heights-in-2025-despite-us-tariff-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">soar last year.</a></p><p>Here’s what we know about the latest phone call and what it means for US-China relations:</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203187\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203187\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203187\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-30T041747Z_802381822_RC2RQIALJQYG_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-TAIWAN-DRILLS-1767075756.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C573&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Taiwan Coast Guard vessel travels near a China Coast Guard vessel as China conducts military drills around Taiwan, in this handout image provided December 30, 2025.

Past administrations have maintained a “strategic ambiguity” position, which does not clearly rule in or out that Washington would step in to defend Taipei in case of a Chinese attack – leaving Beijing guessing.</p><p>Unlike previous governments, however, Trump has not prioritised support for Taiwan and has instead focused on making deals.</p><p>The US’s 2026 National Defense Strategy, published last month, made no mention of Taiwan, although earlier versions of it noted China’s “provocative” overtures in the waters close to Taiwan. Most recently, China held <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/how-are-chinas-new-war-games-around-taiwan-different-from-earlier-drills\">military drills</a> in the waters and airspace around Taiwan’s main island in late December last year.</p><p>In December, the US announced a huge arms sales package to Taiwan valued at more than $10bn, including medium-range missiles, drones and howitzers, drawing anger from China.</p><p>Xi told Trump on the Wednesday phone call to handle any weapons sales to Taiwan with “prudence”, according to Chinese state media.</p><p>The Chinese leader also warned that Taiwan was part of “China’s territory”, and that China “must safeguard its own sovereignty and territorial integrity”, the Xinhua news agency reported.</p><p>“China will never allow Taiwan to be separated,” state broadcaster CGTN quoted Xi as saying.</p><h2 id=\"has-trump-persuaded-china-to-buy-more-us-goods\">Has Trump persuaded China to buy more US goods?</h2><p>China and the US are the world’s largest economies and are also important trading partners. However, the US imports more from China than it exports to the country, with the trade deficit reaching about $300bn by 2024. This trade imbalance is what Trump sought to change when he slapped tariffs on China of 145 percent last year.</p><p>The US’s top export to China is soya beans. Following his call with Xi on Wednesday, the US president claimed the two had discussed Beijing’s purchase of US oil, increased purchase of US soya beans and the delivery of aeroplane engines. However, this has not been specifically confirmed by China since the call between Trump and Xi.</p><p>China has shown some willingness to cede to these sorts of demands from Trump, however. The country’s state-run Sinograin and COFCO have already bought about 12 million tonnes of US soya beans since October trade talks with the US, paying close to $100m more than they would have done for Brazilian beans.</p><p>“Is there a market logic at the moment for China procuring a bunch more US soya beans, just as Brazil’s harvest comes in? No,” Even Rogers Pay, director of Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China, told the Reuters news agency on Thursday. “But could it smooth the path for an even more productive and lucrative state visit by Trump in April? Perhaps.”</p><p>Last year’s trade war between Washington and Beijing saw both sides increase tariffs in a series of announcements. US tariffs on Chinese imports reached 145 percent, while China’s retaliatory taxes reached 125 percent. Following negotiations and an in-person meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea in October, the US reduced tariffs to 47.5 percent while China lowered them to 31.9 percent.</p><p>“Beijing is particularly pleased with its own handling of the trade war with the United States, which Chinese analysts largely view as having played out to China’s advantage,” said analyst Patricia Kim of the Brookings Institution.</p><p>“From their perspective, President Trump’s evident desire to reach a trade deal with China, combined with the expectation of multiple leader-level engagements over the course of the year, has effectively bought China time and strategic breathing room from the most hawkish policy impulses in Washington,” she added.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-bones-of-contention-exist-between-trump-and-xi\">What other bones of contention exist between Trump and Xi?</h2><h3>Iran</h3><p>Trump said the two leaders discussed “the situation in Iran” among other topics.</p><p>Tensions between Washington and Tehran are currently high due to the Iranian government’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deadly crackdown on wide antigovernment demonstrations</a> that were held between December and early January.</p><p>Trump has also said he’s considering military action in Iran that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/how-does-us-military-build-up-off-iran-compare-to-the-june-2025-strikes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysts say</a> could lead to government change there. Since late January, the US has been amassing military forces in the Arabian Sea, triggering concerns of a potential Venezuela-style US invasion that saw President Nicolas Maduro abducted and taken to the US to be tried on guns-and-drugs charges in December.</p><p>The US, which <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/us-israeli-strikes-on-iran-nuclear-sites-how-big-are-radiation-risks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attacked</a> three Iranian nuclear sites during last July’s Iran-Israel war, has been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-us-tensions-soar-what-do-both-sides-want\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pressing</a> Tehran to abandon its nuclear programs and not enrich uranium at all, even for civilian purposes.</p><p>Iran has repeatedly resisted US orders, insisting it doesn’t have plans to manufacture military-grade nuclear weapons. US and Iranian officials are expected to hold talks in Oman on Friday on the issue.</p><p>Last week, the US announced sanctions on unnamed Iranian government officials it said were responsible for the crackdowns on protesters. Washington has long imposed sanctions on Tehran, which have significantly weakened the Iranian economy.</p><p>In January, Trump announced a new 25 percent trade tariff on countries trading with Iran, in a bid to pressure and isolate Tehran.</p><p>China is Iran’s largest trading partner and buys most of Iran’s oil. It’s unclear, however, if Trump directly asked Xi to stop buying Iranian oil in the way he has pressured India to stop buying Russian oil. China has not commented on this.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4289851\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4289851\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4289851\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_698462ae-1770283694.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Firefighters work near a building damaged in a Russian overnight drone attack, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in a place given as Kyiv, Ukraine February 5, 2026, in this screengrab from a handout video.

Both have sought to present a strong front, and Beijing has never denounced the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, is attempting to secure a permanent ceasefire to the four-year Ukraine war. This week, Russian and Ukrainian officials are meeting in Abu Dhabi in talks brokered by the US.</p><p>Beijing imports Russian oil, coal, timber and copper. Amid Western sanctions on Russia, Beijing’s trade with Moscow has proven an economic lifeline, particularly as Washington has successfully used tariffs to force countries like India to <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/trump-to-slash-us-tariffs-on-india-from-50-percent-to-18-percent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stop buying Russian oil</a>.</p><p>Both are founding members of the BRICS economic bloc, which stands for the original member countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Iran, which also joined, participated last month, together with Russia and China, in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/why-is-south-africa-upset-about-iran-joining-brics-naval-drills\">military training</a> in South Africa.</p><p>President Xi separately held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin also on Wednesday and said both sides would continue working together strategically, although neither went into details. There was no mention of Ukraine.</p><p>Beijing has so far shown no signs of scaling back its trade relations with Russia or Iran, experts say, and is not likely to do so.</p><p>“Chinese officials frame its economic relationships as matters of sovereignty and principle, and insist they will continue trading with partners of their choosing,” Kim of the Brookings Institution said.</p><p>The Trump administration has not explicitly tied progress in the two countries’ trade negotiations to exerting economic pressure on Moscow or Tehran, and that “makes it easier for Beijing to disregard those requests”, Kim said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Critical minerals</h3><p>Critical minerals have been a recurring source of tension between the two countries. Important minerals, which include rare earth metals like samarium and promethium, are important for the manufacture of high-tech gadgets and devices, from smartphones and electric cars to fighter jets.</p><p>China currently dominates the mining and processing of such minerals, but the US wants to break that hold. Last year, China tightened export controls on rare-earth metals amid its tense trade war with the US. The move dealt a blow to US supplies and affected US industries that are highly reliant on Chinese supplies.</p><p>Following a truce called by Trump and Xi in October last year, Beijing has paused some of these restrictions, but experts say its dominance remains a key leverage in dealing with the US.</p><p>On Monday, Trump announced a new $12bn US critical mineral reserve – <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Project Vault”</a>, in a bid to boost US stockpiles. He has also held a critical minerals “ministerial” with representatives from 50 countries in Washington this week, to discuss ways to diversify supply chains and break China’s stranglehold.</p><p>On Wednesday, during that ministerial, US Vice President JD Vance proposed a critical mineral trading bloc, with South Korea, India, Thailand, Japan, Germany, Australia, and the <a href=\"/features/2026/2/4/we-are-exploited-congolese-fear-losing-out-as-us-makes-minerals-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, among others, in attendance.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They’re preparing for festivities that have long been a central facet of life in Lahore, but were banned in 2007.</p><p>Now, Basant, as the three-day festival is called, is returning, starting on Friday. The historic Mochi Gate, one of old Lahore’s 13 gates that date back to the Mughal era, is bustling once again with shops selling kites along narrow, dimly lit streets.</p><p>For the past six days, thousands of people have poured in to buy kites and related paraphernalia. Historically rooted in Vasant Panchami, Basant marks the arrival of spring on the fifth day of the month of Magh in the Hindu lunar calendar. Across Punjab, in both India and Pakistan, people celebrate with singing, dancing and — historically — with kite flying.</p><p>But for 18 years, the festival was not allowed. Several deaths linked to accidents while retrieving kites and to the use of chemical-coated kite strings caused public outrage. Despite attempts by successive governments, Basant remained shelved until now.</p><p>Its return has triggered a surge in business, boosting the local economy. Kite sellers report sales nearing one billion rupees ($3.5m) for kites and string alone.</p><p>Khalid and his cousin were among the buyers.</p><p>“We have spent a total of at least 500,000 rupees ($1,780) in the last one week on kites and strings,” he said exuberantly, clutching his prized purchases as passersby asked about their price.</p><p>Mohammad Amir Rafique Sheikh, spokesperson for the All Pakistan Kite Flying Association, said the decision to allow Basant had given local industries a much-needed lift. He predicted that total economic activity generated by the three-day festival would run into several billion Pakistani rupees, speaking between phone calls.</p><p>“Once it ends on February 8, only after that we will be able to put together a comprehensive analysis of the kind of money that was generated, but with [the hotel] business, catering business, public excitement to celebrate, all of that has contributed massively,” he added, praising the government’s decision to allow the return of the festival.</p><h2 id=\"ban-to-boom\">Ban to boom</h2><p>Basant has long been a shared legacy of subcontinental Punjab. After partition in 1947, it continued in Lahore, especially within Androon Lahore, the Walled City.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291541\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291541\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291541\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260204_093308438-1770344906.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"dancers in Mochi Gate\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">As buyers thronged the Mochi Gate market, musicians kept the crowd entertained by playing dhol drums and dancing [Abid Hussain/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>From the 1980s onward, the festival grew in popularity, reaching its peak in the mid to late 1990s. A one-day celebration at the time, it featured daytime and nighttime kite flying from rooftops and open grounds.</p><p>Prime rooftops overlooking the Badshahi Mosque, Lahore Fort and surrounding areas commanded hefty rents, running into hundreds of thousands of rupees.</p><p>This year, rents have soared further. Some prime rooftops are reportedly going for between 1.5 million ($5,300) and 2.5 million rupees ($8,900) for three days.</p><p>A senior official at a local bank in Lahore, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said his bank paid nearly three million rupees to secure a rooftop near Heera Mandi.</p><p>“The roof we have managed to acquire would be able to accommodate around 150 to 200 people or so, and it would oversee the Lahore Fort. We have arranged for food stalls, music performances and kite flying for our staff for three days,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Marriyum Aurangzeb, senior minister in the Punjab government and a close aide to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, told Al Jazeera that authorities spent nearly five months preparing to ensure Basant’s safe return.</p><p>Measures included enforcing a strict regulatory framework, including “revised Basant Act 2025 legislation, detailed transport and operational planning, and pre, during and post-festival arrangements”.</p><p>“Technology is at the centre of enforcement,” she said. Surveillance, she added, would be carried out through cameras, “thermal drones, and district administration monitoring systems.</p><p>“The city is draped in Basant themes, rooftops are booked and decorated, and the tallest kite ever stands proudly at the heart of the city. The atmosphere is magical, festive, and almost unreal, combining tradition, celebration and safety in a way never seen before,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"supply-meets-demand\">Supply meets demand</h2><p>Mochi Gate remains the epicentre of Basant-related activity. Business gathers pace after midday, when shops open, and continues until midnight.</p><p>Thousands stream through the congested lanes. Those fortunate enough to secure kites carry them carefully above their heads to avoid damage.</p><p>Among the crowd on Thursday were two young women — a rarity in the male-dominated bazaar — accompanied by their brother.</p><p>“We actually took a day off from our office to be able to come here and buy kites, but so far we are not happy with the quality of kites available, plus the prices are just exorbitant,” said Amina Farooq, 26, who works in a local factory.</p><p>Farooq said her father and uncles were avid kite flyers. Watching social media buzz and hearing friends talk about Basant made her want to take part.</p><p>“I don’t know how to fly a kite or anything about it, to be honest,” she confessed, adding, “but it is about being able to participate in the joyous festivities, that is what matters,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Complaints about quality and pricing were widespread. Buyers accused shopkeepers of exploiting high demand and selling substandard products.</p><p>With the government allowing only three specific kite sizes, the production cost should not exceed 100 to 150 rupees per kite — less than a dollar — depending on materials, said Ustad Javed Bhatti, a former kitemaker with nearly four decades in the trade.</p><p>“What we are seeing right now in the market is completely fraud, with shopkeepers charging margins which are 5 to 10 times more than the cost,” he said.</p><p>On February 1, a small kite sold for 120 rupees ($0.40). By February 4, the price had risen to 300 rupees ($1). The most popular medium-sized kite climbed from 200 ($0.7) to 600 rupees ($2). The largest size, initially priced between 400 ($1.4) and 500 rupees ($1.8), was selling for between 1,200 ($4.2) and 1,400 ($5) rupees when Al Jazeera visited Mochi Gate.</p><p>Ammad Ali, a wholesaler, said he ordered more than 600,000 kites in January, supplying 500,000 to retailers and keeping 100,000 for his own shop.</p><p>“We have sold out the medium and large-sized kite completely, while we still have around a few hundred left of the small-sized kites,” he said.</p><p>“Thank God, the business has been incredible,” he added with a smile.</p><p>But many prospective buyers remained frustrated. Some accused traders of hoarding and said the government had failed to regulate prices.</p><p>Ali Ahmad, a 19-year-old mobile repair technician, said he had visited the market for three days without buying anything.</p><p>Kite string isn’t available in the regular market any more, he said. “What is still available is being sold in black, and is very substandard quality,” he said.</p><p>He added that a set of two one-kilometre string rolls was selling for more than 14,000 rupees ($50), compared with a typical price of about 4,000 rupees ($14).</p><p>Sheikh, from the kite-flying association, blamed the shortage on what he described as the government’s “abundance of caution”, saying manufacturing was permitted only in January.</p><p>“We have been in the conversation with the government for months, but they decided that since it is returning after almost two decades, they allowed manufacturing only last month. Naturally, the producers in Lahore were unable to meet the demand,” he said.</p><p>Authorities said strict oversight was essential. They issued licences to 350 manufacturers in Lahore, along with 536 sellers and 127 trader groups.</p><p>The aim, officials said, was close monitoring of production and sales to prevent accidents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4291545\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4291545\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4291545\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PXL_20260204_105611757-1770344960.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Safety rods on Motorocyles\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4291545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Punjab government has made it mandatory for motorcycles to install safety rods to avoid any injury due to kite strings [Abid Hussain/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Aurangzeb said the government ran extensive awareness campaigns. Traffic police installed more than 1.4 million safety rods on motorcycles to reduce the risk posed by kite strings. The idea: as a rider drives forward, a string sagging dangerously low hits the rod, instead of the driver.</p><p>“The aim is simple celebrate Basant safely, responsibly and within the law,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"future-of-basant\">Future of Basant</h2><p>As Lahore witnesses a cultural revival, hotels report occupancy rates nearing 95 percent, with remaining rooms priced at three to four times their usual rates.</p><p>Airfares have also surged. Return tickets from Karachi to Lahore, typically between 40,000 ($143) and 50,000 rupees ($178), climbed to more than 110,000 rupees ($392) in early February.</p><p>Amjad Parvez, a former Punjab University professor and veteran kite flyer who has written extensively on Basant’s history and kite design, praised the government for reviving the festival but urged it to preserve its essence.</p><p>“This festival was all about joy for everybody, regardless of their class or social status. Kite flying, in fact, was a great equaliser because of the skill that was required to be able to fly the kite well, and this should be the most important thing,” he said.</p><p>Abdul Mustaqeem, 30, who works in the transport sector, echoed the concern. He said the “gentrification and commodification” of Basant had dampened his enthusiasm.</p><p>“I have been a big kite flyer, but look at the way it is being promoted, as if this is meant for the elites of the society, and not us. They are now trying to rent our roofs and come to our side of town just because they want to be seen participating in Basant, which was our thing, but because of this, the prices have shot up,” he said.</p><p>Still, Mustaqeem acknowledged the government’s move as positive. If the festival passes without incident, he hopes it could pave the way for year-round kite flying.</p><p>“This was a sport, and it was affordable to us. But keeping it to only Basant will make it accessible to only the rich people, not us,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Before the tariffs, he had sales of roughly $5m and $8m to the US and Mexico, respectively. But those have since been halved.</p><p>“I have lost 50 percent of my business in Mexico and the US since the tariffs came into effect. It is a severe blow to my business as I was focusing on Mexico after the US tariffs, but the future looks bleak there also now,” he said.</p><p>US President Donald Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trump-hits-india-with-25-tariff-extra-penalty-for-russian-oil-purchases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">imposed</a> a 25 percent tariff on India in August and soon tacked on another 25 percent as punishment for its continuing purchase of Russian oil, which, he said, was helping to fund Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>Now, within months of those punishing tariffs devastating businesses and jobs across industries in India, including diamond cutting, shrimp farming, and carpet manufacturing, businesses are dealing with equally high tariffs from Mexico, a double whammy, they say.</p><p>On January 1, Mexico implemented steep import tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 50 percent on more than 1,400 products from non-free trade nations, including India, Brazil, China, South Korea, Russia, Indonesia and Thailand.</p><p>Mexico has free trade agreements (FTAs) with more than 50 countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, and countries in the European Union, Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America.</p><p>The North American nation contends that the tariffs have been hiked to boost domestic production, address trade imbalances, and safeguard local employment.</p><p>However, Indian businesses have put it down to Mexico safeguarding itself from US wrath over trans-shipment and supply-chain diversion – issues that businesses from countries like China, which are dealing with high US tariffs, can undertake.</p><p>Such practices could be used by the US against Mexico in the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/13/trump-says-trade-agreement-with-mexico-canada-irrelevant-to-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upcoming review</a> of the trade pact the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And this could push Mexico to align its tariff policy with US sensitivities.</p><p>The steep hike, however, has the Indian business community worried about its future, especially after years of investments in building those supply chains.</p><p>Chadha describes the Mexican tariffs as more disheartening than the ones slapped on by the US, which, Trump said this week, will be <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lowered to 18 percent</a> at some point, though it’s not clear when.</p><p>“The US tariffs were also imposed on our competitors,” said Chadha. “But Mexican tariffs are uneven as they have been implemented on only non-FTA nations, which has put us at a complete disadvantage with our competitors, who have an FTA with Mexico.”</p><p>To help alleviate some of the pain, the Indian government in its annual budget, presented on February 1, allowed the manufacturing units in special economic zones (SEZs) to sell a limited portion of their output to domestic buyers at concessional duty rates. Such sales typically attract the high tariff that is imposed on imports of these products, including textiles and leather goods.</p><p>The move is an attempt to address drop in demand that these exports-focused manufacturing units have been hit by on account of the punishing US tariffs.</p><h2 id=\"mexican-blow\">Mexican blow</h2><p>India exported goods worth $5.6bn to Mexico in 2024, the latest full year data available, led by vehicles and components and followed by electronic equipment. It imported goods worth $4.07bn in that period, with oil and mineral fuels being the lead imports.</p><p>India’s steel exports are facing the steepest hike of 50 percent, followed by auto and auto components that have been hit by 35 percent tariffs.</p><p>Even labour-intensive sectors like garments and ceramics will face tariffs from 25 percent to 35 percent. The plastic, aluminium and chemicals industries have been affected by tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 50 percent.</p><p>The decision has drawn severe criticism from affected countries and industry groups, while China has formally protested by raising concerns about higher consumer prices and supply-chain disruption.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>India has so far warned of “appropriate action for the unilateral” tariff hike by Mexico.</p><p>Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), told Al Jazeera that India is likely to focus on export diversification, treating the tariff hike as another sign of accelerating erosion of global trade rules rather than a dispute to be fought bilaterally.</p><p>The automobile sector, which has a strong market in Mexico, has been badly affected by the tariff hike.</p><p>Indian automobile companies exported passenger vehicles worth around $938.35m and motorcycles valued at $390.25m in the financial year ending March 31, 2025.</p><p>Even the auto components, which are predominantly used in vehicles meant for export to the US, have been slapped with tariffs of 35 percent, pointed out Vinnie Mehta, director-general of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA).</p><p>Last year, India exported auto components worth $835m to Mexico.</p><p>“Undoubtedly, the exports are clearly suffering due to the tariffs by the US, and the addition of Mexico has created a new challenge. The visible impact would be clear after the end of the second fiscal cycle in March,” Mehta told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The automobile industry, however, is shifting gears and pinning its hopes on a strong domestic demand driven by a recent reduction in India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 28 percent to 18 percent, a government move to soften the US tariff blow.</p><p>For now, various industry bodies have written to the government to sign a preferential trade agreement with Mexico to provide quick relief for the Indian business sector.</p><p>Ajay Sahai, director-general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), has, however, called the tariff hikes a push for the industry to increase domestic demand and look for diversification.</p><p>“The tariffs have proved that excessive dependence on single or two countries could be harmful,” he said, “and diversification is the only solution for survival and market expansion.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
