            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"118\" data-end=\"609\">The United States blatantly announced its plan to sell massive advanced weapons to China’s Taiwan region in December 2025. It grossly violated the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, infringed on China’s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and undermined peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this, and has taken a series of necessary measures to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p data-start=\"611\" data-end=\"965\">The Taiwan question is entirely China’s internal affair. There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. This has been clearly recognised by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 of 1971.</p><p data-start=\"967\" data-end=\"1271\">Taiwan’s restoration to China is a victorious outcome of World War II and an integral part of the post-war international order. A series of instruments with legal effect under international law, including the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, have all affirmed China’s sovereignty over Taiwan.</p><p data-start=\"1273\" data-end=\"1563\">Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, 183 countries have established diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle. The one-China principle is a universal consensus of the international community and a basic norm in international relations.</p><p data-start=\"1565\" data-end=\"2190\">The US’s massive arms sales to China’s Taiwan region grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs. The US side pledged in the August 17 communique, which China and the US jointly issued in 1982, that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution.</p><p data-start=\"2192\" data-end=\"2682\">However, the US has not been faithfully implementing the one-China principle and stipulations in the three China-US joint communiques, especially the August 17 communique, over the past 40 years. There have been more frequent open military interactions between the US and Taiwan, and the size and performance of arms sold by the US to Taiwan have kept increasing. It gravely undermines China’s sovereignty and security, while emboldening the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces.</p><p data-start=\"2684\" data-end=\"3212\">Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and must be decided by the Chinese ourselves. History and practice have repeatedly proved that the one-China principle is what underpins peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. When the one-China principle is fully recognised and earnestly followed, the Taiwan Strait would remain calm and tranquil. However, when the one-China principle is wilfully challenged or even sabotaged, there would be dark clouds or even violent storms across the Taiwan Strait.</p><p data-start=\"3214\" data-end=\"3797\">The root cause of the tensions across the Taiwan Strait is that the Taiwan authorities have kept soliciting US support for “Taiwan independence”, and some people in the US intend to use Taiwan to contain China. It is the US and Taiwan separatist forces, not China, that seek to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The US arms sales to Taiwan made provocations first. China’s response is legitimate, lawful and justified. It is a severe punishment against the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and a stern warning to external interference forces.</p><p data-start=\"3799\" data-end=\"4084\">Although the two sides across the Taiwan Strait have yet to be reunified, the fact that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China has never and will not be changed. This is the true status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</p><p data-start=\"4086\" data-end=\"4525\">To solicit US support to advance their separatist agenda, the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) authorities are turning Taiwan into a powder keg. Their massive and desperate arms purchase further reveals their true nature as provocateurs, saboteurs of peace and warmongers. External forces who try to arm Taiwan to contain China will only embolden the separatists and push the Taiwan Strait closer to the peril of armed conflict.</p><p data-start=\"4527\" data-end=\"5034\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The Taiwan question is at the core of China’s core interests, and is a red line that must not be crossed. China will take all measures necessary to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. No matter how many advanced weapons are sold to Taiwan, this will not reverse the inevitability of China’s reunification. Anyone who crosses the line or makes provocations on the question will be met with China’s firm response. All attempts to hold back China’s reunification will invariably fail.</p><p data-start=\"4527\" data-end=\"5034\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

By withdrawing from the UNFCCC, the administration aims to exit the entire international framework for climate negotiations.</p><p>The withdrawal from the UNFCCC is particularly significant as it is a Senate-ratified treaty.

The federal government in Mogadishu, which considers Somaliland part of its territory, condemned the move as a violation of sovereignty. The Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) also issued statements rejecting the “separatist reality”.</p><p>Hassan, however, brushed off the criticism.</p><p>“We have been an independent state for 34 years,” he said. “The rejection of the Arab League does not matter to us at all. They did not accept us as a member … and we did not receive any attention from Arab countries.”</p><p>When pressed on why Somaliland would ally with Israel while it is isolated in the region, Hassan pointed to other Arab nations.</p><p>“Normalisation with Israel is not limited to Somaliland,” he argued. “Many Arab and Islamic countries have broad political and economic relations with Israel, such as Egypt, Turkiye, Jordan, and the UAE.”</p><h2><strong>The military base question</strong></h2><p>Regional powers are concerned that the new alliance could lead to an Israeli military foothold at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.</p><p>When asked repeatedly if Somaliland would allow Israel to establish a military base on its soil, Hassan refused to rule it out explicitly.</p><p>“We have started diplomatic relations… This topic [a military base] has not been touched upon now,” Hassan said.</p><p>Pressed further on whether Hargeisa would accept such a request in the future, he replied: “Ask the question when the time comes… The question is untimely.”</p><p>He insisted that the relationship is currently diplomatic and economic, aimed at securing international legitimacy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>‘Political, not religious’</strong></h2><p>The interview grew tense when the discussion turned to the war on Gaza. The anchor Ahmed Taha challenged Hassan on the morality of forging ties with a state accused of genocide, asking how he could ignore the suffering of “two million besieged Palestinians”.</p><p>Hassan sought to separate the political deal from religious solidarity, claiming that the war in Gaza had “stopped” following a US-brokered initiative in October 2025 – a reference to a recent ceasefire deal championed by United States President Donald Trump. Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect.</p><p>“We deal with Israel politically,” Hassan said. “Political dealing is not something religion forbids… Our stance on the Palestinian people is similar to the stance of Arab and Islamic countries.</p><p>“We are far from these problems,” he added. “We are looking for international recognition… That is the key.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On Christmas Day this year, Tarique Rahman – the heir apparent of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the man many believe could be the country’s next prime minister – returned home and stepped directly into a power vacuum that has been steadily widening since the collapse of the Awami League government in August 2024.</p><p>After 17 years in exile, Rahman’s act of touching the soil was carefully staged for the cameras, but its consequences are structural rather than symbolic. Bangladesh today is a state without a steady pulse, and his return has brought the country’s brief post-revolutionary interlude to an end.</p><p>Five days later, on December 30, the political moment hardened into historical finality. Khaleda Zia – the former prime minister and wife of BNP founder and former Bangladesh President Ziaur Rahman – died after a prolonged illness, severing the last living link to the party’s original leadership generation.</p><p>Rahman is no longer Khaleda Zia’s successor. He is now the leader of the BNP as it heads towards elections on February 12.</p><p>The nation Rahman left in 2008 was fractured; the one he inhabits now is structurally compromised. The hurried flight of Sheikh Hasina to India after the uprising against her ended a decade and a half of autocratic rule but left behind a hollowed-out bureaucracy and a social contract in shreds.</p><p>While Muhammad Yunus’s interim administration attempts to manage the transition, street power has already begun to bypass formal authority. In this volatility, Rahman’s presence acts as a high-voltage conductor for the BNP, providing a focal point for an opposition that was, until recently, systematically suppressed.</p><p>For millions who viewed the last decade of elections under Hasina’s authoritarian grip as foregone conclusions, Rahman represents the return of choice.</p><p>Yet Rahman is no insurgent outsider; he is the ultimate product of the system he seeks to lead. As the son of two former leaders of the country, he carries the weight of a dynastic legacy closely associated with the patronage networks that have long hobbled Bangladeshi governance. His earlier proximity to power was marked by allegations of informal authority and corruption – charges that continue to serve as political ammunition for his detractors. To supporters, he is a victim of judicial overreach; to critics, he is evidence of why Bangladesh’s democratic experiments so often collapse under the weight of elite impunity.</p><p>This duality defines the tension of his return. Rahman is now attempting a pivot, trading the rhetoric of street agitation for the measured cadence of a statesman. His recent speeches – emphasizing minority protection, national unity, and the rule of law – suggest a leader acutely aware that the youth who helped dislodge Hasina will not accept a simple change in the identity of the ruling elite.</p><p>The BNP he now leads faces a Bangladesh that is more globally integrated and less patient with opaque politics. If Rahman takes power, pressure to reform the judiciary and the Election Commission will be immediate. Without institutional credibility, any mandate he secures will have a dangerously short shelf life.</p><p>Economically, Rahman is likely to pursue pragmatic continuity. Bangladesh’s dependence on garment exports and foreign investment leaves little room for ideological experimentation. The real test will be internal discipline. The temptation to settle old scores and reward loyalists through the same rent-seeking channels used by previous regimes will be immense. History suggests this is where Bangladeshi leaders fail – and the country’s current economic fragility leaves no margin for such indulgence.</p><p>The most delicate arena, however, will be foreign policy – specifically, relations with India. For years, New Delhi found a predictable, if transactional, partner in Sheikh Hasina. The BNP, by contrast, has long been viewed by Indian security circles with suspicion and strategic unease.</p><p>Rahman now appears to be signalling a reset, moving away from nationalist antagonism towards what he describes as “balanced sovereignty”. He understands that while Bangladesh must recalibrate its relationship with India to satisfy domestic sentiment, it cannot afford hostility with its most consequential neighbour. For India, the challenge is accepting that a stable, pluralistic Bangladesh – even under a familiar rival – is preferable to a perpetually unstable one.</p><p>Ultimately, Rahman’s return is a stress test not just for Bangladesh, but for the idea of democratic choice in South Asia itself. This is not a simple dynastic succession; it is a reckoning. After years of enforced stability and managed outcomes, the reintroduction of political uncertainty is, paradoxically, a sign of democratic life.</p><p>Whether Tarique Rahman uses this opening to rebuild institutions he once bypassed – or reverts to the habits of the past – will determine more than his personal legacy. It will decide whether Bangladesh can finally break its cycle of exile and revenge, or whether it is merely preparing for the next collapse.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

At the same time, the US has handed China a new opportunity to assert its dominance in its own back yard, including on its claim to self-governing Taiwan, say analysts.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Under the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, recently revived by US President Donald Trump, the Western Hemisphere falls under the US sphere of influence – and the US only.</p><p>Trump invoked the doctrine in his latest national security strategy published late last year. Originally intended to keep Europe out of the Western Hemisphere, Trump’s version emphasises the need to counter China’s presence there.</p><p>The “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine states the US wants a Western Hemisphere that “remains free of hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets, and that supports critical supply chains” in an oblique reference to China.</p><p>ABC News and CNN on Tuesday reported that the Trump administration was demanding that Venezuela cut ties with China, Iran, Russia and Cuba before it would be allowed to resume oil production.</p><p>The White House declined to confirm or deny the reports, which cited unnamed sources.</p><p>Trump has previously taken issue with Chinese investment in the region and claimed, incorrectly, during his inauguration speech last year that China was in control of the Panama Canal.</p><p>Since US forces captured Maduro last week, Trump has also revived claims that the US should “acquire” Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, to protect US national security.</p><p>He claimed this week that the Arctic island was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/do-russia-and-china-pose-a-national-security-threat-to-the-us-in-greenland\">inundated with “Russian and Chinese ships</a>,” although there is no evidence to support his claim.</p><p>“China is likely to read this as confirmation that the US is explicitly comfortable with hemispheric spheres of influence,” said Simona Grano, head of research on China-Taiwan relations at the University of Zurich’s Institute for Asian and Oriental Studies.</p><p>China immediately condemned Maduro’s abduction by US special forces as a “clear violation of international law” and urged Washington to “stop toppling the government of Venezuela”.</p><p>But the return of these spheres “cuts both ways for Beijing,” said Grano.</p><p>“On the one hand, it underscores the vulnerability of China’s investments and partnerships in Latin America; on the other, it may reinforce Chinese perceptions that Washington would find it harder to credibly oppose similar logic in East Asia, even if the Taiwan case is far more sensitive and escalatory,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>China has pledged to annex Taiwan by peace or by force if necessary and regards Taipei’s Democratic Progressive Party, which heads the democratically elected government, as separatists.</p><p>Diplomatically isolated Taiwan is only recognised by 11 countries and the Holy See, but it has unofficial backing from the US, which has pledged to help Taipei defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances.</p><p>While Beijing regards Taiwan as an “internal” matter, Trump’s policy regarding “spheres of influence” could offer it another way to discuss Taiwan on the world stage, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and an assistant professor at National Taiwan University.</p><p>“I do think that America has created more global precedent for large powers to take action against other states beyond their jurisdiction,” Nachman told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Though China is unlikely to act militarily against Taiwan in the near future, “it will now have an easier time justifying military action if and when the day comes,” Nachman said.</p><p>Taiwan is not the only place Beijing may consider to fall under its “sphere of influence”. China claims much of the South China Sea and has ongoing territorial disputes there with Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taipei, while it also claims the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.</p><p>Disputes between China and India on its eastern border have ended in deadly clashes, including a 1962 border war and more recent skirmishes since 2020.</p><p>On Chinese social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin and Weibo, Venezuela has been a major talking point over the past week, with some netizens drawing parallels to Taiwan.</p><p>“Since the US can illegally invade Venezuela and arrest its president, the [Chinese military] can legitimately and legally exercise its national sovereignty over unification,” one Weibo user wrote in a post that received more than 1,000 comments.</p><p>The White House has characterised Maduro’s abduction as a law enforcement operation, and its air strikes on the waters around Venezuela as a defensive move to stem the flow of drugs into the US. None of Venezuela’s neighbours has interceded, although they have condemned Trump’s actions.</p><p>While critics have rejected the Trump administration’s framing of the kidnapping as a law and order move, that approach, too, appears to have prompted suggestions from some on Chinese social media on how Beijing could try to take Taiwan.</p><p>“First, issue arrest warrants for pro-independence elements, then send people to search for them,” a Weibo user said.</p><p>“During this process, there will inevitably be people who obstruct us, so we will use the military to overcome the obstruction,” another Weibo user said. “This term is good: law enforcement action, which is more applicable to our internal province of Taiwan.”</p><p>Experts agreed that the Maduro abduction in Venezuela would not immediately change China’s plans for Taiwan, which Grano described as “categorically different from Latin America in terms of escalation and alliance dynamics”.</p><p>A conflict with Taiwan could quickly draw in the US and potentially its treaty ally Japan, whose Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any attack or blockade of Taiwan would be a “survival-threatening situation for Japan,” potentially justifying the use of force. It could also dramatically affect global shipping routes through the strategically important Taiwan Strait.</p><p>Beijing has also not ruled out peaceful means of taking control of the democracy of 23 million people.</p><p>At the same time, “many [Chinese] netizens expressed shock at the United States’ unilateral handling of Maduro, with some commenting that the incident underscored a belief that only a strong country can avoid being bullied,” Jiang Jiang, chief editor of the China-focused newsletter Ginger River Review and a researcher at the Xinhua Institute think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Maduro’s arrest has shown Beijing that Trump is ready and willing to act on perceived threats, said William Yang, senior analyst for Northeast Asia at the Crisis Group.</p><p>Trump’s strike on Maduro was preceded by months of threats against the Venezuelan leader over his alleged ties to drug cartels, accompanied by US air strikes on alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The Trump administration has not released any evidence showing that the more than 100 people killed in these boat strikes were drug traffickers, or that the vessels were headed to the US.</p><p>“It’s a warning towards Beijing that the US will be willing to resort to the military option when trying to accomplish the goal of removing certain political forces in Latin America,” Yang told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Qinduo Xu, a Chinese political analyst who hosts a current affairs programme on the state-run CGTN television channel, agreed.</p><p>“It’s a reminder for China that the US is a different power – naked raw power – and they just throw out any kind of rules, international rules, or as long as they see the rules as in their way,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Maduro’s ousting will likely reinforce Beijing’s preference for a model of engagement in Latin America where it does not assume any responsibility for the survival of its partnering governments and leaders, according to experts like Grano.</p><p>For the past 20 years, Venezuela has been one of Beijing’s closest partners in the region. China was the top destination for Venezuelan oil after the US imposed sanctions in 2019, and China has invested $4.8bn in Venezuela over that period, according to the Rhodium Group.</p><p>Beijing has also loaned the country tens of millions of dollars, of which JP Morgan estimates Venezuela still owes between $13bn and $15bn, according to a recent Reuters report.</p><p>The two sides signed an “all-weather strategic partnership” in 2023 – a diplomatic designation only granted by Beijing to five other countries. The partnership, however, does not include security guarantees, which means China will suffer little reputational damage in the long term as a trusted diplomatic partner for failing to come to Venezuela’s defence militarily, experts said.</p><p>Gabriel Wildau, the managing director of risk analysis company Teneo, told Al Jazeera he expected Chinese officials to remain pragmatic even as the US tries to assert its political sway over its “sphere of influence”.</p><p>“Ultimately … Beijing is likely to keep the bigger picture in mind. China’s leadership does not view relations with Venezuela as a core interest, and maintaining the current US-China detente is likely a higher priority,” he said. Trump is due to visit China in April amid negotiations aimed at resolving an ongoing trade war between the two superpowers that last year threatened to disrupt global commerce with spiralling tit-for-tat tariffs.</p><p>“Trump’s raid on Venezuela suggests that Chinese investments in Latin America now face greater political risks from US meddling in the region,” Gildau said. “Still, Beijing will likely respond by seeking ways to mitigate those risks rather than turning away from the region.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But he blamed Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/israel-bombs-southern-lebanon-saying-it-targeted-hezbollah-and-hamas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">continued military actions</a> and occupation of Lebanese territory along the border as complicating and undermining these efforts.</p><p>On January 8, Haykal will brief Lebanon’s government on the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/first-phase-of-hezbollahs-disarmament-close-to-complete-lebanons-salam\">progress</a> of the disarming mission. He’s expected to announce the completion of the plan’s first phase, which involves clearing the area between the Litani River, about 30km (19 miles) at its deepest point in Lebanon, and the country’s southern border with Israel.</p><p>But Israel already has a verdict on the army’s performance.</p><p>It says Hezbollah still has a presence close to the border and is rebuilding its military capabilities “faster than the army is dismantling [them]”. The United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon has a different take. It says there is “no evidence” that Hezbollah’s infrastructure has been rebuilt.</p><p>Israel also sent another message through its military actions days before the cabinet meeting.</p><p>It carried out intense air strikes on what it said were positions north of the Litani River some kilometres (miles) from the border in what a western diplomat said showed “Israel has no intention to wait for the army to move to the next phase to dismantle Hezbollah’s weapons.”</p><h2 id=\"litani-river\">Litani River</h2><p>“Israel has already shifted focus to phase two,” Joe Macaron, a political analyst, told Al Jazeera. “And this phase is going to be different, difficult and challenging for the army.”</p><p>The second phase involves operations expanding north of the Litani River up to the Awali River north of the city of Sidon. “Hezbollah has made it clear there will be no disarmament north of the Litani, which means there is the possibility of political tension,” Macaron added.</p><p>Hezbollah, which has dismissed efforts to disarm it as a United States-Israeli plan, believes it has complied with a ceasefire agreement agreed with Israel because it understands the truce to apply “exclusively south of the Litani River”.</p><p>The November 2024 truce ended more than a year of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The group’s critics in Lebanon say the ceasefire calls for the implementation of UN Resolution 1701, which mentions the disarmament of all non-state actors across Lebanon.</p><p>“With the Israeli enemy not implementing any of the steps of the agreement … Lebanon is no longer required to take any action on any level before the Israelis commit to what they are obligated to do,” Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Naim Qassem said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"political-consensus\">Political consensus</h2><p>Hezbollah was long considered the strongest military force in Lebanon, although it has been weakened by the war with Israel, when much of its leadership was killed.</p><p>The group retains the support of Lebanon’s Shia community, which it emerged from.</p><p>“Assuming the Lebanese state and the army commander would try to disarm Hezbollah north of the Litani, Hezbollah and also the majority of the Shia community is going to rise and try to prevent this. They will act and there will be a violent reaction if that scenario will happen,” Ali Rizk, a political and security analyst, told Al Jazeera. “The community feels they are facing a twin threat … one from Israel and the other from the <a href=\"/features/2025/3/24/lebanon-syria-border-clashes-reflect-new-realities-on-the-ground\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new regime in Syria</a>, so that is why they are more supportive of Hezbollah’s weapons.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Lebanese Army commander Hakyal reportedly told a recent military meeting that the army is carefully planning for the next phases of disarmament. Officials know that without political consensus, there is a risk of internal conflict.</p><p>But Lebanon’s leadership, which pledged to reassert full state sovereignty, is under pressure. Israel has publicly said it will act “as necessary” if Lebanon fails to take steps against Hezbollah.</p><p>“The state is ready to move on to the second phase – namely [confiscating weapons] north of the Litani River – based on the plan prepared by the Lebanese army pursuant to a mandate from the government,” Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said.</p><p>And then there is Iran.</p><p>Coinciding with Lebanon’s government meeting, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will arrive in Beirut.</p><p>“There is no doubt there is a link between his visit and the army submitting its report before moving to phase 2,” Rizk explained. “Hezbollah is by far Iran’s number one ideological and strategic ally, and it will stop at nothing to prevent Hezbollah’s complete elimination by getting rid of its weapons.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The warnings prompted Petro to issue a call for Colombians to take to the streets to defend their sovereignty.</p><p>“It was a Great Honour to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>“I appreciated his call and tone and look forward to meeting him in the near future.”</p><p>Trump added “arrangements are being made” for a meeting in Washington between himself and Petro, but gave no specific date for a meeting.</p><p>Petro, Colombia’s first left-wing president, addressed demonstrators who had heeded his call for protests at Bogota’s Plaza Bolivar following the call with Trump. He said a detente was under way and that he had to change his speech at the last minute.</p><p>“If we don’t speak, there is war. Colombia’s history has taught us that,” the former rebel fighter said.</p><p>“And what happened is that we talked and re-established communication for the first time.

Washington has provided Bogota with roughly $14bn in the last two decades.</p><p>For the US, Colombia remains the main source of intelligence used to interdict drugs in the Caribbean, and the cornerstone of its counternarcotics strategy abroad.</p><p>Colombia is also a “Major non-NATO ally” of the US – a designation that only belongs to a handful of countries like Australia, Japan and Qatar.</p><p>“The relationship between presidents Trump and Petro is volatile and unpredictable,” said Anthea McCarthy-Jones, an expert in Latin America affairs at the University of New South Wales.</p><p>“It seems to oscillate from exchanges involving threats and inflammatory language to more reasoned attempts to use diplomacy as a way forward,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Colombia’s government, meanwhile, said cooperation between the two countries on intelligence, defence and law enforcement was continuing.</p><p>Colombia’s defence minister Pedro Sanchez told The New York Times this week that the “Navy, Coast Guard, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives” have been uninterrupted.</p></div></div></body></html>"

One was the flag of the former South Yemen, resurrected as a symbol of Yemen’s secessionist southern movement. The other was of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the movement’s primary backer.</p><p>Passing one checkpoint after another on the road out of Aden, the flag of the actual Republic of Yemen wasn’t visible, and only made an appearance towards the city of Taiz, to the north.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The UAE-backed secessionist <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-yemen-says-stc-leader-al-zubaidi-has-fled\">Southern Transitional Council</a> (STC) had been formed a few months earlier, in May 2017. Headed by <a href=\"/features/2026/1/7/who-is-aidarous-al-zubaidi-yemens-traitor-chief\">Aidarous al-Zubaidi</a>, it made clear that its ultimate goal was separation from the rest of Yemen, even if it found itself on the same side as the Yemeni government in the fight against the Houthi rebels occupying the Yemeni capital Sanaa.</p><p>By 2019, the STC and the Yemeni government fought in Aden and other areas of the south. The STC emerged on top, forcing the government out of Aden – the former capital of South Yemen and the city the government had designated as a temporary capital during the conflict against the Houthis.</p><p>Momentum continued to be on the STC’s side for the next few years, as it seized more territory. Even after al-Zubaidi joined the Saudi-backed <a href=\"/news/2022/6/3/yemens-new-leadershiperadicating-divisions-in-anti-houthi-force\">Presidential Leadership Council (PLC)</a> as a vice-president, officially making him a member of the Yemeni government, it was clear that on the ground, the STC had de facto control over much of the former South Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al-Zubaidi must have felt close to achieving his goals when he found himself at the United Nations General Assembly in September. Speaking to the international media, he said that the “best solution for Yemen” was a “two-state solution”.</p><p>But then he went too far. His move last month to push STC forces into the eastern governorates of Hadhramout and al-Mahra, effectively securing control over all of the former South Yemen, was a red line for Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The STC leader is <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/7/saudi-led-coalition-targets-yemen-separatists-after-leader-skips-talks\">on the run</a>, forces now loyal to the Yemeni government are in control of the majority of southern Yemen, and many of his allies have changed sides.</p><p>The UAE, meanwhile, appears to have accepted that Saudi Arabia is the primary foreign actor in Yemen, and has taken a step back – for now.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-now-for-south-yemen\">What now for South Yemen?</h2><p>In a matter of weeks, secession has gone from a de facto reality to seemingly further away than it has been since the early days of Yemen’s war in the mid-2010s.</p><p>It was only last Friday that al-Zubaidi announced a two-year transitional period before a referendum on the independence of southern Yemen and the declaration of the state of “South Arabia”.</p><p>A week later, the STC looked divided – with Abdul Rahman al-Mahrami, a PLC member also known as Abu Zaraa, now in Riyadh, appearing to position himself in the Saudi camp.</p><p>The Yemeni government, with Saudi support, is attempting to reorganise the anti-Houthi military forces, with the aim of moving them away from being a divided band of groups under different commands to a force unified under the umbrella of the government.</p><p>Nods to the “southern issue” – the disenfranchisement of southern Yemen since the country’s brief 1994 north-south civil war – continues, with plans for a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/yemeni-separatists-to-attend-saudi-talks-after-losing-key-southern-sites\">conference</a> on the issue in Riyadh.</p><p>But the ultimate goal of hardline southerners – secession – is off the table under current circumstances, with consensus instead forming around the idea of a federal republic allowing for strong regional representation.</p><p>The Yemeni government also sees an opportunity to now use the momentum gained in the recent successes against the STC to advance against the Houthis, who control Yemen’s populous northwest – even if that remains an ambitious goal.</p><p>Of course, this is Yemen, and the winds can always change once again.</p><p>Support for the secession of southern Yemen remains strong in governorates like Al-Dhale, where al-Zubaidi is from. Hardcore STC supporters, those who have not been coopted, will be unlikely to simply give up, sowing the seeds for a potential insurgency.</p><p>And President Rashad al-Alimi will have to show that his power does not simply rest on Saudi Arabia’s military strength. One of the major tests of his legitimacy is whether he will be able to return with his government to Aden, and finally be based in Yemen for the first time in years.</p><p>That will be the ultimate challenge for the Yemeni government. Is it truly capable of being in control once again? Or are current events just a temporary setback for the STC and the cause of southern secession, waiting for the opportunity to rise up again?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It seized the provinces of Hadramout and al-Mahra, which border Saudi Arabia, in a campaign that Riyadh described as a red line for its national security.</p><p>The Saudi-led coalition responded with <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-yemeni-port-over-unauthorised-weapons-shipment\">air strikes</a> on the Yemeni port of Mukalla on December 30, targeting what it called a UAE-linked weapons shipment, and backed a call by Yemen’s internationally recognised government for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country.</p><p>For its part, Abu Dhabi denied that the shipment contained weapons and expressed a commitment to ensure Riyadh’s security. On the same day, it announced an end to what it called its “counterterrorism mission” in Yemen.</p><p>Yemeni government troops, backed by Saudi air attacks, went on to reclaim Hadramout and al-Mahra, and the STC said on Saturday that it would attend peace talks hosted by Riyadh.</p><p>But the coalition said al-Zubaidi was not on board the Yemeni Air flight that took the STC delegation to Riyadh on Wednesday.</p><p>It launched strikes on al-Zubaidi’s forces in Yemen’s Al-Dale governorate, while the Yemeni government’s ground forces moved on the STC-controlled Aden and seized the presidential palace in the city.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-fugitive\">Al-Zubaidi ‘a fugitive’</h2><p>The head of the internationally recognised government’s Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, has meanwhile announced that al-Zubaidi has been removed from the council for “committing high treason”.</p><p>Al-Alimi said he has asked the country’s attorney general to launch an investigation against al-Zubaidi and take legal action.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed Al-Jaber, posted a picture with 19 officials on Thursday, saying he met the STC delegation and discussed a conference on South Yemen to be held in Riyadh soon.</p><p class=\"p2\">He said al-Zubaidi’s actions “harmed the Southern cause and did not serve it, and damaged the unity of the front in confronting the enemies”, referring to the Houthis.</p><p class=\"p1\">Mohammed Al-Ghaith, a senior official of the STC who is part of the delegation in Riyadh, said on Thursday that their delegation had held productive talks with the Saudi ambassador.</p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Hashem Ahelbarra said that, having fled Yemen, al-Zubaidi was now out of the picture politically, as others within the STC were meeting the Saudis in Riyadh and would potentially take over as leaders of the movement.</p><p>“From a Saudi perspective, today he’s a fugitive,” said Ahelbarra.</p><p>“He had a chance to fly to Riyadh to negotiate a settlement. From now onwards, from a Saudi perspective, his era is over and that explains why some of his lieutenants are now in Riyadh, taking over as potential leaders.”</p><p>In particular, one of those present in Riyadh, Abdulrahman al-Mahrami, a senior STC official and commander of the Southern Giants Brigade, was likely to “have a bigger say in the future”, he said.</p><p>“He took over Aden yesterday, his troops are present there to prevent the secessionists from taking over,” said Ahelbarra.</p><p>“In a way, he is some sort of replacement for Aidarous al-Zubaidi.”</p><p>While only days ago, the STC had announced a move that it said would lead to an independent southern Yemeni state within years, “the idea of secession is no longer on the table.</p><p>“Now the talk is about a federal system with one authority,” he said.</p><p>Ahelbarra said the fallout from al-Zubaidi’s flight had exposed the rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE like never before.</p><p>“You don’t get any sense of a compromise or an attempt at reconciliation,” he said.</p><p>“It gives you a sense that we are likely to see more strained relations in the upcoming days about the future of Yemen.”</p><p>He said the Saudis were insisting that the roadmap for Yemen would be resolved in Riyadh, and that they would tolerate no further dissent.</p><p>“It’s totally clear to me that they have the upper hand when it comes to how to go forward,” he said.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4162354\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE_YEMEN_CONTROL_MAP_DECEMBER-9_2025-1765288083.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE_YEMEN_CONTROL_MAP_DECEMBER 9_2025-1765288083\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

notably the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p><p>Although <a href=\"/news/2022/11/6/what-the-latest-ipcc-science-says-about-climate-change\">the IPCC</a> was included in the list of non-UN bodies by the White House, it is a UN organisation that brings together top scientists to assess the evidence related to climate change and provide periodic scientific assessments to help inform political leaders.</p><p>In addition, the White House said it was withdrawing from 31 UN entities, including the UN’s top climate change treaty body, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Democracy Fund and the top UN entity working on maternal and child health, the UNFPA.</p><p>Several of the UN entities targeted also focused on protecting at-risk groups from violence during wars, including the UN Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children in Armed Conflict.</p><p>In a note to correspondents on Wednesday evening, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that the UN expected to respond

administration also <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/us-sanctions-un-expert-albanese-over-israel-criticism\">imposed sanctions</a> on UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese, after she published a <a

So until it’s clear which way this is going, and how much stability is there … the idea that the capture of Maduro will cause US oil companies to jump into Venezuela is also a myth,” Arnson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is a chance things could worsen for the Venezuelan economy before they get better, especially as it is not clear how soon – if at all – the US government will reimburse the country for its sanctioned oil.</p><p>According to Tim Hunter, senior economist for Latin America at Oxford Economics, 78 percent of the Venezuelan government’s budget is allocated to social spending.</p><p>With those finances squeezed, there could be “very quick knock-on consequences in terms of social spending, which in turn comes with a risk of social unrest”, Hunter told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Already, locals are experiencing a sharp increase in prices in some daily essentials, as Al Jazeera has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/price-hikes-queues-and-tension-venezuela-shoppers-uneasy-after-us-bombing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, oil revenues will be key to the revival of Venezuela’s economy, said Benjamin Radd, a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations.</p><p>But getting the Latin American country’s oil market ready will take massive investment in infrastructure, “so we are years away before we see any of that in Venezuela”, Radd told Al Jazeera.</p><p>While Trump has pledged to “run” Venezuela and control energy sales, there has been little clarity on what that would entail.</p><p>“Trump has been very vague on this entire process,” Radd said.</p><p>A key factor is the structure of Venezuela’s government, which has been left largely in place, in contrast to the de-Ba’athification of Iraq following the US’s 2003 invasion.</p><p>“It is also not clear what is the status of the legitimacy of the current Venezuelan government, [or] what economic measures can they even undertake,” Radd said.</p><p>“There are a lot of unknowns here.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
