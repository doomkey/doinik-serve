He cited a crime emergency – but referred to the same crime that city officials stress is already falling noticeably.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>The president holds the legal right to make such moves – to a point.</p><p>The law lets Trump control the police department for a month, but how aggressive the federal presence will be and how it could play out remained open questions as the city’s mayor and police chief went to the Justice Department to meet with the attorney general.</p><p>The meeting comes a day after Mayor Muriel Bowser said Trump’s freshly announced plan to take over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and call in the National Guard was not a productive step. She calmly laid out the city’s case that crime has been dropping steadily and said Trump’s perceived state of emergency simply doesn’t match the numbers.</p><p>She also flatly stated that the capital city’s hands are tied and that her administration has little choice but to comply. “We could contest that,” she said of Trump’s definition of a crime emergency, “but his authority is pretty broad.”</p><p>Bowser made a reference to Trump’s “so-called emergency” and concluded: “I’m going to work every day to make sure it’s not a complete disaster.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, said Trump has accused Democrats of being “weak on crime”.</p><p>“He singled out Democrat-run cities like Oakland – which is outside San Francisco – New York, Baltimore, even Chicago,” she said. “Given the fact they’re run by Democrats … this is causing a little bit of concern.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Democrats are calling the move “a power grab”.</p><p>“Even though they’re saying this is technically legal, it is a hostile takeover given that these powers have actually never been executed in modern history,” Halkett said.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-bumpy-relationship-with-dc\">Trump’s bumpy relationship with DC</h2><p>While Trump invokes his plan by saying that “we’re going to take our capital back”, Bowser and the MPD maintain that violent crime overall in Washington has decreased to a 30-year low after a sharp rise in 2023.</p><p>Carjackings, for example, dropped about 50 percent in 2024 and are down again this year. More than half of those arrested, however, are juveniles, and the extent of those punishments is a point of contention for the Trump administration.</p><p>“The White House says crime may be down, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not a problem and that violent crime exists at levels that are far too high,” Halkett said.</p><p>Bowser, a Democrat, spent much of Trump’s first term in office openly sparring with the Republican president. She fended off his initial plans for a military parade through the streets and stood in public opposition when he called in a multi-agency flood of federal law enforcement to confront anti-police brutality protesters in the summer of 2020.</p><p>She later had the words “Black Lives Matter” painted in giant yellow letters on the street about a block from the White House.</p><p>In Trump’s second term, backed by Republican control of both houses of Congress, Bowser has walked a public tightrope for months, emphasising common ground with the Trump administration on issues such as the successful effort to bring the National Football League’s (NFL’s) Washington Commanders back to the District of Columbia.</p><p>She watched with open concern for the city streets as Trump finally got his military parade this summer. Her decision to dismantle Black Lives Matter Plaza earlier this year served as a neat metaphor for just how much the power dynamics between the two executives had evolved.</p><p>Now that fraught relationship enters uncharted territory as Trump has followed through on months of what many DC officials had quietly hoped were empty threats. The new standoff has cast Bowser in a sympathetic light, even among her longtime critics.</p><p>“It’s a power play and we’re an easy target,” said Clinique Chapman, CEO of the DC Justice Lab. A frequent critic of Bowser, whom she accuses of “over policing our youth” with the recent expansions of Washington’s youth curfew, Chapman said Trump’s latest move “is not about creating a safer DC; it’s just about power”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He smiles shyly and, at one point, puts his arms around both of the women.</p><p>He’s the baby of the family, the youngest of four siblings, and he and the two women share sloped hazel eyes. They also share the same anxieties over Israel’s increasingly violent military presence in and around their town.</p><p>“I used to go out often with my family,” Azem told Al Jazeera. “But now, due to the occupation forces, I hardly go out at all.”</p><p>The family has lived in this yellow-plastered house for 40 years – longer than Azem has been alive. Before the violence escalated, his days were quiet and calm.</p><p>He worked as a builder in Tel Aviv and enjoyed going into town in the evening to meet friends. Sometimes, he’d walk alone to the ruins overlooking the dry hills around Sebastia, past the ancient Roman columns and stone amphitheatre, enjoying the peaceful solitude and beautiful landscape.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>That peace has now disappeared.</p><p>First came the job losses. Israel revoked nearly all border permits for Palestinians after October 7, 2023, and barred Palestinian workers from the construction industry.</p><p>Unemployment soared over 30 percent, leaving Azem and his two brothers without regular work, and the family now relying solely on the income of Azem’s father, Wael, a taxi driver.</p><p>Then came the Israeli military incursions, which ramped up since late 2023, with soldiers now storming through the village nearly every night. One evening, on January 19, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/the-boy-who-bled-to-death-as-an-israeli-soldier-celebrated-his-shot\">an Israeli army sniper shot and killed a 14-year-old child</a>, Ahmad Rashid Rushdi Jazar, near Sebastia’s kindergarten.</p><p>Now, many families, including Azem’s, no longer venture outside their homes, especially in the evenings.</p><h2 id=\"a-message-for-sebastia\">‘A message for Sebastia’</h2><p>Azem recalls his attack as he drove to a construction gig before dawn with his brother-in-law.</p><p>Three Israeli soldiers stopped his car at <a href=\"/features/2025/3/5/public-execution-the-israeli-checkpoint-terrorising-a-palestinian-town\">a checkpoint in the adjoining town of Deir Sharaf</a>. The Israelis demanded their names and identity cards and began to interrogate them, asking what they were doing and where they were from.</p><p>Azem told them he was from Sebastia, at which point the soldiers made him get out of the car and kicked his legs out from under him, forcing him to his knees.</p><p>Azem says the soldiers tried to frame him as an armed fighter, yelling questions at him like: “Why are you attacking us with Molotov cocktails?” The questions didn’t make sense to Azem, who says he has never engaged in violence.</p><p>He told them he doesn’t do much of anything, except occasionally look for work.</p><p>Azem repeated that he was only on his way to work and told them he didn’t know anything. He says the soldiers then pushed him face-first into the ground, and one of them stepped on his head and asked: “Do you love Iran?”</p><p>Azem said no, that he wasn’t political and that he doesn’t support Iran.</p><p>For the next 40 minutes, as his brother-in-law sat in the car, the soldiers kicked and beat Azem with their weapons as he lay on the ground. One soldier sat on his legs to ensure he couldn’t escape. Then they demanded his phone.</p><p>The soldiers filmed a video in which they commanded Azem to repeat after them, in Hebrew: “I love Israel” and “I will do everything they ask of me”.</p><p>Azem still has the video the soldiers shot on his phone. Filmed above the muzzle of a gun, Azem’s worried face is turned towards the lens, repeating the Hebrew words one by one as he lies on his belly.</p><p>The soldiers then uploaded the video to Azem’s Facebook account. They waited 15 to 20 minutes to ensure that some of Azem’s friends and family saw the video before giving back the phone.</p><p>As Azem recounts the story, his voice is strong and clear, but he anxiously bounces his heels on the floor.</p><p>When the soldiers finally let him go, his brother-in-law had to turn around and drive home. Azem, too injured to work, spent the rest of the day trying to sleep and heal.</p><p>Humiliated by the video and afraid that he will be attacked again, Azem no longer leaves his house. When friends call and invite him out, he declines.</p><p>“I am extremely embarrassed,” Azem says. “The video mocks us, the people of Palestine.”</p><p>Though he took the video down quickly, others saw it, including Sebastia’s Mayor Mohammed Azem (no relation), who saved a copy as evidence of the soldiers’ mistreatment.</p><p>“If I leave home again … I don’t want to think what they could do to me next time,” Azem says.</p><p>Maha, Azem’s mother, speaks up: “When the Israeli soldier learned he was from Sebastia, they wanted to make this video to send a message to all of Sebastia, to say: ‘I’m here, and I control your village, and I do what I want to do here.’”</p><p>“If he hadn’t said [what they commanded him to say], they could have hurt him worse, or killed him,” she adds.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"humiliation-by-design\">Humiliation by design</h2><p>Israel has been accused of deliberately and systematically humiliating Palestinians, particularly civilians detained in Gaza. There, human rights organisations say soldiers have forced men to strip while being filmed. Israel has also been accused of using sexual assault, rape, and the threat of rape as a way of humiliating prisoners.</p><p>In the West Bank, soldiers near Hebron have allegedly drawn the Star of David on a Palestinian child’s book and <a href=\"/news/2023/8/18/israeli-police-arrest-and-brand-palestinian-with-star-of-david-report\">branded the symbol on a man’s face</a> in occupied East Jerusalem.</p><p>“Israel employs a systematic strategy of humiliation to psychologically impact and break down Palestinian individuals and communities,” writes Ramy Abdu, chairman of the Swiss nonprofit Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, comparing such acts of humiliation to those witnessed during World War II’s Kristallnacht.</p><p>Israel has purportedly set its sights on Sebastia because it’s an important archaeological site believed to be among the oldest continuously inhabited places in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>It was an important centre under Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, and Roman rule. Israeli politicians say it was the historical capital of the Biblical Kingdom of Israel, while Christians and Muslims believe it is the burial site of John the Baptist.</p><p>In 2012, Palestine applied for Sebastia to become a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage site, an application that is still pending.</p><p>The town remains under civilian Palestinian control, but the acropolis has been under Israeli control since the 1995 signing of the Oslo Accords. Increasingly, and especially since 2019, Jewish settlers have “attempted to impose a separation between the acropolis of the ancient site of Sebastia … and the village”, according to a report from Emek Shaveh, an Israeli archaeological NGO.</p><p>In May 2023, the <a href=\"/features/2025/5/24/palestinians-plan-push-land-israel-builds-national-park\">Israeli government approved</a> a massive $8m plan to turn Sebastia into a tourist hub and national park. Last summer, Israel’s military issued an order to seize 1.3 dunums (1,300 square metres) of land at the summit of the archaeological site.</p><p>Since then, Israel has put more checkpoints around Sebastia. And this May, it began excavations there, transporting sacks of soil with ancient artefacts to the nearby illegal settlement, named Shavei Shomron.</p><p>Emek Shaveh says taking artefacts and material from Sebastia is considered illegal under international law. Last month, it released a paper addressed to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, stating: “Israel’s attempt to appropriate the acropolis and sever it from the town undermines the historical integrity of the site … and violates the cultural rights of the town residents.”</p><p>In response to Emek Shaveh’s objections, the Israeli military confirmed last year that establishing a military facility at the summit of the Sebastia archaeological site would involve frequent military incursions through the Palestinian town below.</p><p>In May 2025, a UN report revealed that Israel plans to build a fence and bypass road through Sebastia. The report said this will “not only cut off Palestinians from the site, it will also develop the site to focus exclusively on Jewish history”.</p><p>In June, Israel’s Civil Administration also issued a permit for its army to set up a “defence station” at the nearby historical Massoudieh Ottoman train station.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3884514\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3884514\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3884514\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Sebastiya-site-1755006892.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A little boy in a red t-shirt points at a corner of the Sebastia ruins where he likes to play\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3884514\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A child from Sebastia points out his favourite roaming grounds in the ancient ruins, so long as there are no Israeli soldiers around [Delaney Nolan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"locals-fear-the-worst\">Locals fear the worst</h2><p>Palestinian residents and leaders fear that Israel’s plans are leading towards the annexation of Sebastia. They see it as similar to moves made in Tulkarem and Jenin, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced by Israeli military raids this year.</p><p>Sebastia’s Mayor Azem told Al Jazeera that Israeli military incursions have escalated in recent weeks. While soldiers used to come to the village once a week, over the last three months, they’ve arrived every night, paralysing the villagers’ freedom of movement.</p><p>“They even attack the electricity,” he says. “The municipal employees, when they’re working in the street, they attack them.”</p><p>There is no presence of Palestinian resistance fighters in Sebastia, and locals don’t have weapons to defend themselves, the mayor says.</p><p>Groups of Israeli settlers also regularly visit the Sebastia archaeological site under the protection of Israeli soldiers. This has led to frequent incidents of settler violence against Palestinian residents.</p><p>Mayor Azem pointed to an incident in June in which soldiers stormed into a Sebastia home and beat a family, sending a daughter to the hospital.</p><p>“They attacked the house of a family who have small daughters,” said Azem. “When they pushed and attacked the girls, the Red Crescent came and took them to the hospital,” because locals can’t use their own cars for transportation to the hospital, for fear of Israeli military violence.</p><p>Israeli authorities did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the attacks.</p><p>These incursions and the intended bifurcation of the village are happening even though Israel is signatory to the First Protocol of the Hague Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from retaining cultural property in an occupied territory.</p><p>On May 13, UNESCO approved funds to prepare a preliminary assessment of Palestine’s application for Sebastia to become a World Heritage site. This gives villagers a glimmer of hope of some limited protection from annexation.</p><p>But Mayor Azem believes UNESCO has been slow to move forward partly because it doesn’t want to agitate the administration of US President Donald Trump, which has already put UNESCO participation under review due to so-called “anti-Israel sentiment”.</p><p>Meanwhile, back on the porch with Azem and his family, his mother notes that while things were bad before October 7, 2023, “now it’s 10 times worse”.</p><p>She says her village no longer holds events after dark – they even worry that weddings that go past dusk will bring violence.</p><p>“There are no reasons for attacking us, but they don’t want us to be happy,” Maha says.</p><p>“If they hear that there is a wedding or something we can celebrate here, in the night, they come to the village to cancel our happiness.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The executive order says federal use of the district’s Metropolitan Police Department is needed to maintain law and order; protect federal buildings and monuments; and ensure “conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.”</p><p>Trump delegated operational control of the department to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/pam-bondi-who-is-trumps-attorney-general-handling-the-epstein-files\">US Attorney General Pam Bondi</a>.</p><p>The emergency powers cannot extend past 48 hours, the law says, unless the president notifies Congress in writing about the reason and the time period needed. If he notifies Congress, Trump can extend the emergency for up to 30 days.</p><h2><strong>Did Washington, DC</strong><strong>, homicides reach the highest rate ever in 2023? </strong></h2><p>Trump said, “Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don’t know what that means, because it just goes back 25 years. Can’t be worse.”</p><p>The city’s Metropolitan Police Department data showed 274 homicides in 2023, the highest number over the past 20 years. Trump omitted that the department’s preliminary crime data shows homicides have declined 32 percent since 2023, to 187 in 2024.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/us-crime-rates-dropped-in-2024-new-fbi-report-shows\">homicide rate continues to decline</a>. This year, through August 11, homicides decreased by 12 percent compared with the same time period in 2024.</p><p>Jeff Asher, an analyst for AH Datalytics, told PolitiFact that the <a href=\"/news/2021/11/3/hld-surge-in-us-homicides-continues-in-2021-why\">homicide rate increased</a> substantially after 2020, peaking in 2023 at 39 per 100,000 people.</p><p>That was the highest rate since 2003, but far below the 1991 peak of 81 per 100,000 people. The falling rate matches national trends, Asher said.</p><p>White House spokesperson Steven Cheung said on X that the city police statistics are not as they seem. Cheung attached a July WRC-TV story about a district police commander’s May suspension after he was accused of altering crime statistics.</p><p>Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Gregg Pemberton told the TV station that union members and management said the command staff want to “make sure that these classifications of these reports are adjusted over time to make sure that the overall crime stats stay down.”</p><p>A police spokesperson told PolitiFact that Commander Michael Pulliam is on administrative leave and the department can’t comment on active internal investigations. The union did not respond to our request for comment.</p><h2><strong>Have violent crimes such as carjacking increased in Washington, DC?</strong></h2><p>Trump said, “The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled.”</p><p>Trump is correct that the number of these crimes increased, but he did not mention a recent decline in carjackings.</p><p>The city’s dashboard shows carjackings rose from 2020 through 2023 before declining in 2024. This year, through August 9, there have been 188 carjackings compared with 299 during the same time period in 2024, and compared with 607 in 2023, a police spokesperson told PolitiFact.</p><p>The city’s preliminary car theft data shows a 25 percent drop from 2023 to 2024, and car thefts are essentially flat year to date in 2025 compared with the same period last year.</p><p>“Auto theft increased a huge amount in DC after 2020 before surging again in 2023 following the video being posted showing how to steal certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars,” Asher said. The “Kia Boyz” phenomenon happened nationwide.</p><p>Overall, the city’s data shows that, through August 11 this year, compared with 2024, violent crime in the district declined by 26 percent. Washington, DC’s violent crime decrease is part of a nationwide trend in major cities.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Does implementing cashless bail affect crime rates?</strong></h2><p>Trump said, “The radical left City Council adopted no cash bail. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster … Somebody murders somebody, and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out.”</p><p>“No cash bail” or “cashless bail” allows certain defendants awaiting trial to be released from custody without paying bail. Even with cashless bail laws in place, defendants accused of violent crimes, such as murder, can still be detained if judges determine they are a public safety threat or flight risk.</p><p>Misdemeanour charges typically result in higher rates of release, according to the district’s Pretrial Services Agency.</p><p>In 2024, 89 percent of defendants were not rearrested during the pre-trial period, the agency said.</p><p>Proponents of eliminating cash bail say a cash requirement harms low-income people. Those who support cash bail say it ensures defendants appear in court, and removing it threatens public safety. Washington, DC, was a pioneer in pretrial reform, largely eliminating cash bail in the 1990s.</p><p>There’s a lack of expert consensus on the impact of cashless bail on crime rates.</p><p>A 2024 report by the left-leaning Brennan Centre for Justice at NYU Law said researchers found “no statistically significant relationship” between bail reform and crime rates. The study looked at crime rate data from 2015 through 2021 for 33 cities across the US, 22 of which had implemented some type of bail reform.</p><p>The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that supports reducing the prison population, measured public safety before and after pretrial reforms in four states and nine cities and counties, including Washington, DC. In general, researchers found that releasing people pre-trial did not put communities at risk for more crime.</p><p>The Trump administration has cited a 2022 report from the Yolo County, California, district attorney’s office as evidence that cashless bails cause increased crime. The report explored the effects of California’s temporary bail suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that 420 out of 595 people — 70.6 percent — were rearrested after being released from jail under this system.</p><p>A November 2024 paper by the Public Policy Institute of California also found that implementing emergency bail orders caused “notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days”. However, once reversed, the return to cash bail did not affect the number of rearrests.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Under his control, the country severed ties with its former coloniser, France, and thousands of French soldiers involved in the fight against the armed groups <a href=\"/news/2022/8/16/last-french-troops-leave-mali-ending-nine-year-deployment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exited</a> the country.</p><p>The military rulers have since turned to Russian private mercenaries and military officials under the Wagner Group and Africa Corps. The army and the Russians have recorded wins but also heavy losses.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-military-government-said\">What has the military government said?</h2><p>The military government has not put out an official statement stating the reasons for the arrests.</p><p>RFI quoted an unnamed Malian senior military officer close to the government as saying the soldiers were arrested because “they wanted to destabilise the transition,” referring to the military government, which calls itself a transitional government that is expected eventually to hand over power to a civilian administration.</p><p>Many of those arrested were confirmed by RFI to be members of the national guard. The special unit is headed by Defence Minister and General Sadio Camara. In elite military circles in Bamako, Camara is increasingly seen as a rival to Goita although they were both part of the team of coup leaders who seized power. The rifts inside the military come as some of Goita’s policies have begun to irk many, both in the military and among civilians.</p><p>This week’s arrests, some critics said, are the strongest sign yet that the military’s control is weakening from the inside. While Goita is the head of state, he appears not to have complete control over the armed forces, analysts said.</p><p>Due to the reported cracks, the military government will want to project a strong image, hence its silence, Beverly Ochieng, a Sahel analyst with the intelligence firm Control Risks, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“[These arrests] indicate some pronounced divisions,” Ochieng said. “Quite a few red lines have been crossed in recent months, and people are bound to be tired. It is likely that the military leadership will maintain and project a united front to downplay vulnerabilities and internal rivalries.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3817900\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3817900\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3817900\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/13144045-1751638804.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Interim president of the Republic of Mali Assimi Goita attends a signing ceremony following his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia on June 23, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3817900\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In July, the transitional parliament approved a five-year renewable mandate, clearing the way for Goita to lead Mali until at least 2030 [Alexander Kazakov/Sputnik/Pool via EPE-EFA]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-there-a-crackdown-on-dissent\">Is there a crackdown on dissent?</h2><p>Critics said Goita’s recent policies appear to attack dissenters and aim to shrink the civic space in the troubled country.</p><p>Goita’s government, for example, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/mali-military-chief-granted-renewable-five-year-presidential-term\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">approved </a>a bill in July that would allow him to seek a five-year presidential mandate, renewable “as many times as necessary” and without requiring an election. Earlier, when it seized power, the military promised to hand over power to civilians in 2024.</p><p>In May, the military government dissolved<a href=\"/news/2025/5/7/malis-military-government-suspends-political-parties-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> political parties and organisations</a> and banned political meetings, drawing condemnation from opposition politicians and rights groups.</p><p>In addition, the military government has targeted outspoken critics. This month, former Prime Minister Moussa Mara <a href=\"/news/2025/8/2/ex-mali-pm-charged-over-x-post-supporting-jailed-critics-of-military-rulers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was arrested and charged </a>with “undermining the credibility of the state” after he visited political prisoners and posted about seeking justice for them.</p><p>“As long as the night lasts, the sun will obviously appear!” Mara had written on July 4 in a social media post, adding: “We will fight by all means for this to happen as soon as possible!”</p><p>Choguel Maiga, who was the prime minister until his ouster in November, has also accused Goita’s government of targeting him. Although Maiga was once a champion of the government, he became critical of Goita this year. In July, the government accused him of fraud and embezzlement during his time in office and launched an investigation.</p><h2 id=\"what-else-is-fuelling-anger-in-the-country\">What else is fuelling anger in the country?</h2><p>Alongside the political situation, a lack of security remains rife in the country, causing frustration among many Malians.</p><p>Several armed groups continue to operate in the north, including JNIM. Human Rights Watch (HRW) blames the military forces and their Russian counterparts for targeting civilians indiscriminately on the assumption that they work with armed groups. At least 12 men from the Fulani ethnic group appear to have been executed and 81 forcibly disappeared since January, HRW said in a report.</p><p>Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, which are also military led, banded together to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) this year after they withdrew from the <a href=\"/news/2024/1/28/niger-mali-burkina-faso-announce-withdrawal-from-ecowas\">Economic Community of West African States</a>.They also created a 5,000-strong force for joint military operations to try to drive out armed groups.</p><p>Separately, the Malian army is once again battling Tuareg separatists. Although there were peace agreements made after the 2012 war that allowed the northern region of Kidal to maintain a semiautonomous nature, the military government under Goita has <a href=\"/news/2024/1/26/malis-military-rulers-scrap-peace-deal-with-separatist-rebels#:~:text=Military%20leaders%20say%20Algiers%20Accord,to%20signatories%20not%20upholding%20commitments.&amp;text=Mali's%20military%20rulers%20have%20announced,hostility%20by%20chief%20mediator%20Algeria\">torn up</a> the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2015/6/21/will-malis-peace-deal-hold\">peace deals</a> and returned to fighting, forcing hundreds of people to flee across the border to Mauritania.</p><p>In late July, Malian forces said they killed 70 “terrorists” in a raid in the north without specifying if those killed were with an armed group or were separatists.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He has even argued that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/tariff-wars-has-donald-trump-killed-the-wto\">the US’s trade deficit with China</a>, which reached $295.4bn last year, amounts to a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/what-legal-tests-are-donald-trumps-tariffs-facing\">national emergency</a>.</p><p>China is the US’s third-largest trade partner, after Mexico and Canada. It is heavily reliant on China for manufactured goods – from washing machines and TV sets to clothing.</p><p>The US Department of Commerce calculated that mechanical appliances (mainly low to mid-range technology products) made up 46.4 percent of all US imports from China in 2022.</p><p>And while US imports from China surged to beat Trump’s tariff bite following his “liberation day” announcement in April, they then dropped in June.</p><p>Indeed, the US trade deficit with China fell by roughly a third to $9.5 billion in June – its narrowest level since 2004, according to US Census Bureau data.</p><p>The US trade gap with China fell by $22.2bn from March to August. That amounts to a 70 percent drop from one year earlier.</p><p>More generally, US Treasury Department data shows that the US generated $124bn from January to July this year from tariffs. This is 131 percent more than the same time last year.</p><p>At the same time, the two countries trade goods of vital strategic interest whose importance trumps crude deficit figures. And both sides have been taking steps to reduce flashpoints recently.</p><p>For its part, the US has eased some export restrictions on advanced semiconductors – a key demand from China.</p><p>On Monday, the Financial Times newspaper revealed that Trump had permitted Nvidia and AMD to export advanced US chips to China. But the tech giants would pay 15 percent of their China sales to the federal government.</p><p>Trump had previously barred those deals. Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, had also imposed restrictions on US chip exports, as well as banned a range of US high-tech investments in China.</p><p>On the flipside, Chinese exports of rare earth magnets have started to recover in recent weeks after it blocked sales to the US in April.</p><p>Flows of rare earth magnets – used in everything from clean energy technology to military hardware – from China to the US <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-21/global-magnet-crisis-subsides-as-china-eases-up-on-supply-curbs\">rose</a> to 353 tonnes in June, up from just 46 tonnes in May.</p><p>Still, total shipments were still substantially lower than before Beijing launched its export controls in early April.</p><p>Washington has also been pressing Beijing to stop buying Russian oil to pressure Moscow over its war in Ukraine, with Trump even threatening to impose secondary tariffs on China.</p><p>US Vice President JD Vance said on Sunday that President Trump has been thinking of imposing tariffs on Beijing.</p><p>“Obviously, the China issue is a little bit more complicated because our relationship with China, it affects a lot of other things that have nothing to do with the Russian situation,” Vance told Fox News in an interview.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>This week’s tariff pause may clear the path for Trump to meet President Xi Jinping in late October, when the president is expected to travel to South Korea for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</p><p>Until then, the partial tariff moratorium will give both sides time to work through longstanding trade concerns in advance of the potential meeting.</p><p>In the US, economists widely agree that the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods has not been fully felt, as many firms have built up their stockpiles of inventories to mitigate the higher duties.</p><p>Looking ahead, however, BBVA Research published an analysis last month estimating that US tariffs on China would raise US inflation and slow economic growth later this year.</p><p>For Thomas Sampson, “the tariff pause allows them [the US and China] to maintain the status quo, and it wouldn’t be surprising if, after 90 days, they extend it further.”</p><p>More broadly, however, he believes that “there is a bipartisan consensus in Washington to push for a de-linking with trade from China.”</p><p>“Big picture,” he said, “even under a different president, I think you’d still see tensions in the US-China relationship.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On June 6, I decided for the first time to head to one of the distribution sites run by what is known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). On the long 12km walk on foot, I was accompanied by a few friends.</p><p>I went with a faint hope of getting some food for my family. What we encountered bore no trace of humanity. The scene we saw play out at the distribution centre resembled a battlefield.</p><p>Israeli military vehicles stood alongside GHF trucks, with a massive barrier in front of them. Occupation soldiers were stationed on elevated positions, their weapons pointed directly at the Palestinian civilians gathering.</p><p>At one point, two trucks arrived and dumped the aid on the ground in a degrading manner. Anyone who tried to approach was met with gunfire from the Israeli soldiers. Eventually, an Israeli soldier announced over a loudspeaker, “Now you can get the aid,” and the crowd rushed towards the boxes.</p><p>Men shoved and pushed, children cried, and women trembled from fear and exhaustion. Just a small minority managed to lay their hands on some aid. Some tried to steal from those who had made it. The vast majority – myself included – went back home empty-handed.</p><p>It felt as if we were selling our dignity for scraps. I saw it as a deliberate humiliation, a reshaping of the consciousness of our educated society, and its transformation into a broken community.</p><p>I went two more times to the GHF site.</p><p>On the third trip, I was accompanied by Nader, a 23-year-old youth whom I had met during displacement. Nader lived near me and regularly went to the GHF site.</p><p>Before the genocide, he worked as a guard at an orphanage in the east of Khan Younis. He did more than guard the shelter; he cared for the children, helped them in their daily lives, and gave them a sense of safety. After his life was destroyed, he took on the responsibility of supporting his family and his relatives’ children.</p><p>I would see him returning from aid sites covered in dust from head to toe, utterly exhausted, yet greeting me with a faint smile even when he did not manage to get anything.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>On July 19, Nader and my 16-year-old cousin Khaled prepared to go to the GHF site. I decided not to go, having lost all hope in that place, fully convinced it was a trap where Gazans were killed daily under the banner of “humanitarian work”.</p><p>They said they would try to get there early to secure food. Nader never returned. Khaled came back wounded with shrapnel in his leg.</p><p>Israeli forces had opened fire and launched several shells at the starving civilians. Most of the martyrs had been at the front of the line. Nader was hit by three bullets – in the chest, abdomen, and leg – along with shrapnel from a shell that landed near him.</p><p>Nader’s murder was devastating for his family; he was their sole provider. They could find no words to express their grief, only tears that fell on his lifeless body, as they mourned him.</p><p>Nader’s death was registered in the grim statistic of Palestinians killed at aid distribution sites, which today stands at 1,500. To the world, he was just a number; to me, he was a good man who had harmed no one but always helped others; he was robbed of everything by the occupation, his home, his job, his dreams of travelling and working in design and video editing. His family is now doomed to starve.</p><p>Since GHF began operating in Gaza over two months ago, nearly every major humanitarian organisation has condemned it and its method of aid distribution.</p><p>On August 7, Doctors Without Borders published a report titled: This is Not Aid. This is Organized Killing. It provided medical evidence that civilians were being deliberately targeted and described GHF sites as “death traps”.</p><p>A week before that, Human Rights Watch issued a report stating that what is happening constitutes a war crime, noting that the systematic shooting of Palestinian civilians without justification is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. It confirmed that the distribution of aid has turned into “regular bloodbaths”.</p><p>What makes GHF’s crimes even more horrific is that its leadership deny what is happening and embrace the occupation’s narrative. Its president, Johnny Moore, declared that there is no famine in Gaza, ignoring medical reports documenting the deaths of children from hunger. He accused Hamas of stealing aid and dismissed reports on the humanitarian situation as “Hamas disinformation”.</p><p>He even claimed that Hamas deliberately harmed Palestinian civilians to blame the Israeli army or GHF. Yet the reality on the ground, witnessed by me firsthand, is that the only people with guns present at GHF sites are their mercenary guards and occupation soldiers. The Palestinians coming there are starving civilians, their bones protruding from extreme hunger.</p><p>The continuing operations of GHF have implications beyond the Gaza Strip. Granting legitimacy to this organisation instead of condemning and dismantling it risks turning humanitarian aid centres into killing fields everywhere.</p><p>I do not want my friend Nader’s death to be in vain. Everyone responsible for his killing, and everyone who allowed aid to be distributed through GHF, or funded it, or gave it a false humanitarian cover, must be held accountable. What we need is not only to stop these practices, but to prosecute everyone who turned aid into a trap, used hunger as a weapon, and contributed to the killing of innocents.</p><p>Silence over these crimes is complicity, and silence today means they will happen again tomorrow.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Many of the schools' curriculums emphasise social justice, and students are encouraged to take jobs in underserved communities.</p>\n<p>But that revolutionary spirit has also made the normal schools hotbeds for activism. \"Normalistas\", as the students are called, have a long tradition of protest.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they block highways. Other times, they occupy toll booths. One of their most famous activities is the nonviolent commandeering of local buses: The practice is so common that many bus drivers know to simply step aside when their vehicle is boarded.</p>\n<p>Professor Tanalis Padilla, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the public reaction to such protests has been mixed. Some people support the students wholeheartedly. Others, she said, express annoyance at \"the radical kids out there again on the streets\".</p>\n<p>According to Padilla, negative news coverage has contributed to that scepticism. \"It’s safe to say the media has always been against them, calling them vandals and things like that.\"</p>\n<p>Padilla explained that this perception stems from the educational programme at the normal schools, which is rooted in socialist and collectivist politics.</p>\n<p>\"With the Cold War in the '70s and '80s, the media would portray the schools as hotbeds of radicalism and social disturbance,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Over the years, numerous normalista protests have culminated in violent clashes with police — and even death.</p>\n<p>The most infamous incident took place in September 2014, when 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College, another normal school, took over a bus in the state of Guerrero. They planned to use it to join a protest in Mexico City.</p>\n<p>What happened next remains unclear. But it is believed that the students were kidnapped and killed with the knowledge of local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Not a single one of the students was ever seen alive again. Charred remains belonging to three of the Ayotzinapa students were later identified using DNA testing.</p>\n<p>The Ayotzinapa case garnered widespread outrage and support for normalistas in Mexico and abroad.</p>\n<p>“What happened was so shocking and so vicious that there was a general reaction of sympathy” towards normalistas, Padilla explained.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
