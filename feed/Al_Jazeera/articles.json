economies are facing new uncertainty from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war, as his administration cracks down on exports directed through third countries to avoid his tariffs on China.</p><p>Under an executive order issued by Trump last week, goods imported into the US face a punitive 40 percent tariff, plus penalties and any applicable country-of-origin duties, if US Customs and Border Protection determines they have been “transshipped”.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4

4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>The tariff is set to go into effect on Thursday, along with Trump’s latest country-specific tariffs ranging from 10 to 41 percent.</p><p>While China is the main target of the new tax on transhipments, which applies to all redirected goods irrespective of country of origin, Southeast Asia could suffer much of the fallout, because of the region’s highly integrated supply chains with Chinese manufacturers, trade experts say.</p><p>The effect will depend on exactly how the Trump administration defines transhipments, which is still unclear, said Puan Yatim, an associate professor at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia’s Graduate School of Business.</p><p>“If Washington maintains a narrow interpretation – targeting only those goods that are imported from China, minimally processed or relabeled and then re-exported to the US – the economic impact on ASEAN may be limited,” Yatim told Al Jazeera, referring to the Southeast Asian regional bloc.</p><p>“However, a broader and more punitive interpretation – where goods with any significant Chinese input are also deemed in violation – could prove economically devastating for countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Malaysia,” she added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Chinese manufacturers have for years been steadily expanding into Southeast Asia as part of a strategy known as “China Plus One”.</p><p>The strategy has helped Chinese firms avoid US tariffs, exploit cheaper labour, and diversify their supply chains – a particular concern during China’s COVID-19 lockdowns.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>From 2020 to 2024, Chinese foreign direct investment into the 10 ASEAN nations grew from $7.1bn to $19.3bn, according to ASEAN data.</p><p>During the same period, exports from China to Southeast Asia rose from $385bn to $587bn, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>The surge in Chinese exports, including goods illegally mislabeled to conceal their origin, has placed Southeast Asia in the Trump administration’s crosshairs.</p><p>“[Companies] need intermediate imports from China to create products which get shipped to the US, but because companies have been embroiled in illegal transshipments in the region, there’s a huge bias in the Trump administration that ASEAN is the predominant channel,” Priyanka Kishore, principal economist at Asia Decoded in Singapore, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>A key example of trade that invoked Washington’s ire centred on the solar cell industry.</p><p>Following a years-long investigation, the US Department of Commerce in April announced tariffs of up to 3,500 percent on Southeast Asian manufacturers alleged to have illicitly exported Chinese goods.</p><p>Southeast Asia is now in a “sticky situation” where it must appease the US – the region’s top export market – while not alienating China, Kishore said.</p><p>Beijing has threatened to “resolutely take countermeasures” against countries that agree to trade deals with the US that go against its interests.</p><p>In May, Malaysia announced that it would no longer allow nongovernmental organisations such as chambers of commerce to issue certificates of origin, as part of its efforts to ensure the integrity of its exports.</p><p>Vietnam similarly agreed to a 40 percent transshipment tariff in a framework deal reached with the US in May, while Indonesia’s Trade Minister Budi Santoso said last month that his country was opposed to transshipping.</p><p>Despite Southeast Asian governments’ efforts to mollify the US, the transshipment tariff could create major compliance issues for the private sector, said Steve Okun, founder and CEO of APAC Advisors in Singapore.</p><p>A top concern will be how the US treats products made with components from multiple countries.</p><p>US tariffs are typically determined by the location where a product underwent “substantive transformation”, but if the Trump administration were to apply duties based on the presence of even small amounts of Chinese components, compliance and enforcement would be extremely difficult, Okun said.</p><p>“You’re going to have to be doing due diligence on supply chains that you never had to do before,” Okun told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The changes would “potentially redefine trade,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3875000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3875000\" class=\"wp-caption

Plus One competitive advantage with his tariffs on the region’s economies, said Richard Laub, CEO and cofounder of Dragon Sourcing, a global procurement service provider.</p><p>Under Trump’s latest tariffs, Singapore is subject to a 10 percent rate, while Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia are subject to rates of 19 or 20 percent – less than the 30 percent rate proposed for China under the White House’s latest tariff framework.</p><p>Trump’s transshipment tariff potentially eats into that advantage.</p><p>“A lot of the Chinese supply strategy has been to establish some kind of facility abroad with limited content, limited value, adding those facilities to basically circumvent those transshipments. I suspect that that will come to a standstill,” Laub told Al Jazeera.</p><p>A Washington, DC-based consultant who advises businesses on trade and supply chain issues in China, said he had observed a similar phenomenon, but to the detriment of US exporters.</p><p>“We are seeing [multinational corporations] from around the globe, particularly those that served the China market from the United States, doing more to localise supply chains for China in China,” the consultant told Al Jazeera, asking not to be named.</p><p>Companies in sectors that rely on materials like foreign-sourced steel – which is subject to separate tariffs – have found manufacturing becoming too expensive in the US and started moving manufacturing out of the country, the consultant said.</p><p>“This is a terrible outcome and the opposite of what the administration intends,” he said.</p><p>Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said despite the uncertainty, the direction of the policy in Washington is ambiguously bad for Southeast Asia.</p><p>“Clearly, the US is concerned about transshipments,” Marro told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Clearly, it is moving to crack down on them, and so for those investors, those companies, those governments that have staked their premise on things like China Plus One, we are now seeing a reassessment, and that is something which investors have to be integrating into their strategies.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Roughly 78,000 people were killed instantly. Tens of thousands more would die by the end of the year due to burns and radiation exposure.</p><p>The attack on Hiroshima, followed three days later by a plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki, led to Japan’s surrender on August 15 and the end of the second world war. Hiroshima had been chosen as a target partly because its surrounding mountains were believed by US planners to amplify the bomb’s force.</p><p>At Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park on Wednesday, where the bomb detonated almost directly overhead eight decades ago, delegates from a record number of international countries and regions attended the annual memorial.</p><p>Reporting from the park, Al Jazeera’s Fadi Salameh said the ceremony unfolded in a similar sequence to those of previous years.</p><p>“The ceremony procedure is almost the same throughout the years I’ve been covering it,” Salameh said. “It starts at eight o’clock with the children and people offering flowers and then water to represent helping the victims who survived the atomic bombing at that time.</p><p>“Then at exactly 8:15… a moment of silence. After that, the mayor of Hiroshima reads out the declaration of peace in which they call for the abolition of nuclear weapons around the world,” he added.</p><p>Schoolchildren from across Japan participated in the “Promise of Peace” – reading statements of hope and remembrance. This year’s ceremony also included a message from the representative of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, urging global peace.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hiroshima’s mayor, Kazumi Matsui, warned of the dangers of rising global militarism, criticising world leaders who argue that nuclear weapons are necessary for national security.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Among the world’s political leaders, there is a growing belief that possessing nuclear weapons is unavoidable in order to protect their own countries,” he said, noting that the United States and Russia still hold 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads.</p><p>“This situation not only nullifies the lessons the international community has learned from the tragic history of the past, but also seriously undermines the frameworks that have been built for peace-building,” he said.</p><p>“To all the leaders around the world: please visit Hiroshima and witness for yourselves the reality of the atomic bombing.”</p><p>Many attendees echoed that call. “It feels more and more like history is repeating itself,” 71-year-old Yoshikazu Horie told the Reuters news agency. “Terrible things are happening in Europe … Even in Japan, in Asia, it’s going the same way – it’s very scary. I’ve got grandchildren and I want peace so they can live their lives happily.”</p><p>Survivors of the bombings – known as hibakusha – once faced discrimination over unfounded fears of disease and genetic effects. Their numbers have fallen below 100,000 for the first time this year.</p><p>Japan maintains a stated commitment to nuclear disarmament, but remains outside the UN treaty banning nuclear weapons.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ohtani, the three-time MLB MVP from Japan who is on a trajectory to become the greatest Asian player in baseball history, draws fans from across the Pacific Rim to Dodger Stadium while attracting millions in sponsorships and partnerships for the Dodgers.</p><p>Son’s move to California also puts him in a position to have an effect on and off the field at the World Cup, which will be held across North America in 2026. Son, the captain of his national team, has already said he will play in his fourth World Cup.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>After leading Tottenham to its first European trophy in decades by winning the Europa League in May, in a fitting cap to his English career, Son will go straight into the MLS Cup race when he suits up for his new club. LAFC currently sits sixth in the Western Conference at 10-6-6, but with multiple games in hand on every team ahead of it due to its participation in the Club World Cup.</p><p>Son’s seven Premier League goals last season were his fewest since his Tottenham debut, but he still appears to have the pace and skill necessary to be a difference-maker at any level. He also turned 33 only a month ago, putting him on the younger end of the global stars recently arriving in MLS.</p><p>Lionel Messi and Marco Reus were 35 and Luis Suarez was 37 when they went stateside in recent years, while Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris were both 37 when they joined LAFC last year.</p><p>Son will be reunited in Los Angeles with longtime Tottenham teammate Lloris, who has been outstanding since becoming LAFC’s goalkeeper last season.</p><p>High-scoring French forward Denis Bouanga is the only designated player currently under contract for LAFC, and general manager John Thorrington has been criticised by some fans for not using the full power of his financial resources this season. LAFC spent months on an ultimately failed attempt to get France’s Antoine Griezmann to leave Atletico Madrid.</p><p>Bouanga and Son have both thrived on the left wing during their careers, but Son likely has more positional versatility than Bouanga, making him a candidate to line up in the middle or even on the right wing.</p><p>Son seems to be an infinitely better fit for LAFC than Giroud, who moved to Lille last month after one disappointing year in California. LAFC plays a counterattacking, speed-based style that didn’t suit Giroud’s goal-scoring strengths, while Son should be right at home in such a system.</p><p>But LAFC could also alter its style in the winter, after coach Steve Cherundolo departs for Germany following four largely successful seasons highlighted by an MLS Cup championship.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They have repeatedly described each other as friends, and in February, Modi became among the first world leaders to visit Trump in the White House.</p><p>But six months later, a sobering reality has hit New Delhi, with Trump punishing it with a 25 percent tariff on imports and near-daily threats to increase those levies further because of India’s oil purchases from Russia, as he tries to force Moscow into accepting a ceasefire in its war on Ukraine.</p><p>An India-US trade deal remains elusive, and bilateral relations are on a slippery slope, according to some experts. “US-India relations are at the lowest point in decades,” Biswajit Dhar, a trade economist who has worked on several Indian trade deals, told Al Jazeera. Dozens of other countries, including neighbours India has tense ties with, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, are facing lower tariffs.</p><p>Addressing a public rally on Saturday, Modi took a defiant stance against Trump’s tariff assaults. “The world economy is going through many apprehensions. There is an atmosphere of instability,” Modi said.</p><p>“Now, whatever we buy, there should be only one scale: we will buy those things which have been made by the sweat of an Indian,” he added.</p><p>Modi’s comments come as Indian officials reportedly reject stopping the buying of Russian crude.</p><p>Trump has blamed India’s buying of Russian oil for helping finance Moscow’s war on Ukraine. “They [Indians] don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,”  Trump said Monday. “Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA.”</p><p>So, how did we get here? What are the growing points of discord between India and the US? And could India give up on Russian oil to save its relationship with the US?</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-friction-points-in-us-india-relations\">What are the friction points in US-India relations?</h2><p>Modi and Trump might speak highly of each other, but there is a growing number of areas where India and the US are at odds, ranging from trade agreements to strategic alignment.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><h3>No trade deal</h3><p>Trade has long been a sticking point in US-India relations, even as strategic and defence ties have deepened. The US has consistently pushed for greater market access, lower tariffs and stronger protections, especially for its tech, pharmaceutical and agricultural exports. India, on the other hand, has resisted what it sees as disproportionate pressure to open up its economy in ways that may harm its domestic industries and small farmers.</p><p>Yet, before Trump, the two countries managed this economic relationship, despite its imbalance: India sold twice as much to the US as the US sold to India. The US wanted access to India’s growing markets, and India needed to export to the US, so keeping ties afloat was important to both.</p><p>After Trump first announced tariffs on almost all trading partners on April 1, Indian and US officials began talks to stitch together a trade deal. But disagreements over e-commerce regulation, digital data flows and price controls on medical devices have reportedly stalled progress.</p><p>Indian officials were frantically chasing the August 1 deadline set by Trump to avoid tariffs. But despite occasional breakthroughs, like India cutting tariffs on some US goods, the two countries have not yet concluded a full bilateral trade deal.</p><p>With negotiations still under way, New Delhi now faces 25 percent tariffs on its exports to the US, and Trump has threatened unspecified additional penalties tied to India’s energy and arms purchases from Russia.</p><p>“This is a pressure tactic by Trump,” said Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat who has served as India’s trade commissioner in New York. “Unlike others, India has not given in to what the Americans want because we have to protect our MSMEs and agriculture,” he added, using the acronym for micro, small, and medium enterprises.</p><p>Almost half of India’s population depends on agriculture for its livelihood, making the issue politically sensitive for every Indian government.</p><p>“Everybody is playing hardball on both sides, and it’s necessary to arrive at a mutually beneficial solution,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3509392\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3509392\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3509392\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25044861679897-1739493119.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Donald Trump and Narendra Modi reach out at a White House press conference for a handshake\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3509392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump and Indian  Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, on February 13, 2025, in Washington, DC [Alex Brandon/AP]</figcaption></figure><h3>India’s close ties with Russia</h3><p>As Trump’s frustrations with Russia mount over stalled peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, the US president has been looking for more ways to corner Moscow. India’s longstanding relationship with Russia has emerged as a key target for Washington.</p><p>While the US views India as a key partner in countering China’s rise in the Asia Pacific, it has grown increasingly uneasy with New Delhi’s continued defence and energy ties with Moscow, analysts say.</p><p>At a time when the West has shunned Russian President Vladimir Putin, who also faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court related to the war in Ukraine, Modi visited Russia twice last year. In July 2024, Putin conferred upon Modi the Order of St Andrew the Apostle the First‑Called, Russia’s highest civilian honour.</p><p>Russia remains one of India’s largest arms suppliers, and their cooperation spans critical technologies, including missile systems and nuclear reactors. And after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, India ramped up imports of discounted Russian crude oil.</p><h3>Kashmir ceasefire</h3><p>After an attack by gunmen in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam resort town on April 22, in which 26 civilians were killed, India and Pakistan engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades.</p><p>As the South Asian nuclear-armed rivals traded missile and drone attacks in May, Trump said he intervened and told both countries to agree to a ceasefire, or there would be no trade.</p><p>“Fellas, come on. Let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles. Let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully,” Trump said a few days later in Riyadh.</p><p>“I used trade to a large extent to do [the ceasefire]. And it all stopped,” he added.</p><p>In India, which has long held the position that all disputes with Pakistan must be settled bilaterally, with no third-party mediation, Trump’s claim that he engineered the May 10 ceasefire that stopped the fighting has sparked criticism of Modi from the opposition.</p><p>Modi’s government has insisted that the truce was brought about bilaterally, that Modi did not speak to Trump during the conflict, and that – contrary to the US president’s claims – trade was never discussed as a factor in negotiating the ceasefire. But Trump has doubled down on his claim, mentioning more than 30 times that he brokered peace.</p><h3>Growing US-Pakistan ties</h3><p>After the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May, Trump hosted Pakistan’s army chief, Asim Munir, at the White House. Never before had a US president hosted a Pakistani military boss who was not also the head of state.</p><p>That meeting underscored a growing warmth between Washington and Islamabad after years of tense ties, with US military officials crediting Pakistan with helping them capture wanted “terrorists”.</p><p>The government of Pakistan also officially endorsed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for “recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership during the recent India-Pakistan crisis”.</p><p>A day after meeting Munir, Trump called Modi a “fantastic man”, but added that Munir was “extremely influential” in bringing about the ceasefire.</p><p>“I love Pakistan,” Trump said, and repeated: “I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.”</p><p>As Trump targeted India in his latest tariff assault, he took to his Truth Social platform to reveal that he had concluded a deal with Pakistan, in which they would work together on developing oil reserves. “Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!” he wrote.</p><p>Later, the US imposed a 19 percent tariff on imports from Pakistan, which Islamabad hailed as “balanced and forward-looking”.</p><h3>Big Tech hiring, deportation</h3><p>Days before Modi visited Trump in February, visuals emerged of Indian citizens in the US, shackled in chains, parading towards a US military aircraft, prompting anger in India over the treatment of its nationals.</p><p>Returnees, immigrants without documents to stay in the US, described being chained throughout the flight to India, unable to move for nearly 40 hours. Like trade, the issue of deportation has been at the centre of Trump’s re-election campaign.</p><p>And it is not just undocumented migrants.</p><p>After assuming the presidency, Trump’s administration has also come under pressure from the president’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) base to crack down on H1B work visas, nearly 72 percent of which go to Indians.</p><p>Last month, speaking at an artificial intelligence summit in Washington, DC, Trump singled out tech giants like Google, Microsoft and Apple for hiring workers from India. Trump declared, “The days of hiring workers in India are over”, and urged companies to prioritise jobs for Americans and disconnect from outsourcing models tied to India and China.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3036509\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3036509\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3036509\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-09T133450Z_527600057_RC2PR8ASDASC_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-INDIA-1720553705.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C547&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Order of St. Andrew\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3036509\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin awards Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Order of St Andrew the Apostle the First-Called, at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on July 9, 2024 [Evgenia Novozhenina/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-latest-spark-in-us-india-tensions\">What’s the latest spark in US-India tensions?</h2><p>Russia’s war on Ukraine has emerged as the latest trigger, as Trump tried to push Putin into accepting a ceasefire.</p><p>On Monday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits”.</p><p>Earlier, Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff at the White House and one of the US president’s most influential aides, linked India’s buying of Russian crude to financing Moscow’s war in Ukraine.</p><p>“What [Trump] said very clearly is that it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this war by purchasing the oil from Russia,” said Miller.</p><p>“People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil. That’s an astonishing fact,” Miller told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>India imports nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil per day from Russia, making it the second-largest purchaser of Russian oil after China. Russia also tops the list of India’s arms suppliers.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-india-reacted-to-trump\">How has India reacted to Trump?</h2><p>On Monday, India’s Ministry of External Affairs responded sharply, calling the US’s targeting of New Delhi over the buying of Russian oil “unjustified and unreasonable”.</p><p>It accused the West of double standards, pointing out how Europe traded more with Russia in 2024 than India did, and how the US continues to import chemicals and fertilisers from Russia.</p><p>It also said that the US has “actively encouraged” it to buy Russian oil, so that global crude prices would stay under control while the West could reduce its dependence on Russian energy.</p><p>“India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the statement concluded.</p><p><strong>Will India stop buying Russian oil to please Trump?</strong></p><p>That is very unlikely, experts say.</p><p>India has historically — since independence from Britain in 1947 — cherished its strategic autonomy, including during the Cold War, when it stayed non-aligned. Since the end of the Cold War, it has deepened strategic and military ties with the US while maintaining its traditional friendship with Russia.</p><p>“Trump is trying to wean India off its strategic autonomy policy by going after its ties with Russia and membership in BRICS,” Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera, referring to the Trump’s threats of higher tariffs against members of the bloc that includes several leading nations of the Global South.</p><p>“But Delhi is not about to jettison this policy in the face of Trump’s pressure. On the contrary, I expect it to double down.”</p><p>Late on Tuesday, India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval landed in Moscow. Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar is expected to visit Russia later this month. And New Delhi has confirmed that Putin will be visiting India later this year, for the first time since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>In recent weeks, India has also indicated that it is open to reviving a trilateral grouping including Russia and China, the West’s two big rivals.</p><p>“Can the US or Europe give up their strategic autonomy?” asked Jayati Ghosh, economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “India has more people than both of them put together. It is absurd to even think that India can give up that,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3872428\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3872428\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3872428\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20190628__1HY3OT__v1__HighRes__JapanG20Summit-1754324318.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"JAPAN-G20-SUMMIT\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3872428\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping hold a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka on June 28, 2019 [Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik/ AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-future-of-us-india-relationship\">What does this mean for future of US-India relationship?</h2><p>Echoing Dhar, the economist, Kugelman said that US-India relations have “sunk to their lowest level during the last two decades of strategic partnership”, which began taking shape in the early years of the 21st century.</p><p>Non-alignment with foreign governments “remains a critical component of India’s foreign policy”, said Kugelman, adding that he expects that to continue.</p><p>And because “India maintained this balance after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Trump is penalising [New Delhi] for trying to maintain the balance [between US and Russia],” he said. “[That’s] something that the Biden administration never did,” he added, referring to the previous administration of US President Joe Biden.</p><p>Trigunayat, the former diplomat, said that “strategic autonomy for India is more important now than ever. India, with the world’s largest population, has its own approach to strategic autonomy that’s in the DNA of Indian foreign policy.”</p><p>In the longer run, Kugelman said that New Delhi will hope that Trump’s ire will eventually blow over – a likely case if Russia agrees to stop fighting in Ukraine.</p><p>“In that sense, India may look to redouble efforts to press Putin to end the war,” said Kugelman, “because for now, Trump appears to be taking out his frustration with Putin on India”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

These mosquitoes also carry and spread dengue, yellow fever and the Zika virus.</p><p>The name, chikungunya, derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, spoken in Tanzania and Mozambique, meaning “to become contorted”.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In most cases, patients will feel better within a week. In many cases, however, the joint pain can last for months or even years.</p><p>There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but deaths are rare. If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream.</p><p data-start=\"55\" data-end=\"214\">People most at risk of serious illness from chikungunya include newborns, older adults and those with existing health problems such as heart disease or diabetes.</p><p data-start=\"216\" data-end=\"268\">There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but the death rate is low, except in high-risk populations.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"216\" data-end=\"268\">If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream. If a non-infected mosquito bites a person who is already infected, it sucks the virus from that person’s blood and becomes a carrier capable of transmitting the virus to others through bites.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3270421 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-01-1729771918.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-transmission\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-bad-is-the-current-spread-of-the-virus\">How bad is the current spread of the virus?</h2><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current surge in cases began in early 2025, with major outbreaks in Indian Ocean Islands, including La Reunion, Mayotte and Mauritius.</p><p>In La Reunion, more than 47,500 cases of chikungunya and 12 associated deaths were reported up to May 2025, with sustained high transmission across the island, according to the WHO. The ECDC also reports that as of July 18, there were more than 54,000 cases reported from La Reunion.</p><p>This is now the most serious chikungunya outbreak in La Reunion since the 2005–2006 epidemic, which saw an estimated 244,000 to more than 300,000 cases, and prompted large-scale public health efforts to control mosquito breeding and limit transmission.</p><p>The virus has also spread to other countries, including Madagascar, Somalia and Kenya, and has shown signs of epidemic-level transmission in parts of Southeast Asia, as well as India, where financial capital Mumbai has seen a surge in cases since July.</p><p>The WHO has also raised concerns about the rising number of imported chikungunya cases in Europe. Since May 1, about 800 imported cases have been reported in mainland France.</p><p>According to the ECDC, the Americas as a region have reported the highest number of chikungunya cases globally. As of mid-July 2025, the countries with the most cases in the region include Brazil (185,553), Bolivia (4,721), Argentina (2,836) and Peru (55).</p><p>In China, infections have been reported in at least 12 cities across southern Guangdong province, in addition to Foshan.</p><p>Chinese authorities said that an “imported case triggered local transmission” in July, but did not specify where the infection originated. According to experts, rising global temperatures have led to warmer and wetter weather, allowing mosquitoes to thrive.</p><p>Separately, on Saturday, Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200897.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed</a> its first case of chikungunya: a 12-year-old boy who developed a fever, rash and joint pain since July 31, after visiting Foshan.

At the same time, scientists are releasing large “elephant mosquitoes” – about 2cm (0.8 inches) long – whose larvae eat the smaller mosquitoes that spread the virus. Health experts hope these mosquito helpers will play an important role in stopping the outbreak.</p><p data-start=\"138\" data-end=\"270\">According to a report by the BBC, residents of affected areas in China have been ordered to eliminate standing water in and around their homes – including in flowerpots, coffee machines and empty bottles. Noncompliance may result in fines of up to 10,000 yuan (approximately $1,400), and in more serious cases, people could face criminal charges for “obstructing the prevention of infectious diseases”.</p><p data-start=\"987\" data-end=\"1255\">Citing local sources, The New York Times said that in some instances, infected residents in Foshan are being moved to “quarantine wards”, where they are kept behind mosquito nets and screens. Some patients also say they were given no choice but to seek treatment at their own expense.</p><p data-start=\"987\" data-end=\"1255\">In other places, such as La Reunion and Mayotte, authorities have also launched enhanced surveillance, mosquito control initiatives and targeted vaccination efforts.</p><p data-start=\"987\" data-end=\"1255\">The Basque Country in Spain activated preventive protocols after a case was detected in Hendaye, just across the border in France. The protocols include increased surveillance in border towns and encouraging people to make reports through apps such as Mosquito Alert.</p><h2 id=\"how-can-chikungunya-be-prevented-and-treated\">How can chikungunya be prevented and treated?</h2><p>Health authorities advise protecting oneself against mosquito bites as the most effective strategy against the spread of chikungunya.</p><p>This may involve wearing long sleeves and trousers, applying mosquito repellents, removing bodies of standing water where mosquitoes can breed, and staying in closed, air-conditioned spaces indoors or behind mosquito netting when outdoors.</p><p>While there are no specific medicines to treat the virus, rest, fluids and pain relievers may help alleviate symptoms, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"214\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">However, some pain relievers may be unsafe during a suspected infection. The CDC recommends avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until dengue is ruled out, as they can raise the risk of bleeding.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3874547\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3874547\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3874547\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2024-07-25T004356Z_362697650_RC2H09A5EM6M_RTRMADP_3_GUATEMALA-DENGUE-1754441362.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are examined at the entomology department of the Health Ministry, in Guatemala City, Guatemala, July 22, 2024.

Then, if the tourist departs on or before their visa’s expiration, that amount would be refunded to them.</p><p>The money would also be returned if the visa were cancelled, if the travel does not occur, or if the tourist is denied entry into the US.</p><p>Should a tourist overstay their visa — or apply for asylum or another immigration-related programme while in the US — the federal government would keep the money.</p><p>More countries, in addition to Malawi and Zambia, are expected to be added to the list. The bond requirement is slated to take effect for those two countries starting on August 20.</p><p>“This targeted, common-sense measure reinforces the administration’s commitment to US immigration law while deterring visa overstays,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Tuesday.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has taken a hardline approach to immigration since his return to office in January for a second term.</p><p>On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order called “Protecting the American People Against Invasion”, which denounced the “unprecedented flood of illegal immigration” into the US.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>It pledged to forcefully execute US immigration laws. That executive order was ultimately cited as the basis for the new visa bonds.</p><p>The bonds are part of a pilot programme announced on Monday, slated to last 12 months.</p><p>“This [temporary final rule] addresses the Trump Administration’s call to protect the American people by faithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States,” a <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/05/2025-14826/visas-visa-bond-pilot-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filing to the Federal Register</a> reads.</p><p>Every year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) releases a report about visa overstays in the US.</p><p>The most <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1011_CBP-Entry-Exit-Overstay-Report-FY23-Data.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent report</a>, released in 2024, found that there were 565,155 visa overstays for fiscal year 2023. That amounted to only 1.45 percent of the total non-immigrant admissions into the US.</p><p>“In other words, 98.55 percent of the in-scope nonimmigrant visitors departed the United States on-time and in accordance with the terms of their admission,” the report explains.</p><p>In its breakdown of country-by-country overstay rates, the report indicated that both Malawi and Zambia had relatively high visa overstay rates, at 14.3 and 11.1 percent, respectively.</p><p>But Zambia and Malawi are both smaller countries with relatively few tourism- or business-related arrivals in the US.</p><p>According to the report, only 1,655 people arrived from Malawi in fiscal year 2023 for business or pleasure. Of that total, 237 overstayed their visas.</p><p>Meanwhile, 3,493 people arrived from Zambia for tourism or business during the same time frame. Of that total, 388 surpassed their visa limits.</p><p>Those numbers are dwarfed by the sheer numbers from larger, more populous countries with larger consumer bases. An estimated 20,811 Brazilians stayed in the US longer than their tourism or business visas allowed, for instance, and 40,884 overstays were from Colombia.</p><p>Critics have also pointed out that the newly imposed bonds put travel to the US — already a pricey prospect — further out of reach for residents of poorer countries.</p><p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an advocacy group, was among those that denounced the new bond scheme as discriminatory. It described the system as a form of exploitation — a “legalised shakedown” — in a <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-says-trump-admins-15000-visa-bond-program-is-legalized-shakedown-not-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Tuesday.</p><p>“This is not about national security,” said Robert McCaw, CAIR’s government affairs director. “It’s about weaponising immigration policy to extort vulnerable visitors, punish disfavored countries, and turn America’s welcome mat into a paywall.”</p><p>Citizens of countries that are part of the US’s visa waiver programmes are not subject to the visa bonds unveiled this week.</p></div></div></body></html>"
