In 2023, exports were estimated to be worth $560m, with top importers of Sarawak’s wood including France, the Netherlands, Japan and the United States, according to Human Rights Watch.</p><p>In recent years, the timber industry has turned to meeting the rapidly growing demand for wood pellets, which are burned to generate energy.</p><p>While logging reaped billions in profits, it often came at the expense of Indigenous communities, who lacked formal legal recognition of their ancestral lands, despite their historical connection to the forest and their deep ecological knowledge of the region.</p><p>“In Sarawak, there are very limited options for communities to actually claim native customary land rights,” says Jessica Merriman from The Borneo Project, an organisation that campaigns for environmental protection and human rights across Malaysian Borneo.</p><p>“Even communities who do decide to try the legal route, which takes years, lawyers, and costs money, they risk losing access to the rest of their customary territories,” Merriman says, explaining that making a legal claim to one tract of land may mean losing much more.</p><p>“Because you’ve agreed – essentially – that the rest [of the land] doesn’t belong to you,” she says.</p><p>Even successful community claims may only grant rights to a very small fraction of what Indigenous communities actually consider to be their native customary land in Sarawak, according to The Borneo Project.</p><p>This also means that logging companies might legally obtain permits to cut the forest in areas which had been previously disputed.</p><p>While timber companies have brought economic opportunities for some, providing job opportunities to villagers as drivers or labourers, many Kenyah community members in the Ulu Baram region have negative associations with the industry.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878183\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878183\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878183\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC04425-1754638109.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Harvested logs in Sarawak [Izzy Sasada/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878183\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Logs transported on a truck in Sarawak [Izzy Sasada/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>“We don’t agree with logging, because it is very damaging to the forests, water and ecosystems in our area,” says David Bilong, a member of Long Semiyang village, which is about a half-hour boat ride from Long Moh village.</p><p>Both Long Moh and Long Semiyang have dwindling populations, with about 200 and 100 full-time residents, respectively.</p><p>Extensive logging roads in the region have increased accessibility for the villages, resulting in younger community members migrating to nearby towns for work and sending remittances back home to support relatives.</p><p>Those who remain in the village, or “kampung”, live in traditional longhouses which are made up of rows of private family apartments connected by shared verandas. Here, community activities like rattan weaving, meetings and karaoke-singing take place.</p><p>Bilong has played an active role in community activism over the years. For him, deforestation activities have contributed to the undermining of generational knowledge, as physical landmarks have been removed from their lived environment.</p><p>“It’s difficult for us to go to the jungle now,” he explains.</p><p>“We don’t know any more which hill is the one we go to for hunting,” he says.</p><p>“We don’t even know where the hill went.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878202\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878202\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878202\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CE6AE106-E695-441C-AC0F-8DC398A6BB75-1754638498.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"William Tinggang examines a mushroom within Nawan.

Indigenous communities across Ulu Baram have shown their resistance to logging activities by making physical blockades.</p><p>This typically entails community members camping for weeks, or even months, along logging roads to physically obstruct unwanted outsiders from entering native customary territories.</p><p>The primary legal framework regulating forest use is the Sarawak Forest Ordinance (1958), which grants the state government sweeping control over forest areas, including the issuance of timber licences.</p><p>Now, local communities are increasingly turning to strategic tools to assert their rights.</p><p>One of these tools is the creation of community maps.</p><p>“We are moving from oral tradition to physical documentation,” says Indigenous human rights activist Celine Lim.</p><p>Lim is the managing director of Save Rivers, one of the local organisations supporting Ulu Baram’s Indigenous communities to map their lands.</p><p>“Because of outside threats, this

government maps, these maps reflect the community’s cultural landmarks.</p><p>They include markers for things like burial grounds, sacred sites and trees which contain poison for hunting with blow darts, reflecting how Indigenous people actually relate to and manage their land sustainably.</p><p>“For Indigenous people, the way that they connect to land is definitely a lot deeper than many of our conventional ways,” says Lim.</p><p>“They see the mountains, the rivers, the land, the forest and in the past, these were entities,” she says.</p><p>“The way you’d respect a person is the way that they would respect these entities.”</p><p>By physically documenting how their land is managed, Indigenous communities can use maps to assert their presence and protect their native customary territory.</p><p>“This community map is really important for us,” says Bilong, who played a role in the creation of Long Semiyang’s community map.</p><p>“When we make a map, we know what our area is and what is in our area,” he says.</p><p>“It is important that we create boundaries”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The tradition of creating community maps in Sarawak first emerged in the 1990s, when the Switzerland-based group Bruno Manser-Fonds – named after a Swiss environmental activist who disappeared in Sarawak in 2000 – began supporting the Penan community with mapping activities.</p><p>The Penan are a previously nomadic indigenous group in Sarawak who have now mostly settled as farmers.</p><p>Through mapping, they have documented at least 5,000 river names and 1,000 topographic features linked to their traditions, and their community maps have been used numerous times as critical documentation to prevent logging.</p><p>Other groups, such as the Kenyah, are following suit with the creation of their own community maps.</p><p>“The reason why the trend of mapping has continued is because in other parts of Baram and Sarawak, they’ve proven to be successful,” says the Borneo Project’s Merriman, “at least in getting the attention of logging companies and the government.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878221\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878221\"

native customary territories by joining a global platform hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme that recognises Indigenous and community conserved areas, known as the ICCA.</p><p>Communities participating in the ICCA are listed on a globally accessible online database, and this international visibility offers a place for them to publicise threats and land grabs.</p><p>In Sarawak, the international visibility afforded through ICCA registration could offer an alternative avenue of protection for communities.</p><p>Merriman says that another important aspect of applying for ICCA recognition is the process itself of registering.</p><p>“The ICCA process is fundamentally an organising tool and a self-strengthening tool,” she says.</p><p>“It’s not just about being on the database. It’s about going through the process of a community banding together to protect its own land, to come up with a shared vision of responding to threats and what they want to do to try to make alternative income.”</p><p>Safeguarding Indigenous communities in Sarawak also has an international significance, activists say.</p><p>As the impacts of climate change intensify in Malaysia and globally, the potential role of Sarawak’s rainforests in climate change mitigation is increasingly being recognised.</p><p>“There’s plenty of talk at the state level about protecting forests,” says Jettie Word, executive director of The Borneo Project.</p><p>“Officials often say the right things in terms of recognising their importance in combatting climate change. Though ongoing logging indicates a gap between rhetoric and reality,” Word says.</p><p>“While mapping alone can’t protect a forest from a billion-dollar timber project, when it’s combined with community organising and campaigning, it’s often quite powerful and we’ve seen it successfully keep the companies away,” she says.</p><p>“The maps provide solid evidence of a community’s territory that is difficult to refute.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

There’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both, but we’ll be talking about that either later or tomorrow,” he said.</p><p>Ukraine and its European allies have long opposed any agreement that involves ceding occupied territory – including Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia – to Russia.</p><p>But Putin has repeatedly said that any deal must require Ukraine to relinquish some of the territories Russia has seized since 2014.</p><p>He has also called for a pause to Western aid for Ukraine and an end to Kyiv’s efforts to join the NATO military alliance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"questions-about-the-meeting-s-location\">Questions about the meeting’s location</h2><p>Still, the prospect of Trump meeting Putin has raised logistical questions in recent days, particularly since the Russian leader faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC).</p><p>Prosecutors have sought his arrest for alleged war crimes perpetrated in Ukraine, and Putin’s travel through any ICC member countries could result in his detention.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The US, however, is not an ICC member and does not recognise the court’s authority.</p><p>While the Kremlin had previously <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/donald-trump-and-vladimir-putin-to-meet-in-coming-days-kremlin-aide-says\">floated</a> the possibility of meeting in the United Arab Emirates, another non-member, Trump announced on Friday in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114995403653615328\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Truth Social post</a> that he would welcome Putin to the US northernmost state, Alaska.</p><p>The state’s mainland sits approximately 88 kilometres – or 55 miles – away from Russia across the Bering Strait, and some smaller islands are even closer.</p><p>Friday’s announcement came on the same day as a deadline that Trump had imposed on Russia to reach a ceasefire passed without any new agreement.</p><p>In recent weeks, Trump had grown increasingly frustrated with Russia over the country’s continued attacks on Ukraine and its apparent unwillingness to come to an accord.</p><p>The August 15 meeting is slated to be the first tete-a-tete between the two leaders since 2019, during Trump’s first term.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"great-progress\">‘Great progress’</h2><p>Trump had <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy\">broken</a> with decades of diplomatic precedent by seeming to embrace Putin during much of his time in the White House.</p><p>Earlier this year, for instance, Trump appeared to reject Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in favour of Putin. He also blamed Ukraine’s ambitions of joining NATO for provoking Russia’s full-scale invasion of its territory in February 2022.</p><p>“Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,” Trump yelled at one point during a confrontational meeting with Zelenskyy broadcast from the White House in February.</p><p>But Trump has positioned himself as a self-described “peacemaker”, and his inability to bring the Ukraine war to a close has become a source of resentment between him and Putin.</p><p>At the same time, he took an initially permissive approach to Putin, but has since expressed growing frustration with the Russian leader amid Russia’s continued attacks.</p><p>Last week, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/russias-actions-in-ukraine-disgusting-says-trump\">denounced</a> Russia’s renewed attacks on Kyiv. “I think it’s disgusting what they’re doing. I think it’s disgusting,” he said.</p><p>He also demanded that Russia pause its attacks or face new sanctions and secondary tariffs on key trading partners.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump appeared to begin to make good on that threat, <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/india-accuses-us-eu-of-russia-trade-double-standards-who-is-right\">raising tariffs</a> on Indian goods to 50 percent in response to its purchase of Russian oil.</p><p>Still, this week, Trump hailed “great progress” in the peace negotiations as his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited Putin in Moscow.</p><p>But as of Friday, the date of the new deadline, no new US actions or Russian capitulations had been announced.</p><p>Some analysts have argued that Putin is intentionally teasing out talks to extend the war.</p><p>It remains unclear if Trump’s mercurial approach has meaningfully changed the ceasefire equation since he took office.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Sex toys were also thrown at games in New York and Phoenix last Tuesday, but didn’t reach the court. Police say another toy was thrown at a game in Atlanta on August 1, although it is unclear if that one reached the court.</p><p>The distractions have created unexpected challenges for the league, the teams and the players, but also for arena security. Here’s what to know.</p><p>A man was arrested Saturday in College Park, Georgia, after he was accused of throwing a sex toy onto the court during the Atlanta Dream’s July 29 matchup with the Golden State Valkyries, according to a police report. The report said he threw another sex toy during the Dream’s August 1 game against the Phoenix Mercury, but that instance did not seem to result in a delay of play.</p><p>He is charged with disorderly conduct, criminal trespassing, public indecency and indecent exposure. All four charges are misdemeanours in the state of Georgia, meaning that if he is convicted, the punishment for each can be a fine of up to $1,000 or jail time of up to 12 months. A misdemeanour for public indecency and indecent exposure may also require registration on the state’s sex offender list.</p><p>The report said the man told police, “This was supposed to be a joke and the joke [was] supposed to go viral.”`</p><p>Another man in Phoenix was arrested after police say he threw a sex toy in the crowd at a Mercury game on Tuesday. Police say the 18-year-old pulled the sex toy from his sweater pocket and threw it towards seats in front of him, striking a spectator in the back.</p><p>The man later told police it was a prank that had been trending on social media and that he bought the toy a day earlier to take to the game. He was later tackled by a volunteer at the arena who had witnessed the incident and began following him as the man tried to leave the arena.</p><p>Police say the man was arrested on suspicion of assault, disorderly conduct and publicly displaying explicit sexual material.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The New York Liberty told The Associated Press on Thursday night that there is an ongoing investigation into the throwing in New York, and the team is cooperating with law enforcement.</p><p>The types of sex toys being thrown onto the court generally do not include metal elements, meaning that arena metal detectors are not able to sense them. When carried on a spectator’s body, they become even more difficult to detect.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>Arena security teams face challenges in catching these items, according to Ty Richmond, the president of the event services division at Allied Universal Security, a company that provides security services to certain NBA, WNBA, NFL, MLB and MLS arenas across the country.</p><p>“Not all stadiums are using a screening process that’s consistent and can detect (the sex toys) because of what it would require — pat down searches, opening the bags, prohibiting bags,” he said. “The conflict of expediency, of getting fans into the arena and into the venue, which is an important issue, and security and safety.”</p><p>The limits of arena security make legal action one of the strongest deterrents for this kind of behaviour, Richmond said.</p><p>“The decision to prosecute and show examples of how people are being handled is very important,” he said. “Without a doubt, I think it will make a difference. The application of it is important, and publicising that is important.”</p><p>There have not been any arrests made yet in Los Angeles and Chicago. In a statement to The AP, the Sparks said they are “working with arena personnel to identify the individual responsible and ensure appropriate action is taken”.</p><p>The WNBA has said that any spectators throwing objects onto the court will face a minimum one-year ban and prosecution from law enforcement.</p><p>As the disturbances pile up, those on the court have become increasingly frustrated.</p><p>“Everyone is trying to make sure the W is not a joke and it’s taken seriously, and then that happens,” Cunningham said on her podcast after nearly being hit by one of the sex toys on Tuesday. “I’m like, ‘How are we ever going to get taken seriously?’”</p><p>No other professional sports leagues have faced sex toy disturbances like this. It has started a conversation online about the perpetrators’ choices to throw them during games in a women’s league and a league with a high-profile amount of lesbian and queer players.</p><p>“This has been going on for centuries, the sexualization of women. This is the latest version of that. It’s not funny. It should not be the butt of jokes,” said Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve on Thursday. “The sexualisation of women is what’s used to hold women down, and this is no different.”</p><p>Despite the criminal behaviour leading to arrests, at least one crypto-based predictions market is offering trades essentially allowing users to wager on whether sex toys will be thrown at future WNBA games.</p><p>Players have also been sounding off on social media, echoing concerns about arena security protocols.</p><p>Liberty forward Isabelle Harrison posted on X last week, saying, “ARENA SECURITY?! Hello??! Please do better. It’s not funny. Never was funny. Throwing ANYTHING on the court is so dangerous.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They circled the moon 10 times before returning to Earth.</p><p>Lovell was the last surviving crew member from that flight.</p><p>He also was a key figure on the doomed 1970 Apollo 13 flight, which was meant to conduct the third lunar landing.</p><p>But the flight met disaster when its oxygen tank exploded in space, endangering all on board. It was unclear whether Lovell, the most experienced astronaut on the flight, and his two colleagues, John Swigert Jr and Fred Haise Jr, would return from the voyage alive.</p><p>As mission commander, however, Lovell helped steer their lunar module back to Earth in a death-defying splashdown. It was his last space flight, and he has been praised for his calm under pressure.</p><p>“Jim’s character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success,” Duffy said.</p><p>“From a pair of pioneering Gemini missions to the successes of Apollo, Jim helped our nation forge a historic path in space that carries us forward to upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and beyond.”</p><p></p><p>Known by the nickname Smilin’ Jim, Lovell was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 25, 1928.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>He began his aviation career in the 1950s as part of the US Navy, where he completed a four-year tour of duty as a test pilot in Maryland. During his naval service, he logged more than 7,000 hours of flying time.</p><p>Then, in 1962, he was selected by NASA to be an astronaut. His first space flight took place as part of the Gemini project, a series of flights designed to improve space travel in order to pave the way for the later Apollo moon missions.</p><p>At first, Lovell was a backup pilot for Gemini 4. But he got his break with the Gemini 7 mission in 1965, which was only the 12th crewed flight the US had sent to space by that point.</p><p>He was paired with Borman, his future Apollo 8 colleague, for that launch, and together, they made a rendezvous in space with Gemini 6 — a first-time feat for two crewed flights.</p><p>Lovell was also on the spacecraft for the final mission of the project, Gemini 12, which paired him with Buzz Aldrin, then a rookie.</p><p>With the Gemini missions complete, NASA turned its attention to putting a man on the moon.</p><p>Lovell and his colleagues on Apollo 8 helped make that possible, with NASA dubbing the circumnavigation “man’s maiden voyage to the moon”.</p><p>“We could actually see the Earth start to shrink,” Lovell would later tell the TV channel CSPAN. “It reminds me of being in a car, looking out the back window, going inside a tunnel and seeing the tunnel entrance shrink as you go farther into the tunnel.

Lovell’s former colleague Aldrin joined Neil Armstrong in being the first human beings to plant a foot on the moon.</p><p>Lovell was meant to land on the moon himself. He was 42 at the time of his flight with Apollo 13, which was likewise charged with completing a lunar landing.</p><p>But two days into the 10-day mission, the crew heard an explosion. “OK, Houston,” Lovell’s colleague Swigert radioed back to Earth, coining a famous phrase. “We’ve had a problem here.”</p><p>Lovell communicated that the spacecraft was “venting something out into” space. That turned out to be oxygen leaking out of an exploded tank. Another tank remained, but it was damaged, as were the fuel cells. That, in turn, risked leaving the astronauts without electricity.</p><p>The fate of the three astronauts on board the Apollo 13 mission, including Lovell, captured international attention.</p><p>The crew ultimately transformed their lunar module into a “lifeboat” and faced dangerous levels of carbon dioxide as they looped around the moon to boomerang back to Earth.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3879130\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3879130\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3879130\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP20099713391453-1754687029.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C542&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"red Haise, Jack Swigert and Jim Lovell pose at a wooden table for a photo.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3879130\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fred Haise, Jack Swigert and Jim Lovell gather for a photo on the day before launch of Apollo 13 on April 10, 1970 [NASA via AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Lovell ultimately co-wrote a book about his experience, Lost Moon, and the American actor Tom Hanks played him in a 1995 film adaptation, called Apollo 13.</p><p>Lovell himself made a cameo appearance opposite Hanks.</p><p>During his final days, Lovell met with Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, who <a href=\"https://x.com/SecVetAffairs/status/1950559288436400145\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> about the meeting on social media.</p><p>“Yesterday, I was honored to meet one of my personal heroes, Navy Veteran and astronaut Jim Lovell,” Collins said. “Jim’s remarkable leadership during the historic Apollo 13 mission is an inspiration to all!”</p><p>Upon learning of Lovell’s death, Collins <a href=\"https://x.com/SecVetAffairs/status/1953917147518054464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">joined</a> in the outpouring of condolences: “Astronaut and Navy Veteran Jim Lovell was a legend, plain and simple.”</p><p>Lovell is survived by his four children.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The majority included two Trump-appointed judges, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao. The sole dissent was Judge Cornelia Pillard, an appointee from former President Barack Obama.</p><p>In a decision for the majority, Rao ruled that the lower court had overstepped its authority in opening the door for Trump officials to be held in contempt.</p><p>“The district court’s order attempts to control the Executive Branch’s conduct of foreign affairs, an area in which a court’s power is at its lowest ebb,” Rao wrote.</p><p>But Pillard defended the lower court’s decision and questioned whether the appeals court was, in fact, eroding judicial authority in favour of increased executive power.</p><p>“The majority does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust,” she wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-administration-celebrates-decision\">Trump administration celebrates decision</h2><p>The appeals court’s decision was hailed as a major victory by the Trump administration, which has long railed against the judicial roadblocks to its agenda.</p><p>“@TheJusticeDept attorneys just secured a MAJOR victory defending President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport illegal alien terrorists,” Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1953844865185591730\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>“We will continue fighting and WINNING in court for President Trump’s agenda to keep America Safe!”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The court battle began in March, when US District Court Judge James Boasberg, based in the District of Columbia, heard arguments about Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan men accused of being gang members.</p><p>That law allows for swift deportations of foreign nationals — and has, prior to Trump, only been used in wartime.</p><p>Boasberg ruled to pause Trump’s use of the law and ordered the administration to halt any deportation flights, including those that may already be in the air.</p><p>But two deportation flights carrying about 250 people nevertheless landed in El Salvador after the ruling.</p><p>The Trump administration maintained it was unable to safely reroute the flights and expressed confusion about whether Boasberg’s verbal order was binding.</p><p>It also questioned whether Boasberg had the authority to intervene. Trump went so far as to call for Boasberg’s removal, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114183576937425149\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing</a> on Truth Social in March: “This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"weighing-penalties-for-contempt\">Weighing penalties for contempt</h2><p>In April, Boasberg determined that the Trump administration’s actions showed a “willful disregard” for his ruling. He concluded that “probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt”.</p><p>A contempt finding can result in <a href=\"/news/2025/4/18/trump-faces-contempt-risk-what-happens-if-president-violates-court-orders\">various sanctions</a>, including fines and prison time, although it remains unclear what penalties the Trump administration could have faced.</p><p>“The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily,” Boasberg continued. “Indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.”</p><p>Trump’s Department of Justice, for its part, maintained that Boasberg had tread on the president’s executive power in issuing the order.</p><p>Also in April, the US Supreme Court lifted Boasberg’s temporary restraining orders against using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.</p><p>But it nevertheless ruled that the targeted immigrants “are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal” before their deportations.</p><p>The Trump administration has faced persistent scrutiny over whether it was complying with that order, as well as other decisions from lower courts that interfered with its deportation campaign.</p><p>Critics have accused the president and his allies of simply ignoring rulings they disagreed with, raising questions of contempt in other cases, as well.</p><h2 id=\"inside-friday-s-appeals-court-ruling\">Inside Friday’s appeals court ruling</h2><p>But the two Trump-appointed judges on the appeals court, Katsas and Rao, upheld the Trump administration’s position that Boasberg’s rulings had gone too far.</p><p>“The district court’s order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses,” Katsas wrote.</p><p>He compared Boasberg’s order to recall the deportation flights to a district court’s order in July 1973 that sought to halt the US bombing of Cambodia. Within hours, however, the Supreme Court upheld a stay on that opinion, allowing the bombing to proceed.</p><p>“Any freestanding order to turn planes around mid-air would have been indefensible,” Katsas wrote, citing that 1973 case.</p><p>But Pillard — the Obama-appointed judge — offered a counterargument in her dissent, pointing out that the US is not currently at war.</p><p>She also noted that the Venezuelan men who were deported on the March flights had, by and large, not faced criminal charges. Yet, the US had chosen to deport them to El Salvador for imprisonment in a maximum-security facility with a history of human rights abuses.</p><p>“Whatever one might think about a Supreme Court Justice’s emergency order superintending an ongoing military operation, the authority of a federal district court to temporarily restrain government officials from transferring presumptively noncriminal detainees to a foreign prison without any pre-removal process is well recognized,” Pillard wrote.</p><p>The appeals court’s decision comes just days after the Department of Justice announced it had filed a formal complaint against Boasberg, accusing him of misconduct for public comments he made criticising the Trump administration’s approach to the judiciary.</p><p>Critics have called the complaint a blatant retaliation and evidence of an increasing <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/pam-bondi-who-is-trumps-attorney-general-handling-the-epstein-files\">politicalisation</a> of the Justice Department.</p></div></div></body></html>"
