investigators</a> said in a 495-page report into the disappearance that they did not know why the plane had vanished and refused to rule out the possibility that someone other than the pilots had diverted the jet from its scheduled route.</p><p>Satellite data showed the plane diverted from its flight path and headed south, to the far-southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have run out of fuel and crashed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Initially, an Australia-led search operation scoured 120,000sq km (46,300sq miles) of ocean over three years, but only some pieces of possible debris were found along the coastlines in East African and Indian Ocean countries, including Mozambique, Madagascar and Reunion Island.</p><p>The most recent search for MH370 wrapped up in early April due to bad weather after several weeks of fruitless underwater reconnaissance by the maritime exploration company Ocean Infinity.</p><p>Ocean Infinity, which also led an unsuccessful search in 2018, will restart its hunt for the missing airliner on December 30, Bernama reported.</p><p>Malaysia’s government agreed in March to a “no-find, no-fee” contract with the United Kingdom and United States-based Ocean Infinity to resume a seabed search operation at a new 15,000sq km (5,800sq miles) site in the Indian Ocean, The Associated Press news agency reported.</p><p>Ocean Infinity will be paid a $70m fee only if substantial amounts of plane wreckage are discovered.</p><p>Relatives of the passengers and crew have lobbied for years for the hunt to continue and have demanded compensation

Today, 1kg of opium costs $329 in Myanmar, the UNODC said.</p><p>The UNODC report also notes “emerging signs” of heroin flowing from Myanmar to international markets that were previously supplied by narcotics originating in Afghanistan, warning of <a href=\"/news/2025/5/29/methamphetamine-trafficking-surges-from-golden-triangle-region\">global demand increasing for opiates</a> originating in the Southeast Asia region due to “heroin supply shortages from Afghanistan”.

Rights groups, however, warn that it is often used to suppress dissent, consolidate power or sideline democratic processes.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-are-under-some-kind-of-military-rule-today\">Which countries are under some kind of military rule today?</h2><h3>Ukraine</h3><p>Ukraine has been under nationwide, self-described martial law since February 24, 2022 – the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country. But unlike how martial law is traditionally understood, Ukraine is governed by a civilian administration.</p><p>Ukraine’s situation is closer to what Vina Nadjibulla, vice president for research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, described as a “state of emergency, where governments activate special powers – such as curfews, bans on gatherings, or expanded policing – but within a constitutional framework that keeps civilian institutions, including parliament and the judiciary, formally in charge”.</p><p>Nevertheless, under the martial law decree, the Ukrainian government has granted extended powers to the armed forces, banned men of fighting age – typically those aged 18 to 60 – from leaving the country, and restricted political activity deemed harmful to the war effort.</p><p>Public gatherings also require approval, and media outlets must comply with rules intended to protect national security. These include prohibiting the publishing of reports on air defence systems, and banning footage of missile launches.</p><p data-start=\"158\" data-end=\"456\">The restrictions are broadly accepted by much of the population, but they have raised questions about political accountability and transparency in the country, especially as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government faces growing accusations of corruption.</p><p data-start=\"158\" data-end=\"456\">Ukraine’s martial law has also led to criticism for effectively eliminating political challenges to Zelenskyy, with some critics, including United States President Donald Trump, arguing that the country needs new elections.</p><p>Petro Poroshenko, a former president and leader of the largest opposition party, said earlier this year that while martial law was needed, Zelenskyy, according to him, was using the restrictions to strengthen his power.</p><p>“I want to stress that we should recognise the obvious – the government has started to abuse martial law, using it not only to defend the country, but to build an authoritarian regime,” Poroshenko said during parliamentary debates in April.</p><h3>Myanmar</h3><p>Myanmar’s army seized power in a February 2021 coup, overthrowing the elected government of Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The military government has since declared martial law in dozens of townships, especially in major cities like Yangon, Mandalay and conflict-hit ethnic regions, granting commanders sweeping powers to detain, try and execute civilians in military courts.</p><p data-start=\"3201\" data-end=\"3624\">The military’s campaign against anti-coup resistance has plunged parts of the country into full-scale civil war. Internet blackouts and mass arrests have been documented across martial law zones.</p><p data-start=\"3201\" data-end=\"3624\">“Military commanders have taken over local administration, civilian courts have been sidelined, and open criticism of the regime or its proposed elections can lead to harsh punishment,” Nadjibulla said, describing Myanmar as the “clearest example [of martial law] in the Asia Pacific”.</p><p>Rights groups, including Amnesty International, say that <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/01/myanmar-four-years-after-coup-world-must-demand-accountability-for-atrocity-crimes/\">more than 6,000 people have been killed</a> and tens of thousands detained since the coup. For many communities, daily life involves checkpoints, curfews and the constant threat of raids or air strikes.</p><p>The army has bombed schools, hospitals and religious buildings with total impunity, Amnesty said, in “widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population nationwide”.</p><p>In late July, the military announced that it was <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/myanmar-ends-state-of-emergency-before-planned-elections\">lifting the state of emergency</a> from some parts of the country, ahead of national elections scheduled for December 28.</p><p>But some 22,689 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, remain in detention as of December 2, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an independent organisation that keeps detailed tallies of arrests.</p><p>The United Nations has warned that the <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/11/1166472\">“military-controlled” elections</a> at the end of the year are unlikely to lead to any democratic transition, and might only “ingrain insecurity, fear and polarisation throughout the country”. Major political parties are barred from contesting the vote.</p><h3>Thailand</h3><p>Thailand is not under nationwide martial law, but specific areas along the country’s southern provinces, including Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, remain under longstanding emergency and security laws that grant the military expanded powers, similar to martial law.</p><p>These measures allow sudden searches, broad arrest powers and heavy military presence as the government continues to combat a longrunning armed rebellion.</p><p>Thailand has recently also declared martial law in the border districts of Chanthaburi, Trat, and Sa Kaeo provinces following clashes with Cambodia.</p><p>The declaration was made to safeguard “national sovereignty, territorial integrity and the lives and property of Thai citizens”, a statement by Apichart Sapprasert, commander of the Border Defence Command, said in July.</p><h3>Burkina Faso</h3><p>Burkina Faso has been under military rule since twin coups that the country underwent in 2022, first in January, then again in September.</p><p>Since then, while the government has not declared nationwide martial law, the country’s military leaders exercise full executive and legislative control, with restrictions on political parties, and curfews are frequently imposed during security operations.</p><p>The military claims its takeover was necessary to restore stability amid escalating attacks by various armed groups. But censorship, arrests of critics and limits on public assembly have tightened over the past year, according to rights groups.</p><p>The European Union and United Nations, among other bodies, have accused Burkina Faso of serious <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/03/un-committee-enforced-disappearances-publishes-findings-cambodia-burkina\">human rights violations</a> in its fight against armed groups, including the indiscriminate killings and forced disappearances of dozens of civilians, among them journalists and human rights defenders.</p><h3>Guinea</h3><p>Guinea’s military seized power in September 2021, suspending the constitution and dissolving parliament. Although martial law is not formally in place, the military government rules by decree.</p><p>Demonstrations have been repeatedly banned, and security forces have been accused of using lethal force against protesters demanding a return to civilian government.</p><p data-start=\"5326\" data-end=\"5446\">Opposition figures face travel bans and arrest threats, and the transition timeline has been repeatedly pushed back.</p><p>In September, voters in <a href=\"/where/guinea/\">Guinea</a> overwhelmingly backed a new constitution that could allow coup leader Mamady Doumbouya to run for president if he chooses to.</p><p>Critics called the results a power grab, but the military government said the referendum paves the way for a return to civilian government. The presidential election is currently expected to take place later this month.</p><p>A charter adopted after the coup barred members of the transitional government from seeking office.</p><p>The country’s two main opposition leaders, Cellou Dalein Diallo and deposed former President Alpha Conde, are among those who called for a boycott of the referendum.</p><p>Their political parties are currently suspended, and Human Rights Watch has accused the government of disappearing political opponents and arbitrarily suspending media outlets.</p><h3 id=\"guinea-bissau\">Guinea-Bissau</h3><p>Guinea-Bissau slipped under military control in late November 2025, after soldiers seized the election commission just as presidential results were due. According to the commission, ballot papers, tally sheets and even the data servers were destroyed, making it <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/guinea-bissaus-electoral-commission-says-coup-destroyed-election-results\">impossible to finalise</a> the count.</p><p data-start=\"436\" data-end=\"644\">The army then installed Major-General Horta Inta-A as a transitional leader under a new “High Military Command”, dissolving civilian authority, and imposing curfews and bans on protests and strikes.</p><p>Guinea-Bissau’s new military authorities are facing growing pressure from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to restore constitutional rule and allow the election process to resume.</p><h3>Madagascar</h3><p>Madagascar has lived under some form of military-backed governance since 2009, when Andry Rajoelina, then a former mayor supported by key army factions, seized power in a coup that set the tone for years of political instability in the country.</p><p>Although several elections have since been held, the military remains a central political actor, often intervening during periods of tension or protest.</p><p>That pattern resurfaced in October 2025, when weeks of youth-led demonstrations over corruption and economic frustration prompted the elite CAPSAT military unit to <a href=\"/news/2025/10/20/madagascars-new-prime-minister-named-after-military-coup\">defect</a> and take control of the capital.</p><p>As the government collapsed, the army forced out President Rajoelina and installed CAPSAT commander Michael Randrianirina as interim leader.</p><p>The military leadership suspended most national political institutions and the constitution, forming a Council of the Presidency for the Refoundation of the Republic of Madagascar.</p><p>Randrianirina’s military takeover has been condemned by the United Nations and by the African Union, which suspended Madagascar’s membership.</p><h2 id=\"are-other-countries-veering-towards-m-law\">Are other countries veering towards martial law?</h2><p>Though both are ruled by civilian administrations, the interim governments that came to power in Bangladesh (2024) and Nepal (2025) after their leaders were overthrown rely heavily on the military, Nadjibulla pointed out.</p><p>In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August 2024 after a mass uprising against her rule that intensified following a bloody crackdown on protesters. “Because the police and civilian security services were badly discredited during the unrest, the army has remained highly visible across the country since mid-2024,” Nadjibulla said. “The interim authorities are ruling mainly through executive decrees while preparing elections, with the military acting as a key guarantor of order and of the transition itself.” Bangladesh is poised for elections in February.</p><p>In Nepal, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had to leave office in September 2025 amid youth-led protests.</p><p>An interim administration “took office through procedures that stretched the constitution,” Nadjibulla said. “Human rights groups have reported extensive use of force by police and, in some instances, by army units. This is not martial law on paper, but it shows how quickly security institutions can become the decisive political players in periods of crisis.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly 41.7 million people relied on the programme as of fiscal year 2024, a number that represents nearly 12 percent of US residents.</p><p>The USDA’s order would require states to pass along information like Social Security numbers, birth dates and home addresses to federal authorities. Critics fear that such a data transfer could constitute an invasion of privacy.</p><p>Rollins, however, told the cabinet meeting that the information was needed to address alleged fraud and “protect the American taxpayer”.</p><p>“ We asked for all the states, for the first time, to turn over their data to the federal government to let the USDA partner with them to root out this fraud, to make sure that those who really need food stamps are getting them,” she said.</p><p>She indicated that resistance to her demand was a question of partisan politics.</p><p>“ Twenty-nine states said yes. Not surprisingly, the red states. And that’s where all of that data [about] fraud comes from,” Rollins continued. “But 21 states including California, New York and Minnesota — the blue states — continue to say no.”</p><p>As a result, those Democratic-leaning states would no longer be receiving federal support for their SNAP recipients, according to Rollins.</p><p>“So as of next week, we have begun and will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states until they comply,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"an-ongoing-legal-question\">An ongoing legal question</h2><p>It is unclear whether Rollins will be able to carry out her threat.</p><p>In September, a US district court in northern California <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/california-et-al-v-united-states-department-of-agriculture-temporary-restraining-order-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued</a> a temporary restraining order preventing the federal government from enforcing its data request. In October, another hearing was held on the issue, and a temporary injunction was again granted.</p><p>“Let’s be crystal clear: The President is trying to hijack a nutrition program to fuel his mass surveillance agenda,” California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/court-blocks-data-grab-attorney-general-bonta-secures-order-halting-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> after the October ruling.</p><p>“We won’t let that happen — not on our watch, and not in our communities.”</p><p>Tuesday’s announcement that the states involved in the lawsuit would see a suspension of federal SNAP funds was met with outrage by some top Democratic leaders.</p><p>“Genuine question: Why is the Trump Administration so hellbent on people going hungry?” New York Governor Kathy Hochul <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1995951130027983210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media, with a link to Rollins’s remarks.</p><p>The Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee also released a statement, denouncing the Trump administration’s plan.</p><p>“Yet again, Trump and Rollins are illegally threatening to withhold federal dollars. SNAP has one of the lowest fraud rates of any government program, but Trump continues to weaponize hunger,” the <a href=\"https://x.com/HouseAgDems/status/1995920067159040018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> said.</p><p>But Rollins struck back on social media, accusing the states of seeking to protect “their bribery schemes”, an allegation made without proof.</p><p>“NO DATA, NO MONEY — it’s that simple,” she wrote. “If a state won’t share data on criminal use of SNAP benefits, it won’t get a dollar of federal SNAP administrative funding.”</p><h2>Leveraging SNAP?</h2><p>Last year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report stating that 11.7 percent of SNAP benefits dispersed in fiscal year 2023 were “improper”. This amounted to about $10.5bn in incorrect payments.</p><p>But some of those “improper” disbursements were overpayments and underpayments to legitimate recipients, the report explained.</p><p>Tuesday’s threat was also not the first time the Trump administration has sought to suspend SNAP funds.</p><p>During this year’s government shutdown, which lasted a record 43 days, the USDA announced it would not pay SNAP benefits for the month of November.</p><p>Critics accused the Trump administration of leveraging food assistance to pressure Democratic lawmakers to pass a Republican-approved budget, and dozens of states sued.</p><p>Two federal courts sided with the states, ordering the federal government <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/31/us-courts-rule-trump-cannot-suspend-food-aid-during-government-shutdown\">to resume its funding</a>. The Trump administration <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/8/us-supreme-court-allows-trump-to-block-4bn-in-food-aid-to-families-in-need\">then appealed</a> to the Supreme Court, which <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/us-supreme-court-extends-order-allowing-trump-to-withhold-food-aid\">placed a hold</a> on the lower courts’ rulings.</p><p>The impasse ultimately ended when the government shutdown came to a close on November 12.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Both men agreed they would speak again soon.</p><p>“I stressed the urgency of strengthening cooperation with the US to combat international organised crime,” Lula said in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/LulaOficial/status/1995908479958270345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> following the call.</p><p>“President Trump stressed his full willingness to work with Brazil and that he will give full support to joint initiatives between the two countries to confront these criminal organisations.”</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, signalled that their conversation built upon a dialogue they had started in September, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York City.</p><p>“President Lula and I established a relationship at a meeting which took place at the United Nations, and I believe it set the stage for very good dialogue and agreement long into the future,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115652356733049190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his platform, Truth Social.</p><p>“I look forward to seeing and speaking with him soon. Much good will come out of this newly formed partnership!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"tensions-over-bolsonaro\">Tensions over Bolsonaro</h2><p>Brazil and the US have generally had strong ties, but that bond hit turmoil earlier this year after Trump returned to the White House for a second term as president.</p><p>Trump, a Republican, had fostered close relations with Brazil’s former right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who left office in 2023.</p><p>In February, however, Brazil’s attorney general filed charges against Bolsonaro for seeking to overturn the results of the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to Lula.</p><p>His case was heard by a five-member panel on Brazil’s Supreme Court.</p><p>Trump protested the trial, and in July, he threatened to hike tariffs on certain Brazilian exports to 50 percent if the case was not dropped. Those tariffs went into effect in August.</p><p>The US also imposed sanctions and visa restrictions on one of the members of Brazil’s Supreme Court, Alexandre de Moraes, who played a prominent role in the Bolsonaro investigation.</p><p>In response, Lula blasted Trump for interfering in Brazil’s court system and compared the tariffs to “blackmail”.</p><p>Bolsonaro has since been <a href=\"/news/2025/9/15/lula-defends-bolsonaro-verdict-tells-trump-brazils-democracy-not-on-table\">sentenced to 27 years in prison</a> and was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/brazils-supreme-court-panel-votes-to-keep-bolsonaro-in-police-custody\">taken into custody</a> last month.</p><h2 id=\"a-detente-in-relations\">A detente in relations?</h2><p>A turning point seemed to come in September, when Lula and Trump shared a brief encounter at the UNGA.</p><p>They exchanged a hug, and both men expressed surprise at the warmth of their meeting.</p><p>“I was walking in, and the leader of Brazil was walking out,” Trump said at the UN conference. “I saw him. He saw me. And we embraced.”</p><p>Trump added that they had “excellent chemistry” and promised to meet Lula again. “He seemed like a very nice man, actually,” Trump said. “He liked me. I liked him. And I only do business with people I like.”</p><p>Afterwards, the two leaders <a href=\"/news/2025/10/26/trump-meets-brazils-lula-at-asean-summit-touts-pretty-good-deals\">met again in Malaysia</a> for a conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p><p>And on November 20, Trump announced he would peel back the tariff hike on certain Brazilian agricultural products, including coffee, cocoa and beef.</p><p>On Tuesday, Lula praised the tariff rollback as “very positive” but <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/6/lula-asks-trump-to-lift-40-percent-tariff-from-brazilian-goods\">emphasised that there was more</a> to be done.</p><p>“I highlighted that there are still other tariffed products that need to be discussed between the two countries,” Lula said. “Brazil wants to move quickly in these negotiations.”</p><p>For his part, Trump signalled that he had discussed the “sanctions imposed on various Brazilian dignitaries” in his conversation with Lula.</p><p>The US is Brazil’s second largest trading partner, behind China, and in 2024, the two countries exchanged approximately $127.6bn in goods and services.</p><p>While Trump has criticised Brazil’s economic policies as disadvantaging the US, the South American country has a steep trade deficit with the US.</p><p>The US exports nearly $91.5bn to Brazil, compared with only $36.1bn in Brazilian exports to the US.</p><h2 id=\"collaboration-on-organised-crime\">Collaboration on organised crime</h2><p>Another pillar of Tuesday’s high-level discussion was the prospect of greater collaboration on organised crime.</p><p>Trump has made combating criminal networks in Latin America a major item on his foreign policy agenda. Since returning to office, he has moved to designate numerous Latin American cartels and gangs as “foreign terrorist organisations”.</p><p>He has also launched a series of air strikes against boats and other nautical vessels in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, along the South American shoreline.</p><p>While Trump has framed the bombing campaign as a necessary bulwark against drug trafficking, human rights experts have called the attacks extrajudicial killings, in violation of international law. At least 83 people have been killed in the strikes.</p><p>Lula himself has faced pressure to address crime in Brazil, ahead of his <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/brazils-president-lula-announces-he-will-seek-a-fourth-term-in-2026\">re-election bid in 2026</a>.</p><p>In November, for instance, he called on lawmakers in Brazil’s Congress to pursue stronger legislation to combat criminal networks. His proposals included more support for the federal police and Brazil’s intelligence community.</p><p>“We need firm and secure laws to fight organised crime,” Lula <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Lula/posts/precisamos-de-leis-firmes-e-seguras-para-combater-o-crime-organizado-o-projeto-a/1504719464348398/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in a November 19 post on social media.</p><p>Still, the Brazilian government has faced scrutiny for a <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/police-operation-in-rio-de-janeiro-favelas-leaves-dozens-dead\">bloody October 28 police raid</a> in Rio de Janeiro that left 122 people dead.</p><p>Lula called for an investigation into the incident, which was meant to combat a criminal organisation known as the Red Command.</p><p>After Tuesday’s conversation, however, Lula reiterated that he was committed to “suffocating” the criminal networks in his country, with help from the US.</p></div></div></body></html>"

According to the CNE, approximately 20 percent of the votes have yet to be tallied.</p><h2 id=\"infighting-on-the-council\">Infighting on the council</h2><p>But even before the first ballots were cast in Sunday’s election, controversies had gripped the council, resulting in accusations of malpractice from all three leading parties.</p><p>The CNE is led by a three-person panel. Each CNE councillor is selected by Honduras’s legislature to represent the three main political parties: the Liberal Party, the National Party and LIBRE, the party of outgoing President Xiomara Castro.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio represents the National Party. She has had a tumultuous relationship with her LIBRE counterpart, Ochoa.</p><p>In October, Ochoa filed a complaint with federal prosecutors, alleging that Lopez-Osorio had been caught in audio recordings conspiring with the Honduran military to influence the results.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio has denied the allegations. “These are fabricated recordings,” she told the Honduran newspaper La Prensa, calling Ochoa’s complaint “outrageous”.</p><p>Attorney General Johel Zelaya nevertheless opened an investigation into the audio recordings on October 29.</p><p>Ochoa, meanwhile, continued to raise doubts about the election proceedings as the November 30 vote drew near.</p><p>On November 9, for instance, he <a href=\"https://x.com/MarlonOchoaHN/status/1987670757795885119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media that a test of the voting system had “failed”, citing connectivity issues.</p><p>That result, he said, “constitutes further proof that the leaked audios are true and that there is a conspiracy against the electoral process, orchestrated from within the electoral body itself”.</p><p>The CNE has faced other high-profile conflicts as well. Also in October, the head of Honduras’s joint chiefs of staff, Roosevelt Hernandez, said the armed forces would seek to hold its own vote count.</p><p>But the president of the CNE, Liberal Party member Ana Paola Hall, rejected his demand, and legal experts have said there is no constitutional basis for the Honduran military to review the results.</p><h2 id=\"trouble-at-the-ballot-box\">Trouble at the ballot box</h2><p>Fears of irregularities and electoral interference have long loomed over Honduras’s presidential race.</p><p>In March, for example, advocates argued that long lines and delays in the distribution of election material impeded voters from participating in the election. Some polling stations stayed open late into the night as a result of the delays.</p><p>This week’s vote count also stuttered amid government website crashes. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Lopez-Osorio addressed some of the “technical failures” and “transmission issues” that have marred the proceedings.</p><p>She denied that the hiccups were part of any kind of conspiracy. “It is literally a technical failure in the disclosure platform,” she told CNN host Fernando del Rincon.</p><p>Lopez-Osorio explained that the CNE was “searching for explanations” and had been in contact with the company in charge of the technology, ASD SAS. The vote count, she added, would continue.</p><p>“We have very narrow margins, and we also have a large proportion of ballots to process in these remaining days,” she said.</p><p>A statement published on the CNE website echoed her comments. “The CNE has demanded that ASD SAS provide the fastest possible technical solution, so that all citizens have full and permanent access to the statistical data,” it read in part.</p><p>Still, those comments are unlikely to dampen efforts to contest the election results in the coming days.</p><p>Already, United States President Donald Trump — supporter of the right-wing Asfura — has amplified election fraud claims with posts on his online platform Truth Social.</p><p>“Looks like Honduras is trying to change the results of their Presidential Election. If they do, there will be hell to pay!” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115647697688351327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on Monday.</p><p>Moncada, the left-wing candidate, also appears poised to challenge the results. In a statement this week, she denounced Trump for his “imperial foreign interference” in the election process. She also called the initial election results proof that October’s audio leak was authentic.</p><p>“The elections are not lost,” she wrote. “The two-party system imposed its electoral plot on us, following the trap revealed by the 26 audio recordings.”</p><p>She added, “I declare that I will maintain my positions and that I will not surrender.”</p><p>For her part, Lopez-Osorio also called on the electorate to be vigilant, ending her post about her colleague Ochoa with the message: Stay “alert, Honduran people”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
