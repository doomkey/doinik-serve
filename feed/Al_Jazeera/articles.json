Despite unanimous support at the UN for <a href=\"/news/2024/5/23/ancient-humans-lived-in-east-timor-44000-years-ago-archaeologists-find\">Timorese self-determination</a>, Indonesian troops launched their invasion on December 7, 1975.</p><p>Ramos-Horta’s colleagues, including Prime Minister Nicolau Lobato and other Fretilin leaders, either went into hiding or were killed in the ensuing attack. Unable to return home, Ramos-Horta became East Timor’s voice in exile for the next 24 years.</p><p>During his exile, Ramos-Horta lobbied governments, human rights organisations, and the UN to condemn Indonesia’s occupation, which resulted in the deaths of an estimated 200,000 Timorese through conflict, famine, and repression.</p><p>Silenced by a military-imposed media blackout for much of the 1980s, it was only in the 1990s that reports of Indonesian atrocities – including the 1991 Santa Cruz massacre – began to filter out and East Timor’s struggle for independence gained international attention.</p><p>Ramos-Horta’s tireless advocacy earned him a Nobel Peace Prize, along with Bishop Carlos Belo, in 1996.</p><p>A UN-sponsored referendum delivered an overwhelming vote for independence in 1999, leading to a fully independent East Timor in 2002.

So, it was in the midst of all of this that Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste [the official Portuguese-language name for East Timor], on December 7, 1975. The day before, US President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger were in Jakarta, and they officially gave the green light to President Soeharto to invade – immorally – with the use of American weapons.</p><p>So, it was within this context that it was very challenging for us to mobilise sympathy, support and the media. The invasion merited only one small, short column in The New York Times.</p><p>In Australia, there was more coverage. But the coverage didn’t last long, because Indonesia did a very good job, with Australian complicity, in blocking any news out of East Timor. At that time, not a single journalist came – the first foreign journalist to come here was in 1987.</p><p>The absence of [proof of] death is the worst enemy of any struggle. There were terrible massacres on the day of the invasion, hundreds of people shot and dumped into the sea, including an Australian, Roger East [a journalist killed by Indonesian forces on the day of the invasion].</p><p>Many, many countless people shot on the spot. Many were alive and dragged to the port of Dili, shot and fell into the sea. Many more killed randomly around town.

This must be backed up with visuals.</p><p>But people were sympathetic and listened to me. I was persuasive enough for them to believe what might be going on.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AJ: Given your own personal experience in the struggle for independence in East Timor, does that influence the way that you advocate? Does that bring a more personal response to your diplomacy?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> My personal instinct as a person is not shaped by anyone, by any school, any religion. It is me, always, against injustice and abuse.</p><p>Then came our experience and the fight for independence. When we fought for independence and for freedom, I went around the world begging for support, begging for sympathy. Then, we became independent.</p><p>Well, how can I not show sympathy in a real way towards the Palestinians? Why would I not show sympathy in a real way towards the people of Myanmar? Just showing sympathy, because we cannot do much more.</p><p>What can we do? We are not even a mid-sized country. But speaking out – a voice – is very important.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AJ: What are your reflections on what has occurred in Gaza?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> It is one of the most abominable humanitarian catastrophes in modern times, in the 21st century, next to the killing fields in Cambodia during Pol Pot’s regime.</p><p>The amount of bombs dropped on Gaza is more than the combined amount of the bombs dropped on London and Dresden during World War II, and more than the bombs dropped on Cambodia by the Americans during the Vietnam War.</p><p>The suffering inflicted on civilians, women and children is just unbelievable.</p><p>How we, human beings in this 21st century, can descend so low and how Israel, a country that I always admired, first out of sympathy for what Jewish people went through, through their lives, through their history – always persecuted, always having to flee, and then culminating in the horrendous Holocaust. When you survive a Holocaust experience, like the Jews, I would think that you are a person that is the most sympathetic to anyone yearning for freedom, for peace, for dignity. Because you understand.</p><p>They [Israelis] are doing the opposite.</p><p>And you have to understand, also, the people who are on the other side. You know the Palestinians, who had 70 years of occupation and brutality, they are not going to show any sympathy to the Jews or Israelis. So, this whole situation has generated hatred and polarisation as never before.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4137018\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4137018\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4137018\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2011-02-17T120000Z_717082240_GM1E72H1KUI01_RTRMADP_3_PALESTINIANS-ISRAEL-1764315388.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C560&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (R) meets East Timor's President Jose Ramos Horta in the West Bank city of Ramallah February 17, 2011.

But they found billions of dollars for the last three years to pump into the war in Ukraine.</p><p>I don’t condemn that. It is white people supporting white people being attacked. But then they are silent on Israel as it bulldozes the whole of Palestine; carpet bombing, killing tens of thousands of civilians.</p><p>And yet, with incredible, nauseating hypocrisy, when they are asked to comment on this, they say Israel has the right to defend itself!</p><p>Defend itself against children, against women, against students, against academics, against universities, that they bulldoze completely. Defend themselves against doctors and nurses in hospitals that they bulldoze.</p><p>And in an incredible contortion, you have the secretary-general of NATO say Iran presents a threat to the whole world. I know the whole world, literally, and I don’t know of anyone in the whole world that I know that considers Iran a threat to them.</p><p>I feel nauseated with such dishonesty, such inhumanity. So, I’m thoroughly disappointed. And I was always an admirer of the West.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AJ: Reflecting on many decades in politics in East Timor, is there anything that stands out to you as a personal success or something that you feel most proud about?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> I feel proud that we have been able to keep the country at peace. We have zero political violence. We have zero ethnic-based or religious-based tensions or violence. We don’t have even organised crime. We have never had a bank robbery or armed robbery in someone’s home. We don’t have that. And we are ranked among having the freest media in the world and the freest democracy in the world.

There will be more free movement of capital. There’ll be more people attracted to visit Timor-Leste and more embassies opening.</p><p>These are the benefits of being associated with <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/10/26/asias-youngest-nation-east-timor-declared-aseans-11th-member\">an organisation like ASEAN</a>.

Are there any tensions over East Timor’s relationship with China?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> We don’t view China as an enemy of anyone, unlike some in America.</p><p>The US is not able to digest the fact that China today is a global superpower, that China today is a major global financial and economic power. That it is no longer the US that rules this unipolar world, that it has a competitor.</p><p>But the Chinese are very modest, and they say they are not competing to be number one with the US.</p><p>Any rational, intelligent person who is informed about China – even if a leader emerged in China that would view Australia and the US with hostility – would, in his right mind, think that you can overpower the US economically and militarily.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AJ: What is the projected benefit economically for East Timor from the Greater Sunrise Gas Field?</strong></p><p><strong>Ramos-Horta:</strong> The existing studies point to it taking seven years for the whole project to be completed and deliver gas and revenue to Timor-Leste.</p><p>But long before that, the day we sign the agreement, within the following few months, two years, a lot of investments already start to happen. Because we have to build all the infrastructure on the south coast that will run into the tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>The pipeline will take its time to reach Timor, but the pipeline will be served by all the infrastructure built on the south coast, plus housing. Hundreds, maybe thousands of houses for workers, for people and so on. Then improvement in the agriculture sector. Farmers in the community benefitting because they will sell produce to the company, to the workers and so on.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4137038\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4137038\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4137038\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Ramos-Horta-Article-6-1764315950.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Despite more than two decades of independence, Timor - Leste remains one of the poorest countries in the region (Ali MC/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4137038\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Despite more than two decades of independence, East Timor remains one of the poorest countries in the region [Ali MC/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

She predicts that if current conditions continue, the sector risks losing capital, investments and jobs.</p><p>“Having this great uncertainty – one day it’s on, the next it’s off, who knows tomorrow – and based on no specific criteria, but rather on the president’s mood, creates chaos and severely damages the country and the economy,” she said.</p><p>On December 4, Trump suggested the US might let the USMCA expire next year, or negotiate a new deal. This follows comments by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to US news outlet Politico that the administration is considering separate deals with Canada and Mexico.</p><h2 id=\"a-booming-aerospace-sector\">A booming aerospace sector</h2><p>The Mexican aerospace market is valued at $11.2bn, and is expected to more than double to $22.7bn by 2029, Sheinbaum said, citing data from the Mexican Aerospace Industry Federation (FEMIA). Home to global companies like Bombardier, Safran, Airbus, and Honeywell, Mexico has established itself as a key player in the global aerospace market and is now the world’s twelfth-largest exporter of aerospace components.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Marco Antonio Del Prete, secretary of sustainable development in Queretaro, attributes this success in part to heavy investment in education and training. In 2005, the Queretaro government promised Canada’s Bombardier that it would invest in education and set up the Aeronautical University, which now offers programmes ranging from technical diplomas to master’s degrees in aerospace manufacturing and engineering.</p><p>“Since Bombardier’s arrival, an educational and training system was created that allows us to develop talent in a very efficient way, let’s say, fast track,” Del Prete told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Bombardier has served as an anchor, propelling Queretaro’s rise as a high-skilled manufacturing hub for parts and components.</p><p>While the Bombardier plant in Queretaro originally focused on wiring harnesses, it has evolved to specialise in complex aerostructures, including the rear fuselage for the Global 7500, Bombardier’s ultra-long-range business jet, and key components for the Challenger 3500, the mid-sized business jet.</p><p>Marco Antonio Carrillo, a research professor at the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ), pointed out that the area’s wide educational offerings have cultivated a powerful workforce, which has gained significant attention from aeroplane makers, mainly from the US, Canada and France.</p><p>“This development [of Queretaro] has been, if you look at it in terms of time, truly explosive,” Carrillo said.</p><p>Mexico also aims to join France and the US as the third country capable of fully assembling an engine for Safran.</p><p>But the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Union, which represents more than 600,000 workers in Canada and the US, is worried that progress could lead to more advanced manufacturing and assembly work to eventually shift to Mexico, given the local investment in aeronautical universities and training.</p><p>“Right now they’re [Mexican workers] doing more entry-level type things, but our concern is that later on, larger pieces of the aerospace operation will go to Mexico,” Peter Greenberg, the IAM’s international affairs director, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"high-skilled-low-cost-workforce\">High-skilled, low-cost workforce</h2><p>Of the three countries in the USMCA agreement, Mexico’s biggest attraction has been its low-cost manufacturing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Edgar Buendia and Mario Duran Bustamante, economics professors at the Rosario Castellanos National University, cite Mexico’s low labour costs and geographical proximity to the US as the country’s key advantages. This is partly why the US has intensified pressure on the Mexican government, including during the initial USMCA negotiations in 2017, to raise wages to level the playing field and reduce unfair competition.</p><p>“Most US companies have incentives to move their production here in Mexico, given the [low] wages and the geographic location. So, to prevent that from happening, the United States is pressuring Mexico to raise labour standards, ensure freedom of association, and improve working conditions,” Buendia told Al Jazeera, things that will benefit Mexican workers even as employer-dominated labour groups worry that they may lose their advantage.</p><p>The IAM originally opposed the USMCA’s predecessor, NAFTA. Greenberg said that while they acknowledge USMCA will continue, US and Canadian workers “would probably be perfectly happy” if the agreement ended as the NAFTA deal had led to plants being shuttered and workers being laid off as jobs moved from the US and Canada to low-cost Mexico.</p><p>“There is a need for stronger incentives to keep work in the United States and Canada. We want to see the wages in Mexico go up so that it doesn’t become automatically a place where companies go to because they know they will have lower wages and workers who do not have any bargaining power or strong units,” Greenberg added.</p><p>Under Sheinbaum’s Morena party, Mexico has raised the minimum wage from 88 pesos ($4.82) in 2018 to 278.8 pesos ($15.30) in 2025, with the rate in municipalities bordering the US reaching 419.88 pesos ($23). On December 4, Sheinbaum announced a 13 percent rise in the minimum wage — and 5 percent for the border zone— set to begin in January 2026.</p><p>Despite these increases and the competitiveness of wages in the aerospace sector, researchers agree that a significant wage gap persists between Mexican workers and their US and Canadian counterparts.</p><p>“The wage gap is definitely abysmal,” said Javier Salinas, a scholar at the UAQ Labor Center, specialising in labour relations in the aerospace industry. “The [aerospace] industry average is between 402 [Mexican pesos] and 606, with the highest daily wage being 815. [But] 815, converted to US dollars, is less than $40 for a single workday.”</p><p>By contrast, Salinas estimates that a worker in the US earns an average of about 5,500 pesos, or $300, per day.</p><h2 id=\"protection-unions\">‘Protection unions’</h2><p>The USMCA required Mexico to end “protection unions”, a longstanding practice where companies sign agreements with corrupt union leaders — known as “sindicatos charros” — without the workers’ knowledge. This system has been used to prevent authentic union organising, as these sindicatos often serve the interests of the company and government authorities rather than the workers.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Salinas argues that despite the 2019 labour reform, it remains difficult for independent unions to emerge. Meanwhile, “protection unions” continue to keep wages low to maintain competitiveness.</p><p>“But imagine, a competitiveness based on precarious or impoverished working conditions. I don’t think that’s the way forward,” Salinas said.</p><p>Even with new labour courts and laws mandating collective bargaining, organising in Mexico remains dangerous. Workers attempting to create independent unions frequently face firing, threats, or being blacklisted by companies.</p><p>Humberto Huitron, a lawyer specialising in collective labour law and trade unionism, explains that Mexican workers, including in the aerospace sector, often lack effective representation. “There’s discrimination during hiring or recruitment. They don’t hire workers who are dismissed for union activism,” he said.</p><p>Beyond demanding that Mexico enforce its labour reform, the IAM is calling for the expansion and strengthening of the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), which allows the US to take action against factories if they fail to uphold freedom of association and collective bargaining rights.</p><p>While not in the aerospace sector, the US recently invoked the RRM against a wine producer in Queretaro. Previous such actions in the state had been limited to the automotive sector.</p><p>“No one knows exactly what is going on in all of the factories in Mexico,” Greenberg said.</p><p>According to FEMIA, there are 386 aerospace companies operating in 19 states. These include 370 specialised plants that generate 50,000 direct jobs and 190,000 indirect jobs.</p><p>Del Prete, however, assured Al Jazeera that, in Queretaro, unions are independent and “they have their own organisation.”</p><p>Salinas points out that in Queretaro, there has not been a strike in decades, adding, “Imagine the control of the workforce: 29, 30 years without a single strike in the private sector.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the lawsuit on Friday is the first formal effort to halt construction.</p><p>“The White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognised symbol of our powerful American ideals,” Carol Quillen, the president of the organisation, said in a statement.</p><p>“As the organisation charged with protecting places where our history happened, the National Trust was compelled to file this case,” she said.</p><p>The filing charges that the Trump administration has violated several laws in beginning construction of the ballroom, including failing to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission; failing to prepare an environmental assessment; and failing to obtain congressional approval for construction in a federal park.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It further states that the totality of the administration’s actions violates the property clause of the US Constitution, which “reserves to Congress the right to dispose of and make all rules regarding property belonging to the United States”.</p><p>The organisation had previously sent a letter to the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service, and the Commission of Fine Arts calling for a pause in construction.</p><p>The Trump administration has not immediately responded to Friday’s lawsuit but has maintained that planning and construction of the ballroom have been conducted in compliance with the law.</p><p>In October, Trump aide Steven Cheung, in a post on X, accused the organisation of being “run by a bunch of loser Democrats and liberal donors who are playing political games”.</p><h2 id=\"presidential-priority\">Presidential priority</h2><p>Trump, a real estate magnate known for a personal taste that tends toward the garish and gilded, has championed the construction of a new ballroom.</p><p>The president began demolishing a portion of the White House’s east wing in October. He said the ballroom will seat nearly 1,000 people, up from the 650 seats the administration had previously announced.</p><p>The price has ballooned from $200m to $300m, although the administration has maintained that the funding is coming from <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/who-are-the-private-donors-funding-trumps-white-house-ballroom\">private donors</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While Trump has sought to transform the powers of the executive office and reshape the wider US government, the construction would be the most lasting physical change in Washington, DC, since he took office.</p><p>Critics have said the ballroom would dwarf the White House’s current 55,000-square-foot (16,764-square-metre) footprint and disrupt the balance of the smaller east and west wings.</p><p>While presidents have made internal renovations and changes to the White House grounds, the building’s exterior has remained largely unchanged since its reconstruction in the early 1800s.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And once it’s finished, there will be an official announcement made by the United Nations,” said Vellucci.</p><p>Salih, who studied engineering in the United Kingdom to escape persecution under the rule of Saddam Hussein, served as Iraqi president from 2018 to 2022.</p><p>Originally from Iraq’s Kurdish region, Salih said during his campaign for the job that he believed deeply in the refugee agency’s mission “because I have lived it”.</p><p>“My vision is a UNHCR that places refugees at the centre, recognising that humanitarian aid is meant to be temporary,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The expected succession comes at the end of a devastating year, with UNHCR having slashed its 2026 budget by nearly a fifth to $8.5bn, with 5,000 job losses coming down the line, even as global displacement spikes amid conflicts in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine.</p><p>Key donors like the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/un-cuts-global-aid-plan-as-funding-plummets\">US</a> under President Donald Trump have cut contributions, and others have shifted funds to defence.</p><p>Salih aims to broaden funding sources, tap Islamic finance, and enlist private-sector partners through a proposed “Global CEO Humanitarian Council”.</p><p>He faces growing Western restrictions on asylum, amid anti-immigration sentiment, as well as frustration in poorer states sheltering refugees.</p><p>About a dozen candidates competed for the role, including politicians, an IKEA executive and a TV personality. More than half were European.</p><p>The last non-Western head of the agency was Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan of Iran, who served from 1966 to 1977.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
