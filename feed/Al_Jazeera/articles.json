His host was Sanho Tree, director of drug policy at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS).</p><p>“That’s something I can’t do in Colombia,” Tree remembered Petro telling him. “If your assassins know you’re going to pick up your kid at a certain time, that’s extremely dangerous.”</p><p>Such dangers were not new to Petro.</p><p>He began his career being hunted by soldiers as an armed rebel with the M-19, an underground student movement that sought a fairer, more democratic Colombia. After laying down his rifle, he became a whistleblowing senator, holding hearings on the shadowy alliance between politicians and paramilitary groups that reached the highest echelons of power – and earned him a price on his head from a paramilitary leader.</p><p>Throughout, he has pursued the same issues in a country torn apart by decades of armed conflict and where land has long been concentrated in the hands of the wealthy few.</p><p>“One thing we can say about Petro is that he’s been consistent,” said Alejandro Gaviria, Petro’s former education minister, who has been both a critic and ally of the president.</p><p>“If you watch an interview of his 20 years ago, he has exactly the same ideas. Then he was talking about peace, land reform; he was even ahead of his time talking about environmental issues.”</p><p>In 2022, Petro was elected the first left-wing president of the South American country and entered the presidential palace with promises to lead Colombia in a more <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/2/4/petro-vs-trump-the-diplomatic-standoff-that-could-shape-colombias-future\">equitable</a>, eco-friendly direction.</p><p>On the international stage, he has been a rare figure among Latin American leaders as an outspoken <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/2/4/petro-vs-trump-the-diplomatic-standoff-that-could-shape-colombias-future\">critic</a> of US President Donald Trump.

The former rebel responded by saying he would “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/colombias-petro-promises-to-defend-homeland-amid-trump-threats\">take up arms</a>” again to defend Colombia.

His novel has greatly influenced Petro [File: Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"bookish-rebel\">Bookish rebel</h2><p>Petro was born in 1960 to a middle-class family in the Caribbean coastal town of Cienaga de Oro, but spent much of his childhood in the rainy capital, Bogota, and his teenage years in the city of Zipaquira.​</p><p>From a young age, he questioned authority.</p><p>“He likes discussion, but not dogma,” his father, Gustavo Petro Sierra, once said in an interview where he recalled an incident when his son was three. He had tried to punish his son by slapping his hand, but missed and accidentally struck his face. Petro had looked his father in the eye and yelled, “Don’t hit me in the face, Dad!”</p><p>Petro’s father, a teacher, inspired his son’s love of reading, and Petro was particularly influenced by the celebrated novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, by the Colombian author <a href=\"/features/2014/4/18/author-gabriel-garcia-marquez-dies-at-87\">Gabriel Garcia Marquez</a>. His father gave him a copy as a birthday gift when he was a child, according to former Culture Minister Juan David Correa, who met Petro in 2021 as the editor of his memoir.</p><p>The magical realism epic immortalises Colombia’s civil wars and class struggles through the saga of the Buendia family through the 19th and early 20th centuries. After independence from Spain in 1810, Colombia experienced intermittent warfare between its two main political factions: the secular, reformist Liberals and the Conservatives, who wanted to maintain the Catholic, colonial status quo.</p><p>“That was a book that was definitive in our lives as Colombians,” explained Correa, noting Petro’s belief that Colombians must know their history.</p><p>“We have to know who these oligarchies or aristocracies are that ruled the country over the past 200 years of solitude [since independence], as [Petro] called it.”</p><p>In the colonial era, the Spanish oversaw a feudal-like system in which landless campesinos (rural workers) toiled for a pittance on behalf of wealthy landowners. In the Colombia that Petro grew up in, this system persisted. Even at the dawn of the new millennium, only 1 percent of landowners possessed half the arable land.</p><p>As a boy, Petro’s mother, Clara Nubia Urrego, would tell him stories about the turmoil in the country, including the assassination of Jorge Eliecer Gaitan. Gaitan, a presidential candidate for the Liberals, called for reforms, including land distribution, which landowners fiercely opposed. His murder in 1948 kicked off a decade of bloodshed, known as La Violencia, between Liberal armed rebels and the Conservative government.</p><p>A truce in 1958 led to a power-sharing arrangement between the Liberal and Conservative parties, known as the National Front. Things had seemingly calmed by the early 1960s, but in 1964, inspired by the Cuban Revolution, the remaining Liberal rebels roaming the countryside came together as the communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the smaller National Liberation Army (ELN).</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Front blocked any legitimate alternatives, going so far as to rig the election on April 19, 1970 against the populist ANAPO (National Popular Alliance), which attracted people fed up with the two-party system, including Petro’s mother, who had joined the party. Seeing his mother’s sadness at the election results became Petro’s political awakening. He was 10.</p><p>At his Catholic school in Zipaquira, Petro and three other friends formed a study group and pledged to dedicate their lives to a better Colombia. They read Alternativa, a left-wing magazine founded by Garcia Marquez, which ran interviews with Chilean and Argentinian rebels and criticised the US sway over Latin America. They became involved with local unions, bringing together workers, salt miners and teachers.</p><p>In his memoir, Petro recalls his “communist” beliefs did not make him popular with priests or his classmates whose parents hung portraits of Spain’s fascist dictator <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/11/20/franco-legacy-fifty-years\">General Francisco Franco</a> on their walls. But he credits his high school as the place where he learned about liberation theology, a strand of Catholicism that advocates uplifting the oppressed.</p><p>“Since then, love for the poor has remained by my side,” he wrote.</p><p>“I didn’t learn that from Marxism, but from liberation theology.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264489\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264489\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264489\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP9604170853-1769334165.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C550&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), enter a small town near Miranda, Colombia, Wednesday, April 17, 1996.

It outlined the goals of an underground student movement known as the 19th of April Movement or M-19, named after the 1970 election. Jaimes was impressed by Petro’s work with the unions and considered him a worthwhile prospect for the group.</p><p>Although often described as “urban guerrillas”, M-19 was distinct from the uniformed rebels of the FARC or the ELN. Whereas the FARC recruited from rural workers and wanted a Cuban-style Marxist revolution, M-19 mainly consisted of politicised students who sought social democracy, denied by the two-party system.</p><p>Unlike the FARC’s camouflaged commandos, who would raid army outposts before disappearing into the jungle, M-19 operated in the cities and preferred symbolic stunts such as stealing the sword of Simon Bolivar, Colombia’s 19th-century liberation hero, from a Bogota museum.</p><p>“Bolivar has not died,” read a note they left behind. “His sword continues his fight. It now falls into our hands, where it is pointed at the hearts of those who exploit Colombia.”</p><p>The M-19 hijacked milk trucks to redivert the goods to poorer neighbourhoods, and orchestrated kidnappings targeting Colombia’s wealthy elite.</p><p>Petro read the document from cover to cover.</p><p>“The movement connected me with the reality of the country, with my mother’s stories about Gaitan, Bolivar, and the ANAPO,” he wrote in his memoirs. “It was as if it had struck a chord that intensely stirred some fibres within me.”</p><p>Petro, along with two of his high school study group friends, joined the M-19.</p><p>Although he learned to use a gun, he did not take part in armed operations. He was instead tasked with disseminating propaganda. He took on the nom de guerre Aureliano, after a rebel leader in Marquez’s novel.</p><p>After graduation, Petro returned to Zipaquira and was elected an ombudsman, a public advocate, in 1981, to hear residents’ complaints about the local government.</p><p>In the early 1980s, Petro edited a newsletter – Letter to the People – where he called on readers to occupy a hillside on the outskirts and turn it into a housing project for poor people. Some 400 impoverished families answered the call and found 22-year-old Petro and a group of young activists measuring out 6-by-12 metre (19.7×39.4 feet) plots. There were no wells or sewage, and residents had to collect rainwater.</p><p>The squatters were eventually granted permission to stay by the mayor, and the community evolved into a neighbourhood named Bolivar 83.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264346\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264346\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264346\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1990-03-01T120000Z_92858073_GM1E81S04KW01_RTRMADP_3_CARLOS-PIZARRO-1769330481.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C716&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Columbia presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro, of the M-19 guerrilla movement, surrenders his gun in Bogota March 1990.

My youth was over.”</p><p>After telling the crowd he belonged to M-19, Petro stepped back to applause.</p><p>But not everyone was pleased.</p><p>Petro’s father, who had no idea about his son’s secret life, was shocked by the risks he had been taking.</p><p>The talks with the government soon fell apart, meaning M-19 members were once again targets for arrest. Petro was forced to go underground.</p><p>He lay low in Bolivar 83, sleeping in different beds each night, and wore a disguise, a yellow dress and a wig, pretending to be a woman.</p><p>Around this time, Petro had a psychedelic revelation under the guidance of a shaman on a sacred mountain. Drinking ayahuasca, a powerful Amazonian brew, he experienced intense visions. The first showed an Indigenous princess descending from above as he was enveloped by roots.</p><p>“What does this mean?” he asked the shaman.</p><p>“Well, you are like a spirit taking care of nature,” the spiritual healer replied.</p><p>Petro, who recounted this experience in the book Children of the Amazon (2023), said this was the moment he realised his responsibility towards the environment. His second vision was more troubling: he saw his own death during an ambush.</p><p>In October 1985, soldiers poured into Bolivar 83, scouring the neighbourhood for M-19 rebels and intimidating residents. A terrified boy revealed the secret tunnels where Petro was hiding.</p><p>Petro was arrested, tortured for four days in a military barracks, and imprisoned.

Initially, Colombia was mainly a transit point for cocaine smuggled from Peru or Bolivia, but it was not long before coca cultivation expanded within Colombia, soon becoming the most viable livelihood in rural areas.</p><p>Cocaine barons and other wealthy businessmen began bankrolling private armies and paramilitaries to protect their families and property from armed rebels.</p><p>Although both were engaged in criminal activities, the rebels sought to overthrow the ruling elite, but the narcos wanted to become part of it, pitting them on opposite sides of the conflict.</p><p>After his release from Bogota’s La Modelo prison in 1987 at age 26, the unease of Petro’s rebellion days stuck with him, and he even took to sleeping with an assault rifle under his bed.</p><p>The following year, he met Mary Luz Herran, an ardent M-19 member since she was 14. They would go on to marry and have two children, a daughter named Andrea and a son named Andres, before splitting.</p><p>Soon after they met, in 1990, the M-19 became the first significant rebel group to demobilise, transforming into the M-19 Democratic Alliance party.</p><p>But it was a dangerous time to be in Colombian politics.</p><p>In the 1980s and 90s, some 6,000 members of the left-wing Patriotic Union party were killed by narcos, paramilitaries and the security services.</p><p>M-19 were not spared, either. In 1990, their presidential candidate, Carlos Pizarro, was shot on board a passenger plane mid-flight.</p><p>While serving a term in Congress, Petro began receiving death threats from a paramilitary group called Colsingue, or Colombia Without Guerrillas, and for his and his family’s safety, he agreed to a diplomatic posting in Belgium in 1994. While there, he studied environmentalism and economics at the University of Louvain, and he became deeply interested in the work of Romanian economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, who warned that while the global economy relies on constant growth, the Earth cannot be exploited forever.</p><p>But Petro grew restless in Brussels. “I felt bored, nostalgic, and eager to return to the political arena,” he writes in his memoirs.</p><p>He returned to Colombia, where he was re-elected to Congress in 1998. Two years later, he met his third wife, then a 24-year-old law student named Veronica Alcocer. They soon married, and despite initial tension with Veronica’s father — whom Petro described as an “almost fascist” in an interview with a Colombian magazine — Petro and his father-in-law grew close through their shared love of reading and intellectualism. His funeral in 2012 was one of the few times Petro cried in public. They have two daughters, ​​Sofia and Antonella.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a bid to start peace talks in 1998, then-President Andres Pastrana conceded territory roughly the size of Switzerland to Colombia’s largest armed group, the FARC. It was meant to be neutral ground, but the rebels used it to recruit and train child soldiers, grow coca, hold captives and enforce their own brand of justice.</p><p>Enter Alvaro Uribe. A right-wing hardliner, Uribe won the 2002 presidential election by promising to quash the rebels with an iron fist.</p><p>With US support, Uribe’s beefed-up military inflicted devastating defeats on the FARC. Washington had an interest in stopping the flow of cocaine from the source to the US, and in the 2000s and 2010s, Colombia was the third-largest recipient of US military aid after Israel and Egypt.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264261\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264261\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264261\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2004-05-18T000000Z_1955448631_RP4DRIIFZOAB_RTRMADP_3_TRADE-USA-1769329496.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C563&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Colombia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4264261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Petro (C), then in Congress, talks with police during a protest in Cartagena on May 18, 2004, as Colombia hosts the launch of Andean free trade negotiations with the US [Eliana Aponte EA/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"defying-death-squads\">Defying death squads</h2><p>Overall, security improved, but the Uribe era revealed that the authorities had been colluding with paramilitaries for years. While presenting themselves as anti-communist vigilantes, the paramilitaries were responsible for the <a href=\"/news/2013/7/25/report-says-220000-died-in-colombia-conflict\">lion’s share</a> of civilian deaths, terrorising vast swaths of the country.</p><p>In one particularly brutal episode in 1997, a band of armed men descended on the village of El Aro in Antioquia. Villagers were brutally tortured and raped, and up to 17 people were killed. The paramilitaries burned the village down as they left, and witnesses reported seeing a helicopter circling above — a yellow aircraft belonging to the Antioquia governor’s office, which at the time was occupied by Uribe.</p><p>The ghosts of El Aro were reawakened in the parapolitica (para-politics) scandal of 2006 after journalists and prosecutors revealed that several lawmakers were in league with far-right paramilitary groups, allowing them to murder and intimidate opponents while enriching themselves through bribes and illegal land grabs.</p><p>What happened next became one of the defining periods of Petro’s career. He held public hearings and accused the perpetrators of the El Aro massacre of operating with Uribe’s blessing while he was governor, such as by <a href=\"https://colombiareports.com/ex-auc-commander-links-uribe-with-paramilitaries-in-convivir-formation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">helping</a> establish civilian “self-defence” groups as a front for the militias.</p><p>“Why the silence, Mr President?” Petro pressed him at a hearing. “Or does the government accept that violent narcoterrorists have a presence in its ranks?”</p><p>The then-president fired back, calling the senator a “terrorist in civilian clothes”. Uribe’s alleged paramilitary ties later landed him in a years-long court case from 2012, ending in his conviction for witness tampering last year, which was soon <a href=\"/news/2025/10/21/colombian-appeals-court-strikes-down-ex-president-uribes-conviction\">overturned</a> on appeal.</p><p>Having lost comrades like Pizarro to the bloody purges of the 1980s and 90s, Petro knew all too well what he was up against. The scandal established him as a fearless crusader, but won him few friends.</p><p>“He was the one to [expose the paramilitaries] at a time when it was incredibly dangerous,” said Gimena Sanchez-Garzoli, a human rights advocate at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA).</p><p>“The impunity was so rampant … he was speaking to a Congress where 30 percent of it was linked to these groups.”</p><p>Tree, who nominated Petro for the human rights award in DC, remembered how the senator was on edge during this period.</p><p>“When I would meet with him in the mid-2000s in Bogota, he couldn’t stand near a window, and every night he had to go home by a different route,” Tree recalled.</p><p>Petro’s paranoia about standing near windows was not unwarranted; Salvatore Mancuso, the strongman behind the El Aro massacre, later confirmed that Petro’s name had indeed been on his hit list.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264274\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264274\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264274\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP111030056597-1769329532.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Colombia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4264274\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Petro gestures to supporters as he celebrates winning Bogota’s mayoral race, October 30, 2011 [Fernando Vergara/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"mayor-of-bogota\">Mayor of Bogota</h2><p>In 2010, Petro launched his first presidential bid but found himself at odds with his own party, the Democratic Pole, which sidelined him in favour of another candidate. Petro ran anyway and came in third overall.</p><p>He founded a new party, Humane Colombia, and successfully ran for mayor of Bogota in 2011.</p><p>While the previous mayor and his brother profited from corruption, Petro implemented many progressive reforms. A ban on brandishing firearms in public saw murder rates plunge to a three-decade low. Petro’s administration addressed animal cruelty, stopping the practices of using horse-drawn carts for rubbish collection and bullfighting, and pioneered mobile clinics for homeless drug users, treating addiction as a matter of public health.</p><p>“We were the first organisation to propose these [drug] reform ideas,” said Julian Quintero, director of Social Technical Action (ATS), a Bogota-based NGO focused on harm reduction and drug policy reform.</p><p>“Petro participated with us, and he sort of embraced the proposals we made to him.”</p><p>But Quintero noted that Petro’s governing style was also uneven, characterised by a rapid turnover of staff – a preview of his presidential years.</p><p>“Petro did very well as a senator because he’s a very good analyst who trembles with accusations when he’s in the opposition,” Quintero said.</p><p>“But when he takes office, he doesn’t stand out for his bureaucratic and technical skills. He’s not a good administrator. He changes teams very quickly, not allowing for continuity in his projects.”</p><p>Moreover, he added, in Colombia, “the left isn’t used to governing”.</p><p>Quintero noted that deeply entrenched right-wing interests also made Petro’s job more difficult. A failed attempt to overhaul the capital’s waste management system in 2013 ignited a political battle that saw Petro ousted from office by the arch-conservative Attorney General Alejandro Ordonez. That decision drew mass protests, and Petro was reinstated a month later – a sign that his brand of politics was gaining momentum.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264290\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264290\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264290\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP22150063429516-1769329590.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Colombia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4264290\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Petro (C) and his running mate Francia Marquez, at his left, with the Historical Pact coalition, stand before supporters with Petro’s wife Veronica Alcocer, second from left, and their daughter Andrea on election night in Bogota on May 29, 2022 [Fernando Vergara/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"path-to-victory\">Path to victory</h2><p>In 2010, Petro had lost his presidential bid to Juan Manuel Santos, Uribe’s defence minister, who oversaw his campaign against the FARC in the 2000s. But it was Santos who – to Uribe’s dismay – brokered peace with the rebels in 2016.</p><p>When Uribe’s protege Ivan Duque took office in 2018, however, the government largely abandoned that agreement, and violence surged.</p><p>“[The Uribe faction] wanted a candidate, basically a puppet, who was to rip up the peace agreement and not let it advance,” WOLA’s Sanchez-Garzoli explained.</p><p>Armed groups, including rogue FARC commanders, drug cartels and paramilitaries, rushed to fill the <a href=\"/news/2022/2/4/colombia-indigenous-land-defender-killings-spur-calls-to-action\">power vacuum</a>, where they once held sway.</p><p>Then, in 2021, Duque’s attempt to raise taxes prompted mass protests that were met with police brutality and dozens of deaths. The unrest and growing public disillusionment with the status quo, now fully exposed by the collapsing peace process and the pandemic-ravaged economy, meant Colombia finally had an opening for its first progressive president; a break from the conservative elite such as Uribe and Duque, who came from, and represented the interests of, the wealthy landowning class.</p><p>A leftist coalition called the Historic Pact rallied behind Petro for the 2022 elections.</p><p>Eager to include Liberals as well, Petro reached out to economist and former government official Gaviria.</p><p>“It’s kind of funny because when you see him at a rally, he’s really energised, but in a one-on-one interaction, he is timid, he is quiet, he is difficult to engage in conversation,” Gaviria said, recalling Petro’s visit to his home as he tried to build a coalition.</p><p>“When he visited my apartment, I was trying to ask him questions, and he never said anything to me. He stayed silent for five minutes.”</p><p>The presidential hopeful eventually proposed that Gaviria, then the Liberals’ presidential candidate, ally with his progressive forces.</p><p>Ultimately, in the second round of the election, Gaviria threw his support behind Petro, who offered him a place in his new cabinet as education minister when he took office that August.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2022-09-20T152030Z_946304256_HP1EI9K16M41E_RTRMADP_3_UN-ASSEMBLY-1769329505.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Colombia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4264265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Petro addresses the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2022 [File: Brendan McDermid/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"international-stage\">International stage</h2><p>As president, Petro took his message to the world. At his first United Nations speech, he warned, “the jungle is burning” while global powers were fighting over drugs and resources. He highlighted what he saw as the hypocrisy of vilifying cocaine while protecting coal and oil.</p><p>“What is more poisonous for humanity, cocaine, coal or oil?” he asked. With Colombia’s cocaine industry having fuelled decades of civil war, Petro has called for cocaine legalisation, calling the so-called war on drugs a failure.</p><p>“Cocaine is illegal because it is made in Latin America, not because it is worse than whisky,” he told a broadcast government meeting in February 2025.</p><p>In confronting the climate crisis, he has halted fracking and new gas projects to shift Colombia towards clean energy. In an economy reliant on fuel exports, however, this decision has been met with fierce scrutiny.</p><p>Petro has also sought to address the country’s armed conflict.</p><p>Influenced by French philosopher Jacques Derrida, who believed true forgiveness meant forgiving the unforgivable, Petro presented Congress with a plan to bring all remaining cartels, armed rebels and paramilitaries to the table, including by suspending arrest warrants and empowering local leaders as mediators.</p><p>The plan was called “Total Peace”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264298\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264298\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264298\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP22171037539019-1769329613.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Colombia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4264298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Petro, left, and his running mate Francia Marquez, celebrate before supporters after winning a run-off presidential election in Bogota on June 19, 2022 [Fernando Vergara/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-dream\">‘A dream’</h2><p>Petro’s peace initiative was put to the test in Buenaventura, a key Colombian port on the Pacific Coast. The port had long been a strategic hub for cocaine smugglers loading cargo onto ships bound worldwide.</p><p>Then, in 2019, a deadly turf war exploded. Residents were terrified to leave their homes. In desperation, local archbishop Ruben Dario Jaramillo performed a mass exorcism of the city by spraying the streets with holy water from a convoy of vehicles.</p><p>But in October 2022, the leaders of two rival <a href=\"/news/2022/12/26/following-gang-truce-colombia-city-becomes-experiment-in-peace\">gangs</a> met and shook hands at a church service, thanks to a truce brokered by Jaramillo, building on the Total Peace initiative. The following six weeks saw only one killing, compared with the previous monthly death toll of 25.</p><p>The broader peace plan, however, has had flaws. Anticipating a deal, armed groups consolidated their positions to get the upper hand in negotiations while taking advantage of ceasefires to recruit and resupply.</p><p>As Quintero observed, the groups calling themselves “guerrillas” today are mostly criminal gangs using the label to legitimise their actions. “There are no guerrillas with the ideology to overthrow the state,” he said.</p><p>“[Instead], today there are gangs of very well-armed drug traffickers posing as guerrillas.”</p><p>The two most problematic ones are the Gulf Clan and the ELN. The <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/us-officially-labels-colombias-egc-group-a-terrorist-organization\">Gulf Clan</a> is a powerful narco-paramilitary crime syndicate demanding talks to negotiate their surrender while aggressively expanding its empire. The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/2/colombias-eln-rebels-face-us-drug-threats-amid-push-for-peace-talks\">ELN</a> continues to carry out attacks and kidnappings and is battling a renegade FARC faction in the dense jungles of <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/2/26/everyone-wants-to-go-back-home-inside-catatumbos-displacement-crisis\">Catatumbo</a>, a fertile coca-growing region near Venezuela, displacing tens of thousands of people and prompting Petro to declare a temporary state of emergency last January.</p><p>Gaviria said that while reining in heavily armed drug dealers hiding in mountains and jungles would be challenging for any government, Petro has not really had a plan.</p><p>“He thought political will was enough to achieve Total Peace, which is completely wrong,” Gaviria said.</p><p>He compared Petro’s approach with Santos’s.</p><p>“Santos had a strategy, a group negotiating with the FARC. He met with that group every week, having conversations with his experts around the world … he was very disciplined in the way he was conducting this difficult topic.</p><p>“Petro was just completely different. No strategy at all,” Gaviria added. “Big announcements and political will. [Petro] thought that was enough, and now we know that no, it was not enough, especially if you’re dealing with such a complex problem.</p><p>“Total Peace was not a strategy. Total Peace was an idea, a dream.”</p><p>The chaotic nature of Petro’s cabinet has also complicated matters. The turnover rate is high, averaging a new minister every 19 days. Gaviria resigned in early 2023, along with three other ministers, during a fallout over health reforms. And 13 ministers lost or left their jobs in just three months between late 2024 and early 2025.</p><p>“I think this is a direct result of his style of policymaking,” said Gaviria, describing it as “undisciplined”.</p><p>Petro tends to replace ministers with loyalists and former members of the M-19, while publicly squabbling with former staff and accusing them of disloyalty. Some connect Petro’s perilous past to this governing style.</p><p>“Petro has a paranoid style of government that almost defines him,” said Gaviria.</p><p>“He is always thinking that there is a conspiracy against him. And probably this idea is related to being a former guerrilla member and living [in hiding].”</p><p>Correa agreed, noting that Petro does not trust many people.</p><p>The replacements he selects, too, are not necessarily the best-qualified.</p><p>For example, Sanchez-Garzoli believes the ELN peace process collapsed because Petro appointed “an ideologue and less of a real negotiator”.</p><p>“They basically blew apart a process that could have demobilised thousands,” she explained.</p><p>For Gaviria, Petro is these days more interested in ideological battles on social media than in leading the country. “I think he knows that he has not been an effective president,” he said. “Governing a country can be difficult, boring … [and to be successful] you have to engage in difficult conversations. You have to change your mind.”</p><p>Petro, he believes, has struggled to accept that “tragic destiny”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4227547\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4227547\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4227547\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-10-25T000035Z_556576129_RC2OIHA7QCQD_RTRMADP_3_COLOMBIA-POLITICS-1767987671.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gustavo Petro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4227547\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Petro speaks during a protest against Trump’s comments, accusing him of drug trafficking, and a court ruling that overturned convictions against former President Alvaro Uribe in Bogota on October 24, 202 [Luisa Gonzalez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"legacy\">Legacy</h2><p>Petro’s advocacy on <a href=\"/news/2024/5/1/colombia-to-cut-diplomatic-ties-with-israel-over-gaza-war-petro-says\">Palestine</a> – and the severing of diplomatic ties with Israel over its genocidal war on Gaza – the climate crisis, drug reform and willingness to confront Trump have won him international praise. Trump, without any evidence, has accused Petro of running cocaine mills and called him a “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/petro-says-colombia-cooperating-with-us-despite-insults-threats\">sick man</a>” on several occasions.</p><p>Back home, Petro points to having reduced poverty and infant mortality rates, increased agricultural production, and provided greater access to education, but his criticised peace strategy has failed to deliver broad demobilisation, and stark inequality persists. His <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/2/4/petro-vs-trump-the-diplomatic-standoff-that-could-shape-colombias-future\">approval rating has dropped</a> from 56 <span>percent when he took office to almost 36 percent</span>.</p><p>Petro’s presidency has been overshadowed by scandals, including his eldest son Nicolas’s arrest for alleged money laundering linked to narco campaign funding. He calls such attacks targeting his inner circle “lawfare”, aimed at weakening him, something he experienced when he was briefly ousted as mayor of Bogota.</p><p>“The first thing they tried to destroy was my family,” he told Spanish daily El Pais last February. “They wanted to destroy the emotional ties because a man without emotional ties becomes hard, bad, and errs.”</p><p>He conceded that the presidency is a role that brings him “absolute unhappiness”.</p><p>As Petro faces the end of his presidency this year, his legacy may be that of a polarising figure, a revolutionary who tried to overthrow the system from within — yet was unable to solve Colombia’s toughest challenges.</p><p>Still, Petro’s supporters see his presidency as the start of a social transformation.</p><p>“Our country is a very conservative society; our values, our classism are very, very evident,” said Correa.</p><p>“I think that it will take two generations to reconstruct the society … And I think that this government represents only a beginning, a seed for the new generation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It would also ban those it deems as supporting “an armed struggle by an enemy state or a terrorist organisation against the State of Israel”.</p><p>The measures were roundly condemned, given that Israel has weaponised aid throughout the genocide and falsely accused the United Nations humanitarian agencies of working with Hamas fighters and sympathisers.</p><p>Israel has also accused MSF – without providing evidence – of employing people who fought with Palestinian groups.</p><p>MSF said it would “never knowingly” employ people engaging in military activity.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-msf-agree-to-israel-s-demands\">Why did MSF agree to Israel’s demands?</h2><p>MSF runs medical services in Gaza as well as the occupied West Bank, providing critical and emergency medical care, including surgical, trauma, and maternal care. It also helped run field hospitals in Gaza during two years of Israeli genocide.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday, MSF said following “unreasonable demands to hand over personal information about our staff”, it has informed Israeli authorities that, as an exceptional measure, “we are prepared to share a defined list of Palestinian and international staff names, subject to clear parameters with staff safety at its core”.</p><p>It said MSF’s Palestinian employees agreed with the decision after extensive discussions.</p><p>“We would share this information with the expectation that it will not negatively affect MSF staff or our medical humanitarian operations,” MSF said. “Since 1 January 2026, all arrivals of our international staff into Gaza have been denied and all our supplies have been blocked.”</p><h2 id=\"how-have-observers-reacted\">How have observers reacted?</h2><p>MSF’s decision was condemned by some doctors, activists and campaigners, saying it could endanger Palestinians.</p><p>A former MSF employee, who requested to remain anonymous, told Al Jazeera, “It is extremely concerning, from a duty of care perspective, from a data protection perspective, and from the perspective of the most foundational commitment to humanity, that MSF would make a decision like this.”</p><p>“Staff are extremely concerned for their wellbeing and futures. Other NGOs have been in uproar, since it further exposes their decision not to concede to Israel’s demands,” they said. “MSF faces profoundly difficult decisions – concede to the demands of a genocidal regime, or refuse and face complete expulsion and an abrupt end to all health activities in the coming weeks. But what is humanitarianism under genocide? There must be alternatives – alternatives that demand a much bolder and more disruptive approach to humanitarianism amid such brutal political decline.”</p><p>Ghassan Abu Sittah, a British surgeon who has volunteered in Gaza several times, said, “The moral bankruptcy lies in the implication that during a genocide, Palestinians are capable of making free consent. Their employees have as much choice as the Palestinians who knowingly went to their death at the feeding stations to feed their families.”</p><p>He added that the decision was “in clear contravention” of European Union data protection laws.</p><p>Hanna Kienzler, a professor of global health at King’s College London, said on X, “MSF, you have withdrawn your teams from war-affected settings before when you felt a mission’s integrity and/or safety were compromised.

Thirty-two Cuban soldiers, some of them providing protection to Maduro, were also killed.</p><p>Then last week, he made the “weapons laboratory” accusations and was quoted by El Universal as saying: “The president of the United States admitted that they had used weapons that had never been used on battlefields, weapons that no one in the world possessed. They used that technology against the Venezuelan people on January 3, 2026.”</p><p>He appeared to be referring to an interview Trump gave to the US news channel NewsNation in which he said a “sonic weapon” had been used.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-about-us-secret-weapons\">What has Trump said about US ‘secret weapons’?</h2><p>Days after Maduro’s abduction, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reposted comments that appeared to have been posted on X by a Venezuelan security guard. He wrote that the US had “launched something” during the operation that “was like a very intense sound wave”.</p><p>“Suddenly, I felt like my head was exploding from the inside,” the security guard wrote. “We all started bleeding from the nose. Some were vomiting blood. We fell to the ground, unable to move.”</p><p>Al Jazeera has not been able to verify this account.</p><p></p><p>In his NewsNation interview last week, Trump said the “sonic weapon” was used against Maduro’s <a href=\"https://www.latintimes.com/topics/cuban\">Cuban</a> bodyguards in what he described as a heavily fortified area.</p><p>“Nobody else has it. And we have weapons no one knows about,” Trump said. “And I say it’s probably best not to talk about them, but we have some incredible weapons. That was an incredible attack. Don’t forget that house was in the middle of a fortress and military base.”</p><p>Then, on Sunday, Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying the US had used a weapon designed to disable defensive equipment.</p><p>“The discombobulator,” he said. “I’m not allowed to talk about it.”</p><h2 id=\"what-sonic-or-other-disabling-weapons-has-the-us-been-known-to-use-in-the-past\">What ‘sonic’ or other disabling weapons has the US been known to use in the past?</h2><p>The best known “sonic” systems used by the US are directional acoustic hailing and warning devices, especially the long-range acoustic device (LRAD), Brussels-based military and political analyst Elijah Magnier told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“These are not traditional weapons. Instead, they are powerful, focused sound projectors used for things like stopping ships, securing bases, protecting convoys, managing checkpoints and sometimes crowd control,” he said.</p><p>The main purpose of these devices is to control behaviour by sending voice commands over long distances at a high volume. They can cause discomfort and are designed to force people to either comply with the commands or to leave an area.</p><p>“LRADs have been deployed on ships for piracy deterrence, in port security and by law enforcement agencies,” Magnier explained. “At high output settings, these devices can cause pain, vertigo, nausea or hearing damage, which makes their use sensitive and subject to scrutiny.”</p><p>LRADs are not designed to disable electronics or communication networks, however.</p><p>Another weapon used to disorient people is the active denial system (ADS), which is often wrongly called a “sonic” weapon but does not use sound.</p><p>“Instead, it uses millimetre-wave energy to create a strong heating feeling on the skin, making people move away,” Magnier said. “ADS was sent to Afghanistan in 2010 but was pulled back without being used in combat. Like LRAD, ADS is meant to affect people, not machines.”</p><h2 id=\"how-do-these-devices-work\">How do these devices work?</h2><p>The LRAD system can focus sound into a narrow wave. At a low setting, it enables voices to be heard clearly over long distances. At a higher setting, however, it can be physically debilitating.</p><p>“These effects are only physical and mental,” Magnier said. “Unlike electromagnetic tools, LRAD cannot turn off missiles, radars, computers or communication systems.</p><p>The rapid heating ADS causes to the outer layer of the skin triggers intense discomfort and compels people to move away. “It is a nonlethal area-denial tool intended for crowd control and perimeter defence,” Magnier said.</p><p>“Neither of these systems can realistically disable air defence systems, communication networks or military equipment,” he said. “If equipment stops working, it is much more likely due to electromagnetic, cyber or power denial methods.”</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-us-use-to-disable-systems-and-equipment\">What does the US use to disable systems and equipment?</h2><p>Magnier said the US military is known to use several types of “nonkinetic” and “pre-kinetic” tools. These include:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Electronic warfare (EW)</strong>, which can jam radar systems, block communications, trick GPS and fool sensors. “These actions help control the electromagnetic spectrum,” he said. “EW makes it harder for opponents to understand what’s happening and coordinate their defences before or during attacks.”</li>\n<li><strong>Cyber-physical operations</strong>, which involve sabotaging networks and industrial control systems. “The best known example is the Stuxnet campaign, which targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuge controllers and caused physical damage by changing their software” in 2009, Magnier said.</li>\n<li><strong>Counterelectronics, directed-energy weapons</strong>, which are mainly high-power microwave systems that are built to disable electronics by flooding their circuits with microwave pulses. “The main US project for this is CHAMP (Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project), which was created to disable electronics without physical force,” Magnier said.</li>\n<li><strong>Graphite or carbon-fibre munitions</strong> that can short-circuit electrical grids and cause widespread power failures without destroying all the equipment.</li>\n</ul><p>“These tools are a key part of the US military’s approach to gaining an ‘information advantage’ and controlling different areas of conflict,” Magnier said.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-these-systems-work-and-when-have-they-been-deployed\">How do these systems work, and when have they been deployed?</h2><p>Electronic warfare changes or blocks the electromagnetic environment. It can disorient radar systems by making them “see” noise or fake targets. It can also cause radios to stop working and disrupt GPS and sensor systems.</p><p>“The aim is to blind, confuse and throw off the enemy to create an opportunity for action,” Magnier said.</p><p>In the Stuxnet cybercampaign in 2009, a computer worm was installed on a computer at an Iranian nuclear facility to cause mechanical damage by taking over industrial control systems. “This operation is widely believed to have been carried out by US and Israeli intelligence against Iran’s nuclear programme,” Magnier said.</p><p>High-power microwave systems can also disable electronics by flooding their circuits with microwave energy, making them stop working without any visible damage to them. “Public tests in the early 2010s showed these systems could selectively disable electronic targets,” Magnier said.</p><p>Graphite or carbon-fibre munitions spread tiny conductive fibres that can short-circuit parts of electrical grids. “These weapons have been linked to major power outages in Iraq in 1991, Serbia in 1999 and Iraq again in 2003,” Magnier said.</p><p>“The basic strategy stays the same: first, take down power, communications, sensors and coordination, then start physical attacks.”</p><h2 id=\"has-the-us-tested-new-weapons-in-other-countries\">Has the US tested new weapons in other countries?</h2><p>“Yes, and this is not just something the United States does. Modern wars often become the first real-world test for new technologies once they are ready to be used,” Magnier said.</p><p>The 1991 Gulf War was the first time stealth aircraft, precision-guided bombs and electronic warfare were used on a large scale.</p><p>The cyberattack on Iran in 2009 was the first time a cyber-physical weapon was used at a strategic level.</p><p>The GBU-43/B MOAB, called “the mother of all bombs”, was first used in combat by the US in Afghanistan in 2017. It is a nonnuclear explosive used in precision strikes against fortified underground targets such as tunnels that delivers an enormous blast wave.</p><p>“It is important to know that testing usually does not mean secret device trials,” Magnier said. “Instead, it means using new tools in real situations and improving them based on what happens and the feedback received.”</p><p>All major countries test new systems in secret as well, especially in areas like electronic warfare, cyber-operations, space targeting, signals intelligence and special operations, he explained.</p><p>“The main difference is not how secret the tools are but how widely they are used, where they are based and how willing countries are to use them.”</p><p>Some examples, such as the Stuxnet attack, involve several countries working together.</p><p>“The US uses Israel for several testing grounds of different types of weapons and other warfare equipment of all kinds, mainly against the Palestinians, in Lebanon and Iran,” Magnier said.</p><p>The US has also accused other countries of using “sonic weapons” against its own personnel. In 2017, it <a href=\"/news/2017/8/12/us-urges-cuba-to-probe-health-attacks-on-diplomats\">demanded an investigation</a> into a suspected sonic attack that left several of its diplomats in need of medical treatment and forced them to leave Havana.</p><p>Then-US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US mission in the Cuban capital had been subjected to “health attacks” that left some staff with hearing loss.</p><p>Canada’s government also <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/canadian-diplomat-cuba-treated-hearing-loss-170810214423519.html\">said</a> at least one Canadian diplomat in Cuba had been treated for hearing loss.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-trump-mean-by-a-discombobulator\">What does Trump mean by a ‘discombobulator’?</h2><p>There is no verified definition of a specific “discombobulator”.</p><p>“These terms are not technical and seem to be used as political labels for existing tools,” Magnier said.</p><p>“The most reasonable view is that this term refers to a group of known nonkinetic tools, not a new device.”</p><p>These could be:</p><ul>\n<li>Cyber-disruption targeting command networks</li>\n<li>Targeted kinetic strikes against antennae, relays and sensor nodes and localised power denial</li>\n</ul><p>To observers on the ground, this would appear as systems suddenly “not working”, Magnier said. A sonic device, however, is highly unlikely to have been responsible for affecting equipment in this way, he added.</p><p>“Reports say Venezuela’s Russian-made air defence systems failed, which could mean they were not well integrated or ready. This can happen because of electronic warfare, node suppression, cyberattacks or weak operations without needing any science fiction explanation. We have seen this happening in Syria for Russian weapons prior to Israel’s attacks.”</p><p>A sonic weapon could have affected soldiers and guards. If people had physical symptoms during the raid in Caracas, that does not indicate a new “sonic weapon” was being used.</p><p>“These effects could come from blast pressure, flash-bang devices or other common disorientation tools,” Magnier said. “There is no public evidence for a new type of weapon.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US military plans to transfer up to 7,000 people to Iraq.</p><p>The move represented a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/us-envoy-says-sdfs-role-in-syria-has-largely-expired-after-isil\">seismic shift</a> in how the US handles its fight against ISIL in Syria. Washington had relied for a decade on the SDF, which it trained and armed, but after the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024, it is now partnering with the new Syrian government.</p><p>The Iraqi government has yet to issue any statement following the telephonic talk.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-re-watching-iran\">‘We’re watching Iran’</h2><p>Rubio’s call on Sunday also came as Iraq is expecting a return of Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister after more than 10 years. Al-Maliki first became prime minister in 2006 with the backing of the US. His ties with the US soured after he was accused of implementing sectarian policies that led to the rise of ISIL in Iraq.</p><p>Rubio said, “Iraq can fully realise its potential as a force for stability, prosperity and security in the Middle East” as a new government is expected to take power in Baghdad.</p><p>“The secretary emphasised that a government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq’s own interests first, keep Iraq out of regional conflicts or advance the mutually beneficial partnership between the United States and Iraq,” Rubio said, according to State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott.</p><p>The US <a href=\"/news/2018/3/18/the-us-legacy-in-iraq-violence-sectarianism-and-elections\">invaded</a> Iraq in 2003, causing the country to descend into political chaos and giving rise to al-Qaeda and later ISIL. US troops withdrew in 2009 although some US soldiers remained to train Iraqi security forces.</p><p>In 2011, the remaining US-led coalition forces withdrew from Iraq, declaring an end to the war, which killed at least 275,000 people and ravaged the country.</p><p>About 5,000 US soldiers were deployed again in the fight against ISIL in 2014. They have since been withdrawn, the Iraqi government said this month.</p><p>Washington fears the influence of pro-Iranian Shia armed groups, which operate under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF). The PMF played a major role in the fight against ISIL.</p><p>The US wants armed groups to be dismantled and integrated into state structures.</p><h2 id=\"respond-to-aggression\">‘Respond to aggression’</h2><p>Meanwhile, the US has been moving military assets into the Middle East. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said an “armada” of warships was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/us-military-moves-navy-air-force-assets-to-the-middle-east-what-to-know\">heading towards</a> the Gulf with Iran as its focal point.</p><p>During <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/iran-in-limbo-whats-next-for-country-under-internet-blackout\">mass protests</a> that rocked Iran starting in late December, Trump repeatedly <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/us-iran-tensions-trump-has-no-path-to-an-easy-win-despite-tehrans-woes\">threatened</a> to intervene militarily, prompting Tehran to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/iran-warns-of-severe-response-in-wake-of-trumps-new-strikes-threat\">pledge retaliation</a>. The US <a href=\"/news/2025/6/22/us-bombs-irans-nuclear-sites-what-we-know-so-far\">struck three</a> of Iran’s nuclear sites in June during Israel’s 12-day war with Tehran.</p><p>“We’re watching Iran. We have a big force going towards Iran,” Trump said.</p><p>Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said on Monday that Tehran “will respond to any aggression more powerfully than before with a response that will make the aggressor regret it”.</p><p>“We have faced and continue to face hybrid warfare. Following the aggression in June, over the past few months, we have been confronted with a new threat from the United States and the Zionist regime,” he said, referring to Israel.</p><p>“Countries in the region are aware that any insecurity in the region is not aimed solely at Iran.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Recent fighting between the Syrian military and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led group controlling most of northeastern Syria, ended with the government significantly expanding the territory under its control, particularly in Arab-majority areas. Long the SDF’s primary patron, Washington brokered a ceasefire but sided with Damascus in declaring that the time had come for the SDF to reintegrate into the new Syrian state. This stunning pivot has been long in the making, especially since the ouster of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.</p><p>US support for the SDF was always problematic and ultimately destined to end. During my time working on the Syria file at the State Department, I joined several officials in warning the Obama administration that backing the SDF was a strategic mistake that would prolong the conflict and deepen sectarian tensions.</p><p>It would have been wiser — though more difficult — to address the root causes that enabled the rise of ISIL (ISIS): al-Assad’s repression of his people and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s sectarian policies. Instead, Washington risked fracturing Syria and undermining its ties with Turkiye.</p><p>The SDF was dominated by hardline Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) elements that were actively fighting Turkiye, a critical NATO ally. The group was also deeply at odds with the rest of the Syrian opposition and with most Kurdish factions in Syria and Iraq. We argued that whether al-Assad or the opposition ultimately prevailed, the SDF would eventually be forced to reintegrate into a state structure led by the victor.</p><p>Nonetheless, the decision was made to enlist the SDF in the fight against ISIL, while largely sidelining al-Assad’s crimes against his own people. Fast forward to today, and an outcome favourable to Washington appears to be unfolding, despite its role in creating the problem in the first place.</p><p>First, the worst-case scenario — retaliation by a victorious opposition against Kurdish civilians — has not materialised. On the contrary, the Syrian government has gone to great lengths to reassure the Kurdish community that it will be protected, while establishing humanitarian corridors for those affected by the fighting.</p><p>On January 16, President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree</a> granting citizenship to Kurds and recognising Kurdish as a national language alongside Arabic. The timing was impeccable, undercutting the SDF’s primary claim to legitimacy as the sole protector of Kurdish rights and freedoms. Moreover, Syrian military and security forces largely avoided repeating earlier mistakes seen along the coast and in Suwayda, where violence against minority communities had occurred.</p><p>Second, the Syrian military demonstrated impressive operational proficiency in defeating a US-trained and equipped force that had long been viewed as the only cohesive partner capable of countering ISIL and other extremist threats.</p><p>Al-Sharaa’s victory will have a powerful demonstration effect, reinforcing Washington’s perception that it now has a willing and capable military partner in Damascus. This opens new strategic options for the US as it reassesses the scope and duration of its military presence in northeastern Syria.</p><p>Third, the government gained control over vital oil and gas fields in the northeast; this will significantly accelerate Syria’s economic recovery while reducing its dependence on US financial support. The administration of US President Donald Trump wants Syria to become economically viable as a partial return on its gamble on al-Sharaa and his government.</p><p>Accounting for more than 80 percent of Syria’s oil and gas production, these fields will likely attract foreign investment. While US energy firms may participate, thereby benefitting the US economy, the Syrian government is also seeking to diversify its investment partners through agreements with multiple countries.</p><p>Of course, these developments remain fluid, and much can change in the coming weeks and months. After its rapid gains, Damascus would be wise to pursue a negotiated settlement with the SDF as it retreats to predominantly Kurdish areas.</p><p>Continuing fighting would carry severe humanitarian and reputational costs. On January 18, al-Sharaa announced a US-mediated <a href=\"https://x.com/hmzhmo/status/2012917682207654165?s=61\">ceasefire</a> that included integrating SDF institutions into the central government structures. However, talks on the following day failed to resolve the thorny issue of how to incorporate SDF military units.</p><p>Both sides should focus on implementing the January 18 <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/syria-announces-ceasefire-agreement-with-kurd-led-sdf-after-heavy-fighting\">agreement</a> rather than drifting towards full-scale confrontation. Al-Sharaa clearly holds the upper hand, but he can further demonstrate statesmanship by signalling, both domestically and internationally, his commitment to a peaceful resolution.</p><p>For the SDF leadership, options are increasingly limited given recent battlefield losses and sustained US pressure to integrate. As difficult as it may be, the moment has arrived. The current pause in hostilities offers an opportunity to secure special administrative arrangements in Kurdish-majority cities and regions, such as allowing SDF fighters to continue serving locally even as they integrate into the national security apparatus.</p><p>These seismic shifts reflect al-Sharaa’s astute reading of US strategic interests and his ability to act accordingly. Washington has long favoured a unified, stable Syria that poses no threat to its neighbours. For decades, the US tolerated the Assad regime’s brutalities because it broadly maintained these conditions.</p><p>With Syria today clearly incapable of threatening regional stability, Trump’s central concern has been whether the country’s new leadership can reunify the nation while preserving order. Al-Sharaa’s recent manoeuvres suggest he may have taken a decisive step towards answering that question.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><strong><em>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</em></strong></p></div></div></body></html>"
