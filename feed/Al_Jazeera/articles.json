Trump has previously also warned of possible attacks “on land”.</p><p>Caracas has rejected US accusations of drug trafficking, condemning its actions as “<a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/is-us-president-donald-trump-preparing-to-strike-venezuela\">illegal</a>” under international law and a violation of Venezuela’s sovereignty.</p><p>The Venezuelan government claims Washington is using drugs as a pretext for regime change and to seize the country’s oil wealth.</p><p>Moreover, United Nations <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/un-experts-condemn-us-naval-blockade-of-venezuela-as-illegal-aggression\">human rights experts</a> have condemned the partial naval blockade, finding it an illegal armed aggression against Venezuela, while urging the US Congress to intervene.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-this-attack-lead-to-an-imminent-war-with-venezuela\">Will this attack lead to an imminent war with Venezuela?</h2><p>Caracas-based analyst Elias Ferrer, of Orinoco Research, said if the US has in fact struck Venezuelan territory, it has “certainly violated international law” unless the attack was pre-approved by the Maduro government, which could be possible in light of recent conversations between the Venezuelan president and Trump in the past month.</p><p>Depending on the answer to that question, Ferrer said the incident could either “escalate, or actually de-escalate” the situation.</p><p>“Trump needs a victory before he can de-escalate in Venezuela, and this could be it: destroying an alleged drug-related target,” he said, citing the US bombing of Iran in July as an example during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June.</p><p>Iran responded by carrying out a pre-warned strike on a US base in Qatar, following which a ceasefire was announced between Iran and Israel within the next 24 hours.</p><p>If it was not pre-approved with Caracas, however, Alan McPherson, professor of Latin American studies at Temple University, said it represents a “serious escalation” by Washington as it is the first on Venezuelan territory.</p><p>“This has all the markings of a war of choice – militarily unnecessary – against a sovereign nation,” McPherson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Politically, the [US] administration wants to overthrow President Maduro – plain and simple,” he added.</p><p>In addition, McPherson said, while the US “may also want to damage the drug business” coming from Venezuela, Trump has been clear that he mostly wants to “reverse the nationalisation of petroleum to the benefit of American corporations”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-the-us-campaign-really-about-oil\">Is the US campaign really about oil?</h2><p>Recent remarks by White House officials have raised questions about whether Venezuela’s large oil reserves are in fact the real source of tension with Caracas, rather than drug smuggling.</p><p>Venezuela has the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">world’s largest proven oil reserves</a>, and the US once partnered with the country to develop its oil fields. It was a founding member of OPEC in 1960 and became a major oil exporter, especially after PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela, SA) was created in 1976, and all foreign oil companies were brought under state control.</p><p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Venezuela supplied roughly 1.5 to 2 million barrels per day to the United States, making it one of the US’s largest foreign oil sources. However, exports began to decline sharply after Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998, as he reshaped the country’s oil sector, nationalising assets, restructuring PDVSA, and prioritising domestic and political objectives over traditional export markets.</p><p>The situation worsened under President Nicolas Maduro, Hugo Chavez’s successor, when the Trump administration imposed oil sanctions in 2017 and then tightened them in 2019. These measures restricted Venezuela’s ability to sell crude to the US and limited access to international financial markets, further reducing the country’s oil exports.</p><p>Today, Chevron is the only US oil company that continues to operate in Venezuela under a special licence granted by former US President Joe Biden, which allows it to operate despite oil sanctions.</p><p>Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Donald Trump, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">said earlier this month</a> that Venezuela’s oil belongs to Washington, calling the country’s nationalisation of its petroleum industry “theft” and arguing that “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela”.</p><p>While US and British firms did invest in early development of oil projects in Venezuela, international law clearly recognises Venezuela’s sovereignty over its own resources.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3925817\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3925817\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925817\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Venezuela-oil-fields-and-pipelines-1756997792.png?quality=80\" alt=\"oil\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3925817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"can-the-us-congress-intervene-to-prevent-trump-from-going-to-war\">Can the US Congress intervene to prevent Trump from going to war?</h2><p>Power over the military is divided in the United States. Congress is granted the power to declare war by the US Constitution, but the last time the US declared war was in World War II, in 1942. That means the longest wars the US has engaged in have been undeclared by Congress.</p><p>In addition to empowering the president to direct military actions during a declared war, the Constitution grants the president the authority to order the US military to respond to attacks and imminent threats. It is from these powers that the executive branch has been able to deploy military force against countries in the absence of a congressionally declared war.</p><p>The War Powers Resolution of 1974 was intended to limit the ability of the president to deploy the military in these non-war actions, imposing time limits on deployments without congressional authorisation, and imposing other requirements. However, enforcement has been spotty and broad executive interpretations of what does and does not require authorisation, as well as what is permitted by existing Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs) have left the president with a relatively free hand.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Members of Congress have tried repeatedly to prevent Trump from taking military action against Venezuela.</p><p>Earlier this month, a group of Democratic and Republican US Congress representatives forced a vote that would have blocked US military action against Venezuela without congressional approval.</p><p>But the resolution was narrowly defeated in the Republican-controlled Congress by a vote of 216-210.</p><p>Academic McPherson said Congress can certainly refuse to declare war or to give the president “any authorisation to use force”.</p><p>“It can even cut off funds for specific military purposes. But the executive would likely defy any such restrictions, and this Republican Congress is unlikely to do any of the above.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Iran has repeatedly said its nuclear activities are for civilian purposes only, and neither US intelligence nor the UN’s nuclear watchdog found any evidence of atomic weapons production before the June attacks by the US and Israel.</p><p>Iran has ruled out negotiating over its missile programme.</p><p>The leaders’ comments raise the spectre of renewed conflict just months after a devastating <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war in June</a> that killed more than 1,100 Iranians and left 28 in Israel dead.</p><p>Pezeshkian said the response of Iran to any aggression would be “severe and regret-inducing”.

While Trump claimed Iranian nuclear capabilities were “completely obliterated” by the strikes, experts disputed that, saying Tehran may have hidden stockpiles of enriched uranium and could resume production within months.</p><p>Despite the losses, Iranian officials insist the country is now better prepared for confrontation. In a recent interview, Pezeshkian said Iran’s military forces are “stronger in terms of equipment and manpower” than before the ceasefire.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The war failed to trigger the internal unrest it is suspected that Netanyahu had hoped for.

The property is 360km (225 miles) north of Moscow.</p><p>Lavrov told reporters that Ukraine had launched 91 drones towards the residence. He added that air defence systems shot down the drones and no one was injured.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Russian Ministry of Defence said 49 of the drones were shot down over the Bryansk region, one was shot down over the Smolensk region and 41 were shot down over the Novgorod region while en route.</p><p>“Such reckless actions will not go unanswered,” Lavrov said. “The targets for retaliatory strikes and the timing of their implementation by the Russian armed forces have been determined.”</p><p>Russian officials accused Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, of carrying out the strike to derail the prospects of a peace agreement.</p><p>In an apparent reference to Zelenskyy, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev wrote on X: “The stinking Kiev b**tard is trying to derail the settlement of the conflict. He wants war. Well, now at least he’ll have to stay in hiding for the rest of his worthless life.”</p><p>Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said the strike took place on Sunday “practically immediately after” talks were held in Florida between Trump and Zelenskyy on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>After that meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy had <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/trump-welcomes-zelenskyy-claims-russia-ukraine-truce-in-final-stages\">voiced optimism</a>, saying a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine was “close”.</p><p>Putin has not publicly commented on the attack yet.

Because there’s none. No such attack happened.”</p><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-reacted\">How has Trump reacted?</h2><p>Trump appeared to accept the Russian version of events on Monday when he told reporters: “It’s one thing to be offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it.”</p><p>But when reporters asked Trump if US intelligence agencies had evidence of the alleged attack, Trump said: “We’ll find out.”</p><p>Congressman Don Bacon, a member of Trump’s Republican Party, criticised the president for accepting the Russian account of events without assessing the facts.</p><p>“President Trump and his team should get the facts first before assuming blame. Putin is a well known boldface liar,” Bacon wrote in an X post.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-other-world-leaders-reacted\">How have other world leaders reacted?</h2><p>Like Trump, other leaders appeared to accept the Russian allegations.</p><p>In a statement released on Monday, the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote: “The United Arab Emirates has strongly condemned the attempt to target the residence of His Excellency Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, and denounced this deplorable attack and the threat it poses to security and stability.”</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote in an X post on Tuesday: “Deeply concerned by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation.”</p><p>Modi added that the ongoing diplomatic engagement being led by the US is the “most viable path” towards achieving peace. “We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them.”</p><p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the alleged attack.</p><p>“Pakistan condemns the reported targeting of the residence of His Excellency Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation. Such a heinous act constitutes a grave threat to peace, security, and stability, particularly at a time when efforts aimed at peace are underway,” Sharif wrote on X.</p><p>“Pakistan expresses its solidarity with the President of the Russian Federation, and with the government and people of Russia.”</p><h2 id=\"have-putin-s-residences-previously-been-attacked\">Have Putin’s residences previously been attacked?</h2><p>Russia has made previous claims of Ukrainian attacks on Putin’s residences, including on the Kremlin, Putin’s official residence and main workplace.</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/2023/5/3/what-we-know-alleged-drone-attack-kremlin\">May 2023</a>, Moscow alleged that Ukraine had deployed two drones to attack Putin’s residence in the Kremlin citadel but said its forces had disabled the drones. Kyiv denied any involvement.</p><p>On December 25, 2024, Russia alleged that it had intercepted and destroyed a Ukrainian drone also targeting the Kremlin. Kyiv again denied responsibility.</p><p>Conversely, Ukraine has alleged that Russia has attacked Kyiv and other government buildings in Ukraine.</p><p>In September, the Ukrainian military said a Russian drone attack damaged a government building in Kyiv that is home to Ukraine’s cabinet. Plumes of smoke were seen emerging from the building. Russia said it had targeted Ukrainian military infrastructure only.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-russia-now-threatened-to-do\">What has Russia now threatened to do?</h2><p>While Russia has not outright threatened to end the peace talks, Moscow said it would realign its position in the talks.</p><p>“The diplomatic consequence will be to toughen the negotiating position of the Russian Federation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.</p><p>Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned that Moscow’s response “would not be diplomatic”. Indeed, it has warned that it plans to hit back militarily but has given no details of how or when it might do this.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-this-derail-the-us-led-peace-talks\">Will this derail the US-led peace talks?</h2><p>Speaking to reporters after his <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/trump-welcomes-zelenskyy-claims-russia-ukraine-truce-in-final-stages\">“terrific” meeting</a> with Zelenskyy on Sunday at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump told reporters that Moscow and Kyiv were “closer than ever” to a peace deal.</p><p>But Trump has made this claim several times before. In April, Trump said Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” after Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow.</p><p>On December 15, Trump also said Russia and Ukraine were <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/trump-says-deal-to-end-ukraine-war-closer-than-ever-after-berlin-talks\">“closer than ever”</a> to a deal after talks in Berlin involving Zelenskyy and the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and NATO.</p><p>However, observers and analysts said the issue of territorial concessions remains a major sticking point. Trump’s<a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\"> 28-point peace plan</a> for Ukraine, which he unveiled in November, involved Ukraine ceding large amounts of land that Russia has occupied during nearly four years of war. Zelenskyy has stated on numerous occasions that this is a line Ukraine will not cross.</p><p>Most analysts are sceptical that any progress has been made on this point and said the latest accusations against Ukraine will probably have little effect. “I don’t think there is anything to derail at this point,” said Marina Miron, an analyst at King’s College London.</p><p>The peace process “is not going well due to disagreements on key issues between Ukraine and Russia”, she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Miron also pointed out that Russia said the attack took place between the nights of December 28 and December 29.</p><p>“The interesting thing about it is Ukraine is accusing Russia of mounting a false flag operation to undermine the peace process.”</p><p>“Why would it be, then, after Zelenskyy met Trump? It would have to be before, so from the night of December 27 to December 28, right before Zelenskyy met Trump,” she said.</p><p>Keir Giles, a Russian military expert at the London think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera this month: “Trump has repeatedly claimed that a peace deal is close without sustainable agreement.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Russia has occupied nearly 20 percent of eastern Ukraine and has been slowly gaining territory as Ukraine’s military has been <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/28/ukraine-is-running-out-of-men-money-and-time\">weakened by</a> desertions, casualties and dwindling military aid.

Who does it penalise?</h2><p>The bankers, the banks, and politicians aligned with them get off fairly easily under the current draft law, while the state will bear most of the burden for the financial collapse.</p><p>Under the current version of the draft law, banks are responsible for paying only 40 percent of withdrawals, despite their major roles in engineering the financial crisis.</p><p>But banks, bankers, and affiliated politicians are still waging media campaigns and lobbying parliament to attack the law and make it even more favourable for them.</p><p>Under the new draft law, banks are being asked to pay much more than they are currently paying – but still significantly less than critics say they should be paying.</p><p>There is a lack of clarity over the claims.</p><p>During the crisis, banks were still able to pay out dividends to shareholders and pay executives bonuses, while regular depositors were blocked from accessing their money for daily expenses like buying food or paying bills.</p><p>“Depositors should be last on the list to have to pay,” Debs said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-would-the-state-have-to-pay\">How much would the state have to pay?</h2><p>The state would have to make up the “gap” between what is owed by Lebanese banks to depositors and what the Lebanese financial system can pay out.</p><p>Estimates currently say there is a gap of $70bn.</p><h2 id=\"who-do-the-bankers-say-should-pay-all-this\">Who do the bankers say should pay all this?</h2><p>They say the state should pay. Many bankers and banks say that they entrusted their money to the Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL) and that BDL gave the money to the state, which lost it. Therefore, the state should pay.</p><p>But critics argue that many of the banks gave depositors’ money to BDL without asking the depositors.</p><p>“They put it there because banks made so much money and benefitted from it a lot,” Debs said. “They put all their eggs in the same basket … and the banks knew this very well.”</p><h2 id=\"how-would-the-state-pay\">How would the state pay?</h2><p>With public funds, essentially. After the cash is given to depositors, everything else will be paid back in bonds backed by the state and its assets, including Lebanon’s gold reserves.</p><p>Critics say this is problematic because many of Lebanon’s current bonds were sold to vulture funds abroad. So state assets could essentially be used to pay back vulture funds or to pay back big depositors at the expense of the entire Lebanese population.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-imf-saying\">What is the IMF saying?</h2><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is usually calling for austerity, but for once, civil society and the IMF are on the same page.</p><p>“The IMF is saying… ‘how can you make depositors pay before bankers?’” Debs said, adding that the IMF’s position shows “how greedy and vicious the ruling elites are here”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

His detention was marked by prolonged hunger strikes, denial of basic rights and treatment that human rights organisations described as cruel and degrading. He was <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/egyptian-british-activist-alaa-abd-el-fattah-freed-after-sisi-pardon\">released</a> on September 23 after a years-long campaign by his mother, sister and close friends. A travel ban on him was lifted only this month, and he was able to join his family in the UK on December 26.</p><p>Alaa left behind a decade of repression in Cairo only to be welcomed in London with public attacks and a call for the revocation of his British citizenship and his deportation. Public hostility was whipped up by the uncovering of a social media post from 2010 in which Alaa said he considered “killing any colonialists … heroic”, including Zionists.</p><p>The tweet has been widely condemned, referred to the counter-terrorism police for review, and seized upon by politicians calling for punitive measures.</p><p>The speed and intensity of this reaction stand in stark contrast to the silence surrounding far more consequential statements and actions that the UK not only tolerates but actively enables.</p><p>This is what selective outrage looks like.</p><p>While Alaa’s words are dissected and framed as a moral emergency, the UK continues to host and collaborate with senior Israeli officials who have been accused of participating in and inciting genocide.</p><p>In July, for example, Israel’s air force chief Tomer Bar – the man who has overseen the carpet bombing of Gaza, destruction of hospitals, schools and homes and the extermination of entire families – was granted special legal immunity to visit the UK. Reporting by Declassified UK <a href=\"https://www.declassifieduk.org/israeli-air-force-chief-given-special-immunity-to-visit-britain/\">showed</a> that this immunity shielded him from arrest for war crimes while on British soil.</p><p>There has been no comparable outcry over this.</p><p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog was also able to pay a visit to the UK in September and hold high-level meetings. This is the same man who, at the start of the genocide, suggested that the “entire [Palestinian] nation” is responsible and that “This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved – it’s not true.” This and other statements by Herzog <a href=\"/opinions/2024/1/14/intent-in-the-genocide-case-against-israel-is-not-hard-to-prove\">have been collected</a> in a large database that currently supports the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).</p><p>Yet, despite being accused of incitement to genocide, the Israeli president entered the UK without a problem and was welcomed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Those quarters concerned about Alaa’s tweet displayed no outrage over the visit of a potential war criminal.</p><p>They have also been silent about British citizens who have travelled to serve in the Israeli military, including during Israel’s offensives in Gaza and the ongoing genocide. These operations, documented by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths, the destruction of hospitals and universities, and the devastation of entire neighbourhoods.</p><p>Despite extensive documentation of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the ICJ’s warning of a serious risk of genocide, there has been no systematic investigation into whether British nationals may have been involved in violations of international law.</p><p>Again, there is little sustained outrage.</p><p>At the same time, the UK continues to license arms exports to Israel and to engage in political, military and intelligence cooperation. These policies have persisted even as international bodies have warned of grave humanitarian consequences and potential violations of international law. All of this unfolds with relatively little political cost.</p><p>And yet it is a decade-old tweet – not mass killing, not siege, not the destruction of civilian life on a vast scale, not incitement to genocide – that triggers political panic in the UK.</p><p>This contrast is not incidental. It reveals a hierarchy of outrage in which dissenting voices are policed and punished, and state violence is not, and in which public hostility is directed downward at individuals rather than upward at power. Alaa’s case shows how moral language is deployed selectively – not to restrain impunity, but to manage discomfort.</p><p>This asymmetry corrodes the credibility of the principles the UK claims to uphold. When human rights are defended selectively, they become tools of convenience rather than universal norms. When outrage is loud but inconsistent, it becomes performative. And when accountability is withheld from powerful allies, impunity hardens into policy.</p><p>Those who defend this approach often invoke “quiet diplomacy”, arguing that restraint is more effective than confrontation. Yet there is little evidence that silence has delivered accountability – either for Alaa or for civilians subjected to mass violence in Gaza. In both cases, discretion has functioned less as a strategy than as permission.</p><p>The UK has the tools to act differently: Suspending arms exports, investigating potential crimes by its nationals, conditioning cooperation on respect for international law, restricting visits by officials implicated in serious abuses. That these tools remain largely unused is itself revealing.</p><p>Until that changes, outrage will remain selective, accountability conditional, and impunity intact – widening the gap between the values the UK professes and the violence it continues to enable.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In previous drills, they tried to avoid that, but this time they actually disrupted the air and maritime traffic,” he said.</p><p>The drills also put pressure on Taiwan’s maritime and transport links to Kinmen and Matsu islands, which are closer to the Chinese mainland.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"why-did-china-stage-the-exercises-now\">Why did China stage the exercises now?</h2><p>China has a history of holding military exercises to express its anger with Taiwan and its allies, but large-scale exercises have become more frequent since Pelosi’s Taiwan visit.</p><p>Beijing claims Taiwan as a province and has accused the US of interfering in its internal affairs by continuing to sell weapons to Taipei and supporting its “separatist” government led by President William Lai Ching-te.</p><p>Washington does not officially recognise Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China, but it has pledged to help Taipei defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances.</p><p>The Justice Mission 2025 came just days after Washington approved a record-breaking $11.1bn arms sale to Taiwan.</p><p>China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that the drills were a “punitive and deterrent action against separatist forces who seek ‘Taiwan independence’ through military build-up, and a necessary move to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

He wrote poetry when he was a teenager, studied literature at university in Kharkiv, and joined the local Zolochiv newspaper at age 20. At 31, he stepped away to work for the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, where he investigated corruption in the district. Ten years later, he returned to the weekly.</p><p>“I can’t imagine doing anything other than journalism,” he says.</p><p>Vassyl is proud that his newspaper was among the first to be de-nationalised in 2017. He helped draft the legislation that allowed Ukrainian local newspapers to be privatised, a step he saw as essential to reducing state pressure and safeguarding editorial independence.</p><p>Throughout the war, he has continued to investigate local political corruption, though he acknowledges that much of his focus has shifted to the war.</p><p>“Russia feeds on our internal divisions. Even if holding our own authorities to account remains part of the job, currently, my priority is to counter the enemy’s lies,” he says.</p><p>The fight against Russian disinformation has put his life at risk more than once.</p><p>On April 5, 2022, at 9:30am, two Russian shells hit the weekly's newsroom, partially destroying the 140-year-old building that housed it. Vassyl would normally have been sitting at his desk at the time, but he was spared because he stayed in bed longer than usual that day.</p><p>“I was running late to work ... The night before, we partied with one of my friends and drank a lot of terrible vodka,” he says with a dark laugh. “It is a time of war. The quality of the alcohol is very bad, but this is all we had.</p><p>“That’s what saved me. I usually wake up early, but I was hungover.”</p><p>When he finally got moving and was walking with a friend, two shells passed overhead.</p><p>\"Half a second later, everything exploded.”</p><p>Luckily, nobody was in the newsroom at the time. Vassyl’s old desk is still covered in debris more than three years later, and he knows he had a lucky escape.</p><p>“Given the shrapnel marks in the room, I would have been dead,” he says.</p><p>His newsroom has been targeted 10 times — twice with artillery, eight times with guided aerial bombs — with the latest strike hitting in spring 2025.</p><p>At the beginning of the war, Kremlin news outlets claimed that Vassyl was responsible for spreading disinformation.</p><p>“Apparently, I run a propaganda outlet,” Vassyl says ironically. “In 2022, Russian state television aired a report accusing me of illegally entering one of their villages to spread false information.</p><p>“I have never been there. What I have done, since the start of the war, is document missile remnants embedded in the ground to show where they came from.”</p><p>Tracing the origins of missile remnants could expose Russian attacks as war crimes or violations of international law.</p><p>“This work is the reason why my newsroom has been targeted,” Vassyl says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4154154\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4154154\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4154154\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/273A6607-1765002367.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine newspaper\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4154154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kostyantyn Neoneta, the newspaper's accountant, delivers the weekly edition in Zolochiv, far from first-person view (FPV) drones near the Russian border [Louis Lemaire/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Following the 2022 invasion and the bombing of its printing press in Kharkiv, the newspaper ceased publication for nearly half a year. Russian forces were closing in, prompting many from Zolochiv to flee to safer areas, at least temporarily. But Vassyl chose to remain.</p><p>“I had to stay and bear witness, but I couldn't do it if my loved ones were also in danger,” he says, explaining how he sent his family to western Ukraine and then began documenting the destruction engulfing his hometown.</p><p>At the time, enemy forces were less than 10km (6.2 miles) away. With his phone, he filmed bombings, civilian evacuations and shattered buildings.</p><p>“If I didn’t film what I was seeing with my own eyes, who would have done it? We live in very remote areas. I had to show the world what was happening to us.”</p><p>Vassyl taught himself how to edit videos, which he posted on YouTube and social media to reach more people.</p><p>“The Russians were claiming they were striking command posts or tank repair facilities,” he says, still outraged. “In reality, they were hitting residential buildings, the hospital and a kindergarten.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4154149\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4154149\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4154149\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/273A6557-1765002348.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine newspaper\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4154149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kostyantyn delivers the newspaper in Zolochiv [Louis Lemaire/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>When the Ukrainian army began liberating the first villages near Zolochiv, Vassyl became determined to restore access to news in areas that had been deprived of it for six months.
