However, there were no reported scientific forecasts for the eruption.</p><p>The volcano has not previously erupted in the current Holocene Era, which began about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Ice Age, according to the Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program.</p><p>Satellite imagery shared on social media channels shows the eruption as viewed from space, with a mass of billowing ash shooting up and visibly spreading east towards the Red Sea. Footage captured from the ground also showed huge mountains of ash rising into the skies above the mountain range, blanketing the horizon.</p><p>VAAC reported that the massive waves of volcanic ash plumes emitted rose to about 45,000 metres (148,000 feet) in height at the time of the eruption, and that the ash moved primarily in a northwesterly direction.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-have-local-communities-been-affected\">How have local communities been affected?</h2><p>Local media in Ethiopia have reported that plumes of ash blanketed the areas around the volcano, including hilly villages which are well-known tourist attraction sites. In the neighbouring village of Afdera, one resident told The Associated Press he had heard a loud sound as the eruption occurred.</p><p>“It felt like a sudden bomb had been thrown with smoke and ash,” Ahmed Abdela told The AP. He added that by Monday, the village was still covered in ash, and that tourists and guides heading to the nearby Danakil Desert were stranded.</p><p>Afar TV reported that vibrations and moderate tremors were felt in Ethiopia’s Wollo area, in the northern Tigray region, and as far away as in the neighbouring country of Djibouti.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, dark smoke, rather than white ash, enveloped the area, plunging it into near-darkness, residents said.</p><p>There are concerns about how the eruption has affected air quality in the nearby villages.</p><p>Local administrator Mohammed Seid also told The AP the eruption could have economic implications for the local community, where most are livestock herders and depend on forage – plants eaten by animals – for their livestock. Much of this is now covered with a thick layer of dust. “While no human lives and livestock have been lost so far, many villages have been covered in ash, and as a result, their animals have little to eat,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-hayli-gubbi-volcano\">What do we know about the Hayli Gubbi volcano?</h2><p>Hayli Gubbi, a shield volcano – named so because it has a low profile and resembles a shield when viewed from above – is located about 800km (500 miles) northeast of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital city.</p><p>Hayli Gubbi, which rises to 500 metres (1,640 feet), is the southernmost volcano of the Erta Ale Range, a chain of low-lying shield volcanoes in the Afar region. It has had no known eruptions for 12,000 years.</p><p>Erte Ale volcano, one of Ethiopia’s most active, is also located within this range, which itself is set in the Rift Valley. Erte Ale, whose name means “smoking mountain” in Afar, last overflowed with lava in January 2023, according to The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program.</p><h2 id=\"where-has-the-ash-travelled-and-how-have-flights-been-affected\">Where has the ash travelled and how have flights been affected?</h2><p>Clouds of ash have travelled across the Red Sea, first over Yemen and Oman, and then on to Pakistan and India, according to monitoring website Flightradar24.</p><p>Volcanic ash clouds contain abrasive particles which can enter and damage aircraft engines, contaminate airfields, and reduce visibility, making flying hazardous.</p><p></p><p>The eruption has, therefore, caused widespread travel disruption in neighbouring countries and continents, although there are so far no reports of flight delays in Ethiopia, which is one of Africa’s biggest flight hubs.</p><h3>India</h3><p>In India, the ash had reached the Western Rajasthan region by Monday evening and then moved northeast, according to local newspaper The Hindu.</p><p>The ash prompted several airlines, including national carrier Air India, IndiGo and Akasa, as well as Dutch carrier KLM, to cancel their flights as a precaution. Air India cancelled 11 flights on Monday and Tuesday while Akasa scrapped flights scheduled on the same day to Jeddah, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>The country’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued advisories on Monday urging airlines to avoid affected altitudes and regions, and warning that volcanic ash could harm aircraft engines, according to The Hindu.</p><p>The agency also advised airlines to conduct precautionary checks on aircraft which had already flown over affected routes, and to report any suspected impact of ash on engine performance, or any smoke or odours in the cabin. Airports were also ordered to inspect runways for contamination.</p><p>The plumes have reportedly spread across the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab. India is expected to have clear skies by 14:00 GMT on Tuesday as the ash cloud moves towards China, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>In Pakistan, the country’s meteorological service reported that the ash cloud was seen 60 nautical miles (111km) south of the port city of Gwadar on Monday, according to local newspaper Dawn.</p><h3>Gulf</h3><p>Air Arabia cancelled several flights from Sharjah, UAE, on Tuesday.</p><p>In Oman, the Environment Authority activated its emergency response to monitor the ash clouds but reported no immediate impact on air quality, according to Times of Oman.</p><h2 id=\"when-have-volcanic-eruptions-caused-travel-chaos-in-the-past\">When have volcanic eruptions caused travel chaos in the past?</h2><p>Severe volcanic ash eruptions that lead to widespread disruptions like this one have been rare.</p><p>The last reported incident was in 2010, when the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland erupted continuously between March and June, sending plumes of volcanic ash over swaths of Scandinavia, the UK and other European countries. The eruption ejected ash up to 11km (seven miles) into the atmosphere. That ash had small, sharp particles of glacial debris because the eruption had occurred beneath glacial ice.<strong> </strong></p><p>In April that year, the UK was forced to close down its entire airspace for six days, during which time some 95,000 flights were cancelled. According to the Center for Economics and Business Research, the UK airline industry lost $1.45bn during the prolonged shutdown. Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria and Germany were also forced to close airspace in May.</p><p>Air traffic across Europe during that period was severely restricted as many countries continued to intermittently close their airspace. About 1.2 million passengers were stranded each day during what was the largest air traffic shutdown since World War II.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.</p><p>It was published online on October 30 in JAMA Oncology.</p><p>Doctors say these study results won’t change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.</p><p>Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.</p><p>Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24 percent higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn’t. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year – about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.</p><p>Co-authors Asa Johansson and Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.</p><p>Rachel Fey, interim co-CEO of Power to Decide – a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods – said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media.</p><p>“I get really angry at this because it’s designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,” she said. “It’s really frustrating … especially when it’s given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they’re talking about providing that context.”</p><p>The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel – found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea – but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo‑Provera.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-interpret-the-findings\">How to interpret the findings</h2><p>Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumours, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.</p><p>“A substantial proportion of the ‘cases’ would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,” said Lina S Morch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. Morch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-doctor-patient-conversation\">The doctor-patient conversation</h2><p>Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasise that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: That hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman’s needs and values.</p><p>Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won’t change how she talks to her patients.</p><p>“When counselling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what’s important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),” White wrote in an email. “Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counselling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.”</p><p>Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.</p><p>Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, “For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,” referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.</p><p>Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women’s Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn’t change their advice yet.</p><p>Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. “It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,” they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.</p><h2 id=\"keeping-the-risk-in-perspective\">Keeping the risk in perspective</h2><p>Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. Morch noted that even small risks are worth discussing, but said decisions should be guided by women’s “values and preferences”.</p><p>White said it’s important to see the big picture. “The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85 percent for people who do not use contraception – so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,” she wrote.</p><p><em>KFF Health News is a national newsroom that partners with PolitiFact and produces in-depth journalism about health issues.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Real Madrid, founded in 1902, has only ever had this ownership model.</p><p>This ownership structure prevents large private investors from forging a majority controlling stake in the clubs; it also means they can claim tax concessions.</p><p>This is despite the fact that Real Madrid was named the world’s wealthiest football club for the fourth straight year in 2025, with an estimated market valuation of $6.75bn, according to the Forbes List. It was also the first club to earn $1bn in revenue.</p><p>The nonprofit status allows Spanish clubs to preserve some traditions of their clubs and for members to take an active role in the organisations.</p><p>Graham Hunter, a British football journalist who specialises in Spanish football, pointed to the example of Joan Laporta, the current president of the other Spanish mega club, Barcelona.</p><p>“Laporta went from being a member and a lawyer to being [club] president in seven years,” he said.</p><p>In stark contrast, football clubs in England or the United States – Manchester United or Inter Miami being just two examples – can be owned by individuals, corporations and in some instances, acquired on public stock exchanges, resulting in more commercialised ownership structures.</p><p>It means their club’s performances are often centred on more short-run processes like profit maximisation, whereas in Spain, the club is in the hands of fans – not large private investors – allowing scope for longer-term business strategies to be enacted.</p><p>If Perez’s plan goes ahead, this could open the door for this famous Spanish club to become more like its foreign rivals.</p><p>The high-profile, multi-billionaire boss of Louis Vuitton, Bernard Arnault, was named in Spanish media on Monday as a potential investor in the club, should the new minority ownership rules be adopted.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3394168\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3394168\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3394168\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AFP__20241218__36QM4W6__v2__HighRes__FblFifaQatRealMadridPachuca-1734543018.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Real Madrid's French forward #9 Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid's Brazilian forward #7 Vinicius Junior look on ahead of the 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup final football match between Spain's Real Madrid and Mexico's Pachuca at the Lusail Stadium in Doha on December 18, 2024.

He had told us that access to the club was restricted to the children or grandchildren of members to prevent a Russian or Chinese person from joining,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Garcia added that in recent years, the rules of admission to membership had been changed several times, and Chinese and other foreigners had appeared on membership lists.</p><p>Alejandro Dominguez, a former vice president of the Real Madrid Veterans Pena, questioned why outside investors were needed to boost the coffers of such a profitable club.</p><p>“I don’t understand why we need more money when we are already the richest club in the world?” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>However, Fernando Valdez, a lifelong Real Madrid fan who is part of La Gran Familia supporters club, said he believed the reform would not harm the character of the club.</p><p>“If we were selling off huge chunks of the club to raise money to compete with Paris Saint-Germain, then that would be worrying, as it would change the club forever. But it is not like that,” he said.</p><p>“We need to know more details about this, but on the face of it, it does not seem like anything to worry about. Five percent or 10% is nothing.”</p><p>David Alvarez, who writes about Real Madrid for El Pais newspaper, said Perez’s ownership plan was not designed to compete with other high-spending clubs like Manchester City.</p><p>“This will allow the club to pay dividends to socios (club members). At present, the law stops them from doing that. They would have to sell a much bigger stake to be able to compete with the other big clubs in Europe, so they are not trying to do that.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4129841\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4129841\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129841\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-01T213015Z_347588341_UP1ELB11NQC36_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-SPAIN-RMA-VAL-1764068303.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Real Madrid fans react.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4129841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unlike football fans in other countries, Real Madrid spectators often own a small part of their club under the ‘socios’ model, which has existed since 1902 [File: Juan Barbosa/Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Who is going to secure the vote of Ukrainians in occupied regions or Ukrainian refugees abroad?</p><p>Moscow-appointed “authorities” forced most residents in occupied regions to get Russian passports, otherwise barring them from medical and legal services and forcing them to quit their jobs.</p><p>“There are many questions, and there isn’t a single answer,” Kucherenko said.</p><p>To her, the plan resembles a “classic” intelligence operation, when Moscow’s wish list is published without considering Kyiv’s or the European Union’s positions, she added.</p><p>The publication was timed to Ukraine’s political and energy crises – and the anniversary of the Revolution of Dignity: Huge, months-long protests that began on November 21, 2013 and installed a pro-Western government.</p><p>With all that in mind, Ukrainian diplomats “need to keep our head cool, communicate with European partners and define – firmly, calmly and consequentially – the Ukrainian position,” said Kucherenko.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ukrainian parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said on Monday that Kyiv would not agree to recognising Russia’s occupation, limiting the Ukrainian armed forces to 600,000 and vetoes on Kyiv’s membership in NATO.</p><p>Kyiv said any peace should be “dignified” and “lasting”, and that the plan needs to be <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/24/us-and-ukraine-announce-revised-peace-plan-this-is-what-we-know#flips-6385520440112:0\">updated and refined</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, European leaders said the plan should include an immediate ceasefire, allow Kyiv to eventually join NATO, and use frozen Russian funds to restore Ukraine.</p><p>“This is a pure ‘leave-us-alone’ declaration,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher with Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera, describing the Ukrainian and European reaction to the US’s proposal.</p><p>“Russia won’t capitulate now, but has decent chances to reach the outskirts of the [southeastern city of] Zaporizhzhia and [the eastern city of] Dnipro by spring, and the EU has chances to accept five to seven million Ukrainian refugees from frozen cities,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Washington has not provided any proof for its claims. Cartel de los Soles is actually a term Venezuelans use to refer to officials engaged in corruption, and is not an organised cartel.</p><p>Several airlines have cancelled flights to Venezuela following a warning from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about a “potentially hazardous situation” in Venezuelan airspace.</p><p>The advisory came after months of military build-up in the Caribbean Sea as part of what the US said were efforts to counter narcotics. Meanwhile, the top US military officer, Dan Caine, has been visiting the Caribbean region.</p><p>Last month, US President Donald Trump said he had authorised the CIA spy agency to carry out secret operations in Venezuela, bringing into the spotlight the history of US intervention in Latin America.</p><p>A strike on Venezuelan territory would constitute a serious escalation of the months-long US operation in the region, which has seen more than 80 people killed in a series of strikes on boats for allegedly trafficking drugs.</p><p>Maduro has denounced the US actions. On Monday, the Venezuelan government dubbed the “terrorist” designation of the alleged drug cartel as a “ridiculous lie” aimed at justifying “an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela”.</p><p>Since Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, he has escalated attacks on Venezuela, reversing his predecessor Joe Biden’s policy of engaging with Maduro.</p><p>But the roots of distrust and tension between Washington and Caracas go back a quarter of a century, following left-wing former President Hugo Chavez’s ascension to power in 1999. Maduro took over as president following Chavez’s death in 2013.</p><p>Here is a timeline of the deteriorating relations between Venezuela and the US since Trump started his second term, and how Washington’s approach towards the South American nation has led to this moment.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>January 10, 2025</strong> – Maduro is <a href=\"/news/2025/1/10/venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-sworn-in-for-third-term-after-disputed-election\">sworn</a> in for a third term after disputed elections. The US rejects the outcome, reiterating allegations of election fraud.</li>\n<li><strong>January 2025</strong> – Trump returns to power in the US and revokes the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/21/us-supreme-court-clears-way-to-end-tps-for-venezuelans-what-it-means\">temporary protected status (TPS)</a> that had shielded about 600,000 Venezuelans living in the US from deportation.</li>\n<li><strong>February 20, 2025: </strong>The Trump administration designates Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang as a “foreign terrorist organisation”. Trump would go on to claim that Tren de Aragua is a front for Maduro, even though US intelligence agencies have themselves said they have no evidence of any link between the group and the Venezuelan leadership.</li>\n<li><strong>February 21, 2025</strong> – Caracas agrees on coordinating with Washington over Trump’s mass deportation push; <a href=\"/news/2025/2/21/us-deports-dozens-of-venezuelan-migrants-from-guantanamo-bay\">the first batch of migrants reaches Venezuela</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>February 26, 2025</strong> – Trump nixes Venezuelan <a href=\"/news/2025/2/26/trump-nixes-venezuelan-oil-concessions-granted-by-predecessor-joe-biden\">oil concessions</a> granted by Biden.</li>\n<li><strong>March 24, 2025</strong> – Trump imposes <a href=\"/news/2025/3/24/trump-to-impose-25-percent-tariffs-on-countries-that-buy-oil-from-venezuela\">25 percent tariffs</a> on countries buying oil from Venezuela.</li>\n<li><strong>August 8, 2025</strong> – <a href=\"/news/2025/8/8/us-doubles-reward-for-arrest-of-venezuelas-president-maduro-to-50m\">US doubles reward for arrest</a> of Maduro to $50m, designating him the “global terrorist leader” of the Cartel de los Soles.</li>\n<li><strong>September-November 2025</strong> – Washington launches a maritime “anti-narcotics” campaign in the Caribbean and Pacific on September 2. At least 21 attacks on alleged “drug boats” have since killed more than 83 people.</li>\n<li><strong>October 15, 2025</strong> – Trump confirmed that he has <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/trump-seems-to-confirm-report-that-he-greenlit-cia-operations-in-venezuela\">authorised</a> the CIA to carry out secret operations in Venezuela.</li>\n<li><strong>October 28, 2025</strong> – Venezuela suspends a gas accord with <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/venezuela-suspends-trinidad-and-tobago-gas-accord-over-us-warship-visit\">Trinidad and Tobago</a> over a visit by a US warship.</li>\n<li><strong>November 12, 2025</strong> – Venezuela launches <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/12/venezuela-launches-nationwide-military-drills-amid-us-troop-build-up\">nationwide military drills</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>November 14, 2025</strong> – The US announces <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/us-announces-southern-spear-mission-as-forces-deploy-to-south-america\">“Southern Spear” mission</a> as forces deploy near South America.</li>\n<li><strong>November 14-16, 2025</strong> – The US deploys the world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R Ford, other warships, thousands of troops, and F-35 stealth jets to the Caribbean.</li>\n<li><strong>November 22, 2025</strong> – The <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/airlines-cancel-flights-to-venezuela-amid-us-military-buildup\">FAA issues</a> a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM), warning airlines of hazards in Venezuelan airspace due to “heightened military activity”, including GPS interference.

US companies invested in the oil sector in the early 20th century, and, by the 1920s, the US became the biggest market for Venezuela’s oil exports.</p><p>But Chavez’s nationalisation of the oil industry and vocal stance against US imperial interests in Latin America soured the ties. In 2007, Chavez pushed out US oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips as part of his efforts to make the state oil company gain a majority stake in all new oil projects. Chevron, another US oil major, however, continues to operate.</p><h2 id=\"here-s-a-snapshot-of-venezuela-us-ties-over-the-past-25-years\">Here’s a snapshot of Venezuela-US ties over the past 25 years:</h2><h3 id=\"1999-chavez-takes-office\">1999 – Chavez takes office</h3><p>Campaigning on an anti-establishment, anti-US platform, <a href=\"/features/2013/3/6/timeline-venezuela-during-the-chavez-era\">Hugo Chavez</a> is elected president and launches the so-called Bolivarian Revolution. His early moves to rewrite the constitution and later to nationalise the oil sector set Venezuela and the US on a collision course.</p><h3 id=\"2000s-escalation-and-hostility\">2000s – Escalation and hostility</h3><p>US-Venezuela ties deteriorate as Chavez strengthens ties with Russia, China and Iran.</p><p>Venezuela expels US-backed NGOs and diplomats, and accuses Washington of destabilisation efforts. The US criticises Venezuela over “authoritarianism” and restrictions on the media.</p><p>Domestically, Chavez’s government expands social programmes, funded by high oil prices, but economic mismanagement and corruption begin to undermine growth.</p><h3 id=\"2002-the-coup-attempt\">2002 – The coup attempt</h3><p>A <a href=\"/video/the-big-picture/2018/2/8/hugo-chavez-and-the-coup-that-never-happened\">short-lived coup</a> removes Chavez for 48 hours. Venezuela accuses the US of supporting the plot – a charge Washington denies. This event lays the foundation for two decades of distrust.</p><h3 id=\"2013-maduro-s-rise\">2013 – Maduro’s rise</h3><p>Following the death of Chavez, Maduro — his longtime deputy — narrowly wins the presidency in elections. His tenure is immediately marked by economic decline, corruption scandals and worsening relations with the US.</p><h3 id=\"2014-15-first-major-us-sanctions\">2014-15 – First major US sanctions</h3><p>Amid growing protests and allegations of human rights abuses, the US imposes visa restrictions and sanctions on Venezuelan officials.</p><p>This is a turning point: Sanctions exacerbate the economic crisis, and Venezuela begins to experience severe shortages of food and medicine. Inflation skyrockets, and migration out of the country surges.</p><h3 id=\"2017-19-economic-crisis\">2017-19 – Economic crisis</h3><p>​​The US blocks Venezuela’s access to its financial markets and bans the purchase of Venezuelan debt. Sanctions on oil imports intensify as Venezuela’s economy collapses under hyperinflation and years of mismanagement. In 2019, <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/inflation-cpi\">inflation</a> peaks at 345 percent.

The opposition showed vote tallies from several booths that appeared to suggest a comfortable win for Gonzales, disputing the result announced by election authorities in Maduro’s favour. The United Nations criticised the conduct of the election.</p><p>The then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was “overwhelming evidence” that Gonzalez had won. Several left-wing Latin American governments, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia, also questioned the official results and called for a recount.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The next hearings are scheduled for Thursday and December 2.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>If Ammori succeeds, the ban could potentially be lifted, bringing an end to a months-long campaign of civil disobedience that has resulted in hundreds of arrests.</p><p>More than 2,000 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for showing support for the organisation since it was outlawed in July, mostly for holding signs reading: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.”</p><p>Being a member of or showing support for the direct action group is currently a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>The government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer banned the group after two of its members broke into the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/pro-palestinian-activists-break-into-uk-military-base\">RAF Brize Norton military base</a> in Oxfordshire in June and sprayed red paint on Voyager planes that activists said were used in Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>In a separate incident in August 2024, members of the group broke into the premises of the Israeli defence firm <a href=\"/features/2023/11/17/israels-weapons-industry-is-the-gaza-war-its-latest-test-lab\">Elbit Systems</a> in Filton, Bristol, and reportedly destroyed quadcopter drones, which the group says are used by the Israeli military in Gaza to target Palestinians. A total of 24 activists linked to the group remain under arrest.</p><p>Ammori told Al Jazeera that the ban against Palestine Action is “absurd and authoritarian”.</p><p>“Proscribing Palestine Action wasn’t done to protect the public, it was done to crush dissent and defend the Israeli weapons industry,” she said.</p><p>“This is an opportunity for the courts to right the wrongs that the government has done, and reinstate a bit of sanity. If we are not successful, we will continue to fight the ban, and I am sure that ultimately, we will win.”</p><h2 id=\"political-battle\">Political battle</h2><p>Defend Our Juries, a campaign group coordinating protests across the United Kingdom during which sign-wielding demonstrators are routinely arrested, argued the ban is “political”.</p><p>“The reason there are protest groups is because our government isn’t listening to what the continuous protests are about,” Lex Korte, the group’s legal coordinator and cofounder, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In recent months, thousands of protesters at mass rallies, experts of international law and human rights groups have called on the UK to end its <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/corbyn-led-tribunal-accuses-uk-of-complicity-in-gaza-genocide\">alleged complicity</a> in Israel’s onslaught in Gaza. The UK provides vital components of F-35 jets and operates Shadow R1 surveillance flights over the Gaza Strip.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The ban on Palestine Action marked the first time in British history that a direct action group has been branded as a terrorist organisation. It is also the first time that a proscribed group has been granted a judicial review.</p><p>Korte said the term “terrorism” has always had a strong political connotation.</p><p>“The UK definition of terrorism, particularly in the Terrorism Act 2000, has been criticised as being way too vague and [of including] acts that aren’t acts of terrorism, namely the inclusion of criminal damage that doesn’t require any acts of violence towards humans,” he said.</p><p>“Inviting arrest with your behaviour and with that kind of method, we’re highlighting the unjust nature of the proscription of Palestine Action,” Korte said.</p><h2 id=\"direct-action-challenges-uk-complicity-in-gaza\">Direct action challenges UK complicity in Gaza</h2><p>London-based human rights advocacy organisation Cage International highlighted the “draconian use of terrorism legislation to shut down direct action” in a report issued on Tuesday.</p><p>“Direct action has been neither random nor gratuitous. It has been focused on the specific nodes that make war possible: manufacturers, insurers, logistics providers, financiers, universities, lobbyists, and government infrastructure,” it said.</p><p>“When ordinary channels fail to restrain state-sanctioned harm, principled disruption becomes not only legitimate but necessary.”</p><p>The report argues that the UK continues to support the war in Gaza with military, trade and diplomatic ties, despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) having concluded in July 2024 that Israel’s prolonged presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, constitutes a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">breach of international law</a>.</p><p>The ICJ also found it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide and issued six <a href=\"/news/2024/1/26/what-has-the-icj-ordered-israel-to-do-on-gaza-war-and-whats-next\">provisional measures</a> to mitigate the risk of such acts.</p><p>Cage found Palestine Action has spurred a wave of civil disobedience between 2020 and 2025, leading to a “significant shift in the landscape of activism in the UK”. This resulted in the shutdown of operations at sites connected to the production or facilitation of weapons used by Israeli forces, such as  Elbit’s site in Bristol that was the subject of dozens of protests by Palestine Action, including days before the group was proscribed.</p><p>“Over the last two years of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, the UK has steadily expanded its authoritarian counter-terrorism powers to suppress dissent and insulate itself from public accountability,”  Anas Mustapha, Cage’s Head of Public Advocacy, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But the proscription of Palestine Action went beyond the bounds of what the public would tolerate. It backfired precisely because the greater community consciousness has shifted. People could see with their own eyes what is happening in Gaza, and they recognise those acting to stop British participation in such acts.”</p><p>Korte, of Defend Our Juries, said judges at London’s High Court would have to understand “the gravitas that [their] decision has, both to everyday people and their lives and to the international community and the people of Palestine”.</p><p>Israel has pummelled Gaza since October 2023, killing at least 69,733 Palestinians and wounding 170,863. A total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel and about 200 were taken captive.</p><p>Since a ceasefire came into effect last month, two years after the war began, Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/israel-has-violated-gaza-truce-nearly-500-times-in-44-days-killed-hundreds\">has killed</a> more than 300 people in Gaza and violated the terms of the truce hundreds of times.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly six million people lack basic minimum food supplies in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, which are mainly comprised of rural farming communities.</p><p class=\"s3\">“The advance of insurgency presents a serious threat to stability in the north, with consequences reaching beyond Nigeria,” said David Stevenson, WFP’s Nigeria country director. “Communities are under severe pressure from repeated attacks and economic stress.”</p><p class=\"s3\">Besides Boko Haram in the northeast, Nigeria also suffers violence led by armed gangs in the centre and northwest of the country, where they raid villages, kill people and kidnap for ransom.</p><p class=\"s3\">Over the past week, the country has experienced three mass kidnappings.</p><p class=\"s3\">At least 303 children and 12 teachers were abducted by gunmen from the Saint Mary’s Catholic School in north-central Nigeria’s Niger State on Friday.</p><p class=\"s3\">In neighbouring Kebbi State, 25 Muslim high school girls were taken, while 38 worshippers were snatched from a church during a livestreamed service in Kwara State.</p><p class=\"s3\">The hunger crisis in Nigeria and the region is expected to get worse as international bodies trying to assist suffering populations face increasing funding challenges.</p><p class=\"s3\">The WFP was forced to scale down its nutrition programme in Nigeria in July, affecting more than 300,000 children and exacerbating malnutrition levels from “serious” to “critical” in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p class=\"s3\">Under President Donald Trump, the United States – the NGO’s largest donor – has slashed aid, leaving the agency at risk of running out of funds for emergency food and nutrition by December.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The administration’s maritime strikes on vessels it says were engaged in drug trafficking have killed at least 83 people on 21 boats. No evidence has been released showing narcotics were on board, and legal experts say the strikes would likely violate international law even if drug activity were proven.</p><p>Speaking to his advisers on Monday, Trump said he plans to talk directly with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on an unidentified date.</p><p>Roughly 15,000 US personnel are now in the Caribbean, among them Marines on amphibious ships and about 5,000 service members based in Puerto Rico.

Until this year, the FTO label was largely limited to groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) with political motives.</p><p>On Monday, Washington formally designated the Cartel de los Soles for allegedly shipping narcotics into the US. The administration says the network includes Maduro and senior Venezuelan officials, though it has provided no evidence. Venezuela denounced the move, calling it a “ridiculous” effort to sanction a “non-existent” group.</p><p>The designation follows earlier measures against eight Latin American criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking and migrant smuggling. US officials claim the Cartel de los Soles has collaborated with Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang – itself designated an FTO – to move drugs northward.</p><p>Officials have rarely identified which groups they believe are behind the boats targeted by US strikes. Hegseth said last week the new designation would provide a “whole bunch of new options to the United States” in dealing with Maduro. Asked whether such options might include land strikes inside Venezuela, he said “nothing is off the table, but nothing’s automatically on the table.” Sanctions experts have noted that the FTO statute does not authorise military action.</p><h2 id=\"caracas-pushes-back\">Caracas pushes back</h2><p>Maduro’s government denies involvement in criminal operations and accuses Washington of seeking regime change to control Venezuela’s resources.</p><p>“They want Venezuela’s oil and gas reserves. For nothing, without paying. They want Venezuela’s gold. They want Venezuela’s diamonds, iron, bauxite. They want Venezuela’s natural resources,” said Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez on state television.</p><p>Foreign Minister Yvan Gil echoed that view, saying the US designation revives “an infamous and vile lie to justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela”.</p><p>InSight Crime, a foundation that analyses organised crime, has described the cartel narrative as an “oversimplification”, saying it “is more accurately described as a system of corruption wherein military and political officials profit by working with drug traffickers”.</p><p>The US campaign has also drawn sharp domestic debate within the country. A Reuters poll suggested that only 29 percent of Americans support killing suspected traffickers without judicial oversight. A former senior Treasury official said FTO designations were never intended to justify military operations. “Never had it been suggested that by designating an entity as an FTO it would … meet the standard for military action,” the official said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
