The proposal would also demand cuts to Ukraine’s military, several outlets reported.</p><p>Ukraine’s Zelenskyy – who <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy\">sparred with</a> US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in a dramatic meeting in February – has been clear since Russia’s 2022 invasion that potential peace talks ought not sideline Ukraine, a viewpoint shared by much of the EU’s leadership.</p><p>“We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” Zelenskyy <a href=\"/news/2025/2/13/zelenskyy-wants-plan-to-stop-russia-before-us-peace-talks\">said ahead of that contentious meeting.</a></p><p>He has since repeatedly made clear several red lines that neither the Ukrainian government nor its constitution would permit, including ceding its territory.</p><p>Still, some European leaders have offered less enthusiasm. Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the EU should stop sending money to Ukraine in seeming reference to an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/ukraine-suspends-justice-minister-for-alleged-link-to-100m-corruption-case\">ongoing corruption probe</a> involving an alleged $100m energy kickback scheme.</p><p>Last week, Ukraine’s Justice Minister German Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk submitted their resignations as anticorruption authorities said they had detained five people suspected of an alleged plot to control procurement at nuclear agency Energoatom.</p><p class=\"p1\">“There’s a war mafia, a corrupt system working in Ukraine, and then the European Commission president … instead of stopping the payments and demanding for immediate financial clearance, she wants to send another 100 billion to Ukraine. That is insane,” Szijjarto said.</p><p>Hungary’s right-wing populist leader Victor Orban, who counts Russian President Vladimir Putin as an ally, has been <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/ukraines-zelenskyy-calls-on-hungarys-orban-to-stop-blocking-eu-bid\">blocking Ukraine’s EU bid,</a> received an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/hungarian-leader-viktor-orban-to-meet-us-president-donald-trump\">exemption</a> on Russian energy sanctions from Trump and a “<a href=\"/economy/2025/11/9/hungarian-leader-orban-says-he-secured-financial-shield-from-trump\">financial shield</a>” to safeguard its economy in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The time is not on the side of Ukraine. It is an illusion to say that the time is on the side of Ukraine,” Szijjarto said, adding that he would support Trump’s peace initiatives.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was designed to silence and intimidate any possible opposition.</p><p>The number of victims who were summarily executed is estimated at 130,000 to 200,000.</p><p>In the half-century since Franco's demise, exhumations have been slow and beset by logistical, financial and legal challenges. There are an estimated 6,000 unmarked mass graves dotted around the country, including everywhere from wells and woodlands to gardens, cemeteries and remote hillsides.</p><p>But as Spain remembers the era's victims and analyses exhumation efforts, it is grappling with the steady recent rise of a far-right party, Vox, and nostalgia for the ideals of the dictatorship among young people who did not endure it.</p><p>A recent CIS poll suggested that 20 percent of those aged 18 to 24 believed the dictatorship was \"good\" or \"very good\".</p><p>According to secondary schoolteachers, social media is driving pro-Franco support among teenagers.</p><p>“They talk like they are really in favour of the dictatorship and of obligatory military service as well,” Jose Garcia Vico, a secondary school economics teacher in Andalusia, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The majority of the teachers I know are very worried because even if we’ve explained the difference between dictatorship and democracy, the students are so overrun with content from TikTok and they’re so p***** off with the world in general, they don’t know what they want.”</p><p>“The content they get from the hard-right parties on social media aimed at adolescents is considerable, and it has a lot of effect on how they relate to each other.”</p><p>While emphasising “not everybody in the class” is attracted to the far right, Garcia Vico points to a parallel sharp rise in Islamophobic and anti-transgender comments.</p><p>“Above all, it’s the boys who feel superior to the rest. But it’s a problem which involves some of the parents as well. A couple of years ago, some parents told me that it was OK that their child had interrupted me by shouting, 'Viva Franco!’ ['Long Live Franco!'] because that was freedom of expression.”</p><p>Hundreds of kilometres north in the capital, Madrid, Sebastian Reyes Turner, a 27-year-old teacher, said he has also noticed the impact of hard-right social media influencers.</p><p>“In schools, people only see Franco’s dictatorship as one of several topics to mindlessly memorise to pass a history exam they don’t really care about to begin with.</p><p>“On the other hand, details are cherry-picked by the far right to make them think it was a better time in which they didn’t face problems like they do today - like how hard it is to find jobs even if they’ve been studying well into their 20s or the housing crisis.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

California’s Governor <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slams-trump-absence-at-climate-conference\">Gavin Newsom</a> has accused US President Donald Trump of “handing the future to China” and leaving states like California to pick up the slack, in a speech at the summit.</p><p>“ China is here. Only one country’s not here: United States of America,” Newsom said. Trump has called concerns over climate change a “hoax” and a “con job”.</p><p>But the UN Climate Change Conference COP30 is not the only event where the diverging paths that China and the US are taking on addressing the climate crisis are being felt.</p><p>Back in the US, and in neighbouring Canada, trade barriers aimed at punishing Chinese electric vehicles have made them far costlier than what the manufacturers want to sell them for.</p><p>These tariffs are a legacy of former US President Joe Biden’s administration, and place North America as an outlier at a time when Chinese EVs otherwise dominate the global market.</p><h2 id=\"how-dominant-is-china-in-evs\">How dominant is China in EVs?</h2><p>Joel Jaeger, a senior research associate with the World Resources Institute, told Al Jazeera that Chinese EVs have “really upended the car market” in recent years.</p><p>China has gone “from basically not a major player five years ago” to becoming “the number one exporter of cars globally in terms of the units”, says Jaeger.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China manufactured 12.4 million electric cars in 2024, more than 70 percent of the 17.3 million electric cars manufactured globally last year.</p><p>Of these, China exported about 1.25 million cars, representing 40 percent of global exports, while the remaining Chinese-made cars — the vast majority — were sold domestically.</p><p>This dominance has been built on the back of “subsidies that China’s put in place to develop its industry, which I think is a very strategic thing that China has done, both for its own economic growth as well as decarbonisation”, Jaeger said.</p><p>But on the streets of the US or Canada, Chinese EVs are still relatively rare.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-chinese-evs-less-affordable-in-the-us-and-canada\">Why are Chinese EVs less affordable in the US and Canada?</h2><p>According to Jaeger, “prohibitive” tariffs mean that Chinese EVs are almost impossible to buy in the US and Canada.</p><p>“In the last year, the US and <a href=\"/economy/2024/8/26/canada-follows-us-imposes-100-tariff-on-evs-imported-from-china\">Canada</a> both put on basically completely prohibitive tariffs on EVs [of] over 100 percent in both places,” he added.</p><p>Notably, the steep import taxes on Chinese EVs in the US were introduced under Biden, a Democrat, who <a href=\"/news/2024/5/8/clean-energy-on-the-cusp-of-rolling-back-fossil-fuels-report\">championed renewable energy</a>, in contrast to Trump, who has pledged to fight it and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/21/drill-baby-whats-the-paris-climate-deal-why-does-trump-want-out\">“drill, baby, drill”</a> for oil.</p><p>A month after the US introduced 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs in September 2024, Canada brought in identical tariffs of its own.</p><p>It means that a car that a Chinese EV manufacturer might be selling at $30,000 actually costs at least $60,000 in the US or Canada. This makes it hard for even cheaper Chinese models to compete with the higher-end US electric models, which on average retail for approximately $55,000.</p><p>These tariffs, along with other US policies, have meant that Chinese manufacturers have yet to set up shop in the US.</p><p>In Canada, Addisu Lashitew, an associate professor of business at McMaster University, told Al Jazeera that the steep tariffs conflict with targets set to transition fully to electric cars by 2035, but are also complicated due to Canada’s close trading ties with the US.</p><p>“The problem is that one, we are going through a very complex trade talk with the US now,” said Lashitew. “And two, our supply chain has also [been] very much integrated. Many of the American manufacturers are here, and Canadian firms are mainly suppliers.”</p><p>But while it is almost impossible to buy a cheap Chinese electric car in the US, Jaeger says this does not mean that North America is completely missing out on importing new Chinese technology.</p><p>“The US, for example, imports a lot of batteries from China. It’s actually the second-biggest importer of lithium-ion batteries behind Germany in the world, from China. So, they’re using them in US-made EVs,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117290\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117290\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117290\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ap_691da524082d9-1763550500.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A selection of 2025 GMC Sierra EV Denali pick-up trucks, which are fully electric vehicles, are displayed at a GMC/Hummer truck dealership, Friday, July 18, 2025, in Manchester, N.H.

A majority of the 4.27 million electric cars that BYD sold in 2024 were bought by Chinese consumers. BYD also has a manufacturing presence in Lancaster, California, where it builds electric buses and batteries, but not cars.</p><p>In China, the local market has grown in part due to incentives from the government, which also saw electric cars as part of its strategy to <a href=\"/news/2022/1/4/beijing-meets-national-air-quality-standards-for-first-time\">bring down air pollution</a> in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.</p><p>Customers in China have benefitted from the government’s approach, including through access to new technology. For example, a new battery, which BYD announced in March with the promise of charging for 400km (about 250 miles) of travel in just five minutes, is first being made available for preorder to customers in China only.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-expensive-are-evs\">How expensive are EVs?</h2><p>They used to be costlier than cars that run on petrol or diesel. But according to the IEA, the cost of owning an electric car over the vehicle’s entire lifetime is now less than fossil fuel-powered cars, due to the reduced costs of fuel and maintenance.</p><p>Buying an electric car is still often more expensive, though.</p><p>That is where China’s subsidies to manufacturers help. The IEA has found that prices for electric cars in China are similar to petrol and diesel cars, with half of all electric cars being sold for less than $30,000 and a wide range of lower-priced models available.</p><p>By contrast, in the US and Europe, “the range [of available EVs] was skewed towards higher-end models with higher prices”, according to the IEA.</p><p>Under Biden, the US tried to boost its domestic electric vehicle industry, while also trying to get the sector to reduce dependence on China.</p><p>Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced incentives for US manufacturers that did not use any Chinese parts. The IRA also introduced subsidies for consumers who bought EVs, though these have largely been overturned by Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which became law in July.</p><p>Nevertheless, even with the Biden-era incentives, only one in 10 cars sold in the US in 2024 was electric, while more than half of all new cars sold last year in China were electric.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117288\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117288\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117288\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ap_691da50293471-1763550466.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Cape Town’s Arrowgate Depot, equipped with Autel Energy’s MaxiCharger DC Fast units, powering the city’s growing fleet of electric buses — the largest public EV bus charging hub in South Africa.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4117288\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Electric buses charge in Cape Town, South Africa [File: AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"not-just-cars\">Not just cars</h2><p>While electric cars grab most headlines on sustainable transport, people are also increasingly turning to electric bicycles, scooters, motorcycles, buses and even trains in many parts of the world.</p><p>Even in the US, says Jaeger, there has been a significant growth in the number of electric scooters and two-wheelers imported from China.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), the US imported $1.5bn worth of electric two-wheelers from China in the 12 months up to September 2025, an increase of $275m — or more than 20 percent — from the previous year. Experts say that is because scooters are cheaper than cars, and because US tariffs on Chinese electric scooters are also lower than on electric cars.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Vietnam, the government has said it will <a href=\"/news/2025/8/28/vietnams-petrol-scooter-ban-for-hanoi-raises-fears-for-livelihoods\">ban petrol-powered motorbikes</a> in the centre of its capital, Hanoi, from July next year, as part of a plan to tackle local air pollution.</p><p>According to the IEA, some 40 percent of bus sales are now electric in European countries, including Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway.</p><p>There have also been increases in electric bus sales in Central and South America. In Mexico, for example, “close to 18 percent of all bus sales were electric in 2024, up from just above 1 percent in 2023”, according to the IEA.</p><p>Still, the US continues to struggle here, too. Electric bus sales declined in 2024, according to the IEA, after the leading electric bus manufacturer went bankrupt and a second company stopped manufacturing in the US market after suffering sustained financial losses.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117294\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117294\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117294\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/getty_691da60e4e-1763550734.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM - NOVEMBER 6: People ride motorbikes on a street as water levels reach the annual peak on November 6, 2025 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

But it was only in 2017, when she was bedridden for 11 months after having cancer treatment, that she picked it up again.</p><p>The first time Mwangi was diagnosed, it was with spine cancer. Housebound and wanting to pass the time, she decided to knit hats, which she ended up donating to cancer patients at Kenyatta National Hospital.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Then the next year, in 2018, her world was shaken when she was diagnosed again – this time with stage-three breast cancer.</p><p>“I felt like it was the end of me when the diagnosis came out,” said the 52-year-old mother of three, who recalls being “terrified” at the news.</p><p>She isolated herself from friends and family and even turned off her phone. “I told my husband that I don’t want to interact with anyone; the world felt so violent.”</p><p>Mwangi had to undergo a mastectomy – a surgical removal of part or all of a breast – and 33 sessions of radiotherapy. In all, she was in treatment for four years, losing her hair and her savings in the process.</p><p>“I had taken a 1.3-million-Kenyan-shilling (about $10,000) loan to expand my business as a tailor, and all was swept [away] by treatment,” she lamented.</p><p>Added to the physical and financial devastation was the social discrimination.</p><p>Though the mastectomy helped save her life, it brought stigma in her community in central Kenya, some 40km (24.8 miles) northeast of the capital Nairobi.</p><p>“People referred to me as the woman whose breasts were cut,” said Mwangi, who was declared cancer-free in 2020. “Losing them affects your dignity.”</p><p>She soon realised that she wasn’t the only one: While at the cancer ward of a local hospital, she noticed other women were hiding their chests under big scarves and baggy clothes. When she spoke to them, she learned that they, too, had undergone mastectomies.</p><p>Although there are several cancer survivor support groups in Kenya that offer screening and counselling services, some of them for free, experts say the public health system often lacks adequate oncology and follow-up care, with many survivors left to navigate recovery on their own.</p><p>Determined to help others like herself, Mwangi thought of what got her through her illness: knitting. And then she came up with an idea to support survivors while earning money: knitted breast prostheses made of colourful cotton yarn.</p><p>At a cancer support group she attended while ill, one of the sessions taught the participants to make yarn breast prostheses. Mwangi learned the basics from there and later watched tutorials on YouTube before she began practising to perfect her craft.</p><p>“Thank God for knitting. It was a form of simple therapy for me,” Mwangi said. “It took my mind away from thinking about [the cancer].”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4114599\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4114599\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4114599\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2020-02-14T070110Z_1826411990_RC270F980A4C_RTRMADP_3_KENYA-HEALTH-1763463867.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C493&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4114599\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A patient is seen through the glass as she undergoes a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer at a hospital in Nairobi, Kenya [File: Njeri Mwangi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"physical-and-psychological-care\">Physical and psychological care</h2><p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women globally, according to the World Health Organization. Kenya’s National Cancer Institute says it affects more than 6,700 women in the country every year.</p><p>Many undergo mastectomies and are left searching for prosthetic breasts.</p><p>But in Kenya, one silicone prosthetic costs an estimated 22,000 Kenyan shillings ($170) according to Mwangi, making them unaffordable to many – more than 40 percent of Kenya’s population lives <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kenya/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">below the international poverty</a> line of $3 per day, according to the World Bank.</p><p>Mwangi sells each prosthetic she knits for 1,500 Kenyan shillings ($11,60).</p><p>They come in different sizes and colours and are filled with yarn before being placed into specially adapted bras with pockets, which are sold separately for between 1,000 ($7.74) and 2,000 Kenyan shillings ($15.49) each.</p><p>Mwangi produces about 50 pieces a week, and to date, has sold about 600 breast prostheses, as well as more than 450 knitted hats for cancer patients.</p><p>She sells her products in cash at her shop, but also in bulk to organisations she has partnered with – like Milele Health, Kenyatta National Hospital and Childhood Cancer Initiative – who then donate them to survivors.</p><p>This has helped her rebuild her business, while also continuing to aid those in need.</p><p>Mwangi also tries to help through the New Dawn Cancer Warriors support group she leads, which brings survivors together to share their stories.</p><p>She recounts the day a 33-year-old survivor called Jane joined the group, at first sitting at the back of the room, too nervous to speak.</p><p>When Mwangi spoke to her privately, she learned that her confidence had dropped since having a mastectomy. So she encouraged her, making her see that the loss of a breast does not devalue a woman, and also donated a knitted prosthesis to help her. Slowly, she says, Jane regained her confidence, and after five months, she was sitting at the front during group meetings and contributing. Today, Mwangi says her self-esteem and courage have returned.</p><p>Joy Kulet, a psychologist in Kenya who sees many women who have had mastectomies, says knitted prosthetics not only provide an affordable solution, but also help restore self-confidence.</p><p>“Losing a breast for a woman is more than physical; it is psychological,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109642\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109642\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109642\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hanna-Nungari-Mugo-1763286323.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C497&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109642\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hannah Nungari Mugo, a breast cancer survivor, used to be a vegetable seller but now knits to earn money to support her family [Daniel Kipchumba/Egab]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"knitting-gave-me-purpose\">‘Knitting gave me purpose’</h2><p>In Thika town, the sound of busy sewing machines can be heard from outside Mwangi’s tailoring shop.</p><p>Inside, finished clothes hang on the wall near two women focused on sewing.

As her hair fell out and her body became weak, her husband took out a 500,000 Kenyan shilling ($3,800) loan to keep them afloat.</p><p>“It consumed all the savings we had,” she said.</p><p>But like Mwangi, the stigma that followed was one of the worst parts of the experience, she says. In her neighbourhood, people saw her as “fragile” and excluded her from activities.</p><p>“I joined [Mwangi’s] training and after just a few weeks, I had the basics,” she said. She now makes approximately seven prostheses a week to sell at Mwangi’s store, which earns her an income to support her family.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109651\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109651\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109651\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mary-Patricia-Karobia-1763286390.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109651\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mary Patricia Karobia, a liver transplant survivor, is part of Mwangi’s knitting and support group [Daniel Kipchumba/Egab]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"sharing-stories-is-part-of-healing\">Sharing stories is ‘part of healing’</h2><p>The workshops aren’t just for breast cancer survivors. Others struggling with different health conditions have also participated, like 58-year-old Mary Patricia Karobia, who uses the opportunity to share her own story of stigma and survival.</p><p>In 2011, she was diagnosed with liver fibrosis and underwent a successful liver transplant. But just like Mwangi and Mugo, discrimination awaited.</p><p>“People were whispering that my liver was removed,” she said, recalling that she was excluded from activities and duties at women’s events, as she was believed to be too weak to contribute.</p><p>She felt marginalised. But then she came across Mwangi and her space that enabled women to talk about their experiences with others going through something similar, and she was inspired to join.</p><p>“I now knit four [prostheses] each week,” Karobia said. “Apart from earning me an income, making prosthetics gives me joy as I am helping breast cancer survivors regain their self-esteem.”</p><p>“The healing journey [from cancer] is unique for each individual. For some, it is smooth, but others relapse along the way,” said Kulet, the psychologist, adding that community support groups like Mwangi’s are essential.</p><p>“Sharing their story is part of healing,” she said, especially in spaces where survivors can share openly without fear of judgement.</p><p>Mwangi considers her work to be part of the larger healing process for breast cancer survivors who have undergone mastectomies. She says she has witnessed improved self-esteem and courage in many of the women who have acquired the prostheses – something that makes her proud.</p><p>For now, due to space constraints, Mwangi’s training workshops can only accommodate four people at a time. And financially, she is limited: she can’t register as a training school due to a lack of funds; the price of yarn also fluctuated a few times this year – from 450 Kenyan shillings ($3.40) to almost double that – forcing her to sometimes raise prices.</p><p>But she remains hopeful.</p><p>“My dream is to train as many cancer survivors as possible in Kenya,” she said. She wants them all to have their own independent businesses one day, so that hopefully, they too can “earn a living through knitting”.</p><p><em>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.egab.co/\">Egab</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This makes India one of the three nations most affected by <a href=\"/news/2021/10/26/india-climate-change-migration-poverty-extreme-weather\">internal displacements</a> due to climate change in that period, with China and the Philippines being the top two.</p><p>Moreover, in the first six months of 2025, more than 160,000 people were displaced across India due to natural disasters, as the country received above-average rainfall, triggering huge floods and landslides, and submerging hundreds of villages and cities.</p><h2 id=\"zero-adaptation-money-for-two-years\">Zero adaptation money for two years</h2><p>To help millions of people like Ahmad who are vulnerable to the climate crisis, India’s Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched a National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) in 2015. Its goal was to finance projects that help communities cope with floods, droughts, landslides, and other climate-related stresses across India.</p><p>Managed by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the flagship scheme supported interventions in agriculture, water management, forestry, coastal protection, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Between 2015 and 2021, it financed more than two dozen projects, benefitting thousands of <a href=\"/news/2023/3/29/indias-warm-weather-plans-exclude-the-most-vulnerable-report\">vulnerable households</a>.</p><p>During a roundtable in Brazil’s Belem city last month – before the 30th United Nations climate change conference, or COP30, which officially opened on November 17 – India’s minister for environment, forest and climate change, Bhupender Yadav, said the global meet should be the “COP of adaptation”.</p><p>“The focus must be on transforming climate commitments into real-world actions that accelerate implementation and directly improve people’s lives,” he said, according to a statement released by the Indian government on October 13. He highlighted “a need to strengthen and intensify the flow of public finance towards adaptation”, said the statement.</p><p>In another statement last Tuesday, a day after COP30 opened, India said climate “adaptation financing needs to exceed nearly 15 times current flows, and significant gaps remain in doubling international public finance for adaptation by 2025”.</p><p>“India emphasised that adaptation is an urgent priority for billions of vulnerable people in developing countries who have contributed the least to global warming but stand to suffer the most from its impacts,” said the statement.</p><p>But the actions of the Indian government back home do not match those words at the climate summit.</p><p>Government records show NAFCC received an average of $13.3m annually in the initial years of its launch. But the allocation steadily declined. In the financial year 2022-2023, the fund’s spending was just $2.47m. In November 2022, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change moved NAFCC from the category of a government “scheme” to a “non-scheme”, providing no clear outlay for funds.</p><p>Since the financial year 2023-2024, zero money has been earmarked for the crucial climate adaptation fund.</p><p>As a result, several climate adaptation projects in areas prone to floods, cyclones and landslides have been stalled even as widespread climatic devastation continued to kill and displace people. While presenting the federal budget in parliament in February this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not even include the words “climate change” and “adaptation” in her hour-long speech.</p><p>“Announcing lofty adaptation goals abroad while starving the fund that safeguards our own citizens is misleading and a moral failure,” Raja Muzaffar Bhat, an environmental activist in Indian-administered Kashmir, told Al Jazeera, calling Yadav’s statements in Brazil “a gross distortion of reality and a dangerous distraction”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for their comments on cutting NAFCC funds, but has not received any response.</p><p>An official in the Environment Ministry, however, defended the government’s shift in funding priorities, claiming the authorities have not abandoned climate adaptation efforts.</p><p>“Funds are now being channelled through broader climate and sustainability initiatives rather than standalone schemes like the NAFCC,” the official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.</p><h2 id=\"limate-injustice-at-its-most-blatant\">‘Climate injustice at its most blatant’</h2><p>Meanwhile, climate crises continue to kill and displace people across India.</p><p>In the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India’s poorest state, 38-year-old Sunita Devi has been displaced five times in seven years as floods in the nearby Kosi River repeatedly destroyed her mud house built on bamboo stilts.</p><p>“We live in fear every monsoon. My children have stopped going to school because we shift from camp to camp,” she said, holding on to the family’s only lifeline: A government ration card that allows them to buy food grains at subsidised rates or get them for free.</p><p>This year saw one of the worst monsoons across India, as above-average rains killed hundreds and displaced millions. In Bihar alone, floods affected more than 1.7 million people, killed dozens and submerged hundreds of villages.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Odisha, another impoverished eastern state, fisherman Ramesh Behera*, 45, watched his house in Kendrapara district’s Satabhaya village collapse into the Bay of Bengal in 2024, as rising seas continue to erase entire hamlets. “The sea swallowed my home and my father’s fields. Fishing is no longer enough to survive,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Behera was forced to give up his family’s traditional livelihoods – fishing and farming – and was driven into distress migration to survive. He now works as a manual labourer in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>In West Bengal state’s Sundarbans Islands, one of the largest mangrove forests in the world, rising seas and coastal erosion have consumed lands and homes, forcing thousands of families in the fragile ecosystem to relocate.</p><p>In the southern state of Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, 29-year-old Revathi Selvam says saltwater intrusion from the Bay of Bengal has poisoned her farmland and their paddy harvest has collapsed.</p><p>“The soil is no longer fertile. We cannot grow rice any more. We may have to leave farming altogether,” she told Al Jazeera, adding that many in her village are considering migrating to the state capital, Chennai, to work as construction workers.</p><p>In the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, 27-year-old hotel worker Arjun Thakur saw his livelihood vanish when a cloudburst in 2024 buried the small tourist lodge where he worked. “The mountain broke apart. I saw houses collapse in seconds,” he recalled.</p><p>Thakur now stays with his relatives in the state capital Shimla, unsure if he can ever return to his native place.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4096819\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4096819\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4096819\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s2-1762773236.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The government-provided tarpaulin tents in Reasi district are too small for residents to stand\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4096819\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The government provided tarpaulin tents to affected families in Kashmir’s Reasi district, while the photo on the right shows Qamar Din’s relatives watching helplessly as his house collapses [Junaid Manzoor Dar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Yet, with funds for NAFCC gone, people like Devi, Behera, Selvam and Thakur have no access to a government scheme that helps them cope with their tragedies.</p><p>A government official, who previously worked with NAFCC, told Al Jazeera several schemes approved by the government under NAFCC were never implemented after funds began to dry up as early as 2021, exposing thousands of households to a recurring climate crisis.</p><p>“The fund was created to help vulnerable communities adapt before disasters struck, and to reduce the kind of repeated displacement we are now witnessing,” the official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.</p><p>“Once the allocations stopped, states lost a key channel to protect people living on the front lines of floods, landslides, and droughts. Now, these families are left to rebuild on their own, again and again.”</p><p>Activist Bhat said the government’s attitude to the NAFCC “signals that adaptation is no longer a priority, even as India faces record internal displacement from climate extremes”.</p><p>“People are losing homes, farms, and livelihoods, and the government has left them entirely to their fate. If this continues, the next generation will inherit a country where climate refugees are a daily reality,” he said.</p><p>“This is climate injustice at its most blatant.”</p><h2 id=\"migration-no-longer-a-choice-but-a-survival-strategy\">‘Migration no longer a choice but a survival strategy’</h2><p>Climate Action Network South Asia is a Dhaka-based coalition of about 250 civil society organisations, working in eight South Asian countries to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change. Its estimate says roughly 45 million people in India could be forced to migrate by 2050 due to the climate crisis – a threefold increase over current displacement figures.</p><p>“We are a vast nation with hot and cold deserts, long coastlines, and Himalayan glaciers. From tsunamis on our shores to flash floods, cloudbursts, and landslides in the mountains, we face the entire spectrum of climate extremes,” Bhat told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Bhat said it is not just nature causing displacement, but also unchecked “development” of vulnerable areas.</p><p>“Earlier, floods or cloudbursts were occasional, and population density was low. Now, haphazard construction around mountain passes, waterways and streams, along with rampant deforestation, has amplified these disasters,” he said.</p><p>“People who once fled New Delhi’s air pollution to settle down in [the Himalayan states of] Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand now find themselves living under a constant threat of landslides. Migration is no longer a choice but a survival strategy.”</p><p>Bhat warned that neglecting people affected by climate-related displacement could cause the world’s largest climate migration crisis.</p><p>“We are no longer behaving like the welfare state promised in our constitution. We pay taxes like a developed country but get services that leave people to die in a climate crisis… We are utterly unprepared for the mass migrations that will inevitably come from both our mountains and our plains,” he said.</p><p>Back at the temporary government shelter in Kashmir’s landslide-hit Sarh village, Ahmad fears an uncertain future for him and his family.</p><p>“If land and shelter are not provided, we will not merely be homeless; we will become refugees in our own land, cast aside without place or protection,” he said.</p><p>“When the state neglects the consequences of climate change, it issues a declaration: You are free to drown, but not free to rebuild.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We know what you’re doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,” Healey said.</p><p>“This is the first time we’ve had this action from Yantar directed against the British RAF.
