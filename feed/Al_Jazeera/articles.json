The list includes the Great Omari Mosque, built nearly 1,400 years ago, and the <a href=\"https://aje.io/vit78c\">Church of Saint Porphyrius</a>, both targeted during Israeli bombardment. The Greek Orthodox Church was built in 425.</p><p>Adwan described the move as a strategic step for the “day after” the war.</p><p>“Listing sites like the Great Omari Mosque … is an initial international recognition of their global value and their urgent need for protection,” she explained.</p><p>“We are counting on UNESCO not just for funding, but to document damages as an international legal source to preserve our cultural rights.”</p><h2 id=\"heritage-is-a-bridge\">‘Heritage is a bridge’</h2><p>The initiative has drawn a sharp response from the Israeli government, particularly regarding sites located in Area C of the West Bank, such as Herodium (Jabal al-Fureidis), which is under full Israeli military control. Area C forms more than 60 percent of the West Bank.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.c14.co.il/article/1427344\">According</a> to Israel’s Channel 14, Israeli Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu sent an urgent letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, labeling the Palestinian move as “archaeological terrorism”.</p><p>Eliyahu demanded the formation of a government task force to block the bid, arguing it is a “strategic arena for a political struggle” aimed at seizing sites of “Jewish historical importance”.</p><p>“Lack of response will be interpreted in the international arena as silent acceptance,” Eliyahu warned, claiming the move is a prelude to “international legal interventions”.</p><p>Israel has been accused of<a href=\"/gallery/2014/11/11/erasing-palestine\"> erasing Palestinian cultural heritage</a> and weaponising archaeology to appropriate Palestinian land. It has designated dozens of Palestinian archaeological sites in the occupied West Bank as “Israeli heritage sites” to grab Palestinians land and entrench its occupation.</p><p>The UN General Assembly in September 2024 passed a resolution asking Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian within a year. The resolution came after the International Court of Justice <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">ruled that Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories was unlawful.</a></p><p>Palestinian officials have rejected the Israeli characterisation.</p><p>“Heritage is not a weapon, but a bridge,” Adwan told Al Jazeera. “Trying to link heritage to security or calling it ‘terrorism’ is a deliberate distortion.”</p><p>She noted that the files were selected based on technical criteria to highlight Palestine’s religious and cultural diversity, including the “Miracles of Jesus” route and the Monasteries of the Jerusalem Wilderness (El-Bariyah).</p><p>“This reflects a rare cultural and religious pluralism that must be preserved for all of humanity,” Adwan added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"severing-un-ties\">Severing UN ties</h2><p>The row over heritage unfolds as Israel moves to cut ties with the United Nations system entirely.</p><p>On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar <a href=\"https://x.com/IsraelMFA/status/2011119369435205875\">announced</a> that Israel would “immediately sever all contact” with several UN bodies, including UN Women and the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, citing “anti-Israel bias”.</p><p>Last year Israel banned the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which is considered a lifeline for Palestinians in the occupied territories as well as in neighbouring countries hosting Palestinian refugees. More than 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed from their homeland leading up to the creation of Israel in 1948.</p><p>This follows a recent decision from the administration of US President Donald Trump to withdraw from UNESCO for a second time. The United States, Israel’s closest regional ally, has also cut funds to UNRWA.</p><p>Despite the hostile diplomatic climate, Adwan insisted the Palestinian bid is a “sovereign right”.</p><p>“It is not a race against time,” she said, referring to Israeli settlement expansion. “It is a strategic step to integrate these sites into protection plans before it is too late.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

US President Donald Trump is expected to announce the names of about 15 world leaders who will become members of the transitional body in the coming days.</p><p>Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh welcomed efforts to move ‌ahead with the Gaza plan and argued that institutions in Gaza should be linked to those run by the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank, “upholding the principle of one system, one law and one legitimate weapon”.</p><p>In a joint statement, the other mediators of the ceasefire deal – Egypt, Turkiye and Qatar – called the announcement an “important development aimed at consolidating stability and improving the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip”.</p><p>They welcomed the establishment of the Palestinian technocratic committee set to administer the Gaza Strip and said it would be led by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the PA.</p><p>The technocratic committee will be tasked with providing public services to the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza, but it faces towering challenges and unanswered questions, including about its operations and financing.</p><p>The United Nations has estimated that reconstruction will cost more than $50bn. The process is expected to take years, and little money has been pledged so far.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-announces-gaza-plan-s-second-phase\">US announces Gaza plan’s second phase</h2><p>The US on Wednesday said it was launching the second phase of its plan to ‍end the Gaza war.</p><p>Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said it “establishes a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza” and ​marks the beginning of “the full demilitarisation and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorised personnel”.</p><p>The first phase has been shaken by issues including <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/israeli-attack-on-gaza-tent-kills-at-least-three-palestinians\">Israeli air attacks</a> that have killed hundreds in Gaza, the failure to retrieve the remains of one last Israeli captive, and Israeli delays in <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/6/gaza-waits-as-reports-suggest-rafah-crossing-may-reopen\">reopening Gaza’s border crossing</a> with Egypt.</p><p>In phase two, the US and other mediators will need to tackle the disarmament of Hamas – which has refused to give up its arms while Israel occupies the territory – and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.</p><p>Witkoff said “the goal here is to create the alternative to Hamas that wants that peace, figure out how to empower them,” in a reference to the new committee of ‌Palestinian technocrats as a new “government” for Gaza.</p><p>“And obviously, now that we have this government, we will be engaging in conversations: With Hamas on the next phase, which is demilitarisation; with Israel, on what amnesty program can be given to Hamas if they do this.”</p><p>There was no mention from Witkoff in the initial statement about Israeli withdrawal or allowing critical humanitarian aid and critical supplies into Gaza, which faces both daily Israeli attacks and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/eight-dead-in-gaza-as-storm-brings-extreme-cold-collapses-buildings\">extreme weather</a>, with deaths from both.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Gaza City, said the Gaza deal has so far brought no change on the ground. “We’re still hearing the sound of drones [hovering above] and there have been a couple of explosions in the early morning hours, as demolitions take place across Gaza.”</p><p>While Witkoff claimed the first phase of the deal delivered “historic humanitarian aid” to the besieged enclave, Khoudary said there was “not a single day when 600 trucks of humanitarian aid entered the Gaza Strip”, in reference to the minimum quantity set by the US-brokered agreement.</p><p>“We see people losing their tents after every storm, and most of Gaza’s population is currently homeless,” she said. Most Palestinians in Gaza remain fully dependent on humanitarian aid, which Israel has further curtailed by suspending permits for more than <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/israel-says-it-will-halt-operations-of-several-ngos-in-gaza\">three dozen aid organisations</a> on January 1.</p><p>“There is limited humanitarian aid; what is coming in right now is not enough and definitely not historic,” Khoudary added.</p><h2 id=\"the-deal-is-rigged\">‘The deal is rigged’</h2><p>Witkoff also stressed that the US expects Hamas to fulfil its obligation to return the body of the last deceased Israeli captive, Ran Gvili. “Failure to do so will bring serious consequences,” he said.</p><p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly said he would not begin talks on the second phase of the ceasefire until Gvili is returned. Netanyahu on Wednesday said he had spoken with Gvili’s parents and assured them the “move to establish a technocratic committee will not affect the efforts to return Ran”.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s senior analyst Marwan Bishara said “while there is a ceasefire, the Israelis insist on the body of one and last captive.</p><p>“The deal is rigged; much of the so-called peace process or ceasefire sponsored by the US since 1991 has been rigged because the US is Israel’s ally,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, he ended 2025 on top of the ATP rankings after racking up wins at the end-of-year hard-court tournaments. The Australian Open is the only Grand Slam title to have eluded him, and top-seeded Alcaraz will be eager to set that record straight at the beginning of the new tennis season.</p><p><strong>Jannik Sinner:</strong> After losing the US Open final to Alcaraz, Sinner went on to win four of the five ATP tournaments he played, including the ATP Finals at home. The defending champion will be looking to complete a “three-peat” at the only Grand Slam he’s won more than once.</p><p><strong>Daniil Medvedev:</strong> The former US Open champion endured a topsy-turvy season in 2025. While he has not appeared in a Grand Slam final since the 2024 Australian Open, the Russian began the current season with a <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/11/medvedev-defeats-nakashima-to-win-brisbane-trophy-ahead-of-australian-open\">statement win</a> at the Brisbane International. Despite dropping out of the top 10, with his current ATP ranking of 12, Medvedev will be one of the dark horses in Melbourne.</p><p><strong>Aryna Sabalenka: </strong>Despite spending most of 2025 on top of the women’s rankings and entering three Grand Slam finals, Sabalenka was able to win only the US Open title to end her year on a high. The Belarusian has evolved her game from hard-court expertise to progress further on grass and clay. She will relish the opportunity to win her third Australian Open title after missing out last year. Sabalenka enters the tournament as the top seed, after winning the <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/11/aryna-sabalenka-wins-brisbane-title-ahead-of-australian-open\">Brisbane</a> title without dropping a set.</p><p><strong>Iga Swiatek: </strong>The unassuming Polish player has won the most women’s singles Grand Slam titles (6) among the current crop of top WTA players but she has yet to get her hands on an Australian Open trophy.

Currently ranked fourth in the world, the 24-year-old has shown the ability to knock out top seeds in major tournaments and will be one to watch in the women’s draw.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4241283\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4241283\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4241283\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-15T032600Z_1278526081_UP1EM1F09JA1L_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-AUSOPEN-1768456395.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C520&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tennis - Australian Open - Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Australia - January 15, 2026 Amanda Anisimova of the U.S. during practice REUTERS/Hollie Adams\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4241283\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amanda Anisimova played two Grand Slam finals in 2025 [Hollie Adams/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-the-top-seeds\">Who are the top seeds?</h2><p><strong>Men’s:</strong></p><ol>\n<li>Carlos Alcaraz (Spain)</li>\n<li>Jannik Sinner (Italy)</li>\n<li>Alexander Zverev (Germany)</li>\n<li>Novak Djokovic (Serbia)</li>\n<li>Lorenzo Musetti (Italy)</li>\n<li>Alex de Minaur (Australia)</li>\n<li>Felix Auger-Aliassime (Canada)</li>\n<li>Ben Shelton (USA)</li>\n<li>Taylor Fritz (USA)</li>\n<li>Alexander Bublik (Kazakhstan)</li>\n</ol><p><strong>Women’s:</strong></p><ol>\n<li>Aryna Sabalenka (Belarus)</li>\n<li>Iga Swiatek (Poland)</li>\n<li>Coco Gauff (USA)</li>\n<li>Amanda Anisimova (USA)</li>\n<li>Elena Rybakina (Kazakhstan)</li>\n<li>Jessica Pegula (USA)</li>\n<li>Jasmine Paolini (Italy)</li>\n<li>Mirra Andreeva (Russia)</li>\n<li>Madison Keys (USA)</li>\n<li>Belinda Bencic (Switzerland)</li>\n</ol><h2 id=\"can-there-be-sinner-vs-alcaraz-and-sabalenka-vs-gauff-finals\">Can there be Sinner vs Alcaraz, and Sabalenka vs Gauff finals?</h2><p>The top two seeds are placed in opposite halves of the men’s singles draw and can meet in the final, should they qualify.</p><p>Djokovic and Sinner are in the same half and will be on a collision course to meet in the semifinals, while Alcaraz could meet last year’s runner-up, Zverev, in his semifinal.</p><p>In the women’s draw, a final meeting between Sabalenka and Swiatek could materialise.

It was the first MBBS batch that the private college, founded by a Hindu religious charity and partly funded by the government, had launched.</p><p>Admissions to medical colleges across India, whether public or private, follow a centralised entrance examination, called the National Entrance Examination Test (NEET), conducted by the federal Ministry of Education’s National Testing Agency (NTA).</p><p>More than two million Indian students appear for NEET every year, hoping to secure one of approximately 120,000 MBBS seats. Aspirants usually prefer public colleges, where fees are lower but cutoffs for admission are high. Those who fail to meet the cutoff but meet a minimum NTA threshold join a private college.</p><p>Like Saniya Jan*, an 18-year-old resident of Kashmir’s Baramulla district, who recalls being overwhelmed with euphoria when she passed the NEET, making her eligible to study medicine. “It was a dream come true – to be a doctor,” Saniya told Al Jazeera.</p><p>When she joined a counselling session that determines which college a NEET qualifier joins, she chose SMVDMI since it was about 316km (196 miles) from her home – relatively close for students in Kashmir, who often otherwise have to travel much farther to go to college.</p><p>Saniya’s thrilled parents drove to Reasi to drop her off at the college when the academic session started in November. “My daughter has been a topper since childhood. I have three daughters, and she is the brightest. She really worked hard to get a medical seat,” Saniya’s father, Gazanfar Ahmad*, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>But things did not go as planned.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4241204\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4241204\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4241204\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25361341530018-1768455014.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters demanding revocation of the MBBS admission list of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4241204\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters of right-wing Hindu groups protesting against the governor of Indian-administered Kashmir, demanding that admissions to the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence be revoked, in Jammu on Saturday, December 27, 2025 [Channi Anand/ AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"no-business-being-there\">‘No business being there’</h2><p>As soon as local Hindu groups found out about the religious composition of the college’s inaugural batch in November, they launched demonstrations demanding that the admission of Muslim students be scrapped. They argued that since the college was chiefly funded from the offerings of devotees at Mata Vaishno Devi Temple, a prominent Hindu shrine in Kashmir, Muslim students had “no business being there”.</p><p>The agitations continued for weeks, with demonstrators amassing every day outside the iron gates of the college and raising slogans.</p><p>Meanwhile, legislators belonging to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – which has been accused of pursuing anti-Muslim policies since coming to power in 2014 – even wrote petitions to Kashmir’s lieutenant governor, urging him to reserve admissions in SMVDMI only for Hindu students. The lieutenant governor is the federally appointed administrator of the disputed region.</p><p>In the days that followed, their demands escalated to seeking the closure of the college itself.</p><p>As the protests intensified, the National Medical Commission on January 6 announced that it had rescinded the college’s authorisation because it had failed to “meet the minimum standard requirements” specified by the government for medical education. The NMC claimed the college suffered from critical deficiencies in its teaching faculty, bed occupancy, patient flow in outpatient departments, libraries and operating theatres. The next day, a “letter of permission”, which authorised the college to function and run courses, was withdrawn.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4241306\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4241306\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4241306\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP19163366932008-1768457029.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Hindu pilgrims on their way to the Vaishno Devi shrine rest under a shade and wait for transport outside a railway station on a hot day in Jammu, India, Wednesday, June 12, 2019.

Some of them only have one cadaver per batch, while this college has four of them. Every student got an opportunity to dissect that cadaver individually.”</p><p>Rafiq, a student who only gave his second name, said that he had cousins in sought-after government medical colleges in Srinagar, the biggest city in Indian-administered Kashmir. “Even they don’t have the kind of facilities that we had here,” he said.</p><p>Saniya’s father, Ahmad, also told Al Jazeera that when he dropped her off at the college, “everything seemed normal”.</p><p>“The college was good. The faculty was supportive. It looked like no one cared about religion inside the campus,” he said.</p><p>Zafar Choudhary, a political analyst based in Jammu, questioned how the medical regulatory body had sanctioned the college’s authorisation if there was an infrastructural deficit. “Logic dictates that their infrastructure would have only improved since the classes started. So we don’t know how these deficiencies arose all of a sudden,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Choudhary said the demand of the Hindu groups was “absurd” given that selections into medical colleges in India are based on religion-neutral terms. “There is a system in place that determines it. A student is supposed to give preference, and a lot of parameters are factored in before the admission lists are announced. When students are asked for their choices, they give multiple selections rather than one. So how is it their fault?” he asked.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to SMVDMI’s executive head, Yashpal Sharma, via telephone for comments. He did not respond to calls or text messages. The college has issued no public statement since the revocation of its authorisation to offer medical courses.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4241194\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4241194\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4241194\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25361341583290-1768454760.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters demanding revocation of the MBBS admission list of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4241194\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters of right-wing Hindu groups shout slogans demanding the revocation of admissions at the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence in Jammu on Saturday, December 27, 2025 [Channi Anand/ AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"they-turned-merit-into-religion\">‘They turned merit into religion’</h2><p>Meanwhile, students at SMVDMI have packed their belongings and returned home.</p><p>Salim Manzoor*, another student, pointed out that Indian-administered Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region, also had a medical college where Hindu candidates are enrolled under a quota reserved for them and other communities that represent a minority in the region.</p><p>The BJP insists it never claimed that Muslim students were unwelcome at SMVDMI, but encouraged people to recognise the “legitimate sentiments” that millions of Hindu devotees felt towards the temple trust that founded it. “This college is named after Mata Vaishno Devi, and there are millions of devotees whose religious emotions are strongly attached to this shrine,” BJP’s spokesman in Kashmir, Altaf Thakur, told Al Jazeera. “The college recognition was withdrawn because NMC found several shortcomings. There’s no question of the issue being about Hindus and Muslims.”</p><p>Last week, Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir, announced that SMVDMI students would not be made to “suffer due to NMC’s decision” and they would be offered admissions in other colleges in the region. “These children cleared the National Entrance Examination Test, and it is our legal responsibility to adjust them. We will have supernumerary seats, so their education is not affected. It is not difficult for us to adjust all 50 students, and we will do it,” he said.</p><p>Abdullah condemned the BJP and its allied Hindu groups for their campaign against Muslims joining the college. “People generally fight for having a medical college in their midst. But here, the fight was put up to have the medical college shut. You have played with the future of the medical students of [Kashmir]. If ruining the future of students brings you happiness, then celebrate it.”</p><p>Tanvir Sadiq, a regional legislator belonging to Abdullah’s National Conference party, said that the university that the medical college is part of received more than $13m in government aid since 2017 – making all Kashmiris, and not donors to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine – stakeholders. “This means that anyone who is lawfully domiciled in [Indian-administered Kashmir] can go and study there. In a few decades, the college would have churned out thousands of fresh medical graduates. If a lot of them are Muslims today, tomorrow they would have been Hindus as well,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Nasir Khuehami, who heads the Jammu and Kashmir Students’ Association, told Al Jazeera the Hindu versus Muslim narrative threatened to “communalise” the region’s education sector. “The narrative that because the college is run by one particular community, only students from that community alone will study there, is dangerous,” he said.</p><p>He pointed out that Muslim-run universities, not just in Kashmir but across India, that were recognised as minority institutions did not “have an official policy of excluding Hindus”.</p><p>Back at her home in Baramulla, Saniya is worried about her future. “I appeared for a competitive exam, which is one of the hardest in India, and was able to get a seat at a medical college,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Now everything seems to have crashed. I came back home waiting for what decision the government will take for our future. All this happened because of our identity. They turned our merit into religion.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The USMCA has allowed Canadian and Mexican goods that are covered under the agreement to enter the US tariff-free.</p><p>In Canada’s case, that means about 86 percent of US imports from Canada and Mexico are compliant, making the effective tariff rate on Canadian goods about 6 percent, Tony Stillo, director of Canada Economics at Oxford Economics, said in a note on Wednesday.</p><p>While Canada clearly would benefit from USMCA continuing, Trump, as recently as Tuesday, said the trade agreement was “<a href=\"/economy/2026/1/13/trump-says-trade-agreement-with-mexico-canada-irrelevant-to-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">irrelevant</a>” to the US.</p><p>But if an agreement to extend or modify the USMCA is not reached, it will enter a period of mandatory annual reviews until 2036, after which it would expire, resulting in a “prolonged period of trade policy uncertainty”, Stillo said.</p><p>“If the North American trade agreement eventually disintegrates, the three parties could return to bilateral trade agreements to maintain market access to one another, but this would impose costs on North American trade and investments.”</p><h2 id=\"political-and-narrative-win\">‘Political and narrative win’</h2><p>While Carney is keenly aware of the stakes, the visit holds significance for China, too.</p><p>Beijing is not only on the lookout for new export markets and the removal of trade restrictions, such as the electric vehicle tariff, but a “political and narrative win” as well, Nadjibulla said.</p><p>China has often criticised Canada for following the US too closely and will portray Carney’s visit, and any policy changes that may follow, as Ottawa “trying to correct mistakes of the past,” she said.</p><p>Beijing’s ultimate hope would be compliance from Canada on sensitive issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p><p>Earlier this week, two Canadian MPs from Carney’s Liberal Party wrapped up a visit to self-governing Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory, ahead of schedule on the advice of the government.</p><p>The lawmakers cited the need to avoid “confusion” in Canada’s foreign policy ahead of Carney’s visit.</p><p>Nadjibulla said it was a “worrying” development, adding that Canada would face a “very difficult balancing act” with China.</p></div></div></body></html>"

With unanimous support from Democrats, the measure advanced with 52 votes in favour, 47 against.</p><p>But supporters of the resolution could only afford to lose one vote in order to secure the bill’s passage. By Wednesday, it had lost two: both Young and Hawley.</p><p>The final vote was evenly split, 50 to 50, allowing Vance to act as tie-breaker and defeat the resolution.</p><p>Hawley signalled early in the day that he had decided to withdraw his support. But Young was a wild card until shortly before the final vote took place.</p><p>“After numerous conversations with senior national security officials, I have received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela,” Young <a href=\"https://x.com/SenToddYoung/status/2011577116354363505\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>“I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force.”</p><p>Young also shared a letter, dated Wednesday, from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, offering lukewarm assurances that Congress would be notified ahead of any future military action in Venezuela.</p><p>“Should the President determine that he needs to introduce US Armed Forces into hostilities in major military operation in Venezuela, he would seek congressional authorizations in advance (circumstances permitting),” Rubio wrote.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4240994\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4240994\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4240994\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25180456466825-1768441223.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Josh Hawley\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4240994\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Josh Hawley signalled early on Wednesday that he would not vote to pass the war powers resolution in the Senate [File: J Scott Applewhite/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"legal-questions-about-the-venezuela-attack\">Legal questions about the Venezuela attack</h2><p>The latest war powers resolution arrived in response to a surprise announcement on January 3 that Trump had launched military action to topple Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Explosions were reported in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and nearby military bases, and Trump appeared in a broadcast hours later to announce that the US had abducted Maduro and transported him to the US to face criminal trial.</p><p>Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, was also captured as part of the operation.</p><p>Two US service members were injured in the attack, and as many as 80 people in Venezuela were killed, including Cuban security personnel involved in guarding Maduro.</p><p>“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said in his speech announcing the attack.</p><p>He and Rubio then fielded questions about whether Congress had been notified about the operation. They acknowledged they did not notify lawmakers in advance.</p><p>“This was not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on,” Rubio said. “It was a trigger-based mission.”</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, argued that congressional notification had been a liability to the mission’s security. “Congress will leak, and we don’t want leakers,” he said.</p><p>Normally, the US Constitution divides up military authority between the legislative and executive branches. While the president is considered the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, only Congress has the power to declare war and authorise military action.</p><p>But that division of power has become gradually eroded, as the executive branch has exercised greater authority over the military.</p><p>In recent decades, presidents have often justified unilateral military action by referring to authorisations of military force (AUMFs) approved by Congress in the wake of the attacks on September 11, 2001.</p><p>But military action in Venezuela falls outside of the purview of those authorisations, raising questions about the legal justification for the January attack.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Department of Justice published a 22-page <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/olc/media/1423306/dl?inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">memo</a> it originally wrote in December to justify the forthcoming attack. That memo argued that, since Maduro’s abduction was an act of “law enforcement”, it fell short of the legal threshold that would have required congressional approval.</p><p>In addition, the document asserted that, since the planned military operation was not expected to trigger a war, it also landed outside of Congress’s powers.</p><p>“The law does not permit the President to order troops into Venezuela without congressional authorization if he knows it will result in a war,” the memo explained. “As of December 22, 2025, we have not received facts indicating it will.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4241007\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4241007\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4241007\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25073623220045-1768441551.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Todd Young\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4241007\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Senator Todd Young said he had received assurances from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the executive branch would communicate to Congress about further military actions [File: Ben Curtis/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-republican-breakaway\">A Republican breakaway</h2><p>But not every Republican agreed with that explanation, and several sought to claw back Congress’s power to oversee US military action.</p><p>They included senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine, all seen as pivotal swing votes in Congress’s upper chamber.</p><p>Young and Hawley joined the three rogue Republicans for an initial vote to advance the war powers resolution on January 8. But afterwards, all five came under acute pressure to switch sides and rejoin the Republican caucus for the final vote.</p><p>President Trump, in particular, denounced the five Republicans on his social media platform Truth Social.</p><p>“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” he wrote in a <a href=\"http://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115860738010214901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>“This Vote greatly hampers American Self Defense and National Security, impeding the President’s Authority as Commander in Chief.”</p><p>Reports emerged that Trump even called some of the senators in advance of Wednesday’s vote, in an effort to gain their support. But the publication The Hill indicated that Trump’s conversation with Collins devolved into a “profanity-laced rant”.</p><p>Paul, another Republican who has courted Trump’s ire, was among the senators to speak before Wednesday’s final vote.</p><p>He defended his decision to back the war powers resolution, calling his vote a necessary act to uphold the Constitution’s separation of powers.</p><p>“This isn’t really and shouldn’t be Republican versus Democrat. This should be legislative prerogative versus presidential prerogative, and it should be about the Constitution,” Paul said.</p><p>“The Constitution — specifically, thoughtfully — vested the power of initiating war and declaring war to Congress,” he added.</p><p>“The spectrum of our founding fathers concluded they didn’t want the president to have this power.”</p><p>Risking Trump’s ire comes at a higher cost for some Republicans than others. Of the three Republicans who joined Democrats on Wednesday to vote for the war powers resolution, only one is up for re-election this year in the US midterm races: Collins.</p></div></div></body></html>"

he’s been briefed by his national security council, but these statements we’ve just heard do indicate a potential cooling down of the situation and President Trump backing away from the precipice of imminent action, which he has been threatening,” he said.</p><p>Sina Toossi, a senior non-resident fellow at the Center for International Policy, told Al Jazeera that Trump’s claim that he had received information indicating killings in Iran had stopped appears, on the surface, to be a “face-saving way” to avoid military intervention, though it does not entirely rule out such a conflict.</p><p>“It’s hard to take what Trump says seriously, but we do know that he’s had an aversion to getting sucked into big, open-ended military conflicts, and with Iran, that risk was on the table,” Toossi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This remark today suggests he’s looking for a face-saving way out, but I wouldn’t take it as 100 percent ruling that out,” he said, adding that Trump has a track record of negotiating with Iran while simultaneously threatening military action.</p><p>Trump has threatened Iran with military strikes in the past as a means of pressuring Tehran into greater alignment with US demands, and has said during the last week that a harsh response by Iranian authorities to the country’s protesters could result in US attacks.</p><p>Barbara Slavin, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that Trump is “probably torn” when it comes to deciding what action to take against Iran.</p><p>She said that while the US president would like “another quick victory, I don’t think he wants to be involved in a protracted conflict in the Middle East that goes against all his instincts”.</p><p>She added that she expects Trump to carry out limited strikes that enable him to claim he fulfilled his pledge to “help” the Iranian people, without triggering “a wider escalation”.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, Britain and the US withdrew some personnel from the airbase in Qatar – Al Udeid Air Base, which hosts US troops and other international forces – after a senior Iranian official said Tehran had warned neighbours it would hit US bases if Washington strikes.</p><p>A number of countries have also issued advisories for protecting their citizens in the region amid fears of a wider regional escalation.</p><p>US media outlet NewsNation on Wednesday reported that the Pentagon had begun moving an aircraft carrier strike group from the South China Sea towards the Middle East.</p><p>The US has not announced any such movement, and Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the report.</p><h2 id=\"iran-ready-to-respond\">Iran ready to respond</h2><p>Iran has said it is prepared to retaliate in the event of any US intervention.</p><p>The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohammad Pakpour, has said that Iran is ready to respond “decisively” to its foes, Israel and the US, which he accused of being behind the protests sweeping the country.</p><p>IRGC is at “the height of readiness to respond decisively to the miscalculation of the enemy”, said Pakpour in a written statement quoted by state television.</p><p>Pakpour went on to accuse Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the “murderers of the youth of Iran”.</p><p>Araghchi told Fox News that his government was in full control after a deadly crackdown on protests that had spread across the country since January 8.</p><p>“After three days of terrorist operation, now there is a calm. We are in full control,” Araghchi said.</p><p>Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi said that people in the city and across the country are anxious because they have psychologically felt the shadow of war since the 12-day conflict with the US and Israel in June.</p><p>“Many people feel it, and it is creating anxiety about a possible new round of escalation, which would tangibly impact people’s everyday lives,” he said.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/are-irans-protests-different-this-time-around\">The protests started in December</a> when shopkeepers took to the streets to protest against a fall in the value of the local currency and the soaring cost of living, and quickly escalated into widespread antigovernment demonstrations.</p><p>Iranian state television has acknowledged reports of a high death toll during the nationwide protests, quoting the head of the Martyrs Foundation as saying “armed and terrorist groups” are to blame.</p><p>More than 100 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of unrest, according to Iranian state media, while opposition activists say the death toll is higher and includes thousands of protesters.</p><p>The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has said that it has confirmed the deaths of more than 2,400 protesters, and more than 150 security personnel and government supporters.</p><p>Al Jazeera has not been able to independently verify the figures.</p><p>Iran is currently in the midst of a near-total telecommunications blackout, with monitor NetBlocks reporting on Wednesday that the shutdown had surpassed 144 hours.</p><p>Rights group Amnesty International said on Wednesday it reviewed evidence showing “mass unlawful killings committed on an unprecedented scale” in Iran over the past week, including against “mostly peaceful protesters and bystanders”.</p><p>“The evidence gathered by Amnesty International points to a coordinated nationwide escalation in the security forces’ unlawful use of lethal force against mostly peaceful protesters and bystanders since the evening of 8 January,” Amnesty said in a press release.</p><p>Verified audiovisual evidence depicted severe and fatal injuries, including gunshot wounds to the head and eyes, and security forces chasing and directly firing at fleeing protesters, the rights group said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
