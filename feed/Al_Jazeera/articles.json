Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the move – coupled with the Trump administration’s comments – raises questions over the integrity of any conclusions reached.</p><p>On Tuesday, the UN Human Rights Council also called for a “prompt, independent and transparent” investigation into the incident.</p><p>Prior to Good’s killing, the Trump administration had surged immigration agents to Minnesota as the president increasingly focused on alleged fraud in the large Somali-American community in the state, at times employing <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/from-mogadishu-to-minneapolis-somalis-reject-trumps-bigoted-remarks\">racist rhetoric</a> as he sent 2,000 immigration agents to the area.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it was revoking so-called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somalia, a special designation that protects individuals from deportation due to unsafe conditions in their home country.</p><p>In a statement on X, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said the move means Somalis who had been on TPS are required to leave the country by March 27.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For Morocco, the pressure is even heavier – to win the trophy in front of their own fans, 50 years after their last continental triumph.</p><p>Questions had lingered over whether the Atlas Lions could shoulder that burden, but they remain firmly on course.

There’s no organised, viable opposition inside Iran that can take over immediately. So the more likely scenario is that more repressive elements within the Revolutionary Guard will take over.

There are reports that China was considering even increasing its purchase of Iranian oil in the light of the turbulence now in Venezuela,” she said.</p><p>The new tariff, the Al Jazeera correspondent said, “is really going to hurt Chinese manufacturers” because it will apply on top of the 35 percent tariff that Chinese goods already face in the US.</p><p>The potential new tariff comes months after the US and China announced a trade truce, bringing down China’s tariff from more than 100 to 35 percent following a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Trump in October on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.</p><p>The Al Jazeera correspondent said the new tariff threat “not only could jeopardise the current stability that we have between Beijing and Washington, it will also jeopardise Trump’s planned trip to Beijing in April this year”.</p><p>The Chinese embassy in Washington condemned Trump’s policy, warning that Beijing would take “all necessary measures” to defend its interests and rejecting what it called “illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction”.</p><p>“China’s stance against the arbitrary use of tariffs has been consistent and clear. No one wins in tariff or trade wars, and coercion and pressure are not a solution,” an embassy spokesperson said on X.</p><p>Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning said, “There are no winners in a trade war.”</p><p>“China will resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Mao told reporters on Tuesday.</p><p>Stressing that China wants peace in the Middle East, Mao said Beijing supports Iran to “maintain national stability” and “oppose[s] interfering in the country’s internal affairs and the use, or threat of use, of force in international affairs”.</p><h3>Turkiye</h3><p>According to the UN Comtrade data from 2024, Turkiye was Iran’s second largest trading partner. The trade between the two countries was worth about $5.7bn.</p><p>Turkiye faces a baseline tariff from the US of 15 percent. Since June, the US has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminium from most of its trading partners, including Turkiye, raising them from 25 to 50 percent.</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>Pakistan is a top export destination for Iran, where the total value of exports was about $1.2bn in 2024.</p><p>Pakistani exports to the US face a 19 percent tariff at the moment.</p><h3>India</h3><p>India is a top export destination for Iran, where the total value of exports was just over $1.05bn in 2024.</p><p>India faces 50 percent US duties on its steel and aluminium. A range of other Indian exports also faces a <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/27/trumps-india-tariffs-take-effect-which-sector-will-be-hit-whats-exempt\">50 percent</a> tariff from the US.</p><p>Last week, media reports said the Trump administration is planning to slap 500 percent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-impacted-iran-s-exports\">How have sanctions impacted Iran’s exports?</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The US has imposed sanctions to cut off funding for Tehran’s nuclear ‌programme. Washington accuses Iran of planning to make a nuclear bomb. But Iran has insisted that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only and has allowed inspections by the global nuclear watchdog.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">But after the US bombed a nuclear plant during Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in June, Tehran imposed restrictions on the nuclear inspections. Talks to break the logjam have stalled as Tehran has accused the US of imposing conditions.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Fuel is Iran’s biggest export item by value while major imports include intermediate goods, vegetables, machinery and equipment.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Iran exported products to 147 trading partners in 2022, ⁠according to the most recent data from the World Bank.</p><p>Most of the sanctions on Iran were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal under US President Barack Obama, but three years later, Trump withdrew the US from the deal, which had put limits on Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.</p><p>He also imposed additional sanctions targeting petrochemicals, metals (steel, aluminium and copper) and senior Iranian officials as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The reimposition of US sanctions since 2018 has squeezed oil exports and access to global finance. Iran’s oil exports fell by about 60 to 80 percent, stripping the government of tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue.</p><p>The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita fell from more than $8,000 in 2012 to just over $6,000 by 2017 and a little above $5,000 in 2024, according to World Bank data.</p><p>Iran was exporting about 2.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (bpd) in 2011. Those exports fell sharply after 2018 to an all-time low of just over 400,000bpd in 2020. Exports have gradually risen to about 1.5 million bpd in 2025 but still remain below their pre‑2018 levels.</p><p>Foreign trade has brought billions of dollars to Iran’s economy.</p><p>The country’s exports were worth about $22.9bn in 2024, according to UN Comtrade data, about 5 percent of the country’s total GDP in 2024 of about $475.3bn, according to World Bank data.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Iran is living through one of the most dangerous moments in its post-revolutionary history. Nationwide protests have become sustained rather than episodic. As a new wave of unrest has spread across the country, violence has intensified. The true death toll cannot be verified yet.</p><p>These events have revived a familiar question: Is Iran heading towards another 1979?</p><p>The temptation to rely on this analogy is understandable. Images of mass mobilisation and rapidly recurring protests evoke memories of the final months of the shah’s rule. Yet the comparison is ultimately misleading.</p><p>The success of the 1979 revolution cannot be explained solely by mass mobilisation. Instead, it was the convergence of coordinated opposition under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and, more decisively, the ruling elites’ inability to effectively repress dissent that ensured its triumph.</p><p>Mohammad Reza Shah had cancer, was heavily medicated and was visibly indecisive. His leadership faltered during crises. He left the country twice amid political upheaval, first in 1953 after being challenged by Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and again in January 1979 as protests spread nationwide.</p><p>Equally important, the shah’s repressive apparatus was fragmented and socially heterogeneous. Apart from SAVAK, the shah’s central intelligence organisation, the police and gendarmerie were tasked with maintaining social order while the Iranian army focused on territorial defence rather than political repression.</p><p>These institutions lacked systematic ideological vetting and drew personnel from diverse social and ideological backgrounds. When the shah left the country, some segments of the police stopped their repressive tactics and cooperated with protesters to maintain public order while senior military commanders hesitated, prioritised self-preservation and ultimately abandoned the monarchy.</p><p>The situation today is fundamentally different. Unlike the shah, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s leadership is not marked by hesitation or indecision during crises.</p><p>Since assuming the position of supreme leader in 1989, Khamenei has overseen a profound transformation of the Islamic Republic into what I describe as a theocratic security state that relies more on repression rather than societal consent. As the supreme leader, he presides over a highly institutionalised, cohesive, ideologically committed and deeply invested coercive apparatus. This structural reality, rather than popular sentiment alone, defines the limits of revolutionary change in Iran today.</p><p>The Islamic Republic’s coercive power is not concentrated in a single institution. Instead, it is distributed across overlapping organisations with redundant chains of command. These forces are concentrated within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij, the police, the intelligence services and the social networks attached to them.</p><p>Iran’s coercive institutions are dominated by the regime’s hardcore supporters. Their loyalty is not merely transactional. It is ideological, institutional and generational. Ideological vetting and patronage ensure that their loyalty is not only enforced but actively cultivated.</p><p>Their social mobility, economic security and sense of identity are tied to the survival of the regime and Khamenei’s leadership. For them, regime collapse is not a political transition; it is an existential threat. In moments of crisis, these loyalists act preemptively to prevent the diffusion of protest and frame unrest as foreign-backed sedition, lowering internal barriers to violence.</p><p>Consequently, even protests that are larger and more widespread geographically than those in 1979 would not fundamentally challenge the regime. Instead, they would lead to stricter repression. This highlights a key lesson: Protests by themselves do not cause revolutions.</p><p>Revolutions occur when mass unrest intersects with elite paralysis or defection. That happened in 1979, but it has not happened now.</p><p>What could alter this equilibrium is not protest alone but a direct shock to the regime’s leadership structure. External intervention, particularly by the United States, would likely aim to disrupt elite coordination by targeting senior political and security figures with strikes.</p><p>Such an approach would only generate a genuine regime crisis if it removed Khamenei himself. Power in the Islamic Republic has been heavily centralised within the office of the supreme leader and his inner circle. His sudden absence could trigger elite confrontation over succession and weaken cohesion at the top.</p><p>But intervention could also reinforce loyalist unity. If Khamenei survived, core supporters within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij and the intelligence services would almost certainly close ranks, as they have done during previous external confrontations. Under those conditions, elite defection would remain unlikely.</p><p>Even in the event of regime collapse, Iran would not face the institutional vacuum seen in some post-intervention states. The country’s modern bureaucracy, which has maintained continuity since the early 20th century, would likely continue functioning in the short term. Administrative breakdown would be constrained by state capacity, social organisation and national identity.</p><p>Some warn that the fall of the Islamic Republic would inevitably lead to a prolonged insurgency. That risk cannot be dismissed. However, unlike the cases of Iraq or Afghanistan, in Iran, there would not be external state actors willing and able to finance, organise and sustain armed radical movements. Iranian society has also shown deep resistance to religious extremism and political radicalism. It is possible that instability following a regime collapse could be contained.</p><p>The real danger, then, is not that Iran is on the verge of repeating 1979 but that persistent reliance on that analogy blinds policymakers to how the Islamic Republic functions today. Misreading the nature of power in Iran does not increase the chances of peaceful change. It increases the likelihood that Iranians themselves will bear the cost of repression, escalation and prolonged uncertainty.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In the eyes of the all-powerful Perez, missing out on silverware and that, too, against Barca was too big a mistake to let slip.</p><p>“Losing to Barcelona in a big final remains, it seems, a capital offence,” Hunter said.</p><p>Add to this a patchy run, by Real Madrid’s standards, in La Liga, including a 5-2 thrashing in the Madrid derby, draws against three lower-ranked teams, and a home loss to Celta Vigo.</p><p>Trouble had been brewing for Alonso over the past few months, with a UEFA Champions League defeat at Liverpool setting off a run of only two victories in eight games.</p><p>This slump affected Madrid’s standing on top of the La Liga table, turning their five-point lead over Barcelona into a four-point deficit.</p><p>Real Madrid’s results did improve more recently, but performances did not convince the management. The team beat Atletico Madrid in the Super Cup semifinal despite being outplayed, only to lose in the final.</p><p>“When Real Madrid dropped points against Rayo Vallecano, Elche and Girona, and then lost at home to Celta and Manchester City, there was a massive manhunt mounted by the club and by the media to find someone to blame,” Hunter explained.</p><p>“The coach, correctly or not, was found guilty.”</p><p>In addition to the results, the fact that Alonso very publicly fell out with star forward Vinicius Junior didn’t help his case.</p><p>All of these factors combined to seal the fate of the football manager.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4235759\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4235759\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4235759\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-11T193355Z_1309911149_UP1EM1B1ICIFB_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-SPAIN-BAR-RMA-1768310892.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soccer Football - Spanish Super Cup - Final - FC Barcelona v Real Madrid - King Abdullah Sports City Stadium, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia - January 11, 2026 Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso gives instructions to the players during a break in play REUTERS/Vincent West\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4235759\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Xabi Alonso was in charge when Real Madrid lost the Spanish Super Cup to Barcelona [Vincent West/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-did-alonso-perform-as-real-madrid-manager\">How did Alonso perform as Real Madrid manager?</h2><p>The former midfielder was welcomed amid fanfare at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in May 2025 after signing a contract to stay until 2028.</p><p>Regarded as a modern strategist, he came with an impressive pedigree, having steered German football giants Bayer Leverkusen to their first Bundesliga victory, a German Cup triumph, and a UEFA Europa League final appearance.</p><p>Alosno’s first real test was the FIFA Club World Cup, where Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinal in July.  Despite Alonso’s insistence that he would not implement his coaching style until the beginning of the new (2025-26) La Liga season, it was a clear sign of the vast difference between the club he had previously coached and the Spanish giants.</p><p>During the summer, Alonso’s signing targets never materialised, with Martin Zubimendi choosing Arsenal over Real Madrid.</p><p>When the La Liga season began, Alonso started off well with a series of victories, including a 2-1 Clasico victory over Barcelona in October. But soon, a rot started to set in and resulted in defeats to Celta Vigo and Manchester City.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-alonso-vs-vinicius-junior-saga\">What was the Alonso vs Vinicius Junior saga?</h2><p>The row began during the El Clasico win when Vinicius Junior stormed off the pitch after being substituted by the manager in the 71st minute. The striker issued an apology later, but it was not directed towards Alonso.</p><p>Spain-based football expert Hunter believes the coach was not backed up by the club’s management in the aftermath of the row as they saw the Brazilian as a prized possession.</p><p>Club president Perez, in particular, has been keen to retain Vinicius on the club’s books.</p><p>“Damage was done to Alonso’s public reputation and club credibility during the Vinicius Junior saga as the player erupted in petulant anger while showing complete disrespect for his manager,” Hunter said.</p><p>“He [Vinicius Junior ] said he wanted to leave the club. Perez wanted Vinicius Junior to renew his contract.

The USA stands ready to help!!!” He has since echoed those sentiments in other public statements.</p><p>But ignored in his claims of wanting to help Iranians is a fact: decades of US-led sanctions against Iran, including ones that were toughened under Trump, have played a central role in the country’s economic crises that were the primary trigger for the current spate of protests.</p><p>We unpack the impact of US sanctions on Iran and whether its track record in the country has been one of helping people.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-going-on-in-iran\">What is going on in Iran?</h2><p>The protests in Iran started from Tehran’s Grand Bazaar on December 28, 2025, after the rial plunged to a record low against the US dollar. Shopkeepers shuttered their businesses to rally against rising prices in Iran.</p><p>The protests have since spread to other provinces and have snowballed into a broader challenge to the country’s leadership.</p><p>On Monday, the rial was trading at more than 1.4 million to the US dollar, a sharp decline from about 700,000 in January 2025 and approximately 900,000 in mid-2025.</p><p>The plummeting currency has triggered steep inflation, with food prices 72 percent higher than last year on average.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-us-sanctions-against-iran\">What are the US sanctions against Iran?</h2><p id=\"the-us-first-imposed-sanctions-on-iran-in-november-1979-in-response-to-the-iran-hostage-crisis\">Iran is one of the <a href=\"/economy/2012/10/17/timeline-sanctions-on-iran\">most heavily sanctioned</a> countries in the world.</p><p>In 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran after 14 years of exile in Iraq and France. Following a referendum, Iran was declared an Islamic republic.</p><p>The US first imposed sanctions on Iran in November 1979, after Iranian students stormed its embassy in Tehran and took Americans hostage.</p><p>The 1979 Islamic revolution overthrew the shah, or monarch, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose forces notoriously used repression and torture to keep him in power, without a democratic mandate.</p><p>The US, which backed Pahlavi, had also helped topple Iran’s democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, in 1953 in a coup supported by US and British intelligence agencies.</p><p>Also in 1979, Washington halted oil imports from Iran and froze $12bn in Iranian assets. Iranian products were banned from import into the US apart from small gifts, informational material, foodstuffs and some carpets.</p><p>In 1995, then-President Bill Clinton issued executive orders preventing US companies from investing in Iranian oil and gas and trading with Iran. He banned US trade with Iran and investment in the country. A year later, the US Congress passed a law requiring that the US government impose sanctions on foreign firms investing more than $20m a year in Iran’s energy sector.</p><p>In December 2006, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Iran’s trade in nuclear-energy-related materials and technology and froze the assets of individuals and companies involved in activities pertaining to it.</p><p>The sanctions were mainly an effort to curtail Iran’s growing nuclear capacity, but while programmes to enrich uranium were stopped in 2002, they restarted in late 2005. In subsequent years, the UN toughened the sanctions and imposed more sanctions on Iran. The European Union also followed suit.</p><p>In 2015, Iran signed a nuclear deal – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – with the US, EU, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom.</p><p>The deal banned uranium enrichment at Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility and allowed only peaceful development of nuclear technology for energy production in return for the complete lifting of sanctions.</p><p>Iran agreed to refrain from any uranium enrichment and research into it at Fordow for 15 years. It also agreed not to keep any nuclear material there but instead to “convert the Fordow facility into a nuclear, physics and technology centre”.</p><p>However, in 2018, during his first term, Trump announced the US withdrawal from the nuclear treaty and reimposed all sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the treaty.</p><p>In 2019, the Trump administration designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Additionally, he imposed sanctions targeting petrochemicals, metals (steel, aluminium, copper) and senior Iranian officials. The intensifying sanctions were part of Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran.</p><p>On January 3, 2020, the US assassinated Qassem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC’s elite Quds Force, in a drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq. The US also imposed additional sanctions on Iran.</p><p>The Biden administration, in power from 2021 to 2025, kept in place most US sanctions against Iran.</p><p>In September 2025, the UN sanctions were reimposed on Iran over its nuclear programme when the UNSC <a href=\"/news/2025/9/19/un-security-council-rejects-resolution-to-extend-iran-sanctions-relief\">voted against</a> permanently lifting economic sanctions on Iran.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-these-sanctions-impacted-iran\">How have these sanctions impacted Iran?</h2><p><strong>Incomes: </strong>Iran’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita fell from more than $8,000 in 2012 to about $6,000 by 2017, and to a little above $5,000 in 2024, according to World Bank data.</p><p>The sharpest declines coincided with the reimposition and tightening of US sanctions under Trump’s campaign from 2018 onwards, which squeezed oil exports and access to global finance.</p><p><strong>Oil exports and revenue:</strong> Iran’s oil exports fell by 60-80 percent after US sanctions were reimposed, stripping the government of tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue.</p><p>Iran was exporting about 2.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) of crude oil in 2011. The exports fell sharply after 2018, to an all-time low of just more than 400,000bpd in 2020.</p><p>Exports have gradually risen to about 1.5mbpd in 2025, but remain below their pre‑2018 levels.</p><p><strong>Currency crash:</strong> The Iranian rial has collapsed in value. In the mid‑2010s, a dollar bought only a few tens of thousands of rials on the open market. However, by 2025, it bought several hundred thousand. Now, it can buy more than 1 million rials.</p><p>A devalued currency can help a country in promoting its exports, but sanctions have long blocked a bulk of Iran’s exports. Meanwhile, the currency crisis has made imports costlier, contributed to increased inflation, and reduced investor confidence.</p><p>The sanctions have also crippled Iran’s access to dollars from financial markets, making it harder for it to participate in international trade.</p><p><strong>Aviation: </strong>One of the most visible victims of the sanctions on Iran has been <a href=\"/news/2024/5/20/helicopter-crash-kills-raisi-are-sanctions-behind-irans-aviation-crisis\">its aviation sector</a>. After the initial sanctions in 1979, the government was unable to import new planes. Iran suffered from a spike in deadly aircraft accidents through the 1980s, 90s and the early 2000s.</p><p>Between 1979 and 2023, plane crashes killed more than 2,000 people in the country, according to the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives (B3A).</p><p><strong>Corruption:</strong> The sanctions on Iran spurred a “sanctions economy”, or the particular way its elite have profited from them and reshaped the country’s economy around sanctions.</p><p>Sanctions create opportunities for corruption, forcing trade and finance into grey and black channels. For instance, oil has to be sold through intermediaries, such as front companies or shadow fleets. Imports and exports pass through informal channels. Public information about trade deals is sparse.</p><p>“Sanctions have certainly had a grave impact, but I believe it’s the way the corrupt elite have benefitted from them that has hurt ordinary people most,” Maryam Alemzadeh, an associate professor in history and politics of Iran at the University of Oxford, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They have created new opportunities for corruption and given rise to – sometimes nameless and faceless – moguls that have swallowed the country’s economy.”</p><h2 id=\"how-does-this-impact-people\">How does this impact people?</h2><p>Iran’s middle class – common people – have paid the highest price, say experts.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268025001090?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research</a> paper published last year, Mohammad Reza Farzanegan, an economist at Germany’s Marburg University, and Nader Habibi, an economist at Brandeis University, built a “virtual Iran” using data from similar countries to illustrate the impact of the sanctions between 2012 and 2019.</p><p>They found that starting in 2012, Iran’s middle class began to shrink dramatically.</p><p>During the period, the sanctions caused an average <a href=\"/opinions/2025/9/28/sanctions-on-iran-have-been-a-spectacular-strategic-failure-for-the-west\">17 percentage points gap</a> between the potential and actual size of Iran’s middle class.</p><p>After Trump launched his maximum pressure campaign against Iran, the middle class shrank even more dramatically. The middle class was now 28 percentage points smaller than it would have been in the absence of sanctions.</p><p>Farzanegan told Al Jazeera that sanctions are what have led to the collapse of the rial. “This decimated the purchasing power of fixed-salary earners like teachers and civil servants, many of whom fell from the middle class into the category of ‘working poor’.”</p><p>Purchasing power is the value of money, measured by the quantity of goods and services a unit of currency can buy.</p><p>“As formal businesses contracted, workers were pushed into ‘vulnerable employment’ and informal labour, characterised by lower pay and a lack of social protections,” Farzanegan added.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2020.1746277\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research</a> article published in 2020 shows that UN sanctions are directly associated with a marked <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/12/sanctions-are-not-a-humane-alternative-to-war\">drop in life expectancy</a>: on average, sanctioned countries lose about 1.2 to 1.4 years, with women bearing a disproportionate share of this decline.</p><p>The impact on Iran is in keeping with the broader deadly impact of sanctions: since 1970, US and EU sanctions have <a href=\"/opinions/2025/9/3/us-and-eu-sanctions-have-killed-38-million-people-since-1970\">killed 38 million people</a> – equivalent to the population of Ukraine or Poland – according to research published last year.</p><p>Sanctions have disrupted medicine imports in Iran, leading to price spikes of up to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hpm.3651\">300 percent</a> for some essential drugs such as anti-seizure medications, according to research published in 2023.</p><p>Sanctions have also taken a toll on the environment in Iran. Farzanegan explained that sanctions have hindered the adoption of cleaner fuel standards and slowed green innovation, leading to higher levels of air pollution in cities like Tehran.</p><p>“This has had a measurable negative impact on children’s cognitive abilities.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
