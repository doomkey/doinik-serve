The ban came after members of the group <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/pro-palestinian-activists-break-into-uk-military-base\">broke into a military airbase</a> in June and damaged two planes.</p><p>Membership in or <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/palestine-action-what-has-the-group-done-as-it-faces-a-ban\">support for the group</a> is now a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p><p>Critics say the ban infringes on freedom of speech and the right to protest, as well as aims to stifle demonstrations against Israel’s war on Gaza.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Sonia Gallego, reporting from Parliament Square, said the threat of arrest or punishment “hasn’t deterred any supporters” of Palestine Action from expressing their backing for the group.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Something as simple as wearing a t-shirt saying, ‘I support Palestine Action’, or even having that written on a sheet of paper”, could lead to an arrest, Gallego said.</p><h2 id=\"alternative-universe\">‘Alternative universe’</h2><p>Paddy Friend, a protester, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that the mass arrests at Parliament Square raised serious questions about freedoms in the UK.</p><p>“If we can’t come down with seven words on a sign and sit quietly, then what does freedom of speech mean?” Friend said.</p><p>Another demonstrator, grandmother Manji Mansfield, returned to protest on Saturday, despite having been arrested at a previous rally.</p><p>“This isn’t the Britain that I grew up in,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We’re now living in an alternative universe, and I’m not going to accept it.”</p><p>John McDonnell, a Labour Party MP, also condemned the arrests. “It’s a disgrace that people are being arrested for upholding our democratic rights,” he wrote on X.</p><p>Amnesty International UK denounced the arrest of peaceful protesters solely for holding signs, saying such action constitutes “a violation of the UK’s international obligations to protect the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly”.</p><p>Palestine Action, which accuses the UK’s government of complicity in what it says are Israeli war crimes in Gaza, has increasingly targeted Israel-linked companies in the country, often spraying red paint, blocking entrances or damaging equipment.</p><p>UK Secretary of State for the Home Department Yvette Cooper tabled the order to ban the group in parliament days after its activists <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/pro-palestinian-activists-break-into-uk-military-base\">broke into RAF Brize Norton</a>, the largest station of the Royal Air Force in Oxfordshire, and sprayed two military planes with red paint, resulting in millions of pounds of criminal damage, according to police.</p><p>The ban was passed on July 2.</p><p>The move, however, has drawn concern from United Nations human rights exerts, who say labelling Palestine Action as a “terrorist” group was “unjustified”, as the group’s actions were limited to civil disobedience and “mere property damage, without endangering life”.</p><p>But Cooper, speaking to reporters on Saturday, insisted that Palestine Action had been outlawed “based on strong security advice” and following “an assessment from the Joint Terrorism Assessment Centre that the group prepares for terrorism”.</p><p>“Many people may not yet know the reality of this organisation,” she said, claiming the group “is not non-violent”.</p><p>“The right to protest is one we protect fiercely, but this is very different from displaying support for this one specific and narrow, proscribed organisation,” she added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"repressive-consequences\">Repressive consequences</h2><p>Before the arrests on Saturday, at least 200 people had been detained for protesting the ban.</p><p>More than 350 academics from around the world have also signed an open letter, published this week, applauding a “growing campaign of collective defiance” against Cooper’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action.</p><p>The signatories “deplore the repressive consequences that this ban has already had, and are especially concerned about the likely impact of Cooper’s ban on universities across the UK and beyond”, the letter read.</p><p>Israeli historian and University of Exeter professor Ilan Pappe, Goldsmiths, University of London professor Eyal Weizman, and political thinkers Michael Hardt and Jaqueline Rose were among those who signed the letter.</p><p>Meanwhile, a separate march organised by the Palestine Coalition group was also held in London on Saturday.</p><p>The Metropolitan Police said one person had been arrested at that march, which went from Russell Square to Whitehall, for displaying a banner in support of Palestine Action.</p><p>London’s High Court has, meanwhile, ruled that Palestine Action cofounder Huda Ammori can <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/uk-court-rules-palestine-action-may-challenge-antiterrorism-ban\">bring a judicial review</a> against the ban, with Judge Martin Chamberlain saying that it was “reasonably arguable” that proscription amounted to a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression.</p><p>However, the full judicial review will not take place until late 2025, according to the lawyers representing Ammori.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3880274\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3880274\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

When Palestinian civilians were bombed in their homes, when entire families were buried under rubble, coverage came slowly, cautiously and often buried in “both sides” framing.</p><p>But when the images of starving Palestinian children began to emerge – haunting faces, skeletal limbs, vacant stares – something shifted. The photographs were too visceral, too undeniable. Western audiences were confronted with what the siege of Gaza truly means. And for once, the media’s gatekeepers could not entirely look away.</p><p>The world’s attention, however, alerted Israel, and a new “hasbara” operation was deployed. Hasbara means “explaining”, but in practice, it’s about erasing. With Tel Aviv’s guidance, pro-Israel media operatives set out to “debunk” the evidence of famine. The method was fully Orwellian: Don’t just contest the facts. Contest the eyes that see them.</p><p>We were told there is no starvation in Gaza. Never mind that Israeli ministers had publicly vowed to block food, fuel and medicine. Never mind that trucks were stopped for months, sometimes vandalised by Israeli settlers in broad daylight.</p><p>Israeli officials, speaking in polished English to Western media, assured the public this was all a Hamas fabrication, as though Hamas had somehow managed to trick aid agencies, foreign doctors and every journalist in Gaza into staging hunger.</p><p>The propaganda machine thought it had struck gold with one photograph. A New York Times image showed a skeletal boy, Mohammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq. Israeli intelligence sources whispered to friendly outlets: He’s not starving. He has a medical condition. As if that somehow makes his horrific condition acceptable.</p><p>The Times went ahead and added an editor’s note to “correct” the record.</p><p>That’s how hasbara works – not by persuading people but by exhausting them. By turning every fact into a dispute, every image into a row. By pushing editors to “balance” a photograph of an emaciated child with a government news release denying he is hungry.</p><p>Imagine a weather report where one source says, “It’s raining,” and another insists, “No, it’s sunny,” while everyone stands outside, soaked from the downpour. Gaza is that drenched truth, and yet much of the Western news media still feels obliged to quote the weatherman in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Every honest report is met with a barrage of emails, phone calls and social media smears, all designed to create just enough doubt to make editors pull back.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But the claim “He’s not starving. He’s just sick” is not an exoneration. It’s an admission.</p><p>A child with a pre-existing medical condition who is brought to the point of looking like a skeleton means he has been deprived not only of the nutrition he needs, but of the medical care. This is forced starvation and medicide side by side.</p><p>Palestinian journalists inside Gaza, the only ones reporting since Israel banned all foreign media and killed more than 200 Palestinian journalists, are starving alongside the people they report on. In a rare joint statement, the BBC, AFP and Associated Press warned that their own staff members face “the same dire circumstances as those they are covering”.</p><p>At the height of the outrage over these photos last week, Israel allowed in a trickle of aid – some airdrops and 30 to 50 trucks a day when the United Nations says 500 to 600 are needed. Some trucks never arrived, blocked by Jewish extremists.</p><p>Meanwhile, a parallel mechanism for aid distribution has been funnelled through Israeli-approved American contractors, which purposefully create dangerous and chaotic conditions that lead to daily killings of aid seekers. Crowds of starving Palestinians gather, only to be shot at by Israeli soldiers.</p><p>And still, the denials persist. The official line is that this is not starvation. It’s something else – undefined but definitely not a war crime.</p><p>The world has seen famine before – in Ethiopia, in Somalia, in Yemen, in South Sudan. The photographs from Gaza belong in the same category. The difference is that here, a powerful state causing the starvation is actively trying to convince us that our own eyes are lying to us.</p><p>The goal is not to convince the public that there is no hunger but to plant enough doubt to paralyse outrage. If the facts can be made murky, the pressure on Israel diminishes. This is why every newsroom that avoids the word “starvation” becomes an unwitting accomplice.</p><p>Starvation in Gaza is not collateral damage. It is an instrument of war, measurable in calories denied, trucks blocked and fields destroyed.</p><p>Israel’s strategy depends on controlling the lens as well as the border. It goes as far as prohibiting journalists allowed on airplanes airdropping food from filming the devastation below.</p><p>For a brief moment, the publication of those photos of starving Palestinians broke through the wall of propaganda, prompting minimal concessions. But the siege continues, the hunger deepens and the mass killing expands. Now the Israeli government has decided to launch another ground offensive to occupy Gaza City, and with it, the genocide will only get worse.</p><p>History will record the famine in Gaza. It will remember the prices of flour and sugar, the names of children and the aid trucks turned back. And it will remember how the world allowed itself to be told, in the middle of a downpour, that the sky was clear.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
