They then overlaid the results with maps of cultural sites to pinpoint which places could be inundated in the coming decades.</p><p>The findings show waves could reach Ahu Tongariki, the largest ceremonial platform on the island, as early as 2080. The site, home to the 15 towering moai, draws tens of thousands of visitors each year and is a cornerstone of the island’s tourism economy.</p><p>Beyond its economic value, the ahu is deeply woven into Rapa Nui’s cultural identity. It lies within Rapa Nui National Park, which encompasses much of the island and is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p><p>The roughly 900 moai statues across the island were built by the Rapa Nui people between the 10th and 16th centuries to honour important ancestors and chiefs.</p><p>The threat isn’t unprecedented. In 1960, the largest earthquake ever recorded – a magnitude 9.5 off the coast of Chile – sent a tsunami surging across the Pacific. It struck Rapa Nui and swept the already-toppled moai further inland, which damaged some of their features. The monument was restored in the 1990s.</p><p>While the study focuses on Rapa Nui, its conclusions echo a wider reality: Cultural heritage sites worldwide are increasingly endangered by rising seas. A UNESCO report published last month found that about 50 World Heritage sites are highly exposed to coastal flooding.</p><p>A UNESCO spokesperson told The Associated Press news agency that climate change is the biggest threat to UNESCO’s World Heritage marine sites. “In the Mediterranean and Africa, nearly three-quarters of coastal low-lying sites are now exposed to erosion and flooding due to accelerated sea level rise.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Possible defences for Ahu Tongariki range from armouring the coastline and building breakwaters to relocating the monuments.</p><p>Paoa hopes that the findings will bring these conversations about now, rather than after irreversible damage. “It’s best to look ahead and be proactive instead of reactive to the potential threats.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Just last year, 10 soldiers were convicted of carrying out the systematic rape of Indigenous and rural women and girls.</p><p>Drawing from Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, the human rights group Amnesty International estimates that the country’s armed forces and police were responsible for 37 percent of the deaths and disappearances that happened during the conflict.</p><p>They were also credited with carrying out 75 percent of the reported instances of torture and 83 percent of sexual violence cases.</p><p>Francisco Ochoa, a victims’ advocate, <a href=\"/features/longform/2025/7/30/dramatic-setback-will-perus-new-amnesty-law-put-justice-out-of-reach\">spoke to Al Jazeera last month</a> about his experiences surviving the 1985 Accomarca massacre as a 14-year-old teenager.</p><p>He had been in the corn fields preparing to sow seeds when soldiers arrived and rounded up the residents of his small Andean village.</p><p>Despite having no evidence linking the villagers to rebel groups, the soldiers locked many of them in their huts, fired into the structures and set them ablaze.</p><p>As many as 62 people were killed, including Ochoa’s mother, eight-year-old brother and six-year-old sister.</p><p>“The first thing I remember from that day is the smell when we arrived,” Ochoa, now 54, told journalist Claudia Rebaza. “It smelled like smouldering flesh, and there was no one around.”</p><p>When asked how he and other survivors felt about the amnesty law, Ochoa responded, “Outraged and betrayed”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In April, car companies, including <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/30/automakers-suspend-financial-guidance-amid-tariff-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stellantis, Ford and Volvo, suspended</a> financial guidance as a result of the uncertainty.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last month Volvo also said that tariffs will cost it $1.2bn in the second quarter. Ford then announced it expects a reduced annual profits to $3bn after taking an $800m hit from tariffs in the second quarter. GM announced that it expects a $5bn hit, and Toyota said it expects $9.5bn in tariff-driven blows to profits for the year.</p><p>In May, Ford also announced it would have to raise prices on some of its cars made in Mexico, including the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, Maverick pick-up truck and Bronco Sport, in some cases by as much as $2,000, the Reuters news agency reported. Those cars began to reach lots last month.</p><p>As a result, consumers are overwhelmingly opting for used cars that are not subject to tariffs, including foreign-made ones, as they are already on US roads.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Used car sales are up 2.3 percent from this time last year, according to Used Car Index report, an auto industry insight platform by Edmunds.</p><p>In part, this is because of the limited supply of used cars. Edmunds’s report says that buyers, and sellers looking to upgrade but need the money from sale of a current car, are hesitant about undertaking expenses amid economic uncertainty.</p><p>The bigger impact of both those trends is of inventory piling up. On average, dealerships have 82 days worth of cars on the lot, a roughly 14 percent increase between May and June.</p><h2 id=\"an-expensive-escalation\">An expensive escalation</h2><p>Cox forecasts prices could rise anywhere between 4 to 8 percent over the next six months as a result of the tariffs. The group expects new car sales of 13 million to 13.3 million this year.</p><p>“Tariffs will be inflationary on both the new and used vehicle market,” Schirmer said, adding, the main challenge right now is the unsold inventory that’s piling up.</p><p>Analysts believe that prices will continue to rise amid Trump’s tariffs, especially as companies try to move supply chains to the US, as demanded by Trump, an effort that is years in the making.</p><p>“The tariff ‘relief’ is like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound with US car companies now dealing with the repercussions moving forward as this Twilight Zone situation will change the paradigm for the US auto industry for years to come,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the meantime, the cost to import a car is expected to increase by $1,000 this year to $5,700, according to Cox Automotive.</p><p>“The US imports a little less than half of the new vehicles sold, but dependence on imports varies substantially by segment. The most dependent segments are at the two ends of the price spectrum – the most affordable vehicles and luxury vehicles. Most of the vehicles priced under $30,000 would face added costs that would make them unaffordable,” Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said in a June conference call shared with Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"evs-hit-hard\">EVs hit hard</h2><p>Trump’s new tax legislation – signed into law last month and which cut the EV tax credit of up to $7,500 – has already led to a significant pullback specifically for the electric vehicle marketplace as demand for the products begins to fall.</p><p>“Our forecast had been for approximately 10 percent of new vehicle sales this year to be EV. We slightly lowered that to 9 percent,” Schirmer added.</p><p>Volvo reported a 26 percent decline in sales for electric vehicles (12 percent overall). Ford EV sales tumbled by 31 percent. Rivian saw sales decline by 23 percent. Tesla saw a decline of 13.5 percent globally as CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement hindered the brand’s reputation. The cuts to the EV tax credit is expected to cost Tesla $1.2bn every year, JP Morgan forecast.</p><p>“Several dealers have also stated that these [EV tax credits] are the main drivers [for consumers]. So without those incentives, there would definitely be a significant hit through EV sales,” Golara added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>General Motors has been the exception to the rule. The Michigan-based auto giant doubled its <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2025/07/03/gm-tesla-ev-sales-elon-musk/84452115007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EV sales</a> in recent months.</p><p>Despite the dip in sales, Golora believes that the setback in the EV market is temporary.</p><p>“It’s [the EV market] still compelling in the long run because many manufacturers have already reached a decision that this is where the industry is going,” Golara said.</p><p>“Investment [in EV production] doesn’t look like a lost one. The payback period will be longer.”</p><h2 id=\"manufacturing-strains\">Manufacturing strains</h2><p>While US manufacturing ticked up overall in June, when it comes to motor vehicle and parts production, it is a different story. Production tumbled by 2.6 percent for the month as demand began to slow.</p><p>US auto manufacturing employment is also down. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in auto manufacturing in the United States has tumbled by 35.7 percent since this time last year and down 2.4 percent from this time last month.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the United Auto Workers for comment about the effect on car manufacturing jobs, but the organisation did not respond.</p><p>“Demand was not growing as fast as needed, and many manufacturers were caught by surprise. That’s a problem, and it is kind of a longer-term, structural issue,” Golara said.</p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

The real stats,” he said.</p><p>Trump also faces legal limitations to his efforts: The capital’s police can only be federalised for a period of 30 days, barring congressional action.</p><p>When asked about that limit at Wednesday’s news conference, Trump indicated he would seek to retain control of Washington’s police for the long term.</p><p>“ If it’s a national emergency, we can do it without Congress,” Trump said, though he added that he would introduce a crime bill that would allow him to extend his control over the local police.</p><p>“ We’re going to do this very quickly, but we’re going to want extensions. I don’t want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will, but I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3886814\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3886814\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886814\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25225570015911-1755106316.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C492&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Trump stands in front of a photo of Sylvester Stallone at the Kennedy Center\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3886814\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Donald Trump stands in front of a portrait of Sylvester Stallone, a 2025 Kennedy Center honouree [Alex Brandon/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"trump-very-involved-in-honouree-selection\">Trump ‘very involved’ in honouree selection</h2><p>The Republican leader also hinted at a potential political bent to the reimagined Kennedy Center Honors.</p><p>He has previously denounced the Kennedy Center’s programming, pledging to nix artistic productions like drag shows and book classic Broadway hits instead.</p><p>In response, over the past year, the touring production of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton cancelled its scheduled stop at the Kennedy Center, as did comedian Issa Rae and the opera Fellow Travelers.</p><p>Performers in a touring production of Les Miserables also boycotted performances at the Kennedy Center to protest Trump’s changes.</p><p>Still, Trump doubled down on the programming changes, saying his ratings success on the reality TV show The Apprentice testified to his arts-industry smarts.</p><p>“I shouldn’t make this political because they made the Academy Awards political and they went down the tubes,” Trump said on Wednesday.</p><p>“They’ll say, ‘Trump made it political,’ but I think, if we make it our kind of political, we’ll go up, OK? Let’s see if I’m right about that.”</p><p>He also confirmed that he had played a large role in selecting this year’s Kennedy Center honourees.</p><p>“I would say I was about 98-percent involved. No, they all went through me,” Trump explained, adding that he turned down “plenty” of candidates, including “a couple of wokesters”.</p><p>Looking ahead, Trump said the Kennedy Center would feature heavily in his plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding in 2026.</p><p>“I’m going to be president for the Olympics. I’ll be president for the World Cup. And the 250th is going to be maybe more exciting than both,” Trump said. “It’s a great celebration of our country. We’re going to be using this building for a lot of the celebration.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Make no mistake: This selection is a clear assault on independent analysis that will have far-reaching implications for the reliability of US  economic data,” Alex Jaquez, a member of the White House National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Many former Labor Department officials say that while it is unlikely Antoni will be able to distort or alter the data, particularly in the short run, he could change the currently dry-as-dust way it is presented.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Antoni was nominated by Trump after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released a jobs report on August 1 that showed that hiring had weakened in July and was much lower in May and June than the agency had previously reported. Trump, without evidence, charged that the data had been “rigged” for political reasons and fired the then-BLS chair, Erika McEntarfer, much to the dismay of many within the agency and the broad condemnation of experts.</p><p>“Firing officials for reporting accurate data unflattering to the regime is straight out of the authoritarian playbook. It is an attempt to mislead the American people, to avoid being held to account for their failures, and to rewrite history,” Vanessa Williamson, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Antoni’s nomination comes as <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/1/trump-says-economic-growth-shatters-expectations-data-says-otherwise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump continues to spin fabrications</a> throughout the US economic data, including claiming gas prices are lower than they are and that egg prices have fallen 400 percent – a mathematically impossible figure.</p><h2 id=\"government-data-critic\">Government data critic</h2><p id=\"the-stock-market-moves-clearly-based-on-these-job-numbers-and-so-people-with-skin-in-the-game-think-it-s-telling-them-something-about-the-future-of-their-investments-albrecht-said-could-it-be-improved-absolutely-katharine-abraham-an-economist-at-the-university-of-maryland-who-was-bls-commissioner-under-president-bill-clinton-said-updating-the-jobs-report-s-methods-would-require-at-least-some-initial-investment\">Antoni has been a vocal critic of the government’s jobs data in frequent appearances on podcasts and cable TV. His partisan commentary is unusual for someone who may end up leading the BLS.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>On August 4, a week before he was nominated, Antoni said in an interview on Fox News Digital that the Labor Department should stop publishing the monthly jobs reports until its data collection processes improve, and rely on quarterly data based on actual employment filings with state unemployment offices.</p><p>The monthly employment reports are probably the most closely watched economic data on Wall Street, and can frequently cause swings in stock prices.</p><p>When asked at Tuesday’s White House briefing whether the jobs report would continue to be released, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration hoped it would be.</p><p>“I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope,” Leavitt said.</p><p>Leavitt also defended Antoni’s nomination, calling him an “economic expert” who has testified before Congress and adding that, “the president trusts him to lead this important department.”</p><p>Yet Antoni’s TV and podcast appearances have created more of a portrait of a conservative ideologue, instead of a careful economist who considers tradeoffs and prioritises getting the math correct.</p><p>“There’s just nothing in his writing or his resume to suggest that he’s qualified for the position, besides that he is always manipulating the data to favour Trump in some way,” said Brian Albrecht, chief economist at the International Center for Law and Economics, told The Associated Press.</p><p>Antoni wrongly claimed in the last year of Biden’s presidency that the economy had been in recession since 2022; he called on the entire Federal Reserve board to be fired for not earning a profit on its Treasury securities holdings; and posted a chart on social media that conflated timelines to suggest inflation was headed to 15 percent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>His argument that the US was in a recession rested on a vastly exaggerated measure of housing inflation, based on newly purchased home prices, to artificially make the nation’s gross domestic product appear smaller than it was.</p><p>“This is actually maybe the worst Antoni content I’ve seen yet,” Alan Cole of the centre-right Tax Foundation said on social media, referring to his recession claim.</p><p>On a 2024 podcast, Antoni wanted to sunset Social Security payments for workers paying into the system, saying that “you’ll need a generation of people who pay Social Security taxes but never actually receive any of those benefits.” As head of the BLS, Antoni would oversee the release of the consumer price index by which Social Security payments are adjusted for inflation.</p><h2 id=\"flawed-data\">Flawed data</h2><p>Many economists share, to some degree, Antoni’s concerns that the government’s jobs data has flaws and is threatened by trends such as declining response rates to its surveys. The drop has made the jobs figures more volatile, though not necessarily less accurate over time.</p><p>“The stock market moves clearly based on these job numbers, and so people with skin in the game think it’s telling them something about the future of their investments,” Albrecht said. “Could it be improved? Absolutely.”</p><p>Katharine Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland who was BLS commissioner under President Bill Clinton, said updating the jobs report’s methods would require at least some initial investment.</p><p>The government could use more modern data sources, she said, such as figures from payroll processing companies, and fill in gaps with surveys.</p><p>“There’s an inconsistency between saying you want higher response rates and you want to spend less money,” she said, referring to the administration’s proposals to cut BLS funding.</p><p>Still, Abraham and other former BLS commissioners do not think Antoni, if confirmed, would be able to alter the figures. He could push for changes in the monthly press release and seek to portray the numbers in a more positive light.</p><p>William Beach, who was appointed BLS commissioner by Trump in his first term and also served under Biden, said he is confident that BLS procedures are strong enough to prevent political meddling. He said he did not see the figures until two days before publication when he served as commissioner.</p><p>“The commissioner does not affect the numbers,’’ Beach said. “They don’t collect the data. They don’t massage the data. They don’t organise it.”</p><p>Regarding the odds of rigging the numbers, Beach said, “I wouldn’t put it at complete zero, but I’d put it pretty close to zero.’’</p><p>It took about six months after McEntarfer was nominated in July 2023 for her to be approved. Antoni will likely face stiff opposition from Democrats, but that may not be enough to derail his appointment.</p><p>Senator Patty Murray, a senior Democrat from Washington, on Tuesday slammed Antoni as “an unqualified right-wing extremist” and demanded that the GOP chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, hold a confirmation hearing for him.</p></div></div></body></html>"
