Harris said, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”</p><p>In this moment, analysts said, Harris had tied herself inextricably with the economic hardships voters faced during the Biden administration and its other failings. Harris lost the election and returned to the show a year later to say, “I realise now that I didn’t fully appreciate how much of an issue it was.” In her book 107 Days, Harris likened her statement to pulling the pin on a hand grenade.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>While Harris’s appearance may not have helped her electoral prospects, Donald Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee, did not appear on The View before the 2024 election or in his previous two elections.</p><p>Daytime and late-night shows are usually required by a United States Communications Act rule that political candidates be given equal access to airtime, but The View may possibly have been an exemption because it could be seen as a “bona fide news show”, and those are exempt from that requirement.</p><p>But in the last year, The View, Saturday Night Live, Jimmy Kimmel Live and other shows have been in the Federal Communications Commission’s eye for not providing equal access and possibly providing partisan coverage. But critics say the FCC’s attempts to rein in such shows could amount to curtailing of speech. That, along with increasing corporate consolidation of media ownership, could make it vulnerable to regulatory intervention and a backsliding in media freedom, as has been seen in countries such as Hungary and Russia.</p><p>The FCC put out a public notice in late January saying concerns had been raised that the interview portions of all daytime and late-night shows were exempt from the equal opportunities requirement. “This is not the case,” the FCC’s notice said, encouraging stations “to obtain formal assurance” that they are exempt from giving equal access.</p><p>But such processes could be “a tool for harassment and intimidation”, said Harold Field, senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, DC.</p><p>With the notice and the petitioning process hanging, broadcasters may rethink “which perspectives to air and which ones not to”, said Seth Stern, chief of advocacy at the Freedom of Press Foundation.</p><p>Gigi Sohn, a lawyer who has previously worked in the FCC, said, “I like the spirit of the notice,” referring to the principle of providing lesser-known candidates equal access to airtime, “but the impact could be censorship. I am concerned about how it will be applied.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"it-costs-money-to-stand-up-for-principle\">‘It costs money to stand up for principle’</h2><p>The FCC notice stems from the Communications Act of 1934, which said, since the three broadcasters were being provided public airwaves, if a station provides space to one political candidate, it would have to provide equal opportunity to all other candidates for that office. Broadcasters would have to keep a public file on any free time given to a candidate so that other candidates could review this and claim their equal free time, too.</p><p>When John Kennedy appeared on the Tonight Show in 1959, the FCC had ruled that equal time was to be given to other candidates. In 2006, by the time Arnold Schwarznegger appeared on the Tonight Show while running for California governor, more talk shows had filled the airwaves and blurred the line between news and entertainment. The FCC had ruled that The Tonight Show was exempt from the equal time rule as a bona fide news interview.</p><p>The FCC notice from January said that the industry has taken this to mean that all daytime and late-night shows are exempt because they are bona fide news shows, but they are not.</p><p>“To state the obvious, Jimmy Kimmel Live is not Meet The Press. Not by a long shot. Not even close,” Daniel Suhr, president of the Center for American Rights, a right-leaning think tank based in Chicago, wrote in a blog post for the Yale Regulatory Journal.</p><p>FCC chair Brendan Carr had also <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/2014081766902940028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted</a> that such shows had claimed exemptions “even when motivated by partisan political purposes”. Right-wing analysts quoted a study saying The View had only two conservative guests in 2025, while it had 128 liberal guests. A media representative of The View did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>But others worry that the notice is part of a broader effort to curtail satire, comedy and comment.</p><p>“This, to me, is the most shocking element of what this administration has been able to do, is to say that views, satire and humour are censored,” said Margot Susca, assistant professor of journalism at American University in Washington, DC.</p><p>Putting out such notices could push the broadcasters’ parent organisations to limit their content, analysts say, citing instances of how the Paramount Skydance <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/10/trump-accused-of-leading-a-multipronged-attack-on-us-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">merger</a> was approved only after it settled a lawsuit over Harris’s interview on 60 Minutes.</p><p>“For-profit corporations are not known for their bravery,” said Public Knowledge’s Field. “They may keep their heads down and views in check.”</p><p>Berkeley’s Davis said that “it costs money to stand up for principle,” and that the administration’s “understanding of the financial needs of media corporations is unprecedented.”</p><p>Large corporations often have mergers pending or licence issues, said Sohn, “so departments can extract a pound of flesh when there isn’t even an issue.”</p><p>The notice may also be “intended to drive a wedge between broadcasters and affiliates”, argued Sohn. “It could be that Disney asks Kimmel not to have political candidates, or the affiliate may preempt the show since the burden also falls on stations.”</p><p>Sohn had been nominated by Biden for the FCC, but withdrew her nomination after a protracted and fraught confirmation process.</p><p>Last fall, when Kimmel made comments about Charlie Kirk’s killer, FCC commissioner Carr said affiliates could preempt, or drop the show, which Nextstar and Sinclair, the two biggest owners of television stations, did. Even after a public outrage reinstated Kimmel’s show, the two <a href=\"/economy/2025/9/23/some-us-broadcasters-will-not-air-kimmel-even-as-abc-brings-back-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">did not bring back Kimmel’s show for days</a>.</p><p>“Public outrage is the best tonic,” Sohn said, referring to the outcry that led ABC to bring back Kimmel. “But there are so many outrages.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"control-the-narrative\">‘Control the narrative’</h2><p>While broadcasters’ licences for free airwaves come with a public service responsibility, the FCC notice said daytime and late-night shows have been partisan.</p><p>But others, such as Berkeley’s Davis, say notices like this serve to “control the narrative, not inform the public”.</p><p>“The executive branch getting so powerful and increasing concentration of media ownership in corporate hands have created two forms of power that have colluded in ways that undermine media independence,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>It is a pattern American University’s Susca said she saw in other countries with sliding democratic standards and has written about in her forthcoming book Media Plutocracy, to be published by the University of Massachusetts Press.</p><p>“Hungary was the most glaring example where media ownership was concentrated in the hands of wealthy people who were aligned with President Orban,” she said. “This led to media restrictions and has meant that media independence was gone and any accountability on journalism disappeared in 15 years of Orban.”</p><p>Stern of the Freedom of Press Foundation said that, while there are comparisons with developments in Russia and Hungary, where media acquisitions have been steered towards favourable owners leading to a slide in media independence, these aren’t the only such cases.</p><p>“There are many precedents. Some of what we are seeing is old, and some new, but the value of these comparisons is limited because Trump is a unique figure in a unique time”.</p><p>More conservative analysts have accused the media of having a liberal bias that they have battled to correct. For instance, when Harris appeared in a 90-second Saturday Night Live last year and made jokes such as the US public “wants to end the dramala”, Suhr’s Center for American Rights filed a complaint for equal time. NBC then filed a public file offering equal time to Trump, who made a 90-second speech asking voters to vote for him.</p><p>The Center for American Rights did not respond to a request for comment by Al Jazeera.</p><p>While these battles are being fought over broadcasters’ right to air, Berkeley’s Davis pointed out that “this is a time for convergence. I watch Kimmel on YouTube,” where viewers could see the show, even when Nextstar and Sinclair did not air it, and the Communication Act rules do not apply.</p><p>Viewers, of all political views, are increasingly turning to social media for their news, opinions and humour, data shows.</p><p>“I like more speech, not less. Limiting it could be a concerning impact of this,” Sohn said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the government does not control the proceeds. Instead, funds are deposited into a restricted account in Qatar, subject to US approval, to pay public sector salaries and essential services.</p><p>This new agreement came amid major political changes following the US military <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abduction</a> of President Nicolas Maduro. On January 15, acting President Delcy Rodriguez proposed reforms to Venezuela’s hydrocarbons law, aiming to attract foreign investment by easing restrictions that had favoured nationalisations for the past 25 years.</p><p>US Energy Secretary Chris Wright also said on Friday that he plans to visit Venezuela soon to meet “all the leadership” and assess oil and gas operations, as Washington signals it intends to oversee Venezuela’s oil sector for the foreseeable future.</p><p>As Venezuela moves forward amid these political changes, we examine how the government sustains its operations and the challenges it currently faces.</p><h2>What is the context, and what has been happening in Venezuela?</h2><p>One month after the US military action known as Operation Absolute Resolve, Venezuela is navigating a volatile political and economic landscape. The operation, conducted on January 3, 2026, resulted <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">in the abduction</a> of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. According to Venezuela’s Ministry of Defence, the extraction was deadly, resulting in at least <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/nearly-50-venezuelan-soldiers-killed-in-us-abduction-of-president-maduro\">83 deaths</a>.</p><p>In the aftermath, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice declared Maduro’s capture a “forced absence” and appointed Rodriguez as acting president. While Rodriguez condemned the US action as an “illegal kidnapping,” she has since signalled willingness to cooperate with Washington, including proposing reforms to attract foreign investment in the oil sector.</p><p>She has also framed herself as shaping a new order while maintaining tight control over the implementation of reforms.</p><p>Domestically, in late January, Rodriguez also announced a mass amnesty bill aimed at releasing political prisoners and plans to repurpose the notorious El Helicoide prison into a community centre.</p><p>Critics, however, argue that these measures may not address Venezuela’s structural problems, raising questions about the interim government’s long-term legitimacy and direction.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-key-people-running-the-venezuelan-government\" data-start=\"1639\" data-end=\"1690\">Who are the key people running the Venezuelan government?</h2><p>In Venezuela, power remains concentrated in a “civic-military” alliance.</p><p>While Rodriguez holds formal executive authority, analysts like Salvador Santino Regilme, a political scientist who leads the international relations programme at Leiden University in the Netherlands, say that in this case “real power is best understood as residing within a governing coalition rather than a single office-holder.”</p><p>Here are some of the key figures forming her government:</p><ul>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"8,2,0,0\"><strong>Jorge Rodriguez (Head of the National Assembly):</strong> The interim president’s brother controls the legislature.

As such, oil remains one of its main sources of income.</p><p>“Venezuela’s fiscal survival still depends primarily on hydrocarbons, because oil remains the only sector capable of generating rents at scale,” Santino told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The current financial control mechanism operates through several stages, from oil extraction to the final disbursement of funds.</p><p>Payments are not sent directly to Venezuela. Instead, they go through US-supervised channels and are deposited into a restricted account in Qatar, to stop creditors from seizing the money to recover Venezuela’s estimated $170bn in external debt.</p><p>The US also oversees the distribution of these funds. Venezuela must submit budget requests for specific uses, such as paying teachers, police and healthcare workers. Once approved, the funds are transferred to the Central Bank of Venezuela and then to private local banks.</p><p>“Venezuela will submit every month a budget of ‘this is what we need funded.’ We will provide for them at the front end what that [oil] money can be used for,” Rubio detailed the plan during an appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January.</p><p>“I understand it’s novel, but it’s the best we could come up with in the short term,” Rubio added.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925812\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Venezuela-oil-fields-poster-1756997699.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Venezuela oil fields poster-1756997699\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><br>\nHowever, experts have raised concerns about the implications of this arrangement.</p><p>“Right now, given the control … even though you have a facade, you have an interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, and other members, the one who really has control is Donald Trump,” Jose Manuel Puente, a professor at the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administracion in Caracas, said.</p><p>“Venezuela is a state under tutelage right now by the US. The US took control of all its income,” he added.</p><p>Some US officials have also criticised the arrangement. Democrat Lloyd Doggett <a href=\"https://doggett.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-doggett-demands-answers-trumps-corrupt-venezuelan-oil-bargain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> Rubio’s testimony “raised more questions than answers”</p><p>“There are currently no safeguards to ensure the Rodriguez family does not use the revenue to pay off Maduro’s allies,” Doggett said.</p><p>And by following this scheme, “[Trump] is unlawfully refusing to honour debts owed to US institutions … and [he] instead appears to be rewarding his donors,” he added.</p><h2>Are there any other sources of government revenue?</h2><p>The government has tried to diversify its revenue streams beyond oil.</p><p>The country possesses <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/what-resources-does-venezuela-have-apart-from-the-worlds-most\">the largest official gold</a> reserves in Latin America. Venezuela’s reserves are approximately 161.2 metric tonnes, worth more than $23bn in today’s market value.</p><p>The country is also believed to hold some of the most significant untapped gold resources, but official data is outdated. Large parts of gold production happen through informal or illegal mining networks, especially in southern states like Bolivar.</p><p>According to the government in 2025, Venezuela produced 9.5 tonnes of gold in 2025.</p><p>“In recent years, gold has increased its share, just like some small export areas, such as the case of tropical fruits, or the case of shrimp,” Puente explained.</p><p>“There are some sectors that generate some income, but it is still completely asymmetric in favour of oil,” he added.</p><h2>How are things looking inside the country?</h2><p>&gt;With more than 7.9 million people requiring urgent humanitarian assistance and approximately<a href=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/where/latin-america-and-caribbean/venezuela_en\"> 56 percent</a> of the population living in extreme poverty, according to the United Nations and the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, the administration faces immense pressure to implement effective solutions.</p><p>Nationals are struggling with wages that are too low to cover basic living costs.</p><p>“I am a housewife. I don’t work. My two older children work, but they earn salaries that are not enough,” Zulma Clavo, a Petare resident in Caracas, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“My son works as a motorcycle taxi driver and has to take risks just to survive, and my daughter earns the minimum wage, and it’s still not enough. When we go grocery shopping, we realise we have to put things back because we don’t have enough money,” she added.</p><p>Experts say there will be some economic relief as oil production increases.</p><p>“And that, evidently, is going to be a significant flow [of funds]. The thing is, who will finally decide how and in what that large amount of money is invested will be the Americans, and that is the point of difference,” Puente said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But following Maduro’s ouster, the US has exerted pressure on the government of interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez.</p><p>Venezuela has since agreed to comply with a US demand to end its supply of oil and funds to Cuba.</p><p>“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,” Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/2010348143880053159?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on January 11.</p><p>“THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA – ZERO!

They represent the best of this country,” said Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the US House of Representatives.</p><p>“Donald Trump is a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder. Why are GOP leaders like John Thune continuing to stand by this sick individual?”</p><p>The White House, for its part, initially defended the post as an “internet meme”. Later, it said the post had been shared “erroneously” by a White House staffer, not by the president.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"stoking-outrage\">Stoking outrage</h2><p>Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the Obamas, who became the first Black couple in US history to serve as president and first lady.</p><p>One of Trump’s first forays into national politics came during Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, when he <a href=\"/news/2016/9/17/donald-trump-finally-admits-obama-was-born-in-us\">pushed false claims</a> that the Democratic leader had not been born in the US.</p><p>Trump, a Republican, is known to be a prolific social media user, and he co-founded Truth Social in February 2022 after being temporarily banned from other major social media sites.</p><p>There, he often reposts memes and videos generated through artificial intelligence that promote his public image and political platform.</p><p>The video that includes the Obamas came at 11:44pm Eastern US time (04:44 GMT) as part of a series of shared clips.</p><p>The image of the Obamas as apes comes about 59 seconds into a video that only lasts one minute and two seconds.</p><p>It appears dropped into a documentary-style segment that pushes baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election was marred by malfeasance involving electronic voting machines. Trump has repeatedly spread lies denying his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in that race.</p><p>The video, which bears the watermark of a site called Patriot News Outlet, briefly pairs the doctored image of the Obamas with the 1961 song The Lion Sleeps Tonight.</p><p>Critics have regularly accused Trump of intentionally stoking outrage to distract from politically damaging domestic issues, including the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/us-department-of-justice-releases-three-million-new-epstein-documents\">recent release</a> of millions of files related to disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump’s name has featured in those files.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"midterms-ahead\">Midterms ahead</h2><p>Some Republicans, like Lawler in New York, also face punishing re-election campaigns ahead as the country nears its November midterm elections.</p><p>Trump has warned that, if Republicans lose control of Congress, he could face new impeachment proceedings.</p><p>Initially, in the hours after the video was reposted on Trump’s Truth Social account, the White House dismissed the backlash as overblown.</p><p>White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told several US news outlets that the image of the Obamas was excerpted from an “internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from ‘The Lion King'”, a 1994 animated feature film.</p><p>“Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” she said in a statement to ABC News.</p><p>But that explanation did not dampen the bipartisan push for Trump to renounce the video.</p><p>Republican Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska was also among those calling for the post to be taken down.</p><p>“Even if this was a Lion King meme, a reasonable person sees the racist context to this,” Ricketts <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorRicketts/status/2019814293366272277\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on X.</p><p>“The White House should do what anyone does when they make a mistake: remove this and apologise.”</p><p>Democrats, meanwhile, questioned Trump’s fitness for the presidency. In a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/CongressmanRaja/status/2019781481934053502\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi drew a line between the video and the long history of racist depictions of Black people in the US.</p><p>He pointed to similarly dehumanising illustrations that were shared during the Jim Crow era, a period from 1865 to the mid-20th century when Black people faced segregation and unequal rights following the abolishment of slavery.</p><p>“This kind of Jim Crow-style dehumanisation is pathetic and a disgrace to the office,” he wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US, he added, was “locked and loaded and ready to go”.</p><p>A week and a half later, on January 13, CBS News aired an interview where Trump asserted that the US “will take very strong action” against Iran should protesters face execution.</p><p>Separately, that same day, he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115888317758045915\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> a message on Truth Social encouraging the demonstrators to continue their protests, adding, “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.”</p><p>In late January, Trump took a further step, announcing the deployment of a “massive armada”, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, to the waterways near Iran. An Iranian drone was reportedly shot down this week as it approached the aircraft carrier.</p><p>But US allies in the Middle East have encouraged the Trump administration to avoid any military escalation with Iran, for fear of sparking a destabilising, region-wide conflict.</p><p>In advance of Friday’s talks in Oman, the Trump administration released a list of demands, which included not only the dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear programme but also restrictions on its ballistic missile stockpile and its ability to back armed groups in the region.</p><p>While Iranian officials have baulked at some of the demands, Friday’s negotiations concluded with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi calling it a “good start”. The US has yet to comment on the talks.</p><p>During Trump’s first term as president, the US withdrew from a 2015 deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which would have seen Iran scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p></div></div></body></html>"

US Central Command chief Brad Cooper, the most senior commander in the region, also joined the US delegation.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Speaking to Iranian television in Muscat after the talks finished, Araghchi said the indirect talks got off to “a good start” and that a decision on how to proceed with further rounds would be taken after “consulting with the capitals”.</p><p>But Araghchi cautioned that there was a climate of “mistrust” after the US military attacked Iran’s nuclear sites when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in June, days before a sixth round of similarly mediated indirect talks had been scheduled.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi met with the US and Iranian sides separately multiple times on Friday and conveyed messages between the teams.</p><p>“It was useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress,” he said, adding that the aim is to “reconvene in due course”.</p><p>Consultations “focused on creating appropriate conditions for the resumption of diplomatic and technical negotiations”, according to a statement from Oman’s Foreign Ministry.</p><p>The talks in Muscat come as US President Donald Trump considers military options against Iran. The US has moved the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/iran-prepares-for-war-as-us-military-armada-approaches\">USS Abraham Lincoln supercarrier</a> and supporting warships and fighter jets near Iranian waters, strengthened air defences in bases used by the US military across the region, while US forces also shot down an Iranian drone this week.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran if it does not reach a new agreement with the US on several issues.</p><h2 id=\"red-lines\">Red lines</h2><p>The US wants Iran to fully abandon enriching uranium, even at the 3.67 percent civilian-use rate agreed under the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that Trump unilaterally abandoned in 2018. Iran used to enrich up to 60 percent before its main nuclear facilities were destroyed or significantly damaged by US bombs in June.</p><p>Washington also wants to limit the range of Iran’s ballistic missiles – the main tool in the country’s arsenal – and ensure that Tehran’s aligned armed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Syria will no longer receive any military or financial support.</p><p>Several European powers have expressed support for the US demands, as has the far-right government in Israel, which wants to undermine a substantive military rival in the region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But the Iranian government has repeatedly emphasised that it will only negotiate on nuclear issues to lift sanctions and de-escalate, saying that discussions on missiles or any other subject were a red line. As Araghchi reiterated on Friday, it also wants the US threats of war to end.</p><p>Iranian commanders have also said they remain highly prepared for a regional-scale war, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on Thursday showed a new test launch of one of the country’s top ballistic missiles.</p><p>Iranian Press TV said the Khorramshahr-4 missile, capable of reaching Israel and US bases across the region, was put on a mobile launcher taken out from <a href=\"/news/2023/2/7/iran-unveils-underground-base-in-response-to-us-israel-exercises\">an underground base</a>.</p><p>Yadollah Javani, the political deputy for the IRGC, said that “unveiling the missile means that although we have sat down at the negotiating table, we will not give up our military power”.</p><h2 id=\"conditions-more-severe-than-war\">‘Conditions more severe than war’</h2><p>People in Iran are closely following the developments.</p><p>But there are fewer signs of the cautious optimism seen during five rounds of previous negotiations held last year in the lead-up to the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/24/is-the-12-day-israel-iran-war-really-over-and-who-gained\">12-day war with Israel</a>.</p><p>Soroush, a Tehran resident, told Al Jazeera he hopes the negotiations can lift the shadow of war hanging over Iran.</p><p>“War not only brings fear and anxiety, but also doubles the economic pressure,” he said, as the country deals with one of the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/irans-economy-falters-as-internet-shutdown-hits-people-businesses-hard\">highest inflation rates in the world</a>.</p><p>But another resident, Maryam, said she believes the negotiations will not succeed “and will definitely lead to war”, due to clashing positions of the two sides.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Angered by the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/iran-rejects-un-rights-resolution-condemning-protest-killings\">unprecedented killings of thousands</a> during last month’s nationwide protests and frustrated by a prolonged state of unpredictability and pressure, some are actually welcoming a military escalation.</p><p>“War is not a good thing, but the conditions we are living in now are, in many ways, larger and more severe than war itself,” said Amir from the capital. “I don’t think that with war, something worse than what already exists will happen.”</p><p>The Iranian government says that 3,117 people were killed during the protests, and that “terrorists” and “rioters” were to blame, not state forces. It also released a controversial list of victims this week that has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/questions-after-irans-government-releases-victim-list-in-protest-killings\">only raised more questions</a>.</p><p>The United Nations and international human rights organisations say they have documented widespread use of lethal weapons by state forces, as well as attacks on hospitals and medical staff helping wounded protesters. Rights groups say the actual death toll is likely far higher than the official figure.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He is being investigated for economic corruption.</p><p>He was Norway’s prime minister from 1996 to 1997 and, afterwards, served as foreign affairs minister from 2000 to 2001. He was also head of parliament (stortingspresident) from 2005 to 2009.</p><p>However, Jagland’s association with Epstein is linked to his time as secretary-general of the Council of Europe, formed to protect human rights on the continent, and his simultaneous leadership of the Nobel Committee.</p><p>He joined the Norwegian Nobel Committee as chairman in 2009. He was later demoted to ordinary member in 2015 after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese rights activist Liu Xiaobo, prompting outrage from China. His demotion was seen as a peace offering to Beijing.</p><p>During this time, Jagland was also serving as head of the Council of Europe – he completed two terms from 2009 to 2019. His critics at the time alleged he did not do enough to fight corruption and that he was overly friendly towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>On Thursday this week, Norwegian police said it is investigating whether Jagland received gifts, loans and travel benefits while serving in those positions after emails between him and Epstein emerged in the released documents last Friday.</p><p>Authorities did not provide details as to whether Epstein or people in his network offered those benefits, but Pal K Lonseth, head of a special police economic crimes unit, Okokrim, told reporters that what was revealed in the files “provides a basis for investigating whether these are criminal offences”.</p><p>Several Norwegian publications have reported that the new files revealed plans Jagland made for a family visit to Epstein’s private Caribbean island in 2014, but say the trip was later cancelled.</p><p>Speaking to Norwegian state broadcaster NRK, Jagland’s lawyer Anders Brosveet denied the claims and said there was “no question” as to whether the politician received any benefits.</p><p>“Based on the information we have found so far, we believe it is quite simple to clarify that this is not a transfer of benefits,” he said.</p><p>Following the release of the Epstein files, Jagland stated via his lawyers that his contact with Epstein had been “unwise” and that he “never” related to Epstein around his private life or his “dealings with young girls”.</p><p>While Jagland enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution as a former Council of Europe head, the Norwegian police have asked the institution to revoke his protections.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4257561\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257561\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4257561\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T145607Z_1188291971_RC2Q5JAVYDLD_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769009464.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C510&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump gestures, as he stands next to the President and CEO of the World Economic Forum Borge Brende during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF), in Davos, Switzerland, January 21, 2026.

He is part of Norway’s opposition Conservative Party.</p><p>The WEF said in a statement after last week’s revelations that a risk committee would probe communications between Brende and Epstein.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/norway-police-probes-former-pm-jagland-over-epstein-ties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Speaking to Al Jazeera,</a> Brende said he had only ever had limited contact with Epstein and that he had been unaware of his past or crimes.</p><p>He said he met Epstein in 2018 at a dinner and that the financier had been presented to him as an “American investor”.</p><p>“This gathering included several other leaders,” he said. “The following year, I attended two similar dinners with Epstein, alongside other diplomats and business leaders. These dinners, and a few mails and SMS messages, were the extent of my interactions with him,” he said.</p><p>Brende also said he regretted not doing more to look into Epstein’s history.</p><p>“I remain committed to learning from this experience and welcome the upcoming independent review, which I indeed requested,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-response-been-in-norway\">What has the response been in Norway?</h2><p>The revelations have prompted demands for further probes in parliament, which Jagland’s Labour Party dominates.</p><p>Foreign Affairs Minister Espen Barth Eide, also from Labour, said in a statement on Thursday that he had acted on a request from the police and reached out to the Council of Europe to remove Jagland’s immunity.</p><p>However, opposition parties, including the Conservative Party, which is the main opposition, are demanding that the government set up an independent investigation committee to probe the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>“What everyone is questioning now is whether this is the tip of the iceberg. Whether this is a culture that exists at the top of Norwegian politics and the foreign service,” Sylvi Listhaug, head of the opposition Progress Party, said in parliament on Thursday, according to the NRK broadcaster.</p><p>Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, of the Labour Party, who has backed the police investigation, has, however, responded to the demand, saying an investigative committee is not “the right instrument to shed light on the matter”, NRK reported.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293029\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293029\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293029\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-12-10T133552Z_1481862617_RC2PDIAQ9FO3_RTRMADP_3_NOBEL-PRIZE-PEACE-1770388176.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mette-Marit\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4293029\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Norway’s Crown Prince Haakon, Crown Princess Mette-Marit and Princess Ingrid Alexandra attend the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony at Oslo City Hall in Oslo, Norway, December 10, 2025 [Ole Berg-Rusten/NTB/via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-crown-princess-mette-marit-linked-to-epstein\">How is Crown Princess Mette-Marit linked to Epstein?</h2><p>Meanwhile, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, 52, is also in the spotlight over her alleged close relationship with Epstein as documented by emails included in the files released by the US Justice Department.</p><p>Her friendship with Epstein was already known. The latest tranche of documents, however, provides a much clearer picture of the nature of her relationship with him, with hundreds of messages sent over several years.</p><p>They included a 2012 email from Mette-Marit to Epstein in which she asked him: “Is it inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my I5 yr old sons wallpaper?”</p><p>Epstein then replied, “Let them decide,” and advised that the mother should “stay out of it.”</p><p>In a separate email, Epstein told Mette-Marit he was in Paris “on my wife hunt” but that “i prefer Scandinavians.”</p><p>In response, Mette-Marit said Paris was “good for adultery” but that “Scandis” were “better wife material”.</p><p>In a statement following the documents’ release, the crown princess said she felt “deep sympathy and solidarity” with the girls abused by Epstein.</p><p>She said she took responsibility for “not having investigated Epstein’s background more thoroughly” and also expressed regret for “having had any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.”</p><p>Separately, Mette-Marit’s eldest son, Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, whom she had referred to in her emails to Epstein, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/son-of-norways-crown-princess-denies-rape-as-trial-opens\">appeared in court</a> this week on multiple charges, including rape and domestic violence.</p><p>He denied charges of rape and filming people without their consent in court on Wednesday, but admitted to transporting drugs and speeding while driving.</p><p>Hoiby was first arrested in August 2024 on suspicion of assault. His trial will continue until March.</p><p>Amongst the evidence against him, police say, are incriminating videos stored on his phone, including one that allegedly shows him assaulting a woman who was incapacitated at his parents’ Skaugum estate, west of Oslo, in December 2018. He is alleged to have raped four women.</p><p>Hoiby holds no royal title. He was born when Mette-Marit, a non-royal, was in a relationship before her 2001 marriage to the heir, Prince Haakon. He has previously spoken about mental health issues and a struggle with substance abuse.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

They took whatever came; now, we can be selective,” he said, adding, “We can easily absorb another million. I used to tell Putin always, what we need is just one more million.”</p><p>Barak said that Russians would come to Israel first without preconditions, but added, “Under the social pressure of the need, especially of the second generation to adapt, it will happen.”</p><h2 id=\"some-are-welcome-others-not\">Some are welcome, others not</h2><p>The government of Israel has actively promoted immigration into the country for decades. Americans and the French are especially welcome, and many end up moving to illegal settlements and espousing domination of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank, in which they have no previous links.</p><p>As recently as November, the government revealed that new immigrants and returning residents arriving in 2026 will be offered a zero-percent income tax rate for their first two years in the country.</p><p>Under the reform, which was introduced as part of the 2026 state budget, returning residents who lived abroad for 10 or more years and new immigrants who move to Israel in 2026 will pay no income tax in 2026 and 2027; the rates will be gradually increased, according to the Israeli media.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But a large wave of immigration into the country, when tens of thousands from the Beta Israel community were transferred to Israel from Ethiopia in the 1980s and 1990s, has exposed deep-seated racism.</p><p>Beta Israel was widely seen as the main and oldest Jewish presence in Ethiopia.</p><p>These Ethiopian Israelis have faced racism, exclusion and police violence against their communities.

It represents the biggest Shia bloc in the Iraqi parliament.</p><p>The loose nature of the coalition that makes up the CF means that opinions on al-Maliki’s candidacy are varied, with some opposing it, others willing to bend to Trump’s will and switch their backing, and still others who are adamant that they will push forward.</p><p>And it seems as though the majority are in the latter camp.</p><p>The CF issued a statement on Saturday reiterating its support for al-Maliki. “Choosing the prime minister is an exclusively Iraqi constitutional matter … free from foreign interference,” the statement added.</p><p>The statement reflects the position of various pro-Maliki forces in the CF, including former deputy parliament speaker Mohsen al-Mandalawi; the Badr Organization, led by Hadi al-Amir; and the Islamic Supreme Council, led by cleric Humam Hamoudi.</p><p>Current Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, whose party received the most votes in the elections but who did not receive the CF nomination despite his membership within it, is also officially supportive of al-Maliki’s nomination, even if he has not abandoned the possibility of continuing as prime minister himself.</p><p>Several of these factions did well in last year’s parliamentary elections, including al-Maliki’s own State of Law Coalition, as well as Badr and al-Sudani’s Reconstruction and Development Coalition.</p><p>But, with support from Kurdish and Sunni parties, the Shia al-Maliki sceptics have enough seats, and enough of a voice, to block the nomination if they desire to do so.</p><p>These include important Shia figures such as Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq group; Ammar al-Hakim, the leader of the National State Forces alliance; and former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.</p><p>Al-Hakim, whose parliamentary bloc has 18 seats, warned that there would be “incoming economic repercussions” if al-Maliki was chosen, and added that “public interest must be prioritised over private interests”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Victory Alliance, led by al-Abadi, issued a statement calling for “[the prioritisation of] the people’s vital interests given the exceptional circumstances Iraq and the region are experiencing”. Al-Abadi’s group has no seats in parliament, but retains an important voice within the CF.</p><p>Both statements contain a tacit acknowledgment of Iraq’s inability to withstand US pressure and the need for an alternative candidate suited to the current reality.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"other-roadblocks\">Other roadblocks</h2><p>The CF, therefore, still has an uphill battle to confirm al-Maliki as prime minister. Outside of the Shia political groups, there is also <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/25/what-al-malikis-return-would-mean-for-iraq-and-the-region\">opposition to al-Maliki</a>, a divisive figure remembered negatively by many Iraqis, particularly Sunnis.</p><p>And there are also divisions within the non-Shia groups that are also slowing down the nomination process.</p><p>Under the Iraqi Constitution, parliament must first elect a president for Iraq, who then mandates the nominee of the largest parliamentary bloc to form the government. According to Iraq’s post-2003 “muhasasa” system of dividing political offices by sect and ethnicity, the prime minister must be a Shia, the president a Kurd, and the parliamentary speaker a Sunni.</p><p>To date, the main Kurdish factions – the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Masoud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Bafel Talabani – have failed to agree on a consensus candidate for the presidency.</p><p>The CF is attempting to broker an agreement between the Kurds. Recent efforts included a delegation led by al-Sudani meeting with both parties, and a personal visit by al-Maliki to Barzani. But these initiatives have not yet succeeded, and without a political agreement on the presidency, the process of designating a prime minister cannot proceed.</p><p>And even if the Kurds reach an agreement and don’t stand in the way of al-Maliki, the CF must persuade a long list of the former prime minister’s opponents.</p><p>Among them is Mohammed al-Halbousi, former speaker of parliament and leader of the Takadum Party, who issued a statement prior to the US veto implicitly rejecting al-Maliki’s candidacy.</p><p>Collectively, the anti-al-Maliki groups could gather roughly a third of the seats in parliament, enough to prevent a presidential election session due to a lack of quorum.</p><p>To avoid that scenario, the CF would have to either reset internal negotiations regarding the next prime minister, or nominate al-Sudani for a second term.</p><p>Al-Sudani’s party issued a statement on January 28 calling for “positive relationships with the United States” – a move interpreted as an indirect pitch for his renewal, leveraging his proven track record of managing relations with Washington during his tenure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-leverage\">US leverage</h2><p>The US may no longer be the occupying power in Iraq, but it still has enormous economic leverage over the country.</p><p>The revenue from Iraq’s main export – oil – is routed through the US Federal Reserve Bank in New York.</p><p>Trump may decide not to renew a presidential executive order, issued originally by President George W Bush in the wake of the Iraq War, that grants legal protection for the oil revenue funds and prevents them from being frozen by Iraq’s creditors. The order had been expected to be renewed as a formality upon its expiration in May.</p><p>If the US president decides against renewal, creditors will seek to claim their funds, and New York courts may issue rulings to freeze the Iraqi assets. This would disrupt the transfer of funds necessary to pay public salaries and sustain the economy for months or even years. In practical terms, the Iraqi economy would grind to a halt.</p><p>That therefore explains why the pro-al-Maliki bloc in the CF is attempting to persuade the US to change its position, rather than simply ignore Trump.</p><p>A high-ranking source in the CF’s State of Law coalition, who wished to remain anonymous in order to speak freely on the topic, told Al Jazeera there are “ongoing attempts to convince the US administration to lift the veto on al-Maliki”.</p><p>Aqeel al-Fatlawi, the State of Law spokesperson, also said he was hopeful that the US “will change its stance in the coming period”.</p><p>While blaming regional states, including Turkiye and Syria, for the US position towards him, al-Maliki himself has sought to soften his positions.</p><p>Syria has been one of the main points of difference between al-Maliki and the US, which has backed Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa, even as the former Iraqi prime minister has denounced him for his past membership of al-Qaeda.</p><p>In a televised interview on Tuesday, al-Maliki used al-Sharaa’s full name, rather than the Syrian leader’s nom de guerre of “al-Jolani”, an attempt to emphasise that he was willing to move on from the past. Al-Maliki also attempted to soften his stance towards the Syrian government, directing his criticism towards the former regime of ousted President Bashar al-Assad and its role in supporting “terrorism” in Iraq.</p><p>Whether these attempts will go far enough to placate the US remains to be seen.</p><p>Reports indicate that US Special Envoy to Iraq Mark Savaya may have been removed from his position, although there is no official confirmation. His replacement would likely be Tom Barrack, currently the US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy to Syria.</p><p>The CF favours Savaya, who has proven to be more supportive of using a more gradual approach in reducing the power of Iraq’s Shia militias, versus Barrack, who is viewed by the CF more negatively for his role in weakening Hezbollah in Lebanon and his support for Syria’s al-Sharaa.</p><p>An official announcement of a change could indicate where Trump’s thoughts are in the critical next few weeks – and whether the president will choose to not renew the US guarantee to protect Iraq’s oil revenue in May.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

All her efforts, along with the expenses she endured, have been to no avail.</p><p>“I have adhered to the prescribed medications without fail. My body regains strength for a short time, but I fall sick again. This has exhausted my health and my finances,” she said.</p><p>Hadeel says she has lost faith in health facilities in Yemen, where the country’s more than decade-long war has taken a heavy toll on the healthcare system.

Houthi officials accuse regional and international actors of banning the resumption of flights.</p><p>The director of Sanaa International Airport, Khalid al-Shaef, said in December that the “American-Saudi-Emirati aggression alliance” continues imposing a blockade on the airport.</p><p>Al-Shaef noted that more than 500,000 Yemeni patients are registered as critical cases in urgent need of immediate travel, describing the ban on the airport as a “war crime not subject to a statute of limitations”.</p><p>Tayseer al-Samei, a media officer at the Ministry of Public Health and Population in central Yemen’s Taiz province, told Al Jazeera that thousands of patients in Yemen die while waiting for a flight.</p><p>“The patients are denied the right to travel for treatment purposes, which means they are denied the right to life,” al-Samei said.</p><p>He indicated that some diseases, such as cancer, are often not treatable in Yemen, which necessitates treatment abroad for those who can afford it.</p><p>“In Taiz alone, the health authorities documented 1,967 cases of cancer in 2025, recording a 21 percent increase compared to the previous year,” al-Samei said.</p><p>In late December, the Minister of Public Health and Population of the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/regained-momentum-sets-yemen-governments-eyes-on-houthis-in-the-north\">UN-recognised government</a>, Qasim Buhaibeh, revealed that authorities record 30,000 new cancer cases annually in the country.</p><p>Al-Samei posed a sobering question: “How many of these patients would have been saved if the airports were operating and medical evacuation were possible?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"high-cost-of-misdiagnosis\">High cost of misdiagnosis</h2><p>A faulty diagnosis or botched operation can turn a patient’s life into a misery.

However, the result was not what they expected.</p><p>“That wound expanded instead and became cancerous,” said Maram. That forced him to travel for treatment abroad three months ago.</p><p>To catch a flight, he had to travel from Sanaa to the southern port city of Aden, under the control of the government. “My father spent 15 hours on a bus to reach Aden Airport. If Sanaa Airport were operational, that would have taken him only 15 minutes to the terminal,” she added.</p><p>Suad, a doctor in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that particular medical appliances in some clinics or hospitals are increasingly outdated. This shortage of modern equipment severely compromises the accuracy of diagnostic tests, particularly for cancer screenings and prenatal care.</p><p>She shared a story of a patient who visited her three months ago. The woman, two months pregnant, arrived suffering from nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.</p><p>“Using an ultrasound, I checked the fetal pulse. It was zero. I informed the patient of the fetal demise,” Suad said.</p><p>However, the woman was not happy with the news. She went to another clinic and did a second ultrasound. There, the practitioner told her the fetal pulse was weak but still there.</p><p>“She clung to that result because she did not want a miscarriage,” said Suad. Two months later, the patient’s body began to swell, and the fetus had to be removed to save the mother’s life.</p><p>Suad emphasised that many clinics and health centres need to be equipped with modern medical appliances, which can provide accurate results to spare patients unnecessary suffering.</p><p>“This is the shared responsibility of the Yemeni authorities, the private sector, and international humanitarian organisations to ensure that reliable medical testing is accessible to patients,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"aid-cuts-claiming-lives\">Aid cuts claiming lives</h2><p>Ahmed Yahya has worked as an aid worker with multiple local and foreign humanitarian organisations in rural areas of Yemen’s Hodeidah and Raymah provinces during the war.</p><p>The aid offered to the health sector, he told Al Jazeera, has saved lives, improved the personal health of countless people, and kept health facilities functional.</p><p>UN reports say more than 450 facilities in Yemen have already closed, and thousands more are at risk of losing funding.</p><p>“Medications, medical appliances and health-related training programmes have been among the aid packages humanitarian organisations have provided to different areas of Yemen. Without such health aid, death would have taken many more lives,” Yahya said.</p><p>The declining aid is a grave and increasingly visible concern. “Lately, humanitarian organisations have largely reduced their aid programmes in the areas where I have engaged in humanitarian activities.”</p><p>He added, “For example, therapeutic nutrition for malnourished children and pregnant and lactating women has decreased over the past year. The reduction seems set to continue this year.”</p><p>The UN itself has acknowledged the situation.</p><p>On January 19, Harneis, the UN coordinator, said: “For 10 years, the UN and humanitarian organisations were able to improve mortality and improve morbidity … this year, that’s not going to be the case.”</p><p>Last month, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) indicated that Yemen’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan is just 25 percent funded.</p><p>The funding gap has forced agencies to scale back life-saving services across all sectors, leaving millions of Yemenis on the brink of total health collapse.</p><p>The security situation in northern Yemen, where the Houthis govern, presents further challenges.</p><p>Authorities in Sanaa have detained 73 UN aid workers since 2021 on accusations of espionage, prompting UN organisations to suspend operations.</p><p>The Houthi authorities control northern Yemen, where 70 to 80 percent of the country’s 42 million people live.</p><p>This hostile environment forces organisations to stop or scale back their programmes, leaving millions of people in desperate health and living conditions.</p><p>“When aid stops flowing, families feel helpless,” Yahya said. “They lose access to life-saving healthcare and vital assistance.”</p><p>“As long as the war drags on, humanitarian support should continue, and patient evacuation should be facilitated,” he added. “The collective punishment of the population is unfair and inhumane.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He had been rushed to intensive care a day earlier with a dangerously slow heart rate and organ failure. Soon after, he ended his 17-day hunger strike protest.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>She has not heard from him since. The prison informed her on January 28 that he had returned to hospital and was being monitored.</p><p>But Khalid’s mother told Al Jazeera that prison authorities are not forthcoming with further information about his condition or level of care, despite her repeated calls and emails.</p><p>“I fear for his life,” she told Al Jazeera on Friday. “Mentally, he’s probably stressed and distraught.</p><p>“We’re not having contact with anybody. I hope he’s doing OK, but I don’t know because I don’t know what’s wrong with him.”</p><p>She said that when they last spoke, Khalid sounded tired and complained of a dry mouth; towards the end of his hunger strike, he had also been refusing liquids in an escalation of his protest.</p><p>“He was just lying down and taking some rest because he just felt really tired. He was too weak to stand up,” she said.</p><p>In a statement to Al Jazeera, the UK Ministry of Justice said prisoners were managed in line with policy.</p><p>“This includes regular checks by medical professionals, heart monitoring and blood tests, and support to help them eat and drink again. If deemed appropriate by healthcare teams, prisoners will be taken to hospital,” a spokesperson said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Khalid is among five activists accused of breaking into the UK’s largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, last June and spray-painting two Voyager refuelling and transport planes.

Critics have condemned the ban as illiberal overreach, given that the direct action group’s <a href=\"/video/the-take-2/2025/7/10/is-direct-action-for-palestine-terrorism-the-uk-says-it-is\">stated objective</a> is to counter Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians and what it says is British complicity in it by disrupting the UK arms industry.</p><p>Earlier this week, a jury <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/uk-pro-palestinian-activists-not-guilty-of-aggravated-burglary\">acquitted</a> six other Palestine Action-linked detainees of aggravated burglary during a 2024 raid on ⁠a factory operated by the Israeli defence firm Elbit in Bristol.</p><p>Khalid, who suffers from limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes muscle weakness and wasting, is part of a collective of eight remand prisoners linked to Palestine Action that began a rolling hunger strike in November. All have since ended their protests.</p><p>Friends and family of the other hunger strikers have previously told Al Jazeera that when their loved ones were hospitalised, prison authorities did not provide regular updates about their health.</p><p>His trial date is set for January 2027, by which time he would have spent a year and a half in prison – well beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This leads to less liquidity, so any move higher or lower is exacerbated.”</p><p>He explained that the crypto market relies heavily on “hype-driven” cycles where people buy due to a fear of “missing out” on an opportunity.</p><p>“This hype forms the foundation of trading volumes, and that is what we mean by liquidity. Essentially, more trading volumes mean more liquidity, as it makes it easier to quickly buy and sell Bitcoin,” he said.</p><p>“Right now, that foundation is disappearing and this tends to happen during bear markets or ‘crypto winters’, making it much harder to effectively trade assets, and they become even less appealing then. So it’s quite a vicious circle that leads to these downward spirals,” he added.</p><p>A “crypto winter” is an extended period of declining or stagnant prices, something that can be driven by worsening macroeconomic conditions or tightening market regulations, among other reasons.</p><p>Volatility in gold and silver prices in the past two weeks has also dampened market sentiment, affecting the price of cryptocurrencies. Analysts say geopolitical instability and the prospects of a rising US dollar have led investors to sell precious metals, resulting in the sudden downturn.</p><p>Then, last week, prices came back sharply, with the price of gold hitting a record peak of almost $5,595 an ounce, while silver hit an all-time high of nearly $122.</p><p>But this peak did not last long, and this week, the prices of these precious commodities plunged – again – with gold falling to $4,872.83 per ounce on Thursday and silver falling to $77.36 an ounce.</p><p>Other cryptocurrencies like Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, have also fallen. The price of Ether has fallen by 19 percent this week, closing at $1,854 late on Thursday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"does-this-mean-crypto-friendly-policies-in-the-us-aren-t-working\">Does this mean ‘crypto-friendly’ policies in the US aren’t working?</h2><p>The price of Bitcoin soared after United States President Donald Trump’s return to the White House last year, with analysts expecting he would adopt a “crypto-friendly” regulatory regime.</p><p>At a Bitcoin conference in July 2024, as part of his pre-election rally, Trump had said the US is the “crypto capital of the planet” and pledged to also create a Bitcoin “strategic reserve” if he became president.</p><p>In March 2025, on taking office, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/3/4/trump-announces-us-crypto-reserve-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters\">announced</a> his government would create a national strategic crypto reserve which would include five cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and Ether as well as smaller currencies XRP, Cardano and Solana.</p><p>In July last year, Trump also <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/18/trump-says-newly-signed-crypto-law-will-establish-american-dominance\">announced</a> the GENIUS Act, a new cryptocurrency legislation that would establish regulations and consumer protections for “stablecoin”, a type of cryptocurrency whose value is linked to a fixed currency or commodity.</p><p>Then, last month, the US also unveiled draft legislation that would create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, which, if signed into law, would clarify financial regulators’ jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency sector.</p><p>The US president has a personal interest as his family owns the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/is-trumps-pardon-of-binance-boss-changpeng-zhao-a-conflict-of-interest\">cryptofirm</a> World Liberty Financial (WLFI).</p><p>Last March, WLFI launched its own “stablecoin” – a dollar-pegged cryptocoin backed by US treasuries – called USD1.</p><p>But the president’s personal interest in cryptocurrencies and supportive policies have not shielded the digital asset from external market factors.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"have-we-seen-crypto-winters-before\">Have we seen ‘crypto winters’ before?</h2><p>Yes.</p><p>A crypto winter was triggered after Bitcoin peaked in December 2017 and then tumbled in December 2018 due to intense regulatory crackdowns in the US, Canada and other countries, among other reasons.</p><p>Another such winter occurred in November 2022 after a peak in October 2021, due to the <a href=\"/economy/2022/11/11/distressed-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-bankruptcy#:~:text=The%20trading%20platform%20had%20been,after%20a%20wave%20of%20withdrawals.\">FTX currency exchange scandal</a>. In November that year, crypto exchange FTX initiated US bankruptcy proceedings after a liquidity crisis prompted intervention from regulators around the world.</p><p>In a Thursday briefing note, analysts at Kaiko said the downward trend in prices “truly accelerated” after Trump appointed Kevin Warsh as the new Federal Reserve Chair.</p><p>Warsh will replace Jeremy Powell, who Trump has lambasted for not lowering interest rates.</p><p>The Kaiko briefing note stated: “Powell’s recent announcement on January 28th that interest rates would remain unchanged, combined with the appointment of the new Chairman, constituted a true turning point, acting as a catalyst for a sharp acceleration of the decline. The reaction was all the more pronounced given that the crypto market, particularly sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic regime, was already weakened,” the report said.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>Hougan noted that crypto winters typically last for about 13 months and assured investors that the current “winter” will not last for long.</p><p>“As a veteran of multiple crypto winters, I can tell you that the end of those crypto winters feels a lot like now: Despair, desperation, and malaise. But there is nothing about the current market pullback that’s changed anything fundamental about crypto,” he said in his report.</p><p>“I think we’re going to come roaring back sooner rather than later. Heck, it’s been winter since January 2025. Spring is surely coming soon,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"
