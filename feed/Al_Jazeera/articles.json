            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On Christmas Day this year, Tarique Rahman – the heir apparent of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the man many believe could be the country’s next prime minister – returned home and stepped directly into a power vacuum that has been steadily widening since the collapse of the Awami League government in August 2024.</p><p>After 17 years in exile, Rahman’s act of touching the soil was carefully staged for the cameras, but its consequences are structural rather than symbolic. Bangladesh today is a state without a steady pulse, and his return has brought the country’s brief post-revolutionary interlude to an end.</p><p>Five days later, on December 30, the political moment hardened into historical finality. Khaleda Zia – the former prime minister and wife of BNP founder and former Bangladesh President Ziaur Rahman – died after a prolonged illness, severing the last living link to the party’s original leadership generation.</p><p>Rahman is no longer Khaleda Zia’s successor. He is now the leader of the BNP as it heads towards elections on February 12.</p><p>The nation Rahman left in 2008 was fractured; the one he inhabits now is structurally compromised. The hurried flight of Sheikh Hasina to India after the uprising against her ended a decade and a half of autocratic rule but left behind a hollowed-out bureaucracy and a social contract in shreds.</p><p>While Muhammad Yunus’s interim administration attempts to manage the transition, street power has already begun to bypass formal authority. In this volatility, Rahman’s presence acts as a high-voltage conductor for the BNP, providing a focal point for an opposition that was, until recently, systematically suppressed.</p><p>For millions who viewed the last decade of elections under Hasina’s authoritarian grip as foregone conclusions, Rahman represents the return of choice.</p><p>Yet Rahman is no insurgent outsider; he is the ultimate product of the system he seeks to lead. As the son of two former leaders of the country, he carries the weight of a dynastic legacy closely associated with the patronage networks that have long hobbled Bangladeshi governance. His earlier proximity to power was marked by allegations of informal authority and corruption – charges that continue to serve as political ammunition for his detractors. To supporters, he is a victim of judicial overreach; to critics, he is evidence of why Bangladesh’s democratic experiments so often collapse under the weight of elite impunity.</p><p>This duality defines the tension of his return. Rahman is now attempting a pivot, trading the rhetoric of street agitation for the measured cadence of a statesman. His recent speeches – emphasizing minority protection, national unity, and the rule of law – suggest a leader acutely aware that the youth who helped dislodge Hasina will not accept a simple change in the identity of the ruling elite.</p><p>The BNP he now leads faces a Bangladesh that is more globally integrated and less patient with opaque politics. If Rahman takes power, pressure to reform the judiciary and the Election Commission will be immediate. Without institutional credibility, any mandate he secures will have a dangerously short shelf life.</p><p>Economically, Rahman is likely to pursue pragmatic continuity. Bangladesh’s dependence on garment exports and foreign investment leaves little room for ideological experimentation. The real test will be internal discipline. The temptation to settle old scores and reward loyalists through the same rent-seeking channels used by previous regimes will be immense. History suggests this is where Bangladeshi leaders fail – and the country’s current economic fragility leaves no margin for such indulgence.</p><p>The most delicate arena, however, will be foreign policy – specifically, relations with India. For years, New Delhi found a predictable, if transactional, partner in Sheikh Hasina. The BNP, by contrast, has long been viewed by Indian security circles with suspicion and strategic unease.</p><p>Rahman now appears to be signalling a reset, moving away from nationalist antagonism towards what he describes as “balanced sovereignty”. He understands that while Bangladesh must recalibrate its relationship with India to satisfy domestic sentiment, it cannot afford hostility with its most consequential neighbour. For India, the challenge is accepting that a stable, pluralistic Bangladesh – even under a familiar rival – is preferable to a perpetually unstable one.</p><p>Ultimately, Rahman’s return is a stress test not just for Bangladesh, but for the idea of democratic choice in South Asia itself. This is not a simple dynastic succession; it is a reckoning. After years of enforced stability and managed outcomes, the reintroduction of political uncertainty is, paradoxically, a sign of democratic life.</p><p>Whether Tarique Rahman uses this opening to rebuild institutions he once bypassed – or reverts to the habits of the past – will determine more than his personal legacy. It will decide whether Bangladesh can finally break its cycle of exile and revenge, or whether it is merely preparing for the next collapse.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

At the same time, the US has handed China a new opportunity to assert its dominance in its own back yard, including on its claim to self-governing Taiwan, say analysts.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Under the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, recently revived by US President Donald Trump, the Western Hemisphere falls under the US sphere of influence – and the US only.</p><p>Trump invoked the doctrine in his latest national security strategy published late last year. Originally intended to keep Europe out of the Western Hemisphere, Trump’s version emphasises the need to counter China’s presence there.</p><p>The “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine states the US wants a Western Hemisphere that “remains free of hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets, and that supports critical supply chains” in an oblique reference to China.</p><p>ABC News and CNN on Tuesday reported that the Trump administration was demanding that Venezuela cut ties with China, Iran, Russia and Cuba before it would be allowed to resume oil production.</p><p>The White House declined to confirm or deny the reports, which cited unnamed sources.</p><p>Trump has previously taken issue with Chinese investment in the region and claimed, incorrectly, during his inauguration speech last year that China was in control of the Panama Canal.</p><p>Since US forces captured Maduro last week, Trump has also revived claims that the US should “acquire” Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, to protect US national security.</p><p>He claimed this week that the Arctic island was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/do-russia-and-china-pose-a-national-security-threat-to-the-us-in-greenland\">inundated with “Russian and Chinese ships</a>,” although there is no evidence to support his claim.</p><p>“China is likely to read this as confirmation that the US is explicitly comfortable with hemispheric spheres of influence,” said Simona Grano, head of research on China-Taiwan relations at the University of Zurich’s Institute for Asian and Oriental Studies.</p><p>China immediately condemned Maduro’s abduction by US special forces as a “clear violation of international law” and urged Washington to “stop toppling the government of Venezuela”.</p><p>But the return of these spheres “cuts both ways for Beijing,” said Grano.</p><p>“On the one hand, it underscores the vulnerability of China’s investments and partnerships in Latin America; on the other, it may reinforce Chinese perceptions that Washington would find it harder to credibly oppose similar logic in East Asia, even if the Taiwan case is far more sensitive and escalatory,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>China has pledged to annex Taiwan by peace or by force if necessary and regards Taipei’s Democratic Progressive Party, which heads the democratically elected government, as separatists.</p><p>Diplomatically isolated Taiwan is only recognised by 11 countries and the Holy See, but it has unofficial backing from the US, which has pledged to help Taipei defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances.</p><p>While Beijing regards Taiwan as an “internal” matter, Trump’s policy regarding “spheres of influence” could offer it another way to discuss Taiwan on the world stage, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and an assistant professor at National Taiwan University.</p><p>“I do think that America has created more global precedent for large powers to take action against other states beyond their jurisdiction,” Nachman told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Though China is unlikely to act militarily against Taiwan in the near future, “it will now have an easier time justifying military action if and when the day comes,” Nachman said.</p><p>Taiwan is not the only place Beijing may consider to fall under its “sphere of influence”. China claims much of the South China Sea and has ongoing territorial disputes there with Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taipei, while it also claims the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.</p><p>Disputes between China and India on its eastern border have ended in deadly clashes, including a 1962 border war and more recent skirmishes since 2020.</p><p>On Chinese social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin and Weibo, Venezuela has been a major talking point over the past week, with some netizens drawing parallels to Taiwan.</p><p>“Since the US can illegally invade Venezuela and arrest its president, the [Chinese military] can legitimately and legally exercise its national sovereignty over unification,” one Weibo user wrote in a post that received more than 1,000 comments.</p><p>The White House has characterised Maduro’s abduction as a law enforcement operation, and its air strikes on the waters around Venezuela as a defensive move to stem the flow of drugs into the US. None of Venezuela’s neighbours has interceded, although they have condemned Trump’s actions.</p><p>While critics have rejected the Trump administration’s framing of the kidnapping as a law and order move, that approach, too, appears to have prompted suggestions from some on Chinese social media on how Beijing could try to take Taiwan.</p><p>“First, issue arrest warrants for pro-independence elements, then send people to search for them,” a Weibo user said.</p><p>“During this process, there will inevitably be people who obstruct us, so we will use the military to overcome the obstruction,” another Weibo user said. “This term is good: law enforcement action, which is more applicable to our internal province of Taiwan.”</p><p>Experts agreed that the Maduro abduction in Venezuela would not immediately change China’s plans for Taiwan, which Grano described as “categorically different from Latin America in terms of escalation and alliance dynamics”.</p><p>A conflict with Taiwan could quickly draw in the US and potentially its treaty ally Japan, whose Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any attack or blockade of Taiwan would be a “survival-threatening situation for Japan,” potentially justifying the use of force. It could also dramatically affect global shipping routes through the strategically important Taiwan Strait.</p><p>Beijing has also not ruled out peaceful means of taking control of the democracy of 23 million people.</p><p>At the same time, “many [Chinese] netizens expressed shock at the United States’ unilateral handling of Maduro, with some commenting that the incident underscored a belief that only a strong country can avoid being bullied,” Jiang Jiang, chief editor of the China-focused newsletter Ginger River Review and a researcher at the Xinhua Institute think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Maduro’s arrest has shown Beijing that Trump is ready and willing to act on perceived threats, said William Yang, senior analyst for Northeast Asia at the Crisis Group.</p><p>Trump’s strike on Maduro was preceded by months of threats against the Venezuelan leader over his alleged ties to drug cartels, accompanied by US air strikes on alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The Trump administration has not released any evidence showing that the more than 100 people killed in these boat strikes were drug traffickers, or that the vessels were headed to the US.</p><p>“It’s a warning towards Beijing that the US will be willing to resort to the military option when trying to accomplish the goal of removing certain political forces in Latin America,” Yang told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Qinduo Xu, a Chinese political analyst who hosts a current affairs programme on the state-run CGTN television channel, agreed.</p><p>“It’s a reminder for China that the US is a different power – naked raw power – and they just throw out any kind of rules, international rules, or as long as they see the rules as in their way,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Maduro’s ousting will likely reinforce Beijing’s preference for a model of engagement in Latin America where it does not assume any responsibility for the survival of its partnering governments and leaders, according to experts like Grano.</p><p>For the past 20 years, Venezuela has been one of Beijing’s closest partners in the region. China was the top destination for Venezuelan oil after the US imposed sanctions in 2019, and China has invested $4.8bn in Venezuela over that period, according to the Rhodium Group.</p><p>Beijing has also loaned the country tens of millions of dollars, of which JP Morgan estimates Venezuela still owes between $13bn and $15bn, according to a recent Reuters report.</p><p>The two sides signed an “all-weather strategic partnership” in 2023 – a diplomatic designation only granted by Beijing to five other countries. The partnership, however, does not include security guarantees, which means China will suffer little reputational damage in the long term as a trusted diplomatic partner for failing to come to Venezuela’s defence militarily, experts said.</p><p>Gabriel Wildau, the managing director of risk analysis company Teneo, told Al Jazeera he expected Chinese officials to remain pragmatic even as the US tries to assert its political sway over its “sphere of influence”.</p><p>“Ultimately … Beijing is likely to keep the bigger picture in mind. China’s leadership does not view relations with Venezuela as a core interest, and maintaining the current US-China detente is likely a higher priority,” he said. Trump is due to visit China in April amid negotiations aimed at resolving an ongoing trade war between the two superpowers that last year threatened to disrupt global commerce with spiralling tit-for-tat tariffs.</p><p>“Trump’s raid on Venezuela suggests that Chinese investments in Latin America now face greater political risks from US meddling in the region,” Gildau said. “Still, Beijing will likely respond by seeking ways to mitigate those risks rather than turning away from the region.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But he blamed Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/israel-bombs-southern-lebanon-saying-it-targeted-hezbollah-and-hamas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">continued military actions</a> and occupation of Lebanese territory along the border as complicating and undermining these efforts.</p><p>On January 8, Haykal will brief Lebanon’s government on the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/first-phase-of-hezbollahs-disarmament-close-to-complete-lebanons-salam\">progress</a> of the disarming mission. He’s expected to announce the completion of the plan’s first phase, which involves clearing the area between the Litani River, about 30km (19 miles) at its deepest point in Lebanon, and the country’s southern border with Israel.</p><p>But Israel already has a verdict on the army’s performance.</p><p>It says Hezbollah still has a presence close to the border and is rebuilding its military capabilities “faster than the army is dismantling [them]”. The United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon has a different take. It says there is “no evidence” that Hezbollah’s infrastructure has been rebuilt.</p><p>Israel also sent another message through its military actions days before the cabinet meeting.</p><p>It carried out intense air strikes on what it said were positions north of the Litani River some kilometres (miles) from the border in what a western diplomat said showed “Israel has no intention to wait for the army to move to the next phase to dismantle Hezbollah’s weapons.”</p><h2 id=\"litani-river\">Litani River</h2><p>“Israel has already shifted focus to phase two,” Joe Macaron, global fellow at the Wilson Center, told Al Jazeera. “And this phase is going to be different, difficult and challenging for the army.”</p><p>The second phase involves operations expanding north of the Litani River up to the Awali River north of the city of Sidon. “Hezbollah has made it clear there will be no disarmament north of the Litani, which means there is the possibility of political tension,” Macaron added.</p><p>Hezbollah, which has dismissed efforts to disarm it as a United States-Israeli plan, believes it has complied with a ceasefire agreement agreed with Israel because it understands the truce to apply “exclusively south of the Litani River”.</p><p>The November 2024 truce ended more than a year of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The group’s critics in Lebanon say the ceasefire calls for the implementation of UN Resolution 1701, which mentions the disarmament of all non-state actors across Lebanon.</p><p>“With the Israeli enemy not implementing any of the steps of the agreement … Lebanon is no longer required to take any action on any level before the Israelis commit to what they are obligated to do,” Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Naim Qassem said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"political-consensus\">Political consensus</h2><p>Hezbollah was long considered the strongest military force in Lebanon, although it has been weakened by the war with Israel, when much of its leadership was killed.</p><p>The group retains the support of Lebanon’s Shia community, which it emerged from.</p><p>“Assuming the Lebanese state and the army commander would try to disarm Hezbollah north of the Litani, Hezbollah and also the majority of the Shia community is going to rise and try to prevent this. They will act and there will be a violent reaction if that scenario will happen,” Ali Rizk, a political and security analyst, told Al Jazeera. “The community feels they are facing a twin threat … one from Israel and the other from the <a href=\"/features/2025/3/24/lebanon-syria-border-clashes-reflect-new-realities-on-the-ground\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new regime in Syria</a>, so that is why they are more supportive of Hezbollah’s weapons.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Lebanese Army commander Hakyal reportedly told a recent military meeting that the army is carefully planning for the next phases of disarmament. Officials know that without political consensus, there is a risk of internal conflict.</p><p>But Lebanon’s leadership, which pledged to reassert full state sovereignty, is under pressure. Israel has publicly said it will act “as necessary” if Lebanon fails to take steps against Hezbollah.</p><p>“The state is ready to move on to the second phase – namely [confiscating weapons] north of the Litani River – based on the plan prepared by the Lebanese army pursuant to a mandate from the government,” Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said.</p><p>And then there is Iran.</p><p>Coinciding with Lebanon’s government meeting, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will arrive in Beirut.</p><p>“There is no doubt there is a link between his visit and the army submitting its report before moving to phase 2,” Rizk explained. “Hezbollah is by far Iran’s number one ideological and strategic ally, and it will stop at nothing to prevent Hezbollah’s complete elimination by getting rid of its weapons.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The warnings prompted Petro to issue a call for Colombians to take to the streets to defend their sovereignty.</p><p>“It was a Great Honour to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>“I appreciated his call and tone and look forward to meeting him in the near future.”</p><p>Trump added “arrangements are being made” for a meeting in Washington between himself and Petro, but gave no specific date for a meeting.</p><p>Petro, Colombia’s first left-wing president, addressed demonstrators who had heeded his call for protests at Bogota’s Plaza Bolivar following the call with Trump. He said a detente was under way and that he had to change his speech at the last minute.</p><p>“If we don’t speak, there is war. Colombia’s history has taught us that,” the former rebel fighter said.</p><p>“And what happened is that we talked and re-established communication for the first time. I talked about two things: Venezuela and the issue of drug trafficking,” he said. “I gave him our numbers of what we are doing to fight drugs.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Petro also accused Colombian politicians of misleading Trump. “Those [people] are responsible for this crisis – let’s call it diplomatic for now, verbal for now – that has erupted between the US and Colombia,” he said.</p><p>Relations between Trump and Petro have been frosty since the Republican returned to the White House in January 2025.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly accused Petro’s administration, without evidence, of enabling a steady flow of ‌cocaine into the US, imposing sanctions on the Colombian leader in October.</p><p>Earlier this week, Trump described Petro as “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and that he should “watch his a**” following the US attack on Venezuela.</p><p>“He’s not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you,” Trump told reporters on Sunday, and said a military operation there “sounds good.”</p><p>For his part, Petro had condemned the US attack on Venezuela as “abhorrent”, convened emergency meetings before the United Nations and the Organization of American States and even threatened to take up arms again to defend Colombia.</p><p>Petro and Trump also sparred last year when Colombia initially banned deportation flights from the US.  Washington in September also ⁠revoked Petro’s visa after he joined a pro-Palestinian demonstration in New York following a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly and called on American soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump”.</p><p>Petro, who has been a vocal opponent of Israel’s war in Gaza, had accused ‌Trump of being “complicit in genocide” in Gaza and called for “criminal proceedings” over US missile attacks on suspected drug-running boats in Caribbean waters.</p><p>Despite the tensions, for Colombia, the US remains critical to the military’s fight against left-wing rebels and drug traffickers. Washington has provided Bogota with roughly $14bn in the last two decades.</p><p>For the US, Colombia remains the main source of intelligence used to interdict drugs in the Caribbean, and the cornerstone of its counternarcotics strategy abroad.</p><p>Colombia is also a “Major non-NATO ally” of the US – a designation that only belongs to a handful of countries like Australia, Japan and Qatar.</p><p>“The relationship between presidents Trump and Petro is volatile and unpredictable,” said Anthea McCarthy-Jones, an expert in Latin America affairs at the University of New South Wales.</p><p>“It seems to oscillate from exchanges involving threats and inflammatory language to more reasoned attempts to use diplomacy as a way forward,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Colombia’s government, meanwhile, said cooperation between the two countries on intelligence, defence and law enforcement was continuing.</p><p>Colombia’s defence minister Pedro Sanchez told The New York Times this week that the “Navy, Coast Guard, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives” have been uninterrupted.</p></div></div></body></html>"

One was the flag of the former South Yemen, resurrected as a symbol of Yemen’s secessionist southern movement. The other was of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the movement’s primary backer.</p><p>Passing one checkpoint after another on the road out of Aden, the flag of the actual Republic of Yemen wasn’t visible, and only made an appearance towards the city of Taiz, to the north.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The UAE-backed secessionist <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-yemen-says-stc-leader-al-zubaidi-has-fled\">Southern Transitional Council</a> (STC) had been formed a few months earlier, in May 2017. Headed by <a href=\"/features/2026/1/7/who-is-aidarous-al-zubaidi-yemens-traitor-chief\">Aidarous al-Zubaidi</a>, it made clear that its ultimate goal was separation from the rest of Yemen, even if it found itself on the same side as the Yemeni government in the fight against the Houthi rebels occupying the Yemeni capital Sanaa.</p><p>By 2019, the STC and the Yemeni government fought in Aden and other areas of the south. The STC emerged on top, forcing the government out of Aden – the former capital of South Yemen and the city the government had designated as a temporary capital during the conflict against the Houthis.</p><p>Momentum continued to be on the STC’s side for the next few years, as it seized more territory. Even after al-Zubaidi joined the Saudi-backed <a href=\"/news/2022/6/3/yemens-new-leadershiperadicating-divisions-in-anti-houthi-force\">Presidential Leadership Council (PLC)</a> as a vice-president, officially making him a member of the Yemeni government, it was clear that on the ground, the STC had de facto control over much of the former South Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al-Zubaidi must have felt close to achieving his goals when he found himself at the United Nations General Assembly in September. Speaking to the international media, he said that the “best solution for Yemen” was a “two-state solution”.</p><p>But then he went too far. His move last month to push STC forces into the eastern governorates of Hadhramout and al-Mahra, effectively securing control over all of the former South Yemen, was a red line for Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The STC leader is <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/7/saudi-led-coalition-targets-yemen-separatists-after-leader-skips-talks\">on the run</a>, forces now loyal to the Yemeni government are in control of the majority of southern Yemen, and many of his allies have changed sides.</p><p>The UAE, meanwhile, appears to have accepted that Saudi Arabia is the primary foreign actor in Yemen, and has taken a step back – for now.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-now-for-south-yemen\">What now for South Yemen?</h2><p>In a matter of weeks, secession has gone from a de facto reality to seemingly further away than it has been since the early days of Yemen’s war in the mid-2010s.</p><p>It was only last Friday that al-Zubaidi announced a two-year transitional period before a referendum on the independence of southern Yemen and the declaration of the state of “South Arabia”.</p><p>A week later, the STC looked divided – with Abdul Rahman al-Mahrami, a PLC member also known as Abu Zaraa, now in Riyadh, appearing to position himself in the Saudi camp.</p><p>The Yemeni government, with Saudi support, is attempting to reorganise the anti-Houthi military forces, with the aim of moving them away from being a divided band of groups under different commands to a force unified under the umbrella of the government.</p><p>Nods to the “southern issue” – the disenfranchisement of southern Yemen since the country’s brief 1994 north-south civil war – continues, with plans for a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/yemeni-separatists-to-attend-saudi-talks-after-losing-key-southern-sites\">conference</a> on the issue in Riyadh.</p><p>But the ultimate goal of hardline southerners – secession – is off the table under current circumstances, with consensus instead forming around the idea of a federal republic allowing for strong regional representation.</p><p>The Yemeni government also sees an opportunity to now use the momentum gained in the recent successes against the STC to advance against the Houthis, who control Yemen’s populous northwest – even if that remains an ambitious goal.</p><p>Of course, this is Yemen, and the winds can always change once again.</p><p>Support for the secession of southern Yemen remains strong in governorates like Al-Dhale, where al-Zubaidi is from. Hardcore STC supporters, those who have not been coopted, will be unlikely to simply give up, sowing the seeds for a potential insurgency.</p><p>And President Rashad al-Alimi will have to show that his power does not simply rest on Saudi Arabia’s military strength. One of the major tests of his legitimacy is whether he will be able to return with his government to Aden, and finally be based in Yemen for the first time in years.</p><p>That will be the ultimate challenge for the Yemeni government. Is it truly capable of being in control once again? Or are current events just a temporary setback for the STC and the cause of southern secession, waiting for the opportunity to rise up again?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

So until it’s clear which way this is going, and how much stability is there … the idea that the capture of Maduro will cause US oil companies to jump into Venezuela is also a myth,” Arnson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is a chance things could worsen for the Venezuelan economy before they get better, especially as it is not clear how soon – if at all – the US government will reimburse the country for its sanctioned oil.</p><p>According to Tim Hunter, senior economist for Latin America at Oxford Economics, 78 percent of the Venezuelan government’s budget is allocated to social spending.</p><p>With those finances squeezed, there could be “very quick knock-on consequences in terms of social spending, which in turn comes with a risk of social unrest”, Hunter told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Already, locals are experiencing a sharp increase in prices in some daily essentials, as Al Jazeera has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/price-hikes-queues-and-tension-venezuela-shoppers-uneasy-after-us-bombing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, oil revenues will be key to the revival of Venezuela’s economy, said Benjamin Radd, a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations.</p><p>But getting the Latin American country’s oil market ready will take massive investment in infrastructure, “so we are years away before we see any of that in Venezuela”, Radd told Al Jazeera.</p><p>While Trump has pledged to “run” Venezuela and control energy sales, there has been little clarity on what that would entail.</p><p>“Trump has been very vague on this entire process,” Radd said.</p><p>A key factor is the structure of Venezuela’s government, which has been left largely in place, in contrast to the de-Ba’athification of Iraq following the US’s 2003 invasion.</p><p>“It is also not clear what is the status of the legitimacy of the current Venezuelan government, [or] what economic measures can they even undertake,” Radd said.</p><p>“There are a lot of unknowns here.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in a Wednesday evening post on Truth Social, Trump announced that he would petition congressional Republicans to boost that amount to a record $1.5 trillion for fiscal year 2027.</p><p>“This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855894695940909\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>Still, Trump’s threats sent stocks for defence contractors plummeting, amid uncertainty over the future of the high-stakes industry.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term, Trump has taken an aggressive, hands-on approach to private companies that have ties to national security concerns.</p><p>In June, for instance, the Trump administration <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/18/nippon-steel-acquires-us-steel-for-14-9bn-after-months-of-struggle\">was awarded a “golden share”</a> in the metal company US Steel, in exchange for <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/23/us-steel-shares-soar-on-trumps-apparent-blessing-for-deal-with-nippon\">giving a green light</a> to its merger with Japan’s Nippon Steel. That share allows the Trump administration to essentially have a veto over any major action US Steel may take to reorganise or dissolve.</p><p>Then, in August, the technology firm Intel <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/28/intel-receives-5-7bn-as-trump-administration-buys-10-percent-stake\">struck a deal to sell the US government</a> a 10-percent stake in its company, amid <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/trump-calls-on-ceo-of-tech-firm-intel-to-resign-over-china-investments\">pressure</a> from Trump.</p><p>The Trump administration has continued to snap up stakes in other private firms, most notably mining companies involved in the production of rare earth minerals and other raw materials used in technology.</p><p>It is not yet clear how Trump plans to enforce his demands for the defence contractors he blasted in Wednesday’s social media messages. Nor is it certain that Trump could legally enforce his orders.</p><p>But Trump aired a list of grievances against the companies, including that their executives’ pay was simply too large.</p><p>“Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military, and our Allies,” he wrote at one point.</p><p>At another, he called on the private firms to invest in new construction projects, a request he has made across industries, from the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/trump-reveals-prescription-drug-deal-with-pharmaceutical-giant-astrazeneca\">pharmaceutical sector</a> to <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/2/are-us-car-plants-being-built-at-record-rates-as-trump-claims\">automakers</a>.</p><p>“From this moment forward, these Executives must build NEW and MODERN Production Plants, both for delivering and maintaining this important Equipment, and for building the latest Models of future Military Equipment,” Trump said.</p><p>“Until they do so, no Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars which, as high as it sounds, is a mere fraction of what they are making now.”</p><p>He also complained that the defence companies were “far too slow” in offering repairs for their equipment.</p><p>Defence contractors are responsible for a range of services and products, from software to training to missiles and tanks. RTX, for example, designed the Patriot Missile, the US’s flagship surface-to-air missile system, and it keeps the US military supplied with spare parts and other updates.</p><p>Based in Virginia, the company boasted sales exceeding $80bn in 2024. Just this week, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded RTX a $438m contract to update its radar system.</p><p>Still, Trump maintained that too much of that income was going to shareholders, executive pay and stock buybacks, wherein a company purchases its own shares in order to limit their supply and increase their value.</p><p>“Defense Contractors are currently issuing massive Dividends to their Shareholders and massive Stock Buybacks, at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment,” Trump wrote.</p><p>“This situation will no longer be allowed or tolerated!”</p></div></div></body></html>"

These aren’t people that say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great.’ These are people that do nothing but complain.”</p><p>As part of his tirade, Trump cited a fraud scandal in the midwestern state of Minnesota, which has seen some members of the large Somali community there charged with wrongdoing.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has since indicated that Trump could use denaturalisation – the revocation of US citizenship – <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/white-house-looking-at-denaturalising-somali-americans-for-alleged-fraud\">as “a tool”</a> to penalise Somali Americans involved in the fraud scheme.</p><p>The Trump administration has also ramped up immigration enforcement raids in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a city with the largest <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-plans-crackdown-on-somali-communities-in-minnesota-what-we-know\">Somali community</a> in the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration has dramatically scaled back US <a href=\"/news/2025/9/26/us-supreme-court-sides-with-trump-on-freezing-4bn-in-foreign-aid\">humanitarian assistance</a> since returning to the White House in 2025, and it is not clear how much aid will be affected by the suspension of assistance.</p><p>Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden had provided about $770m in assistance for projects in Somalia, but only a small portion went towards the Somali government.</p><p>In announcing Wednesday’s aid freeze, the US State Department signalled that assistance could resume – but only with an acknowledgement of responsibility from the Somali government.</p><p>“Any resumption of assistance will be dependent upon the Somali Federal Government, taking accountability for its unacceptable actions and taking appropriate remedial steps.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

And we’re actually seeing it play out in real time,” Vance said.</p><p>“The way that we control Venezuela is we control the purse strings, we control the energy resources, and we tell the regime, ‘You’re allowed to sell the oil, so long as you serve America’s national interest.'”</p><p>But the question of who is in charge in Venezuela remains a volatile one.</p><p>Before dawn on Saturday, the Trump administration launched a military offensive in Venezuela to capture and remove President Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, describing the couple’s abduction as a law enforcement operation.</p><p>Maduro and Flores have since been transported to New York City, where they face charges that they oversaw the shipment of “tons of cocaine into the United States”.</p><p>In the hours immediately after the attack, it was unclear whether the Trump administration would seek to expel the remnants of the Maduro government.</p><p>Trump delivered a news conference from his residence in Palm Beach, Florida, claiming that the country was under US control.</p><p>“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said from his Mar-a-Lago resort.</p><p>“We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years. So we are going to run the country.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rodriguez-maintains-no-foreign-agent-in-charge\">Rodriguez maintains ‘no foreign agent’ in charge</h2><p>Since then, however, the Trump administration has signalled it would prioritise stability in Venezuela over quickly installing new leadership. It has declined to set a timeline for new elections.</p><p>“ It’s too premature and too early to dictate a timetable for elections in Venezuela right now,” Leavitt said on Wednesday.</p><p>Earlier this week, Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, was officially sworn in as Venezuela’s interim leader, and the Trump administration has indicated it would work with her as it pursues the extraction and sale of Venezuelan oil.</p><p>Still, Rodriguez’s government and the Trump administration have described their relationship in starkly different terms.</p><p>According to the Trump White House, Rodriguez is answerable to US demands. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine on Sunday.</p><p>On Wednesday, Leavitt echoed that position, saying that the US would wield influence over Venezuela’s decisions.</p><p>“We obviously have maximum leverage over the interim authorities in Venezuela right now,” she said.</p><p>Already, in a Tuesday night <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115850817778602689\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on Truth Social, Trump announced that Venezuela would be surrendering 30 to 50 million barrels of oil, so that the US could sell it on the international market.</p><p>“That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States,” Trump wrote.</p><p>The Rodriguez government, meanwhile, has repeatedly denied that the US is puppeteering its decisions.</p><p>Though Rodriguez has, at times, struck a conciliatory posture towards the Trump administration, she has rejected the idea that foreign powers are leading the country.</p><p>“We are here governing together with the people,” Rodriguez said in remarks broadcast on state television.</p><p>“The government of Venezuela is in charge in our country, and no one else. There is no foreign agent governing Venezuela.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-continuation-of-maduro-era-policies\">A continuation of Maduro-era policies?</h2><p>Like Maduro before her, Rodriguez is part of a political movement founded by the late socialist President Hugo Chavez, known as “chavismo”.</p><p>As a “chavista”, Rodriguez has spoken out against US imperialism in Latin America, and she denounced the recent abduction of Maduro — Chavez’s handpicked successor — and his wife as an unwarranted “kidnapping” and a “brutal attack”.</p><p>Chavez is also seen as a key figure in the nationalisation of Venezuelan oil, expanding state control over the country’s rich petroleum reserves during his time as president.</p><p>Trump and his officials have called such efforts, including the 2007 expropriation of foreign oil assets, as an act of theft against the US.</p><p>Still, the Trump administration has described Rodriguez’s government as cooperative so far.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether behind-the-scenes demands — including reports that Trump has asked Rodriguez to sever ties with key allies, including Russia, China, Cuba and Iran — will lead to public discord.</p><p>“The president has made it very clear that this is a country within the Western Hemisphere, close by the United States, that is no longer going to be sending illegal drugs to the United States of America,” Leavitt said.</p><p>“The president is fully deploying his ‘peace through strength’ foreign policy agenda.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Rodriguez government has continued Maduro’s campaign of stifling internal dissent, according to human rights monitors.</p><p>As part of an emergency declaration, the interim president authorised Venezuelan law enforcement to detain those who supported Maduro’s abduction.</p><p>The nonprofit Foro Penal has reported that, on January 5, in the wake of the US attacks, Venezuelan authorities arrested 14 journalists, all of whom were eventually released. One was deported.</p><p>Another human rights group, Caleidoscopio Humano, has announced that two elderly men from the state of Merida were also arrested for celebrating Maduro’s capture by firing guns into the air.</p><p>The international community has long denounced the human rights abuses in Venezuela. But the US has also faced broad criticism for its attack to remove Maduro, which has been denounced as a violation of sovereignty.</p><p>On Wednesday, a group of United Nations experts <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2026/01/un-experts-condemn-us-aggression-against-venezuela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> that Trump’s actions constitute an “international crime of aggression”.</p><p>“These actions represent a grave, manifest and deliberate violation of the most fundamental principles of international law, set a dangerous precedent, and risk destabilising the entire region and the world,” they wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Now.”</p><p>Denmark has warned that any move to take Greenland by force would mean “everything would stop”, including NATO and 80 years of close security links.</p><p>Greenland’s government will join a meeting between Rubio and Danish officials next week following renewed US claims on the Arctic island, its foreign minister said on Wednesday.</p><p>‌The European Union will support Greenland and ‍Denmark when ‍needed and will not accept violations of international law no matter where they occur, European Council President Antonio Costa said.</p><p>“On Greenland, allow me to be ​clear: Greenland belongs to its people. Nothing ‍can be decided about Denmark and about Greenland without Denmark or without Greenland,” Costa said in a speech.</p><p>“The European Union cannot accept ‌violations of international law – whether in Cyprus, Latin America, Greenland, Ukraine, or Gaza.

Since 2019, during Trump’s first term, the president has raised the idea of controlling Greenland, saying it would <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/do-russia-and-china-pose-a-national-security-threat-to-the-us-in-greenland\">benefit US security.</a></p><p>So far, Trump has not ruled out using force to take the island.</p><p>Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that Trump’s intention is to buy Greenland. “That’s always been the president’s intent from the very beginning.”</p><p>House US House Speaker Mike Johnson said he hasn’t heard talk of sending the military into Greenland and the US is “looking at diplomatic channels”.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump and his national security team have “actively discussed” the option of buying Greenland.</p><p>“He views it in the best interest of the United States to deter <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/do-russia-and-china-pose-a-national-security-threat-to-the-us-in-greenland\">Russian and Chinese aggression</a> in the Arctic region. And so that’s why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like,” Leavitt told reporters.</p><p>Neither Leavitt nor Rubio ruled out the use of force. But Leavitt said, “The president’s first option, always, has been diplomacy.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3570999\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-Greeland-1741684530.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Where is Greenland-1741684530\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"
