In fact, we haven’t even had a formal readout from the White House of that meeting with Machado.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2></h2><p>Still, Machado struck an upbeat tone as she exited the White House and strolled onto Pennsylvania Avenue, where she was thronged by reporters and supporters seeking selfies.</p><p>She and Trump spent only a few hours together in the White House, as they discussed Venezuela’s future over lunch.</p><p>Machado confirmed to the media that she followed through with her plans to give Trump her Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the US president has long coveted for himself.</p><p>“I presented the president of the United States the medal, the Nobel Peace Prize,” Machado told reporters.</p><p>As she offered Trump the prize, Machado said she recounted a historical anecdote, about an interaction between Simon Bolivar – the Venezuelan military officer who helped liberate much of South America from colonial rule – and the Marquis de Lafayette, a Revolutionary War hero in the US.</p><p>“I told him this. Listen to this. Two hundred years ago, General Lafayette gave Simon Bolivar a medal with George Washington’s face,” Machado said. “Bolivar since then kept that medal for the rest of his life.”</p><p>The Nobel Committee, however, has clarified that the prize is non-transferable and cannot be shared.</p><p>Machado was announced as the recipient of the prize in October, in recognition of her efforts to advance Venezuelan democracy.</p><p>“I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause,” Machado <a href=\"https://x.com/MariaCorinaYA/status/1976642376119549990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on October 10. She secretly left Venezuela, where she had been living in hiding, in December to travel to Norway and collect the medal.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"willing-to-serve\">‘Willing to serve’</h2><p>Machado remains a popular figure within Venezuela’s opposition movement, which has faced oppression and violence under Maduro’s presidency.</p><p>Human rights organisations have accused Maduro of systematically suppressing dissent and arresting opposition leaders.</p><p>As of January 11, the human rights group Foro Penal estimated there were 804 political prisoners in Venezuela, though some estimates put their population in the thousands.</p><p>Machado was formerly a member of Venezuela’s National Assembly, but Maduro’s government had her removed for allegedly conspiring against the presidency.</p><p>She was considered a leading candidate for the 2024 presidential race, and during the October 2023 opposition primary, she earned more than 92 percent support.</p><p>But in January 2024, she was again disqualified from holding office, and former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez ultimately ran on behalf of the opposition coalition.</p><p>After polls closed in July 2024, the government did not publish the usual breakdown of the voting tallies, leading to widespread outcry over a lack of transparency. The opposition obtained voting tallies that appeared to show Gonzalez winning in a landslide, further fuelling the outrage.</p><p>But Maduro’s government backed his claim to a third six-year term as president.</p><p>After the US military abducted Maduro from Venezuela on January 3, it transported him to the US to face charges of narcotics trafficking.</p><p>Machado has since appeared on US television to advance the Venezuelan opposition’s claim that it has a “mandate” to take over the presidency after Maduro’s removal.</p><p>“We have a president-elect who is Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, and we are ready and willing to serve our people as we have been mandated,” she told CBS News on January 7.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"dismissing-machado\">Dismissing Machado?</h2><p>But Trump has thrown his support behind Rodriguez, whom he has described as cooperative.</p><p>“ She’s somebody that we’ve worked with very well,” Trump said at a news conference on Thursday. “I think we’re getting along very well with Venezuela.”</p><p>The US president has previously said that the US will “run” Venezuela. Last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters that the Venezuelan government’s “decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States of America”.</p><p>Still, Rodriguez has denounced the January 3 attack on Venezuela as a violation of international law, and in Thursday’s state of the union speech, she continued to express continued allegiance to “Chavismo”, the political movement Maduro followed.</p><p>She has also criticised US threats to her country’s sovereignty.</p><p>“We know the US is a lethal nuclear power. We have seen their record in history of humanity. We know and we are not afraid to face them diplomatically through political dialogue as appropriate and resolve once and for all this historical contradiction,” Rodriguez said on Thursday.</p><p>“Brothers and sisters, deputies, regardless of political affiliation, it doesn’t matter. We have to go together as Venezuelans to defend our sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and also defend our dignity and our honour.”</p><p>She nevertheless indicated she planned to revisit Venezuela’s hydrocarbon law to allow for greater foreign investment.</p><p>Renata Segura, the director of the Latin America and Caribbean programme at the nonprofit International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that Rodriguez and her government have consistently maintained that Maduro remains the rightful leader of Venezuela.</p><p>“We should not forget that Rodriguez and many other members of the government in Caracas have been very adamant about the fact that the intervention against Maduro was illegitimate. They’ve actually demanded that he be liberated,” Segura said.</p><p>“So they haven’t done a 180-degree shift in the tone of their declarations. But it’s not like they have a lot of manoeuvring room. So they are really trying to appease Trump at this moment.”</p><p>Still, Trump has long dismissed Machado’s prospects as a replacement for Maduro or Rodriguez, saying on January 3 that she “doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country”.</p><p>Segura believes the Trump administration’s choice to reject Machado as the leader of Venezuela is understandable, in the name of stability.</p><p>But, she added, Machado is the clear leader of the opposition, and her coalition therefore needs to be part of the country’s government moving forward.</p><p>“It would be very illegitimate if we just had a conversation between the regime of Chavismo, now without Maduro, and the Trump administration, without those people that really represent the Venezuelan people’s feelings,” Segura said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

States announced that the two sides had progressed to the second phase of a 20-point ceasefire deal with Hamas to end the conflict.</p><p>The Wafa news agency reported that the Israeli military bombed two houses belonging to the al-Hawli and the al-Jarou families in the central town of Deir el-Balah on Thursday evening, with health officials confirming a 16-year-old minor was among six killed.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The Israeli military announced that one of the victims, Muhammad al-Hawli, was a commander in the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas.</p><p>Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Ibrahim al-Khalili confirmed that a “senior figure of the Qassam Brigades” had been killed and that the attack underscored Israel’s message that it would be defining phase two of the ceasefire “on its terms”.</p><p>Israel, he said, had set the terms of the next phase of the ceasefire, which will see the establishment of a Palestinian technocratic administration overseen by an international “Board of Peace”, with the option of “escalation” remaining very much “on the table”.</p><p>Elsewhere in the war-torn enclave, at least one person was shot dead by Israeli forces near Al-Alam roundabout, west of Rafah city, another person was killed in an Israeli attack on a police post near Al-Nablusi Junction, southwest of Gaza City and two more people were killed in an Israeli air attack on the Al-Khatib family home in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.</p><h2 id=\"despicable-crime\">‘Despicable crime’</h2><p>Hamas condemned the targeting of the al-Hawli home as a “despicable crime”, saying that it revealed the “contempt” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the October ceasefire, but did not confirm the death of one of its commanders.</p><p>At least 451 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect, with Israel ordering residents out of more than half of Gaza, where its troops remain behind an apparently mobile “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/israel-extends-gaza-occupation-beyond-yellow-line-in-north-bombs-south\">yellow line</a>“.</p><p>Three Israeli soldiers have been killed over the same period.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff announced in a post on X on Wednesday that the second phase of Trump’s 20-point plan to end the conflict had been launched, “moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction”.</p><p>The next phase would bring “the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel”, he said, with reference to Hamas, which has so far refused to publicly commit to full disarmament.</p><p>The plan also calls for the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force to help secure Gaza and train vetted Palestinian police units.</p><p></p><p>The 15-member technocratic committee, named the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, will manage day-to-day governance, but leaves unresolved broader political and security issues, including the question of Israel’s post-war withdrawal from the enclave.</p><p>Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority, has been appointed to lead the committee, which is now meeting in Egypt to begin preparations for entering the territory, according to the AFP news agency report citing Egyptian state television.</p><p>In a recent interview, Shaath said the committee would rely on “brains rather than weapons” and would not coordinate with armed groups.</p><h2 id=\"a-step-in-the-right-direction\">‘A step in the right direction’</h2><p>Nevertheless, senior Hamas official Bassem Naim welcomed the establishment of the committee on Thursday, calling it “a step in the right direction” and signalling the armed group was ready to hand over administration of Gaza.</p><p>“This is crucial for consolidating the ceasefire, preventing a return to war, addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and preparing for comprehensive reconstruction,” he said.</p><p>“The ball is now in the court of the mediators, the American guarantor and the international community to empower the committee,” he added.</p><p>The US-proposed Board of Peace is expected to be led on the ground by Bulgarian diplomat and politician <a href=\"/features/2026/1/15/who-is-nickolay-mladenov-the-diplomat-tasked-with-disarming-gaza\">Nickolay Mladenov</a>.</p><p>The Reuters news agency reported that invitations were sent out on Wednesday to potential Board of Peace members personally selected by Trump.</p><h2 id=\"human-remains-in-the-rubble\">‘Human remains’ in the rubble</h2><p>The first phase of Trump’s plan began on October 10 and included a complete ceasefire, the exchange of Israeli captives for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p><p>However, with Israel having maintained a chokehold on supplies entering the enclave, nearly all of the territory’s more than 2 million people are now struggling to survive winter in makeshift homes or damaged buildings.</p><p>As Al Jazeera’s al-Khalili put it, “the situation is going from bad to worse for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians who heard about the announcement of the second phase of the ceasefire, [with] nothing implemented on the ground”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said that conditions were “inhumane” and called for an acceleration of reconstruction work. “We can’t wait, we can’t procrastinate,” he said on Thursday after a visit to the territory.</p><p>Da Silva said the launch of phase two of the Gaza truce plan marked a “historical” opportunity to kick-start reconstruction efforts, which he said would require $52bn, according to an assessment conducted by the World Bank, the UN and the European Commission.</p><p>In phase two, Shaath said that the committee would focus on providing urgent relief for Gaza, announcing that he would bring in bulldozers to “push the rubble into the sea, and make new islands, new land”.</p><p>According to Shaath, Israel’s full-scale onslaught on Gaza has left about 60 million tonnes of rubble scattered across the enclave, “with unexploded ordnance in the rubble, dangerous waste, and unfortunately also human remains”.</p><p>Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 71,441 Palestinians since it erupted on October 7, 2023.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Democrats largely rejected it, saying the accounts would not be enough to cover costs for most consumers. Currently, such accounts are used disproportionately by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked at her briefing on Thursday whether the president could guarantee that, under his plan, people would be able to cover their healthcare costs.</p><p>“If this plan is put in place, every single American who has healthcare in the United States will see lower costs as a result,” she said without elaborating.</p><p>“These are common-sense actions that make up President Trump’s great healthcare plan, and they represent the most comprehensive and bold agenda to lower healthcare costs to have ever been considered by the federal government,” Leavitt also said.</p><p>The White House said that the plan would not affect people with pre-existing conditions.</p><p>The plan also targets pharmacy benefit managers and requires insurance companies to disclose the profits they take from premiums and the frequency of denials.</p><p>Companies would publish their rate and coverage comparisons on their websites in “plain English” as well as the percentage of revenues paid out to claims compared with overhead costs and profits. They would also be required to publish the percentage of claims they reject and the average wait times for routine care.</p><p>“Instead of just papering over the problems, we have gotten into this great healthcare plan, a framework that we believe will help Congress create legislation that will address the challenges that the American people have been craving,” US Centres for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz told reporters on a White House briefing call.</p><p>The White House also did not provide a timeline for implementation, and a deeply divided Congress is unlikely to pass major healthcare legislation quickly.</p><p>Providers and insurers who accept Medicare or Medicaid money would also have to post their pricing and fees.</p><h2 id=\"obamacare-looms\">Obamacare looms</h2><p>The announcement comes as millions of Americans face higher healthcare costs this year, with open enrolment for most federally subsidised Obamacare plans closing on Thursday.</p><p>On average, <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/failure-of-rival-health-bills-underscores-impasse-in-us-politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">premium costs will increase</a> to $1,904 in 2026 from $888 in 2025, according to health policy firm KFF, a far greater jump than the savings promised in the Trump plan.</p><p>Congress remains divided on whether and how to reinstate generous COVID-era tax credits that expired at the end of last year.</p><p>Retroactive expanded federal subsidies are still possible, and there is a group of bipartisan lawmakers negotiating a potential extension, but Republicans remain divided on whether they should do so.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration wants funding to go directly to consumers using health savings accounts, Oz said, rather than to insurers, a position also adopted by Congressional Republicans who oppose extending the Obamacare subsidies.</p><p>Trump has said he may veto any legislation to extend the subsidies, and the plan makes no mention of them.</p><p>“This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on. It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies,” the White House official said.</p><p>Trump has long been dogged by his lack of a comprehensive healthcare plan as he and Republicans have sought to unwind former President Barack Obama’s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act. Trump was thwarted during his first term in trying to repeal and replace the law.</p><p>When he ran for president in 2024, Trump said he had only “concepts of a plan” to address healthcare. His new proposal, short on many specifics, appeared to be the concept of a plan.</p><p>On Wall Street, healthcare insurance provider stocks surged on the news of the looming plan. UnitedHealthcare is up 0.8 percent in midday trading. Humana is up higher at 3.5 percent than the market open, and Oscar Health is up 6.4 percent.</p><p>Pharmaceutical stocks, on the other hand, are trending lower. Eli Lilly is down by about 3.7 percent, AbbVie tumbling 1.9 percent below the market open, and Bristol Myers -Squibb is down by 0.9 percent. Johnson and Johnson, on the other hand, does remain in positive territory at about 0.3 percent higher than the market open.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In June 2025, the UK government proscribed the UK-based group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000. This was not a security decision, but a political one, marking an unprecedented escalation in the criminalisation of Palestine solidarity in the United Kingdom. Palestine Action members have engaged in non-violent direct action aimed at disrupting the UK’s complicity in the Gaza genocide, targeting facilities linked to Israel’s arms industry operating in the UK, including Elbit Systems sites and elements of British military infrastructure.</p><p>Rather than confronting its own actions, the government has sought to divert attention from the central issue: the UK’s role in the Gaza genocide. Throughout Israel’s assault on Gaza, the UK has provided sustained political and diplomatic support, supplied vital components for F-35 fighter jets, and conducted R1 surveillance flights over Gaza. Taken together, these actions render the British government not merely complicit, but materially involved in the violence itself.</p><p>At the same time, the UK has sought to obstruct international accountability. It has attempted to interfere with proceedings at the International Criminal Court — conduct that may constitute an offence under Article 70(1) of the ICC Statute — by intimidating the ICC Prosecutor and creating procedural obstacles designed to delay or prevent the issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. Rather than reassessing policies that expose it to legal and moral liability, the government has turned on those who insist on holding it to its own professed values — values it readily invokes when geopolitically convenient, such as in Ukraine and Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"anti-terror-laws-to-justify-political-imprisonment\">Anti-terror laws to justify political imprisonment</h2><p>The persecution of individuals on political grounds through the law is by no means new. As early as 399 BCE, Socrates was tried and executed in Athens on charges of “impiety”, “not recognising the gods the state recognises”, and “corrupting the youth”, with the law itself serving as the instrument of repression.</p><p>Today, Russia’s crackdown on dissent, carried out through formally lawful means, stands as one of the most widely criticised contemporary examples of political imprisonment, routinely condemned by Western governments, including the UK.</p><p>Attempts to define and legally operationalise the concept of political imprisonment have long faced resistance. While there is no consensus on what constitutes a “political prisoner” or “prisoner of conscience”, the criteria established by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), of which the UK is a member, offer clear and authoritative guidance:</p><p><em>“a. if the detention has been imposed in violation of one of the fundamental guarantees set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and its Protocols (ECHR), in particular freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and association; </em></p><p><em>b. if the detention has been imposed for purely political reasons without connection to any offence; </em></p><p><em>c. if, for political motives, the length of the detention or its conditions are clearly out of proportion to the offence the person has been found guilty of or is suspected of;</em></p><p><em>d. if, for political motives, he or she is detained in a discriminatory manner as compared to other persons; or, </em></p><p><em>e. if the detention is the result of proceedings which were clearly unfair and this appears to be connected with political motives of the authorities.”  (SG/Inf(2001)34, paragraph 10).</em><br>\nThese criteria are directly relevant to the UK’s treatment of Palestine Action. The British government is complicit in Israel’s systematic unmaking of Palestine, including its illegal occupation, its system of apartheid, and its role in the Gaza genocide, and Palestine Action has directly challenged this complicity. Where public order and civil disobedience laws once failed to suppress this activism, the state escalated to the use of exceptional anti-terror legislation.</p><p>The government has since resorted to the Terrorism Act to preemptively criminalise activists and expose them to sentences of up to 14 years’ imprisonment, a level of punishment grossly disproportionate to non-violent direct action. This disproportionality and choice of legislation signal a political motive.</p><p>The application of the Terrorism Act 2000 to non-violent direct action strips activists of ordinary legal protections and subjects them to an exceptional penal regime, including extended pre-charge detention, heightened surveillance powers, restrictions on association and expression, and dramatically increased sentencing exposure. Such measures are ordinarily reserved for acts involving mass violence, not protest aimed at preventing harm.</p><p>Under the PACE criteria, detention may be considered political where punishment is clearly disproportionate or where legal proceedings are unfair and politically motivated. Here, non-violent activism is met with the prospect of lengthy imprisonment alongside reputational destruction through terrorist designation. This combination satisfies multiple indicators of political imprisonment, particularly criteria (c) and (e).</p><p>The use of anti-terror law in this context does not merely criminalise conduct; it redefines dissent itself as a security threat, preempting fair adjudication and conditioning the public to accept extraordinary punishment for ordinary political opposition.</p><h2 id=\"the-broader-picture\">The broader picture</h2><p>In penology, a penal system may serve several recognised purposes, including just deserts and retribution, incapacitation, and deterrence. What is unfolding in the UK fits none of these aims. Instead, the penal system is being deployed to expand executive power and suppress political opposition, deviating from the purposes a penal system in a liberal democracy should serve.</p><p>The UK is complicit in grave violations of international law and has not only failed to meet its international legal obligations, but has actively breached them. Some British citizens, concerned with justice, international law, and human rights, have peacefully stepped in to challenge their government’s wrongdoing. The state’s response has been to criminalise dissent while presenting repression as democratic self-defence.</p><p>Let us be clear: proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation is not an isolated act. It is part of the UK’s broader complicity in Israel’s oppression and genocide, and it functions domestically to silence those who seek to disrupt that complicity.</p><p>This is not the first attempt to rule by law in the UK to support Israel’s policies in Palestine. The introduction of the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism was another such attempt to control and intimidate opposition through legal means. With the weaponisation of anti-terror laws, the UK government has taken a further step towards shrinking the space for dissent.</p><p>The exceptional selectivity of legal tools and the disproportionality of the chosen penal regime cannot be justified when measured against the conduct in question: non-violent activism aimed at compelling the government to halt violence and uphold the international legal obligations it claims to champion. Those participating in violence are branding the non-violent as terrorists.</p><p>Finally, it is striking that after all these decades, the UK continues to ignore its unique historical responsibility towards the Palestinians. The UK imposed its mandate over Palestine by force, governing the territory while systematically privileging colonial and settler interests, before abandoning its obligations and withdrawing unilaterally. This withdrawal was crucial to creating the conditions in which the Nakba unfolded, in breach of the responsibilities the UK had assumed under the Mandate.</p><p>Among those obligations was the commitment articulated in the White Paper of 1939 to establish a Palestinian state for all its citizens within 10 years, a promise that was never honoured. The UK planted the seeds of Palestinian suffering and then exited Palestine without securing political self-determination for its indigenous people, leaving a legacy of dispossession that continues to shape the present.</p><p>More than a century after the Mandate, it remains Palestinians — supported by allies across the world — who are risking everything to defend the values of humanity and the principles of international law. The British state, by contrast, has chosen evasion over responsibility, and repression over reckoning.</p><h2 id=\"any-hopes\" data-start=\"586\" data-end=\"600\">Any hopes?</h2><p>Hope lies in refusing the normalisation of this moment. By challenging the proscription of Palestine Action, activists are not only resisting the UK’s complicity in Israel’s crimes, but defending the space for dissent itself. The struggle is not simply to reverse one decision, but to prevent the erosion of democratic limits through the misuse of law. In the UK right now, defending democracy and acting against complicity in Israeli atrocities go hand in hand.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He has also alleged— andproven —irreparable injuries during his detention,” Freeman wrote.</p><p>“Precedent and principles of statutory interpretation lead me to conclude that ‘it is most unlikely that Congress intended to foreclose all forms of meaningful judicial review’ over his claims,” she added, quoting from a 1991 Supreme Court ruling.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It is not clear how the ruling will immediately affect Khalil’s broader case and the ordeal of other students like him. Federal courts have released several students – including Turkish scholar <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/us-court-orders-trump-admin-to-restore-rumeysa-ozturks-legal-status\">Rumeysa Ozturk</a> – based on habeas petitions.</p><p>Last year, <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/us-deportation-drive-against-pro-palestine-students-is-illegal-judge-rules\">a judge ruled</a> in a separate civil case that the Trump administration’s drive to deport pro-Palestine students based on their speech is illegal.</p><p>Khalil’s legal team can ask the entire Third Circuit Court to review the panel’s decision before taking the came to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Bobby Hodgson, deputy legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is helping represent the Palestinian activist, said Thursday’s ruling “undermines the role federal courts must play in preventing flagrant constitutional violations”.</p><p>“The Trump administration violated the Constitution by targeting Mahmoud Khalil, detaining him thousands of miles from home, and retaliating against him for his speech,” Hodgson said in a statement.</p><p>“Dissent is not grounds for detention or deportation, and we will continue to pursue all legal options to ensure Mahmoud’s rights are vindicated.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

For months, Trump and his team accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of leading mass-scale narcotics smuggling operations, again without evidence. Amid the boat bombings, Trump even said that the US might strike Venezuelan land next.</p><p>But in late November, Trump revealed to reporters that he had spoken to the Venezuelan leader. A few days later, the call was confirmed by Maduro himself, who described it as “cordial”.</p><p>The US then hit what Trump described as a docking facility for alleged drug boats in Venezuela. After that, on January 1, Maduro offered Trump an olive branch, saying he was open to talks with Washington on drug trafficking and even on enabling US access to oil. Trump appeared to be getting what he ostensibly wanted – access to Venezuelan oil and blocks on drugs from the country.</p><p>Yet only hours later, US forces targeted the capital, abducting Maduro and his wife on charges of narcotics trafficking and transporting them to the United States.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4242090\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_Trump_Attacks_Jan15_2026_2-1768477777.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Trump_Attacks_Jan15_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"iran-bombed-when-two-weeks-of-diplomacy-appeared-imminent\" data-start=\"1474\" data-end=\"1639\">Iran bombed – when ‘two weeks’ of diplomacy appeared imminent</h2><p>Venezuela was not the first time Trump launched a dramatic attack at a time when diplomacy appeared to be taking hold.</p><p>In June, Iran learned the hard way that Trump’s words and actions do not match.</p><p>Amid rising tensions over US accusations that Iran was racing towards enriching uranium for nuclear weapons, Washington and Tehran engaged in weeks of hectic negotiations. Trump frequently warned Iran that time was running out for it to strike a deal, but then returned to talks.</p><p>On June 13, he wrote on Truth Social that his team “remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue.”</p><p>His “entire” administration, he said, had been “directed to negotiate with Iran”.</p><p>But barely hours later, US ally Israel struck Iran. Most experts believe Israel would not have attacked Iran without Trump’s approval.</p><p>As Israel and Iran traded fire in the subsequent days, Trump faced questions over whether the US would bomb Iran.</p><p>On June 20, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt quoted Trump as saying that he would “make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks”.</p><p>Far from utilising the full two weeks he gave himself, Trump made his decision in two days.</p><p>In the early hours of June 22, US B-2 Spirit bombers dropped fourteen bunker-busting bombs on Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility, buried deep inside a mountain near Qom. The US also bombed nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan using the most powerful conventional bombs in the US arsenal.</p><p>The attack shocked many observers, in part because of what appeared to have been an elaborate diplomatic ruse preceding it.</p><h2 id=\"iran-protest-calculus-what-s-trump-s-plan\">Iran protest calculus: What’s Trump’s plan?</h2><p>Now, all eyes are on Iran again, where <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\">demonstrations</a> against the government have been under way for the past two weeks, before calming down earlier this week.</p><p>As the unrest turned deadlier last week, Trump urged Iranians to continue demonstrating.</p><p>“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING – TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!… HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on January 13, without elaborating on what form that help might take.</p><p>But within 24 hours, during a meeting with reporters in Washington, DC, Trump said he had been assured that the killing of protesters in Iran had stopped.</p><p>“They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place – there were supposed to be a lot of executions today, and that the executions won’t take place – and we’re going to find out,” Trump said on Wednesday.</p><p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/trump-says-he-has-been-told-killing-of-protesters-in-iran-has-stopped\">in an interview</a> with Fox TV, also denied that Tehran planned to execute antigovernment protesters. “Hanging is ‌out of the ‌question,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-countries-is-trump-threatening\" data-start=\"4292\" data-end=\"4323\">Which other countries is Trump threatening?</h2><p>Beyond Iran and Venezuela, longstanding US rivals, Trump’s aggression has increasingly extended towards Washington’s own allies, including Canada and Greenland.</p><p>The most striking example is Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/greenland-and-denmark-say-trump-set-on-conquering-territory-after-meeting\">eagerness to take over</a> Greenland, a Danish territory, which has evolved from a campaign talking point into a focal element of his administration’s Western Hemisphere strategy.</p><p>On January 5, the State Department posted a black-and-white image of Trump on social media, declaring: “This is OUR Hemisphere, and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened.”</p><p><br>\nThe president has refused to rule out the use of military force, with administration officials openly discussing US interest in Greenland’s strategic location and mineral resources.</p><p>Denmark has categorically rejected any sale, while <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any\">Greenland’s leadership</a> insists the territory is not for sale.</p><p>But experts such as Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations, argue that Trump uses threats to intimidate adversaries and typically employs force only against weaker targets.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/the-bullys-pulpit-finding-patterns-in-trumps-use-of-military-force/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">paper published</a> last May titled, The bully’s pulpit: Finding patterns in Trump’s use of military force, Shapiro suggested that Trump frequently invokes military threats but often fails to follow through.</p><p>According to Shapiro, Trump is more likely to act when threats carry “low escalation risk”, while threats against nuclear-armed or militarily strong states largely serve rhetorical purposes. The most extreme or theatrical warnings, he argues, tend to function as tools of “political signalling rather than precursors to real military action”.</p><p>“Trump often deploys grandiose threats but only accepts limited, low-risk military operations. He uses foreign policy as political theatre, aiming threats as much at his domestic base and media cycle as at foreign adversaries,” Shapiro writes.</p><h2 id=\"calculated-unpredictability\" data-start=\"6667\" data-end=\"6705\">Calculated unpredictability?</h2><p>Some analysts believe Trump’s approach offers tactical advantages.</p><p>“The intent is to keep opponents off balance, heightening psychological pressure and extracting maximum strategic leverage,” a Pakistani government official told Al Jazeera, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. “Even his European allies are not always certain what to expect.”</p><p>Others remain sceptical. Qandil Abbas, a specialist on Middle East affairs at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, described Trump’s behaviour as erratic, citing his repeated threats against multiple countries.</p><p>“Look at his threats against Cuba, or Iran, or Venezuela, and yet this is the same president who also wants to win a Nobel prize and is desperate for it,” Abbas told Al Jazeera.</p><p>So is Trump actually pulling back from the prospect of attacking Iran – or is he bluffing?</p><p>According to Abbas, Trump’s apparent change in tone might be the result of feedback from US allies in the region “that attacking Iran is not smart”.</p><p>Still, Abbas said that “with Israel’s support, I feel he will find a way to strike the country.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, it carried a rigid political framework designed to reframe and actually pour on the unrest.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"16\">The discourse portrayed developments inside Iran as a “moment of collapse” and relied on sharp binaries: “The People vs. The Regime”, “Freedom vs. Political Islam” and “Iran vs. The Islamic Republic”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"17\">The campaign heavily promoted Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, as the sole political alternative. Pahlavi himself engaged with the campaign, a move that was immediately amplified by Israeli accounts describing him as the “face of the alternative Iran”. But he is not thought of in those terms by a majority of Iranians, many of whom have memories of his father’s abuses and how the CIA restored him to power in 1953 in a United States-United Kingdom-orchestrated coup.</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: I am sharing my first call with you today and invite you to start chanting slogans this Thursday and Friday, 18th and 19th of Dey, simultaneously at 8 PM, all of you whether in the streets or even from your own homes. Based on the feedback from this action, I will announce the next calls to you.</em></p><h2><strong>Direct Israeli involvement</strong></h2><p data-path-to-node=\"19\">The campaign was not limited to anonymous activists. It also involved direct participation from current and former Israeli officials during the campaign’s peak.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"20\">Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir posted a tweet in Persian addressed to the Iranian people, calling for the “fall of the dictator” and expressing support for the protests.</p><p></p><p data-path-to-node=\"21\"><em>Translation: The people of Iran deserve a free life, liberated from the killer dictator, Khamenei. We stand with you!</em></p><p data-path-to-node=\"21\">Similarly, tweets by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett were widely circulated within the hashtag’s network, repurposed to fit the “liberation” narrative.</p><h2><strong>Turning protests into an ideological war</strong></h2><p data-path-to-node=\"23\">One of the campaign’s most prominent features was its attempt to reframe the protests as a conflict against religion rather than against economic mismanagement and political repression.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"24\">Posts describing the Iranian government as an “oppressive Islamist regime” circulated alongside narratives portraying the “Persian people” as victims of Islam. This attempt to distinguish between “Persians” and “Muslims” appeared aimed at isolating the regime from Iranian society and framing the unrest as a civilizational clash.</p><p></p><p data-path-to-node=\"25\">Israeli activists, including Eyal Yakoby and Hillel Neuer, also pushed content accusing the Iranian authorities of excessive violence while attacking what they termed the “silence of international media”.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Calls for foreign intervention</strong></h2><p data-path-to-node=\"27\">The discourse quickly evolved from solidarity to explicit calls for foreign military intervention. And this narrative was pushed by US President Donald Trump, who bombed Iran’s nuclear sites as part of Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a> against Iran in June.</p><p></p><p data-path-to-node=\"28\">The network amplified statements attributed to Trump regarding Washington’s readiness to intervene.
