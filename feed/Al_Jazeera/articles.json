All but one reported experiencing “torture, abuse or other forms of violence”, it said.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The alleged abuse meted out by Israeli authorities ranged from baton beatings and electroshocks to excruciating stress positions – including under sewage water – as well as sexual violence. Two journalists said they were raped.</p><p>Journalist Sami al-Sai said soldiers stripped him and penetrated him with a baton and other items in a small cell in Israel’s Megiddo prison, an ordeal he said left him in a “severe psychological state”.</p><p>“Descriptions of sexual violence appeared repeatedly in the testimonies, with journalists describing assaults as intended to humiliate, terrorise and permanently scar them”, said the CPJ report.</p><h2 id=\"we-will-kill-your-family\">‘We will kill your family’</h2><p>Other accounts detailed psychological abuse, including threats to kill family members, sleep deprivation through loud music and medical neglect, such as being denied treatment for severe bone fractures and eye injuries.</p><p>Journalist Amin Baraka said he was repeatedly threatened for his work with Al Jazeera.</p><p>“An Israeli soldier told me, word for word in Arabic, ‘Al Jazeera correspondent Wael al-Dahdouh defied us and remained in the Gaza Strip, so we killed his family. We will kill your family, too,’” Baraka told CPJ.</p><p>“In every prison they transferred me to, I was subjected to physical abuse. I still suffer from the blows to my stomach … and I need surgery,” he added.</p><p>CPJ said the reports of abuse from dozens of journalists expose a “clear pattern”.</p><p>“These are not isolated incidents”, said CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah. “They expose a deliberate strategy to intimidate and silence journalists, and destroy their ability to bear witness.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"there-needs-to-be-accountability\">‘There needs to be accountability’</h2><p>Many of the jailed journalists were also denied basic legal protections, said CPJ.</p><p>Eighty percent of those interviewed were held under Israel’s system of administrative detention, meaning no charges were brought against them. One in four said they were never allowed to speak to a lawyer at any time, according to the watchdog.</p><p>At the same time, the vast majority of those interviewed reported experiencing “extreme hunger or malnutrition”, corroborated by photos CPJ reviewed showing detainees’ “gaunt faces, protruding ribs and hollowed cheeks”.</p><p>Some journalists said they survived solely on “moldy bread and rotten food”.</p><p>The CPJ said the detainees lost an average of 23.5 kilogrammes (54 pounds) while in custody.</p><p>“We returned from hell”, journalist Imad Ifranji said.</p><p>CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg called for the international community to “take action” against the alleged widespread mistreatment of journalists in Israeli jails.</p><p>“Humanitarian law sets unequivocal standards for the treatment of detainees, and there needs to be meaningful accountability for failure to meet these standards,” said Ginsberg.</p><p>Israeli authorities have long faced allegations of rampant abuse targeting Palestinian prisoners in their custody, including <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/what-we-know-about-the-torture-abuse-of-palestinian-prisoners-by-israel\">torture and rape</a>, particularly at the notorious Sde Teiman facility.

communities with severe shortages of humanitarian assistance,” the UN said.</p><p>The aid delivery came as more than 30 countries issued a statement on Wednesday expressing “grave concern” at a recent “severe escalation” in drone attacks amid “heavy fighting” in the Darfur and Kordofan regions.</p><p>The 28 European Union countries, plus Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, warned that “intentional attacks” against aid workers and “wilfully impeding” relief supplies, “may amount to war crimes”.</p><p>The statement was issued after 28 people were killed and dozens more injured when

Sudan.</p><p>After consolidating its hold on Darfur last year, the RSF has pushed east through the oil and gold-rich Kordofan region in an attempt to seize Sudan’s central

He was questioned for six hours, and a video and transcript are to be released soon.</p><p>In his written statement, Wexner described Epstein as a “conman” and said he had been “naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust” in the convicted sex offender.</p><p>Wexner said he was introduced to Epstein in the mid-1980s and later hired him to manage his vast wealth acquired as the founder of L Brands, which also operated leading brands like The Limited, Express, Bath &amp; Body Works, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Wexner said he had “irrevocably cut ties” with Epstein after learning that “he was an abuser, a crook, and a liar” around 2007, a year after the late financier was first arrested for soliciting prostitution from a minor in the state of Florida.</p><p>Wexner said his wife, Abigail, had discovered that “Epstein had stolen vast sums from our family”, and following this revelation, he never spoke to his former adviser again.</p><p>“While others visited Epstein in jail and associated with him after his release, I did not. Nor did I witness, condone, or enable his crimes in any way,” the statement said.</p><h2 id=\"democrats-unconvinced\">Democrats unconvinced</h2><p>Some Democratic lawmakers, however, pushed back on Wexner’s narrative, given their long-running professional relationship.</p><p>“There is no single person that was more involved in providing Jeffrey Epstein with the financial support to commit his crimes than Les Wexner,” Representative Robert Garcia, the committee’s ranking Democrat, told reporters outside Wexner’s home.</p><p>“We have also directly heard from survivors about Mr Wexner, his involvement, and their concerns about the enormous amount of money that was transferred over and paid to Mr Epstein. We know of over a billion dollars that was either transferred, provided in stocks, or given directly to Mr Epstein by Wexner,” he said.</p><p>Garcia noted that Wexner appeared to be “unaware” of much of the money given to Epstein and had downplayed their personal ties.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The pair were close enough that at one point Wexner gave Epstein power of attorney, according to the tycoon’s testimony. Wexner also admitted to visiting Epstein’s properties, like his private island, Little Saint James, albeit on one brief occasion while accompanied by his family.</p><p>Wexner also responded to allegations by the late victim Virginia Giuffre, who claimed in court documents that the billionaire was among the men Epstein trafficked her to. Wexner testified to utter devotion to his wife of 33 years, saying he had never once been unfaithful “in any way, shape, or form”.</p><p>Wexner, whose name appears more than 1,000 times in the Epstein files, was investigated by the FBI at least once, according to an email released by the DOJ.</p><p>The email indicates that in August 2019, the month that Epstein died while awaiting trial, the FBI was looking into Wexner as a potential “secondary coconspirator” in his crimes. The FBI said it had been in contact with Wexner’s lawyers, but there “was limited evidence regarding his involvement”.</p><p>Epstein’s death in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell was ruled a suicide.</p><h2 id=\"i-feel-sorry\">‘I feel sorry’</h2><p>In one of the newly released documents, Epstein sent rough notes to himself about Wexner, saying, “never ever, did anything without informing Les” and “I would never give him up”.</p><p>Another document, an apparent draft letter to Wexner, said the two “had ‘gang stuff’ for over 15 years” and were mutually indebted to each other – as Wexner helped make Epstein rich and Epstein helped make Wexner richer.</p><p>A spokesperson for Wexner told The Associated Press news agency that Wexner never received the letter and characterised it as fitting “a pattern of untrue, outlandish, and delusional statements made by Epstein in desperate attempts to perpetuate his lies and justify his misconduct”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Wexner did not publicly reveal until after Epstein’s arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 that he had severed their relationship. While he said that happened in 2007, the Justice Department’s newly released records show the two were in touch after that.</p><p>Wexner emailed Epstein on June 26, 2008, after a plea deal was announced that would require him to serve 18 months in a Florida jail on a state charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor to avoid federal prosecution. He wound up serving 13 months.</p><p>“Abigail told me the result. All I can say is I feel sorry. You violated your own number 1 rule always be careful,” Wexner wrote.</p><p>Epstein replied, “no excuse”.</p><p>Wexner’s spokesperson told the AP the 2007 date Wexner cited applied to firing Epstein as financial adviser, revoking his power of attorney and removing his name from Wexner’s bank accounts.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Several regional Middle East powers have joined the board, with Israel becoming a late, and to some, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">disconcerting</a> addition in early February.</p><p>As of Thursday’s meeting, the board still has no Palestinian representation, which many observers see as a major obstacle to finding a lasting path forward.</p><p>“What exactly does Trump want to get out of this meeting?” Yousef Munayyer, the head of the Israel-Palestine programme at the Arab Center Washington DC, questioned.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“I think he wants to be able to say that people are participating, that people believe in his project and in his vision and in his ability to move things forward,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But I don’t think that you’re going to see any major commitments until there are clearer resolutions to the key political questions that so far remain outstanding.”</p><h2 id=\"only-game-in-town\">‘Only game in town’</h2><p>To be sure, the Board of Peace currently remains the “only game in town” for parties interested in bettering the lives of Palestinians in Gaza, Munayyer explained, while simultaneously remaining “extremely and intimately tied to the persona of Donald Trump”.</p><p>That raises serious doubts over the board’s longevity in what is likely to be a decades-long response to the crisis.</p><p>“Regional players that have a serious concern over the future of the region and concern over the genocide have no choice but to really hope that their participation in this Board of Peace allows them to have some leverage and some direction over the future of Gaza in the next several years,” Munayyer said.</p><p>He assessed the greatest opportunity for member states who “understand the challenges and understand the context” would be to focus on “what realistically can be achieved in the time period … to focus on the immediate needs and address them aggressively”. That includes health infrastructure, freedom of movement, making sure that people have shelter, pushing for an end to ceasefire violations, to name a few, he said.</p><p>At least 72,063 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, with 603 killed since the October 11, 2025, “ceasefire” went into effect. Nearly the entire population of 2.1 million has been displaced, with more than 80 percent of buildings destroyed.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321828 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Which-country-has-accepted-thier-invitation-to-the-Board-of-Peace-FEB15-2026-copy-1771402622.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Which country has accepted thier invitation to the Board of Peace\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>For his part, Trump, who has previously envisioned turning Gaza into a “Middle East Riviera”, struck a positive tone ahead of the meeting. In a post on his Truth Social account on Sunday, Trump touted the “unlimited potential” of the board, which he said would prove to be the “most consequential International Body in History”.</p><p>Trump also said that $5bn in funding pledges would be announced “toward the Gaza Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts” and that member states “have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans”.</p><p>He did not provide further details.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is a member of the panel’s so-called “Gaza executive board”, unveiled the clearest vision yet of Washington’s “master plan” for Gaza in January.</p><p>The plan, assembled without any input from Palestinians in Gaza, outlined gleaming residential towers, data centres, seaside resorts, parks, and sports facilities, predicated on the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/map-shows-what-would-happen-to-gaza-under-the-us-master-plan\">erasure</a> of the enclave’s urban fabric.</p><p>At the time, Kushner did not say how the reconstruction plan would be funded. He said it would begin following full disarmament by Hamas and the withdrawal of the Israeli military, both issues that remain unresolved.</p><h2 id=\"pressure-on-israel\">Pressure on Israel?</h2><p>As the US administration stargazes over sweeping construction plans, it is likely to face a starker reality when it meets with a collection of the 25 countries that have signed on as members, as well as several others that are sending observers to the meeting, according to Annelle Sheline, a research fellow in the Middle East programme at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.</p><p>Any progress to show the board’s “proof of concept” would all-but-surely require asserting unilateral pressure on Israel, she noted.</p><p>“Trump is hoping to have countries back up his claim about the $5bn, to get actual commitments on paper,” Sheline told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is probably going to be challenging, because – especially the Gulf countries – have been very clear that they’re not interested in financing another reconstruction that’s just going to be destroyed again in a few years.”</p><p>Israel’s decision to join the board, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had initially opposed, has <a href=\"/features/2026/1/22/why-did-israel-join-trumps-board-of-peace-after-raising-objections\">piqued concerns</a> about further influence over US policy. An act of good faith by the US to advance a more lasting peace could be the inclusion of a Palestinian official on the board, Sheline added.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321616\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Who-is-on-the-Board-of-Peace-FEB15-2026-1771396780.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Who is part of Trump's Board of Peace?\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>She proposed widely popular Palestinian political prisoner <a href=\"/news/2025/12/6/palestinian-groups-express-grave-concerns-over-marwan-barghoutis-safety\">Marwan Barghouti</a>, who is continuing to serve consecutive life sentences in Israel, as a possible candidate. His release, she said, could be an example of an area where Washington could use its leverage to immediate effect.</p><p>In the shorter term, “[interested member states] are largely waiting for the security situation to resolve. Israel violates the ceasefire daily and moves the yellow line”, Sheline said, referring to the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/yellow-line-the-de-facto-israeli-buffer-zone-shaping-life-in-gaza\">demarcation</a> in Gaza behind which Israel’s military was required to withdraw as part of the first phase of the “ceasefire” agreement.</p><p>Indonesia’s government has said it is preparing to commit 1,000 troops to a stabilisation force, which could eventually grow to 8,000. But any deployment would likely remain delayed without better ceasefire guarantees, she said.</p><p>“It’s still an active warzone,” Sheline added. “So it’s very understandable that even Indonesia, which has hypothetically said it would contribute troops to the stabilisation force, is likely going to say we’re not actually going to do that until the situation is stable.”</p><h2 id=\"an-opportunity\">An opportunity?</h2><p>Ensuring an actual ceasefire is enforced – including creating accountability mechanisms for violations – remained “by far the most critical” task for the board’s inaugural meeting, according to Laurie Nathan, the director of the mediation programme at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame.</p><p>Trump’s Board of Peace is “not going to be able to play a meaningful reconstruction role in the absence of stability in Gaza, and stability requires adherence to the ceasefire”, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The next key step – and a major development that could come from Thursday’s meeting – would be a commitment of troops, although Nathan noted any deployment would still likely be deadlocked until a voluntary <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/hamas-rejects-netanyahu-aides-60-day-ultimatum-for-group-to-disarm\">Hamas disarmament</a> agreement is reached.</p><p>On the face of the situation, Trump would appear increasingly incentivised to use Washington’s considerable leverage over Israel to foster a stability in Gaza that the president has closely aligned with his own self-image.</p><p>After all, Trump and his allies have regularly portrayed the US president as the “peacemaker-in-chief”, repeatedly touting his success in conflict resolution, even if facts on the ground <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/12/eight-wars-ended-whats-happened-to-trumps-peace-deals\">undermine</a> the claims. Trump has been vocal in his belief that he should be <a href=\"/opinions/2025/10/16/how-trump-got-his-nobel-peace-prize-after-all\">awarded</a> the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>Still, “Trump’s motivation is multifold,” Nathan explained.</p><p>“Does he care about peace? I think he does. Does he want to be a peace broker? Yes. Does he genuinely want the Nobel Peace Prize? Yes.”</p><p>“On the other hand, he is performative … it’s never quite clear how much of it is serious for him,” he added. “The further problem is that personal interests are always involved when Trump is doing these things.”</p><h2 id=\"wider-ambitions\">Wider ambitions?</h2><p>Both Washington’s Western allies and experts in conflict resolution have <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trumps-board-of-peace-an-effort-to-curtail-middle-powers-says-expert\">scrutinised</a> what appears to be the yawning scope of the Board of Peace, far beyond the Gaza purview approved by the UN Security Council last year.</p><p>A widely reported founding “charter” sent to invited countries did not directly reference Gaza as it took digs at pre-existing approaches to peace-building that “foster perpetual dependency and institutionalise crisis rather than leading people beyond it”. Instead, it envisioned a “more nimble and effective international peace-building body”.</p><p>Critics have further questioned Trump’s singular and indefinite role as “chairman” and sole veto-holder, which largely undermines the principles of multilateralism intended to be enshrined in organisations such as the UN. They have argued that the structure fosters a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/rights-advocates-welcome-canadas-exclusion-from-trump-board-of-peace\">transactional approach</a> both in dealings with the US government and Trump as an individual.</p><p>Richard Gowan, the programme director of global issues and institutions at International Crisis Group, said those concerns are unlikely to subside any time soon. Still, he did not see that precluding European countries from supporting the board’s effort if it is able to make meaningful progress.</p><p>“I think, in practical terms, you will see other countries trying to support what the board is doing in the Gaza case, while continuing to keep it at arm’s length over other issues,” he said.</p><p>Thursday’s meeting could indicate the Board of Peace’s dynamic and tone going forward.</p><p>“If Trump uses his authority under the charter to order everyone around, block any proposals he doesn’t like, and run this in a completely personalistic fashion,” Gowan said, “I think even countries that want to make nice with Trump will wonder what they’re getting into.”</p><p>“If Trump shows his mellower side. If he’s actually willing to listen, in particular to the Arab group and what they’re saying about what Gaza needs, if it looks like a genuine conversation in a genuine contact group,” he added, “that won’t erase all the questions about the board’s future, but it will at least suggest that it can be a serious sort of diplomatic framework.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

So, we [civilians in northern Yemen] will again face US strikes,” said Ammar.</p><p>He argued that peace in Yemen should be prioritised over solidarity with Iran.</p><p>“Iran is a powerful country, and it can defend its interests. Even if the Houthis intervened, their missiles or drones would not cripple the US military. They will only bring us trouble,” Ammar told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"legitimate-concerns\">Legitimate concerns</h2><p>The future of Yemen’s Houthis is tied to Iran, and civilian worry over what lies ahead during Ramadan and in the months following is legitimate, Abulsalam Mohammed, the head of the Yemeni Abaad Studies and Research Center, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“A war against the Houthis in northern Yemen remains an option [for anti-Houthi forces]. This option will be scrapped should the group come to talks and recognise the legitimacy of the UN-recognised Yemeni government,” said Mohammed.</p><p>He indicated that Houthi involvement in any US-Iran military conflict would only accelerate the launch of anti-Houthi operations by Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government in Yemen’s north.</p><p>The Yemeni government has been emboldened by a recent campaign against the separatist Southern Transitional Council, forcing them out of much of southern Yemen with the backing of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“The coming military operations against the rebel group, in my view, will not be limited to air strikes. There will be advances by local ground forces, coupled with foreign aerial cover. We witnessed how the separatists collapsed in the north, and the fall of the Houthis in the north is also possible,” Mohammed said.</p><p>The United Nations’s special envoy to Yemen, Hans Grundberg, warned that stabilisation in any part of the country will not be durable if the broader conflict in Yemen is not addressed comprehensively.</p><p>“It is high time to take decisive steps in this regard. Without a wider negotiated political settlement to the conflict, gains will continue to remain vulnerable to reversal,” said Grundberg in a briefing delivered to the UN Security Council on February 12.</p><p>For Sanaa resident Ahmed Abdu, it does not matter who wins any future conflict in the country. His priority is staying safe from the direct consequences of hostilities.</p><p>“During Ramadan last year, I lost my source of income, the motorbike, in an air strike. That loss could be replaced. I only wish a peaceful Ramadan this year and a lasting end to the war,” said Ahmed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

reports.</p><p>The attack on Mukhmas and other Palestinian towns and villages constitutes a “dangerous escalation in systematic terrorism and reflects a complete partnership between the settlers and the occupation forces,” Mu’ayyad Sha’ban, head of the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, told Wafa.</p><p>Calling for international protection for Palestinian communities, Sha’ban said that settlers have now killed 37 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since October 2023, but the escalating violence would not deter Palestinians from holding onto their land.</p><p>Mukhmas and the adjacent Bedouin community of Khallat al-Sidra have faced repeated attacks by Israeli settlers, often occurring with the protection or presence of Israeli forces, according to reports.</p><p>The governorate of Jerusalem, one of the 16 administrative districts of Palestine, said in a statement that the killing of the young man by Israeli settlers was a “fully-fledged crime… carried out under the protection and supervision of the Israeli occupation forces.”</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: Martyr of the town of Mukhmas, Nasrallah Abu Siyam, who ascended after succumbing to his injury from settler gunfire during the attack on the town northeast of occupied Jerusalem.</em></p><p>The governorate said the attack was part of a dangerous surge of violence carried out by settlers in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and characterised by the widespread use of live ammunition, direct shooting at Palestinian citizens, as well as burning local Palestinian homes, damaging vehicles and property, and seizing land.</p><p>Armed settler violence is being supported by “pillars of the Israeli government”, foremost among them far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, the governorate added, according to Wafa.</p><p>According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since 2023, and more than 10,000 people have been forcibly displaced.</p><p>Since the start of this year alone, almost 700 Palestinians in nine communities have been displaced due to settler attacks, including 600 displaced from the Ras Ein al-Auja Bedouin community in Jericho governorate, OCHA reports.</p><p>Earlier this week, Israel’s government approved a plan to designate large areas of the occupied West Bank as Israeli “state property”, shifting the burden of proof to Palestinians to establish ownership of their land in a longstanding situation where Israel has made it all but impossible to obtain property titles.</p><p>Described as de-facto annexation of the West Bank, the Israeli government’s decision has drawn widespread international condemnation as a grave escalation that undermines the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.</p><p>Israel’s attempted land

That ceremony will mark the end of Balcazar’s leadership.</p><p>Balcazar’s short tenure is the latest sign of turbulence in Peru’s government. Of Peru’s last eight presidents, four have been impeached and removed from office, and two have resigned before their term’s end.</p><p>The last president to serve a complete term was Ollanta Humala, whose presidency ended in July 2016.</p><p>Balcazar’s ascent to the presidency, however, was marked by its own turmoil. In an initial round of voting, centre-right lawyer Maria del Carmen Alva, 58, and Balcazar, 83, came out ahead, with 43 and 46 votes respectively.</p><p>But they both fell short of the 59 votes needed to be president, so another round of voting was announced.

May God help Peru.”</p><p>Balcazar hails from the left-wing Peru Libre — or Free Peru — party. Born in the northern department of Cajamarca, near the border with Ecuador, he studied law and eventually became a professor and a judge.</p><p>His time in the judiciary, however, was not without controversy. In 2004, while serving as a provisional member of Peru’s Supreme Court, he attempted to overturn a cassation ruling that was considered a final judgment under the law.</p><p>He was subjected to disciplinary hearings, and Peru’s National Board of Justice (CNM) ultimately decided not to renew his term on the high court’s bench.</p><p>Since 2021, Balcazar has been a member of Congress, briefly separating from the Free Peru for a period to join the Peru Bicentenario party.</p><p>Like many of Peru’s recent presidents, Balcazar has also been dogged by the spectre of corruption and scandal.</p><p>His defence of child marriage has raised eyebrows when Congress debated a law to outlaw the practice in 2023. And he has faced investigations for misappropriating money from the Lambayeque Bar Association and for his involvement in a bribery scandal involving former Attorney General Patricia Benavides.</p><p>But despite his prominent controversies, Balcazar’s candidacy was able to unify enough lawmakers to win the vote, no small feat in Peru’s fragmented Congress.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-to-jose-jeri\">What happened to Jose Jeri?</h2><p>Jeri, 39, was one of the youngest presidents to lead Peru. But he ultimately was the latest in a string of three consecutively impeached presidents.</p><p>His predecessor, Dina Boluarte, had been impeached in October for “moral incapacity”, amid dismal poll numbers, allegations of corruption and scrutiny over her use of force against protesters.</p><p>Boluarte, in turn, had replaced her predecessor, Pedro Castillo of the Free Peru party, who was impeached in December 2022 after he attempted what many consider a self-coup.</p><p>He was subsequently arrested and charged with rebellion and conspiracy against the state. Last November, a court sentenced him to 11 years and five months in prison.</p><p>Before becoming interim president, Jeri was the head of Congress, and he oversaw removal proceedings against Boluarte.</p><p>Since taking office, however, Jeri himself became embroiled <a href=\"/news/2026/2/14/peru-to-debate-removal-of-president-jose-jeri-four-months-into-his-term\">in multiple scandals</a>. A sexual misconduct accusation was levelled against him, and there were also questions raised about late-night meetings he took in the executive office with women who later received government contracts.</p><p>One of the biggest scandals, though, has concerned his off-the-books meetings with Chinese businessmen.</p><p>Normally, Peruvian law requires official meetings to be logged on the presidential agenda. But Peruvian media obtained video showing Jeri — his face obscured by a hoodie — entering a restaurant owned by a Chinese businessman, Zhihua Yang, late at night.</p><p>The meeting was not documented in government records. More footage emerged of Jeri at the businessman’s wholesale store, this time wearing dark sunglasses.</p><p>Yang previously received a government concession under Boluarte to construct a hydroelectric plant. But he has faced scrutiny about the project’s transparency and progress.</p><p>A second Chinese businessman, Xiaodong Jiwu, was also allegedly at the meeting. He has been under house arrest for illegal activities.</p><p>Jeri denied speaking to Jiwu, saying he simply served food. As for his meetings with Yang, Jeri said they were attempts to arrange a Chinese-Peruvian friendship event. He also excused his presence at Yang’s businesses as shopping trips.</p><p>Though Jeri has denied wrongdoing, prosecutors have launched an investigation into potential influence-peddling under his presidency.</p><p>The scandal has become known as “Chifagate”, named for the Chinese-Peruvian fusion cuisine called “chifa”.</p><p>But the uproar comes as Peru faces pressure from the United States to limit its relations with China. The US Department of State <a href=\"https://x.com/WHAAsstSecty/status/2021617772854460897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warned</a> this month that Chinese investment in the port of Chancay could leave the country “powerless” over its own territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"

People everywhere will face more pollution, higher costs, and thousands of avoidable deaths,” Peter Zalzal, the associate vice president of clean air strategies at Environmental Defense Fund, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement.</p><p>The endangerment finding was considered a keystone policy for environmental regulations in the US, serving as the legal underpinning for policies to restrict greenhouse gas emissions and push clean-energy programmes.</p><p>But the Trump administration has led a movement to withdraw from climate-change initiatives, both domestically and on an international scale.</p><h2 id=\"withdrawing-from-clean-energy-initiatives\">Withdrawing from clean-energy initiatives</h2><p>Upon returning to office in January 2025, Trump announced he would once again pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, as he had during his first term.</p><p>More recently, on January 7 of this year, the Republican leader issued an <a href=\"http://whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-conventions-and-treaties-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> directing his government to end its engagement with dozens of international organisations and treaties, among them the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p><p>Trump had campaigned on the platform of slashing regulations and reinvesting in fossil fuels, often using the slogan, “Drill, baby, drill.”</p><p>He has since taken steps towards new oil exploration on federal lands and offshore, and just this month, he announced the Department of Defense would <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-strengthens-united-states-national-defense-with-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-power-generation-fleet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prioritise coal</a> for its energy production.</p><p>The president has coupled those actions with statements casting doubt on the science of climate change, which has been supported by decades of evidence.</p><p>In a speech to the UN General Assembly in September, for instance, Trump scolded world leaders for attempting to combat climate change.</p><p>“It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said.</p><p>He proceeded to denounce projections that the global temperatures would warm as a result of large-scale emissions. Those predictions, he said, “were made by stupid people” who had doomed their countries to “no chance of success”.</p><p>“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail. And I’m really good at predicting things,” he told the world leaders in the audience.</p><h2 id=\"not-a-mere-rollback\">‘Not a mere rollback’</h2><p>Rescinding the endangerment finding, however, was one of the most consequential actions Trump has taken on the domestic front to terminate clean-energy initiatives.</p><p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hailed</a> the move as “the single largest deregulatory action in US history”.</p><p>It has also argued that eliminating the endangerment finding allows US consumers greater choice in their purchase of automobiles, which had previously been subject to emission standards.</p><p>But critics argue it effectively collapses more than a decade and a half of environmental regulations, causing tumult even in the motor vehicle industry.</p><p>“This is not a mere rollback. The EPA is attempting to completely disavow its statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases from motor vehicles,” Brian Lynk, a senior lawyer with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in Wednesday’s statement.</p><p>“This reckless and legally untenable decision creates immediate uncertainty for businesses, guarantees prolonged legal battles, and undermines the stability of federal climate regulations.”</p><p>The World Health Organization has estimated that <a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-energy-and-health/health-impacts/exposure-air-pollution/worldwide-ambient-air-pollution-accounts-for-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">air pollution</a> contributes to more than seven million deaths annually. Wednesday’s lawsuit argues that the US government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from such harms.</p><p>There is also an economic angle, though. Proponents of the endangerment finding have pointed out that its repeal puts the US behind in developing innovations to address climate change and foster renewable energy.</p><p>With many countries pushing for fuel emission standards, US-made vehicles could lose export markets overseas, critics argue.</p><p>Wednesday’s lawsuit was filed in the US circuit court system in Washington, DC, and it names both the EPA and its administrator, Lee Zeldin, as defendants.</p></div></div></body></html>"

seven others over the past day, the region’s military administration said on the Telegram messaging platform.</li>\n<li>The attacks involved 448 drones as well as 163 artillery strikes, causing damage to 136 homes, cars and other structures, the military administration said.</li>\n<li>Russian forces also continued shelling Ukraine’s Donetsk region, forcing 173 people, including 135 children, to evacuate front-line areas over the past day, regional governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>A 54-year-old man was killed in a Russian attack in the Nikopol district of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Oleksandr Hanzha said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Russian attacks also left many people without electricity across Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Energy, including more than 99,000 households in the Odesa region.</li>\n<li>In Russia, one person was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the village of Aleynikovo in the country’s Bryansk region, Governor Alexander Bogomaz said.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Ministry of Defence said that Russian forces seized the village of Kharkivka in Ukraine’s Sumy region and Krynychne in the Zaporizhia region, according to Russia’s state news agency TASS.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian battlefield monitoring site DeepState said that Russian forces advanced in Nykyforivka in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.</li>\n<li>Russian forces shot down 155

“difficult”.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that although “progress has been made … for now, positions differ because the negotiations were difficult”.</li>\n<li>President Zelenskyy later told the Piers Morgan Uncensored current affairs show that Russia and Ukraine were close to defining terms for how a potential ceasefire would be monitored, but progress on “political” issues had been slower, including on the most divisive issue of control of territory.</li>\n<li>In Washington, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said there was “meaningful progress made” with pledges “to continue to work towards a peace deal together”, and more talks are expected in the near future.</li>\n<li>Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s top negotiator, said the two days of talks in Geneva were “difficult but businesslike,” telling reporters that further negotiations would be held soon, without specifying when.</li>\n<li>Rustem Umerov, the head of Kyiv’s negotiating team, said that the second day had been “intensive and substantive” and that both sides were working towards decisions that can be sent to their presidents, he said.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3

that we would see a stronger effort and some real work when we get back to put pressure on Putin”.</li>\n</ul><h3>Sport</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a post on Telegram that “allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the Milano-Cortina Paralympics while Russia continues its full-scale war against Ukraine is a disgrace”.</li>\n<li>Estonian Public Broadcasting company Eesti Rahvusringhaaling announced it would not broadcast the games in protest at the decision to allow the Russian and Belarusian athletes to

Tehran responded by threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz – a vital oil export route for Gulf oil – and warning it could <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">strike US military bases</a> in the region.</p><p>The exchange heightened fears of a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/irans-khamenei-maintains-tough-rhetoric-with-us-despite-nuclear-talks\">regional war</a> and prompted diplomatic efforts by Gulf states, including Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, to prevent escalation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"guiding-principles\">Guiding principles</h2><p>Iran and the US held a first round of indirect talks in Oman on February 6 before meeting in Geneva on Tuesday.</p><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the sides had agreed on <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/17/us-and-iran-reach-guiding-principles-in-geneva-nuclear-talks\">“guiding principles”</a> for a potential deal, but US Vice President JD Vance said Tehran had yet to acknowledge all of Washington’s red lines.</p><p>The US is demanding that Iran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil and has sought to widen negotiations to include non-nuclear issues, such as Tehran’s missile stockpile.</p><p>Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes and says it is willing to discuss limits only in exchange for sanctions relief. It has rejected zero uranium ‌enrichment and ruled out talks on its missile capabilities.</p><p>Even as diplomacy resumed, the US continues to build up its military presence near Iran. Trump has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, according to satellite imagery.</p><p>Iran has also sought to display its <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/16/iran-launches-naval-drills-ahead-of-us-nuclear-talks\">military might</a>, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) holding a series of war games on Monday and Tuesday in the Strait of Hormuz to prepare for “potential security and military threats”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-russia-drills\">Iran-Russia drills</h2><p>Tehran also announced on Wednesday new joint naval drills with Russia in the Sea of Oman.</p><p>Rear Admiral Hassan Maqsoudlou said the exercises on Thursday were intended “to convey a message of peace and friendship to regional countries”.</p><p>They are “also aimed at preventing any unilateral action in the region” and enhancing coordination against threats to maritime security, including risks to commercial vessels and oil tankers, he said.</p><p>Iranian authorities also issued a notice to airmen of planned rocket launches ⁠across parts of the country’s south on Thursday from 03:30 to 13:30 GMT.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, warned that any new ⁠US strike ⁠on Iran would have serious consequences and urged restraint to find a solution to enable Tehran to pursue a peaceful nuclear programme.</p><p>“The consequences are not good,” Lavrov said in the interview with Saudi Arabia’s Al-Arabiya television, which was posted on his ministry’s website. “There have already been strikes on Iran on nuclear sites under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency. From what we can judge, there were real risks of a nuclear incident.”</p><p data-start=\"3995\" data-end=\"4142\">He added that escalating tensions could undermine recent improvements in relations between Iran and neighbouring states, particularly Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“No one wants an increase in tension.

Full forces should be in place by mid-March,” the senior US official said.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/netanyahu-calls-for-dismantling-irans-nuclear-programme-in-any-us-deal\">discuss Iran</a> on February 28, the official said.</p><p>The Israeli Kan public broadcaster, meanwhile, reported that Israel is preparing for the possibility that Washington could give the green light for strikes on Iran’s ballistic missile system.</p><p>Barbara Slavin, a distinguished Fellow at the Stimson Center, said she expected further attacks on Iran by the US and Israel, possibly in the near term.</p><p>“What the objectives are, we have yet to see. Can it be contained? Will others be drawn in? These are all really important questions, and we don’t have answers to them,” she said.</p><p>“Frankly, I do not see a basis for an agreement yet,” she added. “It doesn’t look as though these talks were very extensive. They lasted only a couple of hours … And we do have this massive buildup. So I’m very concerned.”</p><p>“We will all be very nervously checking the news for the next few days,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Of those, 603 people have been killed since the declaration of a “ceasefire” in the Gaza Strip on October 10, 2025.</p><p>Israel has consistently questioned the ministry’s figures, but an Israeli army official told journalists in the country in January that the army accepted that about 70,000 people had been killed in Gaza during the war.</p><p>Despite the higher figure, researchers noted that the demographic composition of casualties – where women, children, and the elderly comprise 56.2 percent of those killed – remains remarkably consistent with official Palestinian reporting.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4321770\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4321770\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4321770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Gaza-death-toll-exceeds-75000-Lancet-study-1771400778.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Gaza death toll exceeds 75000 Lancet study-1771400778\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4321770\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"scientific-validation-of-the-toll\">Scientific validation of the toll</h2><p>The GMS, which interviewed 2,000 households representing 9,729 individuals, provides a rigorous empirical foundation for a death toll.</p><p>Michael Spagat, a professor of economics at Royal Holloway University of London and the study’s lead author, found that while MoH reporting remains reliable, it is inherently conservative due to the collapse of the very infrastructure required to document death.</p><p>Notably, this research advances upon findings <a href=\"/news/2025/1/10/deaths-from-israeli-attacks-in-gaza-undercounted-by-41-percent-study-finds\">published</a> in The Lancet in January 2025, which used statistical “capture-recapture” modelling to estimate 64,260 deaths during the war’s first nine months.</p><p>While that earlier study relied on probability to flag undercounts, this report shifts from mathematical estimation to empirical verification through direct household interviews. It extends the timeline through January 2025, confirming a violent toll exceeding 75,000 and quantifying, for the first time, the burden of “non-violent excess mortality”.</p><p>According to a separate commentary in the same publication, the systematic destruction of hospitals and administrative centres has created a “central paradox” where the more devastating the harm to the health system, the more difficult it becomes to analyse the total death toll.</p><p>Verification is further hindered by thousands of bodies still buried under rubble or mutilated beyond recognition. Beyond direct violence, the survey estimated 16,300 “non-violent deaths”, including 8,540 “excess” deaths caused directly by the deterioration of living conditions and the blockade-induced collapse of the medical sector.</p><p>Researchers highlighted that the MoH figures appear to be conservative and reliable, dispelling misinformation campaigns aimed at discrediting Palestinian casualty data. “The validation of MoH reporting through multiple independent methodologies supports the reliability of its administrative casualty recording systems even under extreme conditions,” the study concluded.</p><h2 id=\"a-decade-of-reconstructive-backlogs\">A decade of reconstructive backlogs</h2><p>While the death toll continues to mount, survivors face an unprecedented burden of complex injury that Gaza’s decimated healthcare system is no longer equipped to manage. A predictive, multi-source model published in eClinicalMedicine quantified 116,020 cumulative injuries as of April 30, 2025.</p><p>The study, led by researchers from Duke University and Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital, estimated that between 29,000 and 46,000 of these injuries require complex reconstructive surgery. More than 80 percent of these injuries resulted from explosions, primarily air attacks and shelling in densely populated urban zones.</p><p>The scale of the backlog is staggering. Ash Patel, a surgeon and co-author of the study, noted that even if surgical capacity were miraculously restored to pre-war levels, it would take approximately another decade to work through the estimated backlog of predicted reconstructive cases. Before the escalation, Gaza had only eight board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeons for a population exceeding 2.2 million people.</p><h2 id=\"the-collapse-of-the-health-system\">The collapse of the health system</h2><p>The disparity between reconstructive need and capacity is exacerbated by what researchers describe as the “systematic destruction” of medical infrastructure. By May 2025, only 12 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remained capable of providing care beyond basic emergency triage, with approximately 2,000 hospital beds available for the entire population, down from more than 3,000 beds before the war.</p><p>“There is little to no reconstructive surgery capacity left within Gaza,” the research concluded, warning that specialised expertise like microsurgery is almost absent. The clinical challenge is further compounded by Israel’s use of incendiary weapons, which produce severe burns alongside blast-related fractures.</p><p>The long-term effect of these injuries is often irreversible. Without prompt medical treatment, patients face high risks of wound infection, sepsis, and permanent disability. The data indicate that tens of thousands of Palestinians will remain with surgically addressable disabilities for life unless there is a huge international increase in reconstructive capacity and aid.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4013406\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Interactive_TwoYearofGaza_2-05-1759764785.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_TwoYearofGaza_HOSPITALS_DESTROYED_DAMAGED\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"the-grey-zone-of-mortality\">The ‘grey zone’ of mortality</h2><p>Writing in The Lancet Global Health, authors Belal Aldabbour and Bilal Irfan observed a growing “grey zone” in mortality where the distinction between direct and indirect death becomes blurred. Patients who die of sepsis months after a blast, or from renal failure after a crushing injury because they cannot access clean water or surgery, occupy a space that risks understating the true lethality of military attacks.</p><p>Conditions have only deteriorated since the data collection periods. By late 2025, forced evacuations covered more than 80 percent of Gaza’s area, with northern Gaza and Rafah governorates facing full razing by Israeli forces. Famine was declared in northern Gaza in August 2025, further reducing the physiological reserve of injured survivors and complicating any surgical recovery.</p><p>This series of independent studies serves as an urgent call for accountability and an immediate cessation of hostilities. “The healthcare infrastructure in Gaza is being repeatedly decimated by attacks despite protection by international humanitarian law,” researchers stated. They underscored that the only way to prevent the reconstructive burden from growing further is an immediate end to attacks against civilians and vital infrastructure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

She alleges that those apps fueled suicidal thoughts and depression.</p><p>Lanier alleged that Zuckerberg misled Congress about the design of its social media platforms.</p><p>Zuckerberg was questioned on his statements to the US Congress in 2024, during a hearing in which he said the company did not give its teams the goal of maximising time spent on its apps.</p><p>Lanier showed jurors emails from 2014 and 2015 in which Zuckerberg laid out aims to increase time spent on the app by double-digit percentage points. Zuckerberg said that while Meta previously had goals related to the amount of time users spent on the app, it has since changed its approach.</p><p>“If you are trying to say my testimony was not accurate, I strongly disagree with that,” Zuckerberg said.</p><h2 id=\"high-stakes\">High stakes</h2><p>The stakes are higher at the jury trial. Meta may have to pay damages if it loses the case, and the verdict could erode Big Tech’s longstanding legal defence against claims of user harm that liability is on the user and not the platform.</p><p>TikTok and Snap, who were previously named in the case, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/meta-tiktok-and-youtube-face-landmark-trial-over-youth-addiction-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reached a settlement.</a> TikTok settled the same day the case began for undisclosed terms. Snap settled a week before, also for undisclosed terms.</p><p>The case is the first among a slew of similar ones that allege that social media platforms designed features that the companies knew would addict young consumers and affect their mental health. Families, school districts and states around the US have filed roughly 1,600 lawsuits against various social media giants, including Meta, TikTok, Google and Snap.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The outcome will help determine how to handle the remaining cases. The jury’s decisions will provide guidance,” Tre Lovell, a Los Angeles-based media law and entertainment lawyer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If the plaintiffs lose and the defendants successfully argue that the platforms are not products, that there is no causation, or that the algorithms had nothing to do with the alleged harm, and that the plaintiffs’ own circumstances are responsible, then Meta and Google’s YouTube will likely take a firmer stance in the remaining cases.”</p><p>Meta has denied the allegations made by KGM.</p><p>“We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a spokesperson for Meta said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most.”</p><p>Meta introduced new safety features in 2025, including, in April, blocking teens under 16 from going live on Instagram. In September, the company launched a school partnership programme that gives educators expedited review of complaints, such as cyberbullying.</p><p>Zuckerberg’s testimony follows Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, who appeared in front of the court last week. He said he was unaware of an internal Meta study that showed that there is no link between parental supervision and teens’ attentiveness to their own social media use.</p><p>Teens with difficult life circumstances more often said they used Instagram habitually or unintentionally, according to the document shown at trial.</p><p>Paul Schmidt, one of Meta’s lawyers, did not dispute KGM’s mental health challenges, but argued that Instagram was not a substantial factor in her struggles. He attributed her difficulties to problems at home and said she used social media as a coping mechanism for deeper personal issues.</p><p id=\"the-question-for-the-jury-in-los-angeles-is-whether-instagram-was-a-substantial-factor-in-the-plaintiff-s-mental-health-struggles-the-evidence-will-show-she-faced-many-significant-difficult-challenges-well-before-she-ever-used-social-media-a-meta-spokesperson-added\">“The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff’s mental health struggles. The evidence will show she faced many significant, difficult challenges well before she ever used social media,” a Meta spokesperson added.</p><h2 id=\"wide-ramifications\">Wide ramifications</h2><p>The case itself is seen as one that could fundamentally change social media, with legal experts likening it to lawsuits that faced the tobacco industry decades ago.</p><p>Social media platforms have largely been protected by Section 230, a provision added in 1996 to the Communications Act of 1934. The law protects internet companies from liability for content posted by users on their platforms.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But this latest case emboldens critics calling for reforms, according to Lovell.</p><p>“Lawmakers may need to carve out greater obligations and duties for internet and social media companies rather than maintain blanket immunity,” Lovell said.</p><p>“With the rise of artificial intelligence and ongoing online abuse, Section 230 has become an enabler for those who want to harm others. Guardrails are needed.”</p><p>On Wall Street, Meta stock ended the day up 0.61 percent, but is down in after-hours trading at the time of publishing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly 200,000 recipients could now lose their coverage due to the increased paperwork, said Suzanne Jiminez, chief of staff at the SEIU-UHW.</p><p>Darien Shanske, a law professor at the University of California at Davis, said it was the “moment of crisis” created by the OBBBA that had pushed him and others to draft the tax on the state’s estimated 200 billionaires. In exploring the various alternatives to make up for the lost funds due to Trump’s bill, he had thought about “the failure of income tax to reach the ultra wealthy”.</p><p>But critics of a billionaire tax, such as the California Policy Center’s Joffe, say that the estimates of those who would lose cover may be overblown.</p><p>For instance, he said, those who can work could be asked to work, get involved in the community or go to college in exchange for their coverage. New undocumented migrants will not be enrolled from this year, and they will have to pay $30 from next year onwards for their coverage.</p><p>“It’s not as big a deal as the unions say,” Joffe told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Most of all, it is the taxing of intangible assets, including equity shares, that has raised hackles. Successful startup founders often have their wealth in the form of equity in their companies, making them billionaires. But imposing a tax on this “punishes people for being innovative”, Joffe said. “There is the emotional aspect of it, the perceived injustice.”</p><p>This sentiment could be at the heart of the flurry of moves out of the state. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is in talks to buy a $200m home in Miami, possibly becoming the latest of several billionaires to move out of California as the prospect of the billionaire tax looms, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Days before the January 1, 2026, applicable date for the tax, should it come into place, Google cofounders terminated or moved 15 related companies from the state, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Billionaires are also funding opposition to the tax. Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, who has also reportedly moved out of the state, donated $3m to a political committee of the California Round Table to oppose the measure. More such donations are expected to flow in.</p><p>But Jiminez of the SEIU-UHW said the idea of a flight of capital and talent “is a scare tactic that will not play out”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250867\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250867\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696db9535fd3-1768798547.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250867\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_696db9535fd3-1768798547.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A banner bearing portraits of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg with a slogan is seen during a demonstration against the World Economic Forum (WEF) on the eve of the WEF annual meeting in Davos on January 18, 2026.

They are also strong sources of employment in these communities.</p><p>Sanchez spent Valentine’s Day evening and most evenings this month at a brewery near her house collecting signatures for the ballot measure from customers, while her kids did homework on a table nearby.</p><p>Daniel Schnur, a political analyst who also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute of Government Studies, said that “it would be surprising if [the measure] didn’t qualify” for the November ballots. “The timing of it may be very effective.”</p><p>While many voters who have aspired to be wealthy may looked up to Silicon Valley billionaires, they have become more disenchanted, he said.</p><p>A 2025 Harris poll found that 94 percent of respondents said that a wealth gap exists, with corporate tax loopholes being a top driver behind the disparity. Some 71 percent of the respondents said they supported a wealth tax.</p><p>California’s billionaire tax proposal also found support in a poll conducted in January by the Mellman Group for a Republican strategist, with 48 percent respondents saying they supported it and 38 percent saying they did not.</p><p>With opinion deeply divided between the state’s unions on one side and its top taxpayers on the other, Newsom, who is in his final term as governor, could face a difficult balancing act ahead.</p><p>“What is the governor’s plan?” Sanchez asked about the increased paperwork and possible loss of Medi-Cal coverage for many residents.</p><p>Given that the loss of taxpayers due to the proposed billionaire’s tax could have a detrimental impact on the state’s already precarious budget, getting signatures for the measure could be just the beginning of a rocky path ahead.</p><p>“It is likely that Governor Newsom will try to find a legislative solution to this. Legislators could seek to modify the bill if it is acceptable to the movers,” Schnur said.</p><p>California Policy Center’s Joffe said that if the measure gets voted on in November, it could also face legal challenges, and “will be litigated up to the Supreme Court”.</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and conservative commentator, has said that with the billionaires moving their homes, the prospect of the tax has already <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/california-billionaire-tax-proposal-hemorrhages-1-trillion-billionaires-flee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">led to $1 trillion</a> leaving the state. It is not clear how he arrived at that figure.</p><p>But “this is paper mobility”, said Shanske, the bill’s co-author.</p><p>“People club where there is talent and amenities, and gutting healthcare will make the state less attractive.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The segment in question involves an appearance from Texas state Representative James Talarico, a Democrat who is vying for the US Senate.</p><p>The confirmation comes as Carr attempted to shut down claims that the government censored an interview between Talarico and late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert.</p><p>“There was no censorship here at all,” Carr said.</p><p>“Every single broadcaster in this country has an obligation to be responsible for the programming that they choose to air, and they’re responsible whether it complies with FCC rules or not, and it doesn’t, and those individual broadcasters are also going to have a potential liability.”</p><p>The controversy with Colbert likewise stems from the Trump administration’s decision to shift definitions under the “equal time” rule.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-equal-time-rule\">What is the ‘equal time’ rule?</h2><p>The rule is part of section 315 of the 1934 Communications Act. Under that law, if a broadcaster allows one candidate for public office to use its facilities, it is required to “afford equal opportunities” to all other candidates in the same race.</p><p>But the law includes exceptions for “bona fide newscasts” and “bona fide news interviews”.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, talk shows and late-night comedy programmes <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/us-fcc-notice-to-broadcasters-prompts-concerns-on-curtailing-free-speech\">were included</a> in those categories.</p><p>In January, however, the FCC issued new guidance (<a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-26-68A1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>) that significantly narrows how it interprets the “bona fide news” exemption. In a memo, it described daytime talk shows and late-night comedy as “entertainment programs” that fall outside the exception.</p><p>“The FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” the memo reads.</p><p>The commission also suggested that many such programmes are “motivated by partisan purposes” and are therefore not “bona fide” news.</p><p>The new interpretation of the “equal time” rule, the FCC argued, is designed to “ensure that no legally qualified candidate for office is unfairly given less access to the public airwaves than their opponent.”</p><h2 id=\"controversy-with-colbert\">Controversy with Colbert</h2><p>That new interpretation came roaring into the spotlight on Monday, after a broadcast of the CBS comedy programme The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p><p>In one of his opening segments, Colbert alleged that the network lawyers barred him from airing a planned interview that night with Talarico.</p><p>“Let’s just call it what it is,” Colbert told his audience. “Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV. OK? He’s like a toddler with too much screen time.”</p><p>Trump has previously criticised both Colbert’s show and The View for what he considers a left-wing slant.</p><p>Instead of broadcasting his interview with Talarico on network television, Colbert instead posted the segment on the programme’s YouTube page, where it has gained more than 6 million views as of 3:30pm Eastern Time (20:30 GMT) on Wednesday.</p><p>According to Carr, Colbert’s show could have aired the Talarico interview if it had complied with the equal time rule.</p><p>That would have involved allowing other candidates in Texas vying for the Senate seat to come on the show. Carr also suggested that another solution could have been to restrict the broadcast in Texas.</p><p>But the FCC has continued to face criticisms for its actions. In Tuesday’s broadcast, Colbert addressed the issue a second time.</p><p>He read aloud a statement from his broadcast channel that read, in part, that The Late Show “was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview” and that it was instead “provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule”.</p><p>CBS added, in the statement, that Colbert could have invited onto the show Talarico’s rivals, including fellow Democrat Jasmine Crockett.</p><p>“I am well aware that we can book other guests,” Colbert responded. “I didn’t need to be presented with that option. I’ve had Jasmine Crockett on my show twice. I could prove that to you, but the network won’t let me show you her picture without including her opponents.”</p><p>Colbert has been a vocal critic of CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, particularly after it settled a lawsuit last year with the Trump administration for $16m in the run-up to a critical merger for which it needed government approval.</p><p>Talarico, meanwhile, accused the FCC of censoring his interviews. Nevertheless, on Wednesday, he noted that the uptick in media attention from the scandal has helped him gather donations.</p><p>“Our campaign raised $2.5 million in 24 hours after the FCC banned our Colbert interview,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/jamestalarico/status/2024124888391287234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p></div></div></body></html>"
