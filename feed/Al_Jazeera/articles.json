This enormous, unsecured island is actually part of North America. That’s our territory,” he said.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256655 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND-Countries-in-the-Arctic-Circle-JAN-21-2026-1768987632.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND - Countries in the Arctic Circle - JAN 21, 2026-1768987632\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Trump proceeded to assert that no nation other than the US can secure Greenland, and that it was therefore essential for European leaders to turn the self-governing island over to US control.</p><p>“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.</p><p>He proceeded to describe the NATO alliance as a money sink for the US, one that failed to offer the country any benefits.</p><p>“We never asked for anything, and we never got anything,” Trump said.</p><p>The president’s remarks failed to acknowledge NATO’s assistance after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when the US invoked the alliance’s collective defence clause and member states sent military air defence in response.</p><p>Still, Trump continued to portray NATO as a moot investment, one that would not yield benefits unless forced.</p><p>“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won’t do that,” he said.</p><p>“That’s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”</p><p>Earlier this month, White House officials said Trump was considering “a range of options” for acquiring Greenland, including military action. At Davos, Trump again issued a warning to Denmark, setting an ultimatum to hand over Greenland.</p><p>“We’ve never asked for anything else. And we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn’t. So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember,” he said.</p><p>Hours later, the US president announced the “framework” for a Greenland deal, though it is unclear to what extent Denmark or Greenland had input or what the deal might look like.</p><p>Rutte later told Fox News that the issue of Greenland’s sovereignty did not come up in their conversation.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258194\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258194\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4258194\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty_6971317c13-1769025916.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"NUUK, GREENLAND - JANUARY 21: Residential houses stand next to fjord on January 21, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland.

And when America booms, the entire world booms. It’s been the history,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"367\" data-end=\"497\">“When it goes bad, it goes bad,” he added. “You all follow us down, and you follow us up. And we’re at a point that we’ve never – I don’t believe we’ve ever been. I never thought we could do it this quickly.”</p><p data-start=\"499\" data-end=\"722\">Trump, who returned to the White House for a second term in 2025, said he had expected economic improvements to take longer.</p><p data-start=\"724\" data-end=\"788\">“My biggest surprise is I thought it would take more than a year, maybe like a year and one month. But it’s happened very quickly.”</p><p data-start=\"790\" data-end=\"921\">He then turned his attention to Europe, offering a bleak assessment of the continent’s trajectory. Trump blamed the continent’s challenges on policies related to green energy and migration, without providing evidence to support the claim.</p><p data-start=\"923\" data-end=\"1021\">“Certain places in Europe are not recognisable, frankly, any more. They’re not recognisable,” Trump said, echoing anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p><p data-start=\"1023\" data-end=\"1113\">“I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258397\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258397\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4258397 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T151927Z_1505331004_RC2R5JAFUD0U_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769028490.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4258397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump gestures during the 56th annual World Economic Forum [Jonathan Ernst/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"tariffs-and-the-trade-deficit\">Tariffs and the trade deficit</h2><p data-start=\"332\" data-end=\"522\">Defending his prolific use of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, Trump credited the measures with chipping away at the US’s trade deficit and boosting domestic production.</p><p data-start=\"524\" data-end=\"741\">“With tariffs, we’ve radically reduced our ballooning trade deficit, which was the largest in world history. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. It was going to waste,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"743\" data-end=\"1128\">“But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77 percent. And all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done,” he added.</p><p data-start=\"1130\" data-end=\"1265\">Trump also pointed to what he described as gains in exports, manufacturing and industrial capacity as evidence of the policy’s success.</p><p data-start=\"1774\" data-end=\"2042\">“During the process, we’ve made historic trade deals with partners covering 40 percent of all US trade, some of the greatest companies and countries in the world. We have countries as our partners, too. The European nations, Japan, South Korea, they’re our partners,” he said.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"trump-on-venezuela-going-to-do-fantastically-well\">Trump on Venezuela: ‘Going to do fantastically well’</h2><p data-start=\"219\" data-end=\"495\">Speaking about Venezuela’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/why-access-to-venezuelas-heavy-oil-is-tremendous-news-for-us-refiners\">economy and oil sector</a>, Trump said the country had suffered a sharp decline because of past policies under socialist leaders like Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez.</p><p data-start=\"219\" data-end=\"495\">But he forecast that the South American country is now poised for a rapid turnaround, driven in part by cooperation with the US and international energy companies.</p><p data-start=\"219\" data-end=\"495\">Trump has taken an active interest in Venezuela’s governance since a January 3 military operation to <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/5/live-venezuelas-maduro-to-appear-in-court-trump-threatens-more-strikes\">abduct Maduro</a> and transport him to the US to face criminal charges. He has since confirmed that the US has extracted 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela following Maduro’s ouster.</p><p data-start=\"497\" data-end=\"609\">“Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"611\" data-end=\"841\">“Twenty years ago, it was a great country, and now it’s got problems. But we’re helping them. And those 50 million barrels, we’re going to be splitting up with them, and they’ll be making more money than they’ve made in a long time.”</p><p data-start=\"611\" data-end=\"841\">Trump proceeded to praise the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, for cooperating with his ambitions in Venezuela.</p><p data-start=\"973\" data-end=\"1217\">“Venezuela is going to do fantastically well,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"973\" data-end=\"1217\">“We appreciate all of the cooperation we’ve been given. We’ve been given great cooperation. Once the attack ended, the attack ended, and they said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’ More people should do that.”</p><p></p><p data-start=\"1219\" data-end=\"1365\">He went on to predict a dramatic economic recovery for the oil-rich nation, citing renewed foreign investment and support from major energy firms.</p><p data-start=\"1367\" data-end=\"1641\">“Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they’ve made in the last 20 years,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"1367\" data-end=\"1641\">“Every major oil company is coming in with us. It’s amazing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. The leadership of the country has been very good. They’ve been very, very smart.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925817\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Venezuela-oil-fields-and-pipelines-1756997792.png?quality=80\" alt=\"oil\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"onto-the-topic-of-energy\">Onto the topic of energy</h2><p data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"286\">Trump then turned to energy policy, highlighting a shift in his stance on nuclear power and reiterating his longstanding criticism of renewable energy.</p><p data-start=\"288\" data-end=\"509\">“We’re going heavy into nuclear. I was not a big fan because I didn’t like the risk, the danger, but the progress they’ve made with nuclear is unbelievable, and the safety progress they’ve made is incredible,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">“We’re very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.”</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">His statements follow a news release from the US Department of Energy on Tuesday that announced Trump would be “unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance” by expanding infrastructure to create such energy.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">Trump has also grown his personal business ties with private nuclear power firms. In December, the Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump is the majority owner, announced a $6bn merger with TAE Technologies, a fusion energy company.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">While Trump has warmed to nuclear power, he doubled down on his opposition to green energy initiatives designed to combat climate change. Calling such efforts the “Green New Scam” – his spin on the “Green New Deal” – he blamed Europe’s economic wobbles on efforts to embrace renewable technology.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">“There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,” he told his audience at Davos.</p><h2 id=\"canada-should-be-grateful\">‘Canada should be grateful’</h2><p data-start=\"79\" data-end=\"222\">From his podium, Trump also responded to Tuesday’s remarks from Canadian <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/rupture-in-the-world-order-speeches-by-carney-world-leaders-at-davos\">Prime Minister Mark Carney</a>.</p><p data-start=\"79\" data-end=\"222\">The leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, Carney had encouraged world leaders to prepare for a future without US leadership and warned that the “great powers” of the world appeared to be abandoning “even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power”.</p><p data-start=\"79\" data-end=\"222\">While Carney did not explicitly mention Trump, it was clear his remarks were aimed at the US leader. Trump replied more directly during his turn at the Davos podium.</p><p data-start=\"229\" data-end=\"283\">“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"290\" data-end=\"510\">“They should be grateful. But they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-says-he-is-meeting-zelenskyy\">Trump says he is meeting Zelenskyy</h2><p>Trump also spoke about the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>“I’m dealing with President Putin, and he wants to make a deal,” Trump said.</p><p>“I believe I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy, and I think he wants to make a deal. I’m meeting him today. He might be in the audience right now.”</p><p>A post on Zelenskyy’s social media account, however, showed the Ukrainian leader at his presidential office in Kyiv on Wednesday, holding a meeting on the energy situation following Russian strikes. His office confirmed he is in Ukraine, not at Davos.</p><p>Still, Trump insisted that he would help navigate Ukraine and Russia to an end to their war, which began nearly four years ago in February 2022.</p><p>“They’ve got to get that war stopped. Because too many people are dying, needlessly dying. Too many souls are being lost. It’s the only reason I’m interested in doing it. But in doing it, I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO,” he said.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"those-beautiful-sunglasses\">‘Those beautiful sunglasses’</h2><p>At one point in his meandering speech, Trump stopped to poke fun at French President Emmanuel Macron, mocking the aviator sunglasses he wore to Davos.</p><p>“I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?” Trump asked.</p><p>Macron’s office said the choice to wear sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256725\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256725\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256725\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-20T155101Z_1849653387_RC215JAXVF57_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-1768989838.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"France's President Emmanuel Macron attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">France’s President Emmanuel Macron attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum [Denis Balibouse/Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Ten percent caps would save borrowers about $100bn a year, according to a 2025 report from Vanderbilt University.</p><p>“One of the biggest barriers to saving for a down payment has been surging credit card debt,” Trump said.</p><p>The comments mark a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in Washington.</p><h2 id=\"an-unlikely-alliance\">An unlikely alliance</h2><p>Progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren, a ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said last week in an interview with CNBC that the president called her to discuss the possibility of working together on the proposal.</p><p>“Great, let’s get something done,” Warren said in the interview.</p><p>Trump’s comments echo an existing bill authored by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which also caps interest rates at 10 percent, but would last for a longer period of time and sunset in 2031. The bill, however, has been sitting stagnant in Congress. It was most recently referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in early February 2025.</p><p>The interest rate cap push comes as an increasing number of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of the US economy. A Wall Street Journal poll released earlier this month found that 54 percent disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy, a sentiment echoed by a recent CNN poll that found that 63 percent disapprove.</p><p>“I think we should test it,” Dimon said. “The government can do it, they should force all the banks to do it in two states, Vermont and Massachusetts [where Sanders and Warren represent], and see what happens.”</p><p>“People crying the most will not be the credit card companies. It will be the restaurants, retailers, travel companies, the schools, the municipalities, because people will miss their water payments, this payment and that payment,” Dimon said.</p><p>“President Trump is generating a lot of headlines from his credit card interest rate idea, but we’re still waiting for him to generate savings for real people. Last week, he said interest rates would be capped by January 20; this week, he says he needs help from Congress. I think it remains to be seen whether he’s serious about delivering on his promise,” Julie Margetta Morgan, president of economic think tank The Century Foundation, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"political-hurdles\">Political hurdles</h2><p>Banking executives like Dimon and Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser have said there are slim chances of this getting passed by Congress.</p><p>Beyond support from Trump and progressive Democrats, the bill will run into hurdles in Congress. Earlier this month, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the proposal could have “negative secondary effects”.</p><p>“The president is asking Congress to pass legislation, so he’s not going to try to personally set credit rates. That makes it highly unlikely we’ll see a 10 percent cap put in place anytime soon,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management. “It does give him an opportunity to point the finger at Congress if it doesn’t happen.”</p><p>On Wall Street, credit card company and bank stocks are fairly mixed on the heels of Dimon’s comments. Mastercard is down by 1.1 percent as is Visa by 1.7 percent. American Express, on the other hand, is up 1.9 percent since the market opened on Wednesday.</p><p>Bank stocks are trending upwards. Bank of America is up 0.5 percent, Wells Fargo by 0.1 percent and Citigroup by 1.2 percent in midday trading. JPMorgan Chase stock is about even on the day.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And the US has long-established laws and norms to protect the rights of journalists to report on sensitive topics from whistleblower sources.</p><p>But on January 14, the administration of President Donald Trump carried out a search warrant targeting Natanson’s home. Over the past year, she has been reporting on changes to the federal government under Trump, with 1,169 new sources reaching out to her with material.</p><p>The Justice Department has argued that the search warrant was necessary to collect information regarding Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, a government contractor who was arrested on January 8 for allegedly removing classified documents.</p><p>The sweep of Natanson’s home, however, resulted in the removal of her work computer, her Post-issued cellphone, her personal MacBook Pro, a one-terabyte hard drive, a voice recorder and a Garmin watch.</p><p>In court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.588772/gov.uscourts.vaed.588772.9.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filings</a> opposing the seizure, lawyers argued that Natanson’s electronics contained “years of information about past and current confidential sources and other unpublished newsgathering materials, including those she was using for current reporting”.</p><p>“Almost none of the seized data is even potentially responsive to the warrant, which seeks only records received from or relating to a single government contractor,” the complaint argues.</p><p>The complaint added that the six devices seized contained many terabytes of data, spanning her journalism career.</p><p>“Natanson’s devices contain essentially her entire professional universe: more than 30,000 Post emails from the last year alone,” it says.</p><p>The Post has sued the Justice Department for the return of the materials, and that case is slated to be heard before a federal court in Virginia.</p><p>“The outrageous seizure of our reporter’s confidential newsgathering materials chills speech, cripples reporting, and inflicts irreparable harm every day the government keeps its hands on these materials,” the newspaper wrote in a statement.</p><p>“We have asked the court to order the immediate return of all seized materials and prevent their use. Anything less would license future newsroom raids and normalize censorship by search warrant.”</p><p>The Trump administration has faced scrutiny for its combative approach to the media, and critics have accused it of seeking to erode the right to free speech, whether in newspapers or through legal protest.</p><p>Trump and his allies, however, have said they remain committed to ferreting out “leakers” in the government who release confidential material to the media.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi, for instance, accused Natanson of “reporting classified and illegally leaked information”.</p><p>“The leaker is currently behind bars,” she wrote in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2011456849711612019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>, referring to Perez-Lugones.</p><p>“The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation’s national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.”</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that stance, warning that the Trump administration would reserve the right to pursue legal action against anyone it believed to be engaging in illegal practices.</p><p>“The administration is not going to tolerate leaks, especially from within the national security apparatus of the United States government that put our nation’s integrity and our national security at risk, full stop,” she said.</p><p>“Legal action will be taken against anyone, whether it’s a member of the press or whether it’s an employee for a federal agency, who breaks the law.”</p><p>The First Amendment of the US Constitution declares that the government can make no law “abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press”.</p><p>Over the decades, the Supreme Court has ruled that the government may curtail the media when faced with a “clear and present danger”, but that the burden falls on the authorities to prove such a danger exists.</p><p>The Washington Post was involved in one of the cases that upheld that standard, New York Times v United States in 1971.</p><p>That case saw the administration of Republican Richard Nixon seek to stop the Times and the Post from publishing classified materials known as the Pentagon Papers – but the Supreme Court determined that their publication amounted to protected speech.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the tight relations have also bolstered Trump’s efforts to expand US authority throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Twice over the past year, Noboa has hosted Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem: once in July and a second time before the November ballot referendum.</p><p>“Ecuador has been an excellent partner to the U.S. in our work to stop illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and smugglers on land and on the seas,” Noem <a href=\"https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1986537214294302765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> at the time.</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a hallmark of his second term in office, calling the term “the most beautiful word” in the dictionary. Since returning to the White House in January 2025, he has enacted a sweeping tariff campaign, which includes a baseline tariff of 10 percent on nearly all trading partners and additional individualised tariffs for certain countries.</p><p>Trump has argued that tariffs protect domestic industries while feeding government coffers. He has also used the economic penalty as a means of forcing trading partners to submit to policy demands.</p><p>Last year, for instance, Trump threatened the US’s neighbours, Mexico and Canada, with tariff hikes if they failed to adequately combat drug smuggling and cross-border immigration.</p><p>His administration has similarly imposed a tariff on China to incentivise the country to staunch the flow of fentanyl.</p><p>But critics have questioned the legality of Trump’s tariff campaign and its coercive nature. Economists have also warned that the tax hikes on imports could result in higher consumer prices domestically.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258209\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4258209\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25349828664417-1769026036.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gustavo Petro speaks to police in uniform\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4258209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President Gustavo Petro delivers a speech during a police ceremony in Bogota, Colombia, on December 15, 2025 [Fernando Vergara/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fraying-relations-with-petro\">Fraying relations with Petro</h2><p>For his part, Noboa appears to be using the threat of tariffs not only to force compliance with Ecuador’s crime crackdown but also to strike back at Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro.</p><p>A former rebel fighter, Petro was elected in 2022 as his country’s first left-wing president. But he has faced criticism, both domestically and abroad, about his efforts to combat drug trafficking.</p><p>Colombia remains the world’s largest producer of cocaine. In a 2024 report, the United Nations said the country had seen 10 consecutive years of rising production potential. Nearly 253,000 hectares (645,000 acres) in the country were dedicated to the cultivation of coca leaves, the raw ingredient in cocaine.</p><p>Complicating efforts is a six-decade-long internal conflict in Colombia. The slow-simmering conflict has long pitted government forces, right-wing paramilitaries, left-wing rebels and criminal networks against each other.</p><p>Since taking office, Petro has departed from the heavy-handed crackdowns of his right-wing predecessors, instead opting for a “Total Peace” plan that involves dialogue with armed rebels and criminal groups.</p><p>His administration has also overseen a shift away from the forced eradication of coca crops, largely grown by impoverished rural farmers. Instead, it has pursued a strategy of voluntary crop substitution, while attacking the laboratories and facilities that process the leaf into drugs.</p><p>Petro has claimed his strategy has resulted in the destruction of nearly <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1995948716440821836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18,400</a> drug-making labs. In addition, last November, his administration claimed to have made Colombia’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/colombia-hails-historic-blow-after-largest-cocaine-bust-in-a-decade\">largest drug bust</a> in a decade, seizing 14 tonnes of cocaine.</p><p>But right-wing figures like Trump have called for “<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/presidential-determination-on-major-drug-transit-or-major-illicit-drug-producing-countries-for-fiscal-year-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more aggressive action</a>” from Colombia.

His election was buoyed, in part, by a pledge to tamp down on Ecuador’s burgeoning crime crisis.</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Ecuador has shed its reputation as an “island of peace” in Latin America, as criminal activity spiked.</p><p>That trend coincided with a steep rise in murders. As of 2024, the think tank Insight Crime found that Ecuador had a homicide rate of 44.6 for every 100,000 people, the highest proportion of any South American country. A total of 7,062 homicides were reported that year.</p><p>Experts say the crime wave reflects, in part, Ecuador’s strategic position between Colombia and Peru, the world’s second-largest cocaine producer.</p><p>But the timing of Noboa’s tariffs has raised questions about the president’s motives — and whether he was strictly focused on crime, rather than politics.</p><p>On Tuesday, one day before the new tariffs were unveiled, Petro <a href=\"http://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2013731006914666929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media a message in support of Ecuador’s former Vice President Jorge Glas, a left-wing figure.</p><p>In 2024, Noboa had authorised a controversial raid on Mexico’s embassy in Quito to arrest Glas on bribery charges. Glas currently resides in a maximum security prison, and Petro has accused the Ecuadorian government of using “psychological torture” against the former politician.</p><p>“Just as I demanded the release of political prisoners in Venezuela and Nicaragua, I believe Jorge Glass should be released,” Petro wrote on Tuesday.</p><p>The Glas case has been a source of ongoing tension between Petro and Noboa, leading some critics to speculate whether the tariffs were, in part, a response to Tuesday’s post.</p><p>Ecuador and Colombia are among each other’s top trading partners, and the new taxes are likely to spur questions about the future of regional trade agreements.</p></div></div></body></html>"

More and more people are seeing that ICE is dangerous, violent, operating with impunity. More and more people are angry, scared, motivated, and more and more people are looking to their members of Congress for action.”</p><p>To be sure, a change of direction remains an enormous undertaking, according to observers.</p><p>Trump’s tax bill, passed last year by the Republican-controlled Congress, which the president <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/trump-claims-victory-as-he-signs-controversial-budget-and-tax-bill-into-law\">dubbed</a> his “Big Beautiful Bill”, included a gargantuan windfall of $170bn for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>About $75bn of that was allocated to ICE over the next four years – $45bn to grow detention capacity and $30bn to boost enforcement operations. That comes on top of ICE’s annual operating budget, which has hovered around $10bn in recent years and is subject to congressional approval.</p><p>The additional funding has been <a href=\"https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/news/minority/appropriations-committees-release-remaining-funding-bills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described</a> by critics as a “slush fund” with little oversight.</p><p>It makes ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency by miles, while feeding what the Brennan Center for Justice has <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> a new “deportation industrial complex”.</p><h2 id=\"shifting-public-opinion\">Shifting public opinion</h2><p>As Trump begins the second year of his second term, his administration controls an ICE force that has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/has-us-ice-officer-training-been-reduced-to-47-days\">doubled in size</a> in recent months, now topping 22,000 agents. They are tasked with reaching a ballooning daily detention goal of 100,000, nearly three times the typical rate, as well as a target of one million deportations a year, far beyond the 605,000 the administration reported during Trump’s first year in office.</p><p>Advocates say US residents are beginning to understand what those numbers portend.</p><p>Video recording of the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in a Minneapolis suburb on January 7 flashflooded across social media, casting doubt, if not completely contradicting, the Trump administration’s immediate claims that Good was attempting to run over an immigration officer when he opened fire.</p><p>Within minutes, Trump officials labelled Good a “domestic terrorist”, with the federal government soon dismissing local authorities from taking part in the investigation and repudiating calls for a customary <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/doj-says-wont-investigate-ice-agents-fatal-shooting-of-renee-good\">civil rights probe</a>.</p><p>The administration then sent hundreds more federal agents to the state, bringing the total to 3,000, as it portrayed protests that spread to hundreds of cities across the US as the work of “agitators” and “insurrectionists”. The Department of Justice has since <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-justice-department-probes-minnesota-officials-amid-migration-raids\">opened investigations</a> into Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state Governor Tim Walz, two of the most vocal critics of the administration’s actions, for alleged conspiracy to impede immigration enforcement.</p><p>The State of Minnesota, as well as the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul, have launched a lawsuit alleging ICE agents have regularly tread on the civil liberties of residents. Images and videos of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/ice-officer-shoots-venezuelan-immigrant-in-minneapolis-what-we-know\">sometimes violent</a> confrontations between immigration agents and state residents have proliferated on social media, with several instances of US citizens being harassed or detained.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During a news conference on Tuesday, local police officials in the state also said they have received a deluge of reports of ICE agents trampling on residents’ rights.</p><p>Mark Bruley, the chief of police for the Minneapolis suburb Brooklyn Park, said residents are regularly being stopped “with no cause and are being forced to produce paperwork to determine if they are here legally”.</p><p>“We started hearing from our police officers the same complaints as they fell victim to this while off duty,” Bruley added. “Every person who has had this happen to them is a person of colour.”</p><p>Speaking at Wednesday’s briefing, Heidi Altman, the vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, said recent events have shown “ICE and border patrol agents are not using taxpayer dollars for the purpose of immigration enforcement”.</p><p>“They’re using it for the purpose of protecting and projecting the absolute power and executive branch of the president of the United States,” Altman said.</p><p>That perception appears to bear out in public opinion polling. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll conducted from January 14 to 16 found an equal split on Trump’s immigration pledges, but growing discontent with how they are being implemented. About 52 percent felt that ICE was making communities less safe, while 61 percent said the agency’s tactics were “too tough”.</p><p>Another poll conducted by the ACLU found that 55 percent of voters support ending mass ICE raids targeting immigrants, while a whopping 84 percent said they supported people’s right to “safely observe, record, and document ICE activities”.</p><p>An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that while Trump’s approval on immigration was largely split 50 to 49 percent among voters in March 2025, the proportion of those who disapproved rose to 61 percent as of mid-January.</p><p>For his part, Trump has blamed the shifting tides on unfair media coverage, urging DHS and ICE to better publicise the “violent criminals” targeted in the 3,000 arrests the administration says immigration agents have made in Minnesota.</p><p>“Show the Numbers, Names, and Faces of the violent criminals, and show them NOW,” Trump said in a recent post on Truth Social account.</p><p>“The people will start supporting the Patriots of ICE, instead of the highly paid troublemakers, anarchists, and agitators!”</p><h2 id=\"business-as-usual\">‘Business as usual’</h2><p>The US Congress, which controls the so-called “power of the purse” in its budgetary discretion, remains slimly controlled by Republicans, who have shown little appetite for contradicting Trump on one of his marquee policy pillars.</p><p>Democrats have introduced a slate of legislative actions to siphon funding from ICE, constrain detentions, force ICE officers to unmask, and even to impeach DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, but all have proved non-starters.</p><p>More broadly, the party has remained divided on its approach, with some political strategists warning of continued perceived weakness on immigration, which was seen as an Achilles heel in the Democrats’ rout in the 2024 election.</p><p>Advocates who spoke on Wednesday, meanwhile, said lawmakers had an immediate opportunity to send a message as they negotiate a bill to apportion annual funding to the DHS.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The current bill would increase ICE’s annual detention budget by $400m from last year, while increasing its enforcement budget by over $300m. That’s on top of the billions of dollars already allocated last year, while offering little in the way of best-practice reforms or oversight, advocates said.</p><p>“It is insane to me to think that anybody would vote to give more money to an already bloated agency,” said Beatriz Lopez, the founder and director of the Democracy Power Project, who called the bill an important opportunity to “check” ICE.</p><p>Added Amy Fischer, director for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA: “Democrats and Republicans came to the table to pull together this bill as if it’s just business as usual, as if it’s just another year”.</p><p>“What we are trying to communicate here is that we can’t actually do business as usual anymore when we have a hyper-militarised agency running lawless in our country, killing US citizens,” she said. “What we’re asking members of Congress to do is actually respond in a way that will hold back this agency, will hold back the lawlessness.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Until now, no president had sought to oust a Fed official.</p><p>A Supreme Court ruling is expected by the end of June.</p><h2 id=\"pressure-on-fed-independence\">Pressure on Fed independence</h2><p>Conservative Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that the administration had handled the case “in a very cursory manner”. Though the case involves Trump’s asserted cause to fire Cook, Alito said, “No court has ever explored those facts. Are the mortgage applications even in the record in this case?”</p><p>“There’s a million hard questions in this case,” Alito said.</p><p>In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions meant to insulate the central bank from political interference, requiring governors to be removed by a president only “for cause,” though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal.</p><p>Clement told the justices that Trump’s position would transform tenure protections for Fed governors into “at-will employment”.</p><p>“That makes no sense,” Clement said. “There’s no rational reason to go through all the trouble of creating this unique, quasi-private entity that is exempt from everything from the [congressional] appropriations process to the civil service laws, just to give it a removal restriction that is as toothless as the president imagines.”</p><p>Roberts expressed doubts about Sauer’s arguments that the president’s assertion of a cause is not reviewable, or that judges cannot reinstate a fired officer.</p><p>Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed doubts about the real-world effects of the administration’s arguments.</p><p>“Your position,” Kavanaugh told Sauer, “that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines – I mean, that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve.”</p><p>Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett also questioned why the Trump administration has denied Cook a hearing to defend herself, saying that it “would not have been that big of a deal” for Trump to sit down with Cook and lay out the alleged evidence against her.</p><p>Barrett also asked Sauer about the practical implications of allowing Trump’s firing of a Fed governor.</p><p>“We have amicus [friend-of-the-court] briefs from economists who tell us that if Governor Cook is [fired], that would trigger a recession. How should we think about the public interest in a case like this?” Barrett asked, adding: “If there is a risk [at this preliminary stage of the case], doesn’t that counsel caution on our part?”</p><p>Sauer said that Cook was notified in August of her termination, and that has not affected the markets. Sauer urged the justices to weigh the predictions of doom for the US economy by economists in briefs submitted in the case supportive of Cook with a “jaundiced eye”.</p><p>US District Judge Jia Cobb in September ruled that Trump’s attempt to remove Cook without notice or a hearing likely violated her right to due process under the US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment. Cobb also found that the mortgage fraud allegations likely were not a legally sufficient cause to remove a Fed governor under the law, noting that the alleged conduct occurred before she served in the Fed post.</p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined Trump’s request to put Cobb’s order on hold.</p><h2 id=\"you-re-fired\">‘You’re fired’</h2><p>Conservative and liberal justices alike posed sharp questions to Sauer on his contention that Cook was not entitled to formal notice and a hearing before removal by the president.</p><p>Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Sauer what such a hearing would look like and whether Cook would have a right to legal counsel.</p><p>Sauer responded that the court in the past has been very reluctant to “dictate procedures to the president” and that it would be up to Trump to decide.</p><p>“Calling Ms. Cook into the [White House] Roosevelt Room, sitting across a conference table, listening for, I don’t know how long, how much evidence is a lawyer required, and then making a decision? Could that suffice?” Gorsuch asked, adding: “Just a meeting across a conference table finished with, ‘You’re fired’?”</p><p>Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas asked Sauer on what basis the justices should conclude that the Fed is “an executive branch agency and hence that the president does have a removal authority”.</p><p>“There’s an academic dispute about whether or not the Federal Reserve’s Open Market operations constitute executive power or something else, essentially private conduct. However, Congress has over the years kind of packed on traditional executive powers on the Federal Reserve,” Sauer replied.</p><p>As a Fed governor, Cook helps set US monetary policy with the rest of the central bank’s seven-member board and the heads of the 12 regional Fed banks. Her term in the job runs to 2038. Cook was appointed in 2022 by Democratic former US President Joe Biden and is the first Black woman to serve in the post.</p><p>Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed Sauer to reconcile two seemingly conflicting positions: his claim that the president has broad discretion to remove a Fed governor, and his recognition that Congress included tenure protections for Fed governors to shield the Fed’s independence from White House interference.</p><p>“How does that further the aims of the statute?” Jackson asked.</p><p>Alito voiced scepticism toward Clement’s argument that a Fed governor’s conduct before taking office cannot provide a basis for removal by the president, asking Cook’s attorney to address a series of increasingly egregious hypothetical scenarios.</p><p>“How about if, after the person assumes office, videos are disclosed in which the office holder is expressing deep admiration for Hitler or for the Klan?” Alito asked.</p><p>The president sought to fire Cook on August 25 by posting a termination letter on social media citing the mortgage fraud allegations disclosed by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee.</p><p>The administration ‍this month opened a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">criminal investigation into Powell</a> over remarks he made to Congress last year about a Fed building project, a move he similarly called a pretext aimed at gaining influence over monetary policy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/21/trump-live-news-us-president-in-davos-as-greenland-threats-spark-outrage\">Trump’s speech in Davos</a> the following day, the US president made clear that times had changed. He nodded to Venezuela, where his forces conducted a raid to <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abduct</a> the country’s President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. He criticised Europe, calling the countries there weak.</p><p>And he constantly referenced his desire to take Greenland, no matter what Greenlanders, or Denmark – the country they are part of – think.</p><p>“We want a piece of ice for world protection. And they won’t give it,” Trump said. “So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.”</p><p>Trump has made clear that the old way of doing things does not interest him. The post-World War II rules-based order concepts of sovereignty, and the resolution of disputes through negotiations, no longer mattered.</p><h2 id=\"not-an-ally-but-a-predator\">Not an ally but a predator</h2><p>The actions of Trump and his administration have forced lawmakers across Europe and the West to confront their reliance upon the US and weigh the difficulties of confronting the world’s most significant superpower, which NATO’s former deputy allied commander for Europe, Richard Shirreff, described on Tuesday as having turned from “ally” to “predator”.</p><p>Limited attempts on the part of Europe to counter US ambitions in Greenland have seen the deployment of a token number of troops to the island, only to be met by American fury and the immediate threat of tariffs.</p><p>“The rules-based order is over, and its ending reflects the decades-old fallacy that European and US values and security interests were the same,” said Geoffrey Nice, a human rights lawyer and former lead prosecutor in the war crimes trial of Serbia’s former president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p><p>Over the years, the US has exempted itself from numerous international treaties, such as the <a href=\"/news/2025/4/8/which-countries-are-international-criminal-court-members\">International Criminal Court</a>, whose warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin was actively <a href=\"/news/2023/7/26/biden-administration-moves-to-assist-icc-in-russia-investigation\">pursued</a> by former US President Joe Biden, despite Washington’s refusal to accept the jurisdiction of the court itself.</p><p>Similarly, when the International Court of Justice ruled against the US in a 1986 case on Washington’s support for rebels in Nicaragua, the US simply dismissed the ruling. Other international obligations, such as those on <a href=\"/news/2020/11/4/us-formally-quits-paris-climate-deal-amid-election-uncertainty\">climate</a>, or <a href=\"/news/2018/5/8/donald-trump-declares-us-withdrawal-from-iran-nuclear-deal\">commitments</a> to Iran to ease sanctions in return for greater transparency of its nuclear programme, have been similarly shrugged off.</p><p>“The reality has been that, time and again, the US has placed its own interests and its own sovereignty first. The United States’ interest in international law, going back to the Nuremberg, has always been ad hoc rather than treaty based,” Nice told Al Jazeera, referring to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. “What’s compounded this is that, for over 80 years, Europe and others have deluded themselves that this isn’t the case.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4254856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4254856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4254856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-03-15T171551Z_996838961_RC2QDDAQMMC6_RTRMADP_3_GREENLAND-PROTEST-1768930265.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters take part in a a demonstration march ending in front of the U.S. consulate, under the slogan, Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people, in Nuuk, Greenland, March 15, 2025.

Western leaders have largely ignored the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, raising questions about whether international law matters for some, but not for others.</p><p>“The idea of holding to a singular — and often deeply hypocritical — rules-based order is finished, to the extent it ever truly existed,” said HA Hellyer of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3780565\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3780565\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3780565\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25167484059469-1750138929.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The deadliest day of shootings near Gaza's food distribution centres\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3780565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Critics say the hypocrisy of the global rules-based order has been exposed during Israel’s war on Gaza [Abdel Kareem Hana/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>“The recognition of that reality by the Canadians and Europeans is landing very differently across the world. For some, similar to Europe and Canada, it feels like a shocking collapse,” Hellyer said. “For others, it’s simply the moment when a system that never protected Black and brown populations, or the ‘Global South’, is finally being named for what it was.”</p><p>“It’s telling that the supposed breaking point for the rules-based order is really the threat to Greenland, not the devastation of Gaza, or other examples before now,” Hellyer added. “The cases are not identical, and I’m not equating them — but it’s difficult to argue that talk of annexation is more offensive to international norms than the destruction of an entire people and territory. But in the case of Israel, the main underwriter of the rules-based order – i.e., the US – did not only work to ensure no accountability for the violation of international law, but actively emboldened and empowered those violations.”</p><p>There is nothing new about Western commentators claiming that events on their own doorstep define the state of the world, regardless of conditions elsewhere, said Karim Emile Bitar, a professor of international relations at the Saint Joseph University of Beirut.</p><p>“This is why we see such a stark contrast between Western attitudes toward Gaza as opposed to Western attitudes when a blue-eyed, blonde Ukrainian lady arrives as a refugee,” he said.</p><p>“When a territory that is part of the ‘European Union’ is under threat, they completely shift course and no longer try to use the usual mendacious justifications that were used for decades and decades.”</p><p>For smaller countries that have been forced to rely upon alliances rather than rules for decades, or much of the Global South, the collapse of the rules-based order will mean little. For those in the Global North and their representatives at Davos, it represents a seismic shift.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This observational documentary follows them through birthday celebrations, 4am medication, difficult medical consultations and quiet, emotional moments together. Their bond gradually goes beyond conventional parent–child roles, as Hassen works tirelessly to preserve joy, dignity and a sense of normal life for Saliha. As the cancer spreads and her chances fade, they face impossible choices: treatment versus comfort, hope versus honesty, a son’s devotion versus his mother’s exhaustion. After Saliha’s death, we see Hassen back in the studio, hosting live television while still guided by her memory, redefining his mother as “a notion of love” that continues to shape him. Raw but unsentimental, the film captures caregiving as both an act of endurance and a profound declaration of love itself.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 21 Jan 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">21 Jan 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"
