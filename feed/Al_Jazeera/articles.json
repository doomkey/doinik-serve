Jake began his career posting videos on the online platform Vine in September 2013 and had amassed 5.3 million followers and 2 billion views before the app was discontinued, according to reports.</p><p>Paul is 6-feet, 1-inch tall (1.85m) and normally fights at the cruiserweight – or junior heavyweight – division. The weight class limit for the division is listed at 200 pounds (91kg).</p><p>The American enters this fight off the back of his last successful bout against former world middleweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in June, which he won by unanimous decision.</p><p>Before that, he shot to worldwide fame in November 2024 when he prevailed in a decision victory over legendary heavyweight Mike Tyson, who was 58 at the time and was a shadow of his former self.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-anthony-joshua\">Who is Anthony Joshua?</h2><p>Anthony Joshua is a 6-feet, 6-inch tall (1.98m) boxer from Watford, just outside London, England.</p><p>Under the parameters of the bout, Joshua, who historically has weighed in at about 250 pounds (113kg) for past heavyweight fights, will be limited to no more than 245 pounds (111kg) against Paul.</p><p>Joshua is a two-time unified heavyweight world champion. He held the unified titles (WBA, IBF, WBO) at the following time periods: April 2016 to June 2019, when he won the IBF belt and unified it, losing them to Andy Ruiz Jr; and again from December 2019 to September 2021, after winning the rematch against Ruiz Jr. before losing to current heavyweight world champion, Oleksandr Usyk.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4177838\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4177838\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4177838\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2019-12-16T202523Z_1488826271_RC2KWD9PLVV7_RTRMADP_3_GLOBAL-POY-SPORTS-1765891620.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C511&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr in action.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4177838\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Anthony Joshua unleashes a huge right hand against Andy Ruiz Jr during their unification fight for the IBF, WBA, WBO &amp; IBO World Heavyweight titles at Diriyah Arena, Diriyah, Saudi Arabia on December 7, 2019 [Andrew Couldridge/ Action Images via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-paul-s-fight-record\">What’s Paul’s fight record?</h2><p>Paul began professional bouts in 2020, and his pro fight record is 12-1.</p><p>His only loss came in February 2023, when he lost to Tommy Fury, the brother of former heavyweight world champion Tyson.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-joshua-s-fight-record\">What’s Joshua’s fight record?</h2><p>The 36-year-old’s fight record is 28-4. Joshua has fought several famous heavyweights, including Usyk, Dubois and Wladimir Klitschko.</p><p>He is eight years older than Paul and has more than double the number of career professional fights than his opponent.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-paul-said-about-the-fight\">What has Paul said about the fight?</h2><p>Paul has predicted the bout will end via a knockout victory in the fifth round.</p><p>“I’m here to go out there and shock the world,” Paul said. “I know what I’m capable of. People say, ‘Oh, he’s out of his mind.’ I’ve gotten to where I am today because of delusional optimism. No one thinks I’m going to win, so join the list and be ready to be shocked.”</p><p>“He’s one of the best heavyweights ever,” Paul added. “But I believe that fighting a smaller man is often times harder for a heavyweight because of the speed difference and because of the foot speed, because of the angles. All that power is great. I just have to avoid that one shot. I believe that I can do that. I know I can pick him apart and score points.”</p><h2 id=\"what-has-joshua-said-about-the-fight\">What has Joshua said about the fight?</h2><p>Despite being the odds-on favourite for victory, Joshua says he is approaching the eight-round contest seriously.</p><p>“You can’t underestimate anyone. I’m going to take him seriously,” Joshua said. “After a year out, I’ve realigned a lot in my life. I got my focus back to where it needs to be.”</p><p>Joshua, who has 25 career KOs as a pro, acknowledged that anything short of a quick knockout win will be perceived as additional erosion of his standing among the elite heavyweights.</p><p>“I’ve seen it. I’ve heard it,” he added. “As I said to Jake respectfully, I need to cut him up. I need to break him up, and I need to hurt him. That’s just what we do.”</p><h2 id=\"who-is-fighting-in-the-co-main-event\">Who is fighting in the co-main event?</h2><p>In the co-main event, it will be an all-North American women’s matchup with Alycia Baumgardner of the United States putting two of her three World super featherweight titles (IBF, WBO) on the line against Canadian challenger Leila Beaduoin.</p><p>Baumgardner, aka “The Bomb”, hasn’t been defeated since 2018 and will start as the strong favourite in the eighth title match of her professional career.</p><p>Beaduoin, who is riding a four-fight winning streak, will need to be at her all-time best to upset the champ on Friday.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4178074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4178074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4178074\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-04-10T021330Z_1930407168_MT1USATODAY25890285_RTRMADP_3_BOXING-TAYLOR-VS-SERRANO-3-PRESS-CONFERENCE-1765897128.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alycia Baumgardner reacts.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4178074\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alycia Baumgardner (pictured) will defend her undisputed junior lightweight titles against Leila Beudoin [File: Vincent Carchietta/Imagn Images via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"full-undercard\">Full undercard</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\"><strong>Main card (From 8pm | 01:00 GMT on Saturday)</strong></p><ul>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua – heavyweight (8x3min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Alycia Baumgardner vs Lela Beaudoin – IBF &amp; WBO super-featherweight world titles (12x3min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Anderson Silva vs Tyron Woodley – cruiserweight (6x3min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Jahmal Harvey vs Kevin Cervantes – featherweight (6x3min rounds)</li>\n</ul><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\"><strong>Preliminary card (From 4.45pm | 21:45 GMT on Friday)</strong></p><ul>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Cherneka Johnson vs Amanda Galle – undisputed bantamweight title (10x2min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Yokasta Valle vs Yadira Bustillos – WBC strawweight world title (10x2min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Avious Griffin vs Justin Cardona – welterweight (8x3min rounds)</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

Russia used the NATO expansion as one of the justifications for its invasion in 2022.</p><p>European leaders, however, say key differences are yet to be resolved between Moscow and Kyiv over territorial issues.</p><p>Is a ceasefire agreement finally within reach?</p><h2 id=\"what-was-discussed-in-the-meeting-in-berlin\">What was discussed in the meeting in Berlin?</h2><p>The Berlin meetings were attended by US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as key leaders from France, Germany, the United Kingdom and NATO.</p><p>In a statement after the talks, European leaders said they and the United States were committed to working together to provide “robust security guarantees” to Ukraine, including a European-led “multinational force Ukraine” supported by the US.</p><p>They said the force’s work would include “operating inside Ukraine” as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine’s forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said that Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.</p><p>Two US officials, speaking to the Reuters news agency, described the proposed protections as “Article 5-like”, a reference to NATO’s Article 5 mutual defence pledge – meaning an attack on one is an attack on all.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Berlin, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv needed a clear understanding of the security guarantees on offer before making any decisions on territorial control under a potential peace settlement. He added that any guarantees must include effective ceasefire monitoring.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have been cautious about what form such guarantees could take. Kyiv received security assurances backed by the US and Europe after gaining independence in 1991, but those did not prevent Russia’s invasions in 2014 (Crimea) and 2022.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Washington had offered “considerable” security guarantees during the Berlin talks.</p><p>“What the US has placed on the table here in Berlin, in terms of legal and material guarantees, is really considerable,” Merz said at a joint news conference with Zelenskyy.</p><p>Russia has yet to comment on the proposals.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-about-the-russia-ukraine-war\">What has Trump said about the Russia-Ukraine war?</h2><p>“We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it [the war] ended also,” Trump told reporters on Monday.</p><p>“We had numerous conversations with President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia, and I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever, and we’ll see what we can do.”</p><p>Since coming to power in January, the US president has been making efforts to end the war and has pressed Ukraine to offer concessions.</p><p>Several rounds of high-level discussions, including an Alaska summit between Trump and Putin in August, and draft peace proposals have failed to end Europe’s deadliest war since World War II.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4178006\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4178006\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4178006\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-22T105446Z_106978677_RC208GAIO6FN_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-USA-1765895372.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C517&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alaska\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4178006\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin before a joint news conference following their meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, US, on August 15, 2025 [File: Sputnik/Gavriil Grigorov/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-did-zelenskyy-say\">What did Zelenskyy say?</h2><p>In an X post, Zelenskyy wrote on Monday that “if these meetings had taken place earlier, the progress would have been even greater”, referring to meetings with Witkoff and Kushner.</p><p>“Of course, we have different positions with Russia regarding territories. This must be acknowledged and discussed openly. I believe that the American side, acting as a mediator, will propose various steps to try to find at least some form of consensus,” Zelenskyy wrote.</p><p>“We will do everything possible to find clear answers to questions about security guarantees, territories, and money as compensation for Ukraine to rebuild. It is necessary to understand the source of this funding.”</p><p>Ukraine had earlier signalled it may be willing to abandon its ambition to join the NATO military alliance in exchange for firm Western security guarantees. The Trump administration has been against NATO membership for Kyiv.</p><p>He added, “We are discussing security guarantees. And before taking any steps on the battlefield, both the military and the civilian population must have a clear understanding of what the security guarantees will be. This is very important.”</p><p>It is unclear what particular security guarantees Ukraine would receive, and which countries will contribute to providing them.</p><p>Addressing the Dutch parliament on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine and Europe are working on a document that could “stop the killing,” adding that “every single detail matters” and “every detail represents a human life”, according to Al Jazeera’s Audrey MacAlpine, reporting from Kyiv.</p><p>McAlpine said that Zelenskyy is mirroring the language of Trump, who has said the phrase “stop the killing” time and time again.</p><p>“He’s talking about documents. We know, before this meeting in Berlin, there were three documents in circulation. Now it appears from comments from Zelenskyy that there are five documents, the details of which we are still waiting to gather. But certainly it’s an evolving landscape with lots of difficult and nuanced pieces which we’re still waiting to get more information on,” McAlpine added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4177415\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4177415\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4177415\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1765877913.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1765877913\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4177415\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-a-ceasefire-truly-closer-than-ever\">Is a ceasefire truly ‘closer than ever’?</h2><p>Experts doubt it.</p><p>“Trump has repeatedly claimed that a peace deal is close without sustainable agreement,” Keir Giles, a Russian military expert at London think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Another foreign policy expert, Nathalie Tocci, believes “it’s extremely unlikely that a ceasefire is going to be reached now.”</p><p>“I think that it’s far more likely that we’re going to remain in the context of ongoing war,” Tocci, director at the Istituto Affari Internazionali, told Al Jazeera. She added that this is because issues of territory and security remain unresolved.</p><p>Russia controls nearly 20 percent of eastern Ukraine and has been slowly gaining territory as Ukraine’s military has been <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/28/ukraine-is-running-out-of-men-money-and-time\">weakened by</a> desertions and dwindling military aid. Moscow annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014.</p><p>“It’s probably impossible that Ukrainians will voluntarily withdraw from these territories unless we will also see a withdrawal of Russian forces on the other side,” Tocci told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s McAlpine also said that one of the main sticking points is the question of territory.</p><p>She added that Zelenskyy has recently been firm on not giving up the Ukrainian territory of Donbas (in the country’s east). “We know that the Russian side is hoping to control the entirety of the Donbas region. Ukraine would prefer to draw the lines where they are,” McAlpine said.</p><p>“Recent polling here in Ukraine shows that 75 percent of Ukrainians reject withdrawal from the Donbas region.” They back the idea of freezing the current front line.</p><p>Giles from Chatham House said that there are still parallel negotiation tracks – one involving the US and Ukraine, and another between Ukraine and European nations. He added that there is no clear evidence that these efforts are fully coordinated or aligned in terms of strategy.</p><p>“There is no guarantee that anything agreed will be accepted by Russia, and reason to think that anything that was agreed is achievable,” Giles added.</p><p>“The key ingredient to make a ceasefire possible remains exactly as it has always been. Russia will only agree to stop fighting if it feels that it will gain more from a ceasefire than it will from continuing to attack Ukraine,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4178011\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4178011\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4178011\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25337565438930-1765895585.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4178011\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A woman grieves over the coffin of her son, a Ukrainian serviceman who was killed in fighting with Russian forces near Pokrovsk, during his funeral ceremony in Boiarka, Ukraine, on Wednesday, December 3, 2025 [Evgeniy Maloletka/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-will-end-the-war-in-ukraine\">What will end the war in Ukraine?</h2><p>“The answer to what will end the fighting remains the same that it always has been, for Russia to be beaten back and for Ukraine to be beaten into submission,” Giles said.</p><p>Giles explained that Russia and Ukraine can not agree on the same terms for a ceasefire because their war aims are incompatible and “so far apart that they are exceptional in terms of modern wars.”</p><p>Trump has repeatedly echoed many of the demands by the Kremlin, including on territorial concessions. His initial <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">28-point plan</a> to end the war included a clause on amnesty for Russian war crimes. Zelenskyy has expressed his opposition to it.</p><p>Giles said that after the 28-point plan, which has since been revised following pushback from European leaders, Russia feels it is at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Russia will only accept a ceasefire agreement if it believes it can violate at will and that facilitates its resumption of the war at a time of its choosing,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

On the afternoon of August 11, they walked past a riot squad on the streets of Minsk when helmeted officers suddenly jumped out of a bush. The pair said they were thrown to the ground and hauled off in a van, where they were beaten en route to a detention centre.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>At the detention centre, they were beaten again and forced to kneel in stress positions, they said. Eventually, they were released without charge after the Russian embassy intervened.</p><p>So after all they had endured together, Vazhenkov was shocked to hear Rogov had been arrested in Poland for espionage.</p><p>“When I read the posts of some of our acquaintances, who write ‘I knew everything as soon as I saw him,’ this is, of course, complete b******t,” Vazhenkov told Al Jazeera from Germany. “I had a pleasant impression [of Igor], so I was shocked, surprised and upset with these thoughts.”</p><p>According to an indictment seen by The Guardian, 30-year-old Rogov has admitted to Polish investigators that he had been working for Russian intelligence for years. He has also been accused of involvement in a plot to detonate incendiary devices across Europe.</p><p>The first hearing in the case was held on December 8. If found guilty, he would be the first known Kremlin asset within the opposition movement granted shelter in Europe.</p><p>His case comes at a sensitive time, as Europe suffers a wave of sabotage, arson attacks, drone incursions and other forms of <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/europe-lacks-coordination-as-russia-prepares-for-war-with-nato-experts\">hybrid warfare</a> blamed on Russia, while Russian passport holders fall under heightened suspicion.</p><p>But neither the Rogov case, nor the apparent dangers of allowing Russians into Europe, are straightforward.</p><h2 id=\"i-am-very-sceptical\">‘I am very sceptical’</h2><p>Rogov was born and raised in Saransk, a city 630 kilometres (390 miles) east of Moscow. There, he spent some time working at the regional headquarters of the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny, before becoming a local coordinator for Open Russia.</p><p>“He was a nice, sociable, kind-hearted young man,” Vazhenkov recounted.</p><p>“He liked to hang out, to go for a walk, to drink, and so on. He didn’t seem to have any distrust or antipathy towards me.”</p><p>After the Minsk incident, Rogov ran for office in his hometown. After that political bid failed, he applied for a computer science scholarship in Poland. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent suppression of dissent that followed hastened those plans, and he rushed into exile. In Poland, his wife reportedly outed him in a WhatsApp chat with fellow Russian exiles after an argument, before hastily deleting the messages and trying to laugh it off as a joke.</p><p>Then, in July 2024, Rogov’s flatmate texted him with a warning. The police had come looking for him after a package filled with explosive material addressed to him was found in a shipping warehouse. But Rogov was on holiday in Montenegro at the time. He was immediately arrested on his return. Rogov’s wife was arrested, too, as well as a Ukrainian woman.</p><p>He reportedly admitted to investigators that he had been passing information to the FSB – Russia’s successor to the KGB – for years. After moving to Poland, he tried leaving that life behind, but his old handlers threatened to have his father conscripted and sent to fight in Ukraine, he said.</p><p>As far as Vazhenkov knew, if Igor was indeed a spy, he was not privy to much sensitive information.</p><p>“If we talk about the hierarchy of Open Russia, I know what Igor was allowed to do, and by and large, there wasn’t anything that wasn’t in the public domain,” he said.</p><p>“That is, he could say who [slept with] whom, who got drunk with whom at what conference, and that’s it. Maybe some internal squabbles, as well, since every organisation has those, but this is hardly valuable information.”</p><p>It’s not clear why Rogov returned to Poland from Montenegro if he knew police were seeking him. Another co-accused in the explosives case, Emil Garayev, fled back to Russia.</p><p>“There was information that he confessed to working for the FSB, that he was an informant, a spy – I do not rule out that this is true,” Vazhenkov said. “[But] I am very sceptical about the accusation of preparing a terrorist attack in Poland.”</p><p>The apparent bomb plot fits in with a pattern of attacks blamed on Russia since before the war: for example, a deadly explosion at a Czech arms depot in 2014 pinned on Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. These attacks have escalated since the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>In November, the EU announced it was tightening visa restrictions for Russians, citing security risks. Russian citizens are no longer allowed multi-entry visas. Antiwar Russians abroad criticised the step as unfairly prejudicial and counterproductive to building a movement against the Kremlin.</p><p>“Travelling to the EU is a privilege, not a given,” said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.</p><h2 id=\"gamifying-espionage\">Gamifying espionage</h2><p>Elena Grossfeld, a researcher into Russian and Soviet spycraft at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera that Russian spies have historically operated within the diaspora.</p><p>“Anyone is a potential security threat, including Ukrainian refugees or whoever else, can be collaborating with Russian intelligence,” she said. “But if you’re running counterintelligence in a European country, you have to look at the propensity or the likelihood. And Soviet intelligence and Russian intelligence have been known to recruit emigres.</p><p>“It’s been their mode of operation after the 1917 revolution and beyond … I don’t want to paint everybody in black-and-white, but I understand the concern.”</p><p>But relatively few Russian nationals have been arrested over hybrid warfare attacks. Rather than the old Cold War strategy of deploying long-term sleeper agents, the focus now seems to be on hiring inexperienced local operatives for one-off jobs for cash, usually between a few hundred to a few thousand dollars in cryptocurrency. Teenagers, especially, are easily manipulated into becoming saboteurs-for-hire.</p><p>“A lot of people have been recruited on Telegram when they go to those channels that advertise all kinds of occasional jobs,” Grossfeld explained.</p><p>“One teenager goes to a Russian-speaking Telegram channel, and then he brings on friends. And when the assignment is gamified – ‘You have to take this item from this place to that location, photograph it and send it’ – and there’s [an element of] competition, it is enticing to teenagers and others, as well.”</p><p>The youngest such suspect was an 11-year-old girl arrested by Ukrainian police in Odesa. Ukrainian intelligence has been accused of similar tactics for hiring saboteurs in Russia.</p><p>Individuals linked to the criminal underworld, particularly from the former USSR, have also been sought after, though Grossfeld pointed out that organised crime and Russian communities might be monitored by the authorities already.</p><p>“If you look at the trials in the UK, British people have been recruited, as well as Bulgarians,” she said.</p><p>Earlier this year, a group of minor league criminals were convicted of setting fire to a London warehouse containing communication supplies for Ukraine on behalf of a Telegram account linked to the Russian mercenary firm Wagner, although they never got paid for the arson since they rushed into it without getting their handler’s green light.</p><p>The gang also considered kidnapping exiled Russian businessman Evgeny Chichvarkin, who personally delivered aid to Ukraine, although the scheme was never realised.</p><p>“I believe that Russian citizens still need to be granted visas, because if you believe the general information from open sources, then the special services are behaving a little differently, and those who arrange acts of subversion are mostly citizens of the European Union, or even Ukraine or third countries, and very rarely they are political refugees,” said Vazhenkov.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, [Rogov] is the only case where a political activist given asylum has been accused of spy activity. Therefore, I believe that visas still need to be given, and their absence does more harm than the possible harm from issuing visas to the wrong people.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Israel may look to many like a winner, a de facto hegemon in the Middle East. It has waged war on several fronts simultaneously, dealing deadly blows on its enemies. In parallel, it continues to enjoy much support from various Western constituencies and leaders, particularly those who face real challenges from the hard right in their countries.</p><p>But under the surface, Israel is imploding. An international coalition, led by the United States with the participation of Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye, is gradually removing Gaza from Israel’s control, as well as pressuring Israel out of its territorial escapades in Syria and Lebanon.</p><p>This is being publicly opposed by the Israeli government, but it appears to be carried out with the tacit acceptance of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has now realised that he is better served by the threat of war rather than by war itself. This is especially after he failed to accomplish his own “war goals” – the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages alive; it seems the Israeli army may have killed many more hostages than initially assumed.</p><p>The unconditional support Israel once received from the US and Europe is dwindling, and so is cooperation with Gulf states. The Palestinians, just like the Muslim Brotherhood, were for decades perceived as a greater threat to the regional status quo than the Israelis.</p><p>Where Western leaders once competed over who would be quickest to condemn Hamas and commend Israel’s fight for “Western values”, these same leaders are much quieter now that constant evidence of the Israeli genocide is pouring out of Gaza. Even US President Donald Trump has much less to say about Hamas than he once did.</p><p>It is clearly difficult for Western leaders to acknowledge that Israel has become an agent of regional chaos. It is much easier to gradually, discretely, remove its levers and make it come to terms with the emerging reality without forcing Israeli leaders to publicly lose face. There is no need to confront Israel directly. It is enough to give it the occasional cold shoulder and to make it wait.</p><p>Despite protestations to the contrary, Israel needs international cooperation to attack and occupy in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Iran. That is why its operations are gradually shrinking. The Israeli army is now busy “hunting” individuals who once participated in attacks on Israelis, rather than engaging in strategic expansion. These are Israel’s capabilities in this new order.</p><p>Israel may be losing on the diplomatic front, too. Hamas is negotiating while the Israeli government is stalling. If this continues, Israel will be faced with a reality it did not actively shape. There is talk, for example, of Israelis being forced to pay for the removal of the rubble that the Israeli army created over more than two years of annihilating Gaza.</p><p>While Israel may be on its way to losing its status as a hegemon of the Middle East, Israeli society is devoting all of its considerable energy to internal squabbles “over Israel’s soul” and to intensifying its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. Israelis are losing their faith in the existence of a world outside Israel’s borders. If there is such a world, many believe, it hates Israel with a passion regardless of its actions.</p><p>The Israeli discourse is focusing more and more on issues ranging from threats to Jews to the Israeli collective, abandoning talk of “geostrategic” upheavals that were quite common only six months ago. There is also an overwhelming disregard for global realities and public opinion.</p><p>Take the new scandal plaguing the Israeli Air Force (IAF). Future fighter pilots, on the verge of graduating from two years of training, underwent a weeklong “imprisonment simulation”, generally considered to be the most difficult part of their training. Afterwards, they were sent to a hotel in a secret location in order to recuperate.</p><p>The cadets revealed the location of the hotel to their families, who visited their sons over a weekend; some of them drank alcohol. Their commanding officer even allowed them to imbibe.</p><p>The cadets will all face disciplinary action. IAF commander Tomer Bar clarified that “no leniency will be given on value‑based matters that are a foundation of the corps’ ethos.”</p><p>This is implosion. The IAF is responsible for most of the devastation in Gaza, including the bombing of civilian housing and infrastructure, which has horrified the world and stripped the Israeli army of its “most moral” claim. And yet, the IAF still talks about “values” and “ethos”. The pilots are the main arm of the genocide, but what matters is unauthorised alcohol consumption.</p><p>The cadets and pilots in general were cast by the media as representatives of the old Israeli elites, morally bankrupt and rudderless, spoiled in comparison with the new elites who torched Gaza and died for their efforts on behalf of the “People of Israel”.</p><p>In response, the pilots as a collective praised their own loyalty to the government and the security of the Israeli state and their commitment to continue the genocide for as long as the “democratically elected government” – which they themselves have repeatedly <a href=\"/news/2023/3/6/israel-air-force-reservists-to-skip-training-in-netanyahu-protest\">protested against</a> – instructs them to.</p><p>Perhaps even more importantly, Israel is losing its internal coherence. Unvaccinated children are dying of measles and the flu. Roving gangs of teenagers are attacking Palestinians who drive buses or clean streets. Palestinian citizens of Israel are murdered in criminal gang shootouts. Veterans of the Gaza “war” are committing suicide in unprecedented numbers.</p><p>The public mental health system has already collapsed under the burden, with appointments scheduled more than a year in advance. Classes in state schools are cancelled daily as teachers find themselves caring for their own children, left teacherless in their turn. The Ministry of Education has seen 25 senior professional leaders resign during the reign of the current Netanyahu government, most of them citing political interference in their work. In Tel Aviv, municipal employees have been encouraged to volunteer once a week at city kindergartens and nursery schools because there are no qualified personnel to be found.</p><p>There is a dearth of judges because the minister of justice isn’t speaking to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and both their approvals are necessary for the appointment of new judges. Two government ministers hold nine ministerial portfolios because the ultra-Orthodox parties left the coalition and would not come back unless the government they formed rejects a compulsory military draft law for Haredi Jews.</p><p>The Israeli state is quickly becoming a hollowed-out shell. Institutions are failing, public servants are leaving and political appointees serving their patrons are the only ones left to step in and fill the gaps. The Israel that emerges is bound for institutional, financial and cultural poverty – or implosion.</p><p data-start=\"7823\" data-end=\"7904\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
