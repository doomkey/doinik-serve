This year, through August 11, homicides decreased by 12 percent compared with the same time period in 2024.</p><p>Jeff Asher, an analyst for AH Datalytics, told PolitiFact that the <a href=\"/news/2021/11/3/hld-surge-in-us-homicides-continues-in-2021-why\">homicide rate increased</a> substantially after 2020, peaking in 2023 at 39 per 100,000 people.</p><p>That was the highest rate since 2003, but far below the 1991 peak of 81 per 100,000 people. The falling rate matches national trends, Asher said.</p><p>White House spokesperson Steven Cheung said on X that the city police statistics are not as they seem. Cheung attached a July WRC-TV story about a district police commander’s May suspension after he was accused of altering crime statistics.</p><p>Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Gregg Pemberton told the TV station that union members and management said the command staff want to “make sure that these classifications of these reports are adjusted over time to make sure that the overall crime stats stay down.”</p><p>A police spokesperson told PolitiFact that Commander Michael Pulliam is on administrative leave and the department can’t comment on active internal investigations. The union did not respond to our request for comment.</p><h2><strong>Have violent crimes such as carjacking increased in Washington, DC?</strong></h2><p>Trump said, “The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled.”</p><p>Trump is correct that the number of these crimes increased, but he did not mention a recent decline in carjackings.</p><p>The city’s dashboard shows carjackings rose from 2020 through 2023 before declining in 2024. This year, through August 9, there have been 188 carjackings compared with 299 during the same time period in 2024, and compared with 607 in 2023, a police spokesperson told PolitiFact.</p><p>The city’s preliminary car theft data shows a 25 percent drop from 2023 to 2024, and car thefts are essentially flat year to date in 2025 compared with the same period last year.</p><p>“Auto theft increased a huge amount in DC after 2020 before surging again in 2023 following the video being posted showing how to steal certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars,” Asher said. The “Kia Boyz” phenomenon happened nationwide.</p><p>Overall, the city’s data shows that, through August 11 this year, compared with 2024, violent crime in the district declined by 26 percent. Washington, DC’s violent crime decrease is part of a nationwide trend in major cities.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Does implementing cashless bail affect crime rates?</strong></h2><p>Trump said, “The radical left City Council adopted no cash bail. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster … Somebody murders somebody, and they’re out on no cash bail before the day is out.”</p><p>“No cash bail” or “cashless bail” allows certain defendants awaiting trial to be released from custody without paying bail. Even with cashless bail laws in place, defendants accused of violent crimes, such as murder, can still be detained if judges determine they are a public safety threat or flight risk.</p><p>Misdemeanour charges typically result in higher rates of release, according to the district’s Pretrial Services Agency.</p><p>In 2024, 89 percent of defendants were not rearrested during the pre-trial period, the agency said.</p><p>Proponents of eliminating cash bail say a cash requirement harms low-income people. Those who support cash bail say it ensures defendants appear in court, and removing it threatens public safety. Washington, DC, was a pioneer in pretrial reform, largely eliminating cash bail in the 1990s.</p><p>There’s a lack of expert consensus on the impact of cashless bail on crime rates.</p><p>A 2024 report by the left-leaning Brennan Centre for Justice at NYU Law said researchers found “no statistically significant relationship” between bail reform and crime rates. The study looked at crime rate data from 2015 through 2021 for 33 cities across the US, 22 of which had implemented some type of bail reform.</p><p>The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that supports reducing the prison population, measured public safety before and after pretrial reforms in four states and nine cities and counties, including Washington, DC. In general, researchers found that releasing people pre-trial did not put communities at risk for more crime.</p><p>The Trump administration has cited a 2022 report from the Yolo County, California, district attorney’s office as evidence that cashless bails cause increased crime. The report explored the effects of California’s temporary bail suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that 420 out of 595 people — 70.6 percent — were rearrested after being released from jail under this system.</p><p>A November 2024 paper by the Public Policy Institute of California also found that implementing emergency bail orders caused “notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days”. However, once reversed, the return to cash bail did not affect the number of rearrests.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The recent arrests, analysts said, mark the first time the military is cracking down on soldiers within its ranks on suspicion of a coup.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about the arrests:</p><h2 id=\"who-was-arrested-and-why\">Who was arrested and why?</h2><p>Conflicting reports have emerged since the arrests over the weekend and on Monday.</p><p>Reports by the French news channel RFI put the number of arrested soldiers at at least 50 while the Reuters news agency reported 36 to 40 soldiers have been detained.</p><p>Two generals are reportedly among them.</p><p>Abass Dembele, a former military governor of the northern region of Mopti, was arrested on Sunday morning in his home in Kati, a garrison town just outside Bamako, according to RFI.</p><p>Dembele is popular among Malian soldiers and has a reputation as an officer who often leads from the front. He was active in the northern war of 2012, a civil war that broke out after Tuareg separatists parlayed with armed groups to seize more than 60 percent of the country. The failure of the Malian army to push the rebels back prompted France to deploy thousands of soldiers.</p><p>Air force General Nema Sagara is another top official believed to be detained. Sagara is one of the few high-ranking female military officials in Mali and throughout the region. She is also one of the few female Malian officers to have been drafted into battle when she fought in the civil war of 2013.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Al Jazeera, however, could not independently confirm the veracity of the reports.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3770607\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3770607\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3770607\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP22112753713926-1749748426.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Wagner\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3770607\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This undated photograph released by the French military shows Russian mercenaries in northern Mali [Handout/French army via AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-is-happening-in-mali\">What is happening in Mali?</h2><p>Since 2012, Mali’s army has battled a swarm of armed groups in the north, including Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in the greater Sahara (ISGS).</p><p>The fighting has resulted in thousands of deaths while up to 350,000 people are currently displaced, according to Human Rights Watch. Several northern towns in rebel-held territory are under siege by the armed groups, limiting food, fuel and medical supplies. The groups operate in the Mali-Burkina Faso-Niger border area.</p><p>Promising to end the violence, then-Colonel Goita, 41, took power in two successive coups in 2020 and 2021. He was sworn in as transitional president in June 2021. Under his control, the country severed ties with its former coloniser, France, and thousands of French soldiers involved in the fight against the armed groups <a href=\"/news/2022/8/16/last-french-troops-leave-mali-ending-nine-year-deployment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exited</a> the country.</p><p>The military rulers have since turned to Russian private mercenaries and military officials under the Wagner Group and Africa Corps. The army and the Russians have recorded wins but also heavy losses.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-military-government-said\">What has the military government said?</h2><p>The military government has not put out an official statement stating the reasons for the arrests.</p><p>RFI quoted an unnamed Malian senior military officer close to the government as saying the soldiers were arrested because “they wanted to destabilise the transition,” referring to the military government, which calls itself a transitional government that is expected eventually to hand over power to a civilian administration.</p><p>Many of those arrested were confirmed by RFI to be members of the national guard. The special unit is headed by Defence Minister and General Sadio Camara. In elite military circles in Bamako, Camara is increasingly seen as a rival to Goita although they were both part of the team of coup leaders who seized power. The rifts inside the military come as some of Goita’s policies have begun to irk many, both in the military and among civilians.</p><p>This week’s arrests, some critics said, are the strongest sign yet that the military’s control is weakening from the inside. While Goita is the head of state, he appears not to have complete control over the armed forces, analysts said.</p><p>Due to the reported cracks, the military government will want to project a strong image, hence its silence, Beverly Ochieng, a Sahel analyst with the intelligence firm Control Risks, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“[These arrests] indicate some pronounced divisions,” Ochieng said. “Quite a few red lines have been crossed in recent months, and people are bound to be tired. It is likely that the military leadership will maintain and project a united front to downplay vulnerabilities and internal rivalries.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3817900\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3817900\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3817900\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/13144045-1751638804.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Interim president of the Republic of Mali Assimi Goita attends a signing ceremony following his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia on June 23, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3817900\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In July, the transitional parliament approved a five-year renewable mandate, clearing the way for Goita to lead Mali until at least 2030 [Alexander Kazakov/Sputnik/Pool via EPE-EFA]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-there-a-crackdown-on-dissent\">Is there a crackdown on dissent?</h2><p>Critics said Goita’s recent policies appear to attack dissenters and aim to shrink the civic space in the troubled country.</p><p>Goita’s government, for example, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/mali-military-chief-granted-renewable-five-year-presidential-term\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">approved </a>a bill in July that would allow him to seek a five-year presidential mandate, renewable “as many times as necessary” and without requiring an election. Earlier, when it seized power, the military promised to hand over power to civilians in 2024.</p><p>In May, the military government dissolved<a href=\"/news/2025/5/7/malis-military-government-suspends-political-parties-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> political parties and organisations</a> and banned political meetings, drawing condemnation from opposition politicians and rights groups.</p><p>In addition, the military government has targeted outspoken critics. This month, former Prime Minister Moussa Mara <a href=\"/news/2025/8/2/ex-mali-pm-charged-over-x-post-supporting-jailed-critics-of-military-rulers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was arrested and charged </a>with “undermining the credibility of the state” after he visited political prisoners and posted about seeking justice for them.</p><p>“As long as the night lasts, the sun will obviously appear!” Mara had written on July 4 in a social media post, adding: “We will fight by all means for this to happen as soon as possible!”</p><p>Choguel Maiga, who was the prime minister until his ouster in November, has also accused Goita’s government of targeting him. Although Maiga was once a champion of the government, he became critical of Goita this year. In July, the government accused him of fraud and embezzlement during his time in office and launched an investigation.</p><h2 id=\"what-else-is-fuelling-anger-in-the-country\">What else is fuelling anger in the country?</h2><p>Alongside the political situation, a lack of security remains rife in the country, causing frustration among many Malians.</p><p>Several armed groups continue to operate in the north, including JNIM. Human Rights Watch (HRW) blames the military forces and their Russian counterparts for targeting civilians indiscriminately on the assumption that they work with armed groups. At least 12 men from the Fulani ethnic group appear to have been executed and 81 forcibly disappeared since January, HRW said in a report.</p><p>Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, which are also military led, banded together to form the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) this year after they withdrew from the <a href=\"/news/2024/1/28/niger-mali-burkina-faso-announce-withdrawal-from-ecowas\">Economic Community of West African States</a>.They also created a 5,000-strong force for joint military operations to try to drive out armed groups.</p><p>Separately, the Malian army is once again battling Tuareg separatists. Although there were peace agreements made after the 2012 war that allowed the northern region of Kidal to maintain a semiautonomous nature, the military government under Goita has <a href=\"/news/2024/1/26/malis-military-rulers-scrap-peace-deal-with-separatist-rebels#:~:text=Military%20leaders%20say%20Algiers%20Accord,to%20signatories%20not%20upholding%20commitments.&amp;text=Mali's%20military%20rulers%20have%20announced,hostility%20by%20chief%20mediator%20Algeria\">torn up</a> the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2015/6/21/will-malis-peace-deal-hold\">peace deals</a> and returned to fighting, forcing hundreds of people to flee across the border to Mauritania.</p><p>In late July, Malian forces said they killed 70 “terrorists” in a raid in the north without specifying if those killed were with an armed group or were separatists.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

China, in a similar statement, said it would also extend its tariff suspension for 90 days.</p><p>On May 11, the two sides agreed to a 90-day tariff pause. From early April until then, US import levies on Chinese goods stood at 145 percent, while Chinese tariffs on US exports were 125 percent – rates that resulted in a virtual trade embargo between the two countries.</p><p>But the tariff truce agreed to in Geneva, Switzerland, lowered the temperature by temporarily slashing US tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent, while Chinese levies on US exports fell to 10 percent.</p><p>Beijing also agreed to resume some rare earth exports critical for the US manufacturing sector, including electronics, aerospace and cars.</p><p>Following talks in Geneva, US and Chinese representatives met in London in June and then again in Stockholm, Sweden, last month. After the Stockholm meetings, US negotiators returned to Washington with a proposal that Trump extend the Geneva deadline past August 12.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In the run-up to this latest pause, it’s understood that Trump pushed for additional concessions on Sunday, urging China to quadruple its US soya bean purchases. But analysts questioned the feasibility of his deal, and Trump did not repeat his demand on Monday.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-stock-markets-responded\">How have stock markets responded?</h2><p>Financial markets rallied on Tuesday, with Japanese and Australian equities hitting record highs following the trade truce announcement. Japan’s Topix benchmark rose 1.6 percent, as Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 climbed 0.2 percent.</p><p>In the US, futures tracking the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes edged up 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, oil prices increased. Brent crude futures jumped 0.4 percent to $66.9 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 0.4 percent to $64.2.</p><h2 id=\"why-has-trump-been-flexible-with-china-on-trade\">Why has Trump been flexible with China on trade?</h2><p>In recent weeks, US-China negotiations have been on a parallel track to other talks Washington has held with trade partners, as it moved to implement sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs – as well as industry-specific levies – on <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/trumps-higher-tariffs-take-effect-on-imports-from-dozens-of-countries\">August 7</a>.</p><p>Trump struck agreements to lower tariffs with some trading partners, including the EU and Japan, but hit others like Brazil and Switzerland with swingeing levies. In the case of India, Trump doubled tariffs to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/us-india-relations-at-their-worst-as-trump-slaps-50-percent-tariff\">50 percent</a> after New Delhi refused to curb purchases of Russian oil and lower tariffs on US goods.</p><p>For Thomas Sampson, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics, trade negotiations between the US and China have “been running on their own track … because the US sees China as a long-term economic rival.”</p><p>Sampson told Al Jazeera that “I don’t think it [Washington] sees the EU or other countries in the same way.” He also noted that the “incipient military rivalry between the US and China” means that bilateral negotiations are sensitive.</p><h2 id=\"what-makes-the-trade-relationship-special\">What makes the trade relationship special?</h2><p>Trump has consistently criticised Beijing for what he deems to be unfair trade practices – namely import quotas, tax breaks and subsidies. He has even argued that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/tariff-wars-has-donald-trump-killed-the-wto\">the US’s trade deficit with China</a>, which reached $295.4bn last year, amounts to a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/what-legal-tests-are-donald-trumps-tariffs-facing\">national emergency</a>.</p><p>China is the US’s third-largest trade partner, after Mexico and Canada. It is heavily reliant on China for manufactured goods – from washing machines and TV sets to clothing.</p><p>The US Department of Commerce calculated that mechanical appliances (mainly low to mid-range technology products) made up 46.4 percent of all US imports from China in 2022.</p><p>And while US imports from China surged to beat Trump’s tariff bite following his “liberation day” announcement in April, they then dropped in June.</p><p>Indeed, the US trade deficit with China fell by roughly a third to $9.5 billion in June – its narrowest level since 2004, according to US Census Bureau data.</p><p>The US trade gap with China fell by $22.2bn from March to August. That amounts to a 70 percent drop from one year earlier.</p><p>More generally, US Treasury Department data shows that the US generated $124bn from January to July this year from tariffs. This is 131 percent more than the same time last year.</p><p>At the same time, the two countries trade goods of vital strategic interest whose importance trumps crude deficit figures. And both sides have been taking steps to reduce flashpoints recently.</p><p>For its part, the US has eased some export restrictions on advanced semiconductors – a key demand from China.</p><p>On Monday, the Financial Times newspaper revealed that Trump had permitted Nvidia and AMD to export advanced US chips to China. But the tech giants would pay 15 percent of their China sales to the federal government.</p><p>Trump had previously barred those deals. Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, had also imposed restrictions on US chip exports, as well as banned a range of US high-tech investments in China.</p><p>On the flipside, Chinese exports of rare earth magnets have started to recover in recent weeks after it blocked sales to the US in April.</p><p>Flows of rare earth magnets – used in everything from clean energy technology to military hardware – from China to the US <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-21/global-magnet-crisis-subsides-as-china-eases-up-on-supply-curbs\">rose</a> to 353 tonnes in June, up from just 46 tonnes in May.</p><p>Still, total shipments were still substantially lower than before Beijing launched its export controls in early April.</p><p>Washington has also been pressing Beijing to stop buying Russian oil to pressure Moscow over its war in Ukraine, with Trump even threatening to impose secondary tariffs on China.</p><p>US Vice President JD Vance said on Sunday that President Trump has been thinking of imposing tariffs on Beijing.</p><p>“Obviously, the China issue is a little bit more complicated because our relationship with China, it affects a lot of other things that have nothing to do with the Russian situation,” Vance told Fox News in an interview.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>This week’s tariff pause may clear the path for Trump to meet President Xi Jinping in late October, when the president is expected to travel to South Korea for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.</p><p>Until then, the partial tariff moratorium will give both sides time to work through longstanding trade concerns in advance of the potential meeting.</p><p>In the US, economists widely agree that the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods has not been fully felt, as many firms have built up their stockpiles of inventories to mitigate the higher duties.</p><p>Looking ahead, however, BBVA Research published an analysis last month estimating that US tariffs on China would raise US inflation and slow economic growth later this year.</p><p>For Thomas Sampson, “the tariff pause allows them [the US and China] to maintain the status quo, and it wouldn’t be surprising if, after 90 days, they extend it further.”</p><p>More broadly, however, he believes that “there is a bipartisan consensus in Washington to push for a de-linking with trade from China.”</p><p>“Big picture,” he said, “even under a different president, I think you’d still see tensions in the US-China relationship.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On June 6, I decided for the first time to head to one of the distribution sites run by what is known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). On the long 12km walk on foot, I was accompanied by a few friends.</p><p>I went with a faint hope of getting some food for my family. What we encountered bore no trace of humanity. The scene we saw play out at the distribution centre resembled a battlefield.</p><p>Israeli military vehicles stood alongside GHF trucks, with a massive barrier in front of them. Occupation soldiers were stationed on elevated positions, their weapons pointed directly at the Palestinian civilians gathering.</p><p>At one point, two trucks arrived and dumped the aid on the ground in a degrading manner. Anyone who tried to approach was met with gunfire from the Israeli soldiers. Eventually, an Israeli soldier announced over a loudspeaker, “Now you can get the aid,” and the crowd rushed towards the boxes.</p><p>Men shoved and pushed, children cried, and women trembled from fear and exhaustion. Just a small minority managed to lay their hands on some aid. Some tried to steal from those who had made it. The vast majority – myself included – went back home empty-handed.</p><p>It felt as if we were selling our dignity for scraps. I saw it as a deliberate humiliation, a reshaping of the consciousness of our educated society, and its transformation into a broken community.</p><p>I went two more times to the GHF site.</p><p>On the third trip, I was accompanied by Nader, a 23-year-old youth whom I had met during displacement. Nader lived near me and regularly went to the GHF site.</p><p>Before the genocide, he worked as a guard at an orphanage in the east of Khan Younis. He did more than guard the shelter; he cared for the children, helped them in their daily lives, and gave them a sense of safety. After his life was destroyed, he took on the responsibility of supporting his family and his relatives’ children.</p><p>I would see him returning from aid sites covered in dust from head to toe, utterly exhausted, yet greeting me with a faint smile even when he did not manage to get anything.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>On July 19, Nader and my 16-year-old cousin Khaled prepared to go to the GHF site. I decided not to go, having lost all hope in that place, fully convinced it was a trap where Gazans were killed daily under the banner of “humanitarian work”.</p><p>They said they would try to get there early to secure food. Nader never returned. Khaled came back wounded with shrapnel in his leg.</p><p>Israeli forces had opened fire and launched several shells at the starving civilians. Most of the martyrs had been at the front of the line. Nader was hit by three bullets – in the chest, abdomen, and leg – along with shrapnel from a shell that landed near him.</p><p>Nader’s murder was devastating for his family; he was their sole provider. They could find no words to express their grief, only tears that fell on his lifeless body, as they mourned him.</p><p>Nader’s death was registered in the grim statistic of Palestinians killed at aid distribution sites, which today stands at 1,500. To the world, he was just a number; to me, he was a good man who had harmed no one but always helped others; he was robbed of everything by the occupation, his home, his job, his dreams of travelling and working in design and video editing. His family is now doomed to starve.</p><p>Since GHF began operating in Gaza over two months ago, nearly every major humanitarian organisation has condemned it and its method of aid distribution.</p><p>On August 7, Doctors Without Borders published a report titled: This is Not Aid. This is Organized Killing. It provided medical evidence that civilians were being deliberately targeted and described GHF sites as “death traps”.</p><p>A week before that, Human Rights Watch issued a report stating that what is happening constitutes a war crime, noting that the systematic shooting of Palestinian civilians without justification is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. It confirmed that the distribution of aid has turned into “regular bloodbaths”.</p><p>What makes GHF’s crimes even more horrific is that its leadership deny what is happening and embrace the occupation’s narrative. Its president, Johnny Moore, declared that there is no famine in Gaza, ignoring medical reports documenting the deaths of children from hunger. He accused Hamas of stealing aid and dismissed reports on the humanitarian situation as “Hamas disinformation”.</p><p>He even claimed that Hamas deliberately harmed Palestinian civilians to blame the Israeli army or GHF. Yet the reality on the ground, witnessed by me firsthand, is that the only people with guns present at GHF sites are their mercenary guards and occupation soldiers. The Palestinians coming there are starving civilians, their bones protruding from extreme hunger.</p><p>The continuing operations of GHF have implications beyond the Gaza Strip. Granting legitimacy to this organisation instead of condemning and dismantling it risks turning humanitarian aid centres into killing fields everywhere.</p><p>I do not want my friend Nader’s death to be in vain. Everyone responsible for his killing, and everyone who allowed aid to be distributed through GHF, or funded it, or gave it a false humanitarian cover, must be held accountable. What we need is not only to stop these practices, but to prosecute everyone who turned aid into a trap, used hunger as a weapon, and contributed to the killing of innocents.</p><p>Silence over these crimes is complicity, and silence today means they will happen again tomorrow.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Many of the schools' curriculums emphasise social justice, and students are encouraged to take jobs in underserved communities.</p>\n<p>But that revolutionary spirit has also made the normal schools hotbeds for activism. \"Normalistas\", as the students are called, have a long tradition of protest.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they block highways. Other times, they occupy toll booths. One of their most famous activities is the nonviolent commandeering of local buses: The practice is so common that many bus drivers know to simply step aside when their vehicle is boarded.</p>\n<p>Professor Tanalis Padilla, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the public reaction to such protests has been mixed. Some people support the students wholeheartedly. Others, she said, express annoyance at \"the radical kids out there again on the streets\".</p>\n<p>According to Padilla, negative news coverage has contributed to that scepticism. \"It’s safe to say the media has always been against them, calling them vandals and things like that.\"</p>\n<p>Padilla explained that this perception stems from the educational programme at the normal schools, which is rooted in socialist and collectivist politics.</p>\n<p>\"With the Cold War in the '70s and '80s, the media would portray the schools as hotbeds of radicalism and social disturbance,\" she said.</p>\n<p>Over the years, numerous normalista protests have culminated in violent clashes with police — and even death.</p>\n<p>The most infamous incident took place in September 2014, when 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College, another normal school, took over a bus in the state of Guerrero. They planned to use it to join a protest in Mexico City.</p>\n<p>What happened next remains unclear. But it is believed that the students were kidnapped and killed with the knowledge of local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Not a single one of the students was ever seen alive again. Charred remains belonging to three of the Ayotzinapa students were later identified using DNA testing.</p>\n<p>The Ayotzinapa case garnered widespread outrage and support for normalistas in Mexico and abroad.</p>\n<p>“What happened was so shocking and so vicious that there was a general reaction of sympathy” towards normalistas, Padilla explained.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It is a redrawing of the geopolitical map.”</p><p>Others are more sceptical.</p><p>“Between Putin’s senile stubbornness and Trump’s spontaneousness, everything can still change 100 times over,” said Katherine, a St Petersburg pensioner. “God willing, they agree to end the war, of course.”</p><p>In recent months, Trump has expressed growing frustration with Putin’s unwillingness to halt attacks on Ukraine, <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/russias-actions-in-ukraine-disgusting-says-trump\">calling</a> recent strikes on Kyiv “disgusting”. On July 31, Russian drones and missiles killed dozens of civilians in the Ukrainian capital in one of the worst wartime assaults.</p><p>Last month, Trump threatened more sanctions unless Russia stops the fighting within 50 days. That deadline, mocked by senior Russian politicians, has now passed. New sanctions have not materialised, but 50 percent tariffs were slapped on <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/us-india-relations-at-their-worst-as-trump-slaps-50-percent-tariff\">India</a> last week to punish the country for buying Russian oil.</p><p>Even so, Trump has suggested a peace deal is close.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“We’re gonna get some [land] back. We’re gonna get some switched,” the US president said at the White House on Friday. “There’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both [Russia and Ukraine],” he added, without elaborating on what land would be given up by whom.</p><p>“I’ve already seen memes how we’ll swap the Crimea for Alaska,” Anya, a Muscovite, quipped.</p><p>According to Ilya Budraitskis, a Russian political scientist and visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley, the irreconcilable positions of the warring parties make real compromise unlikely. Instead, the Alaska summit will have a more symbolic nature, he predicted.</p><p>“From Putin’s side, this shows the restoration of his position in the world, that he comes to American territory and meets with the president, who shows signs of respect. It is clear this meeting is a symbolic victory for Russia by the very fact it is being held, regardless that no one expects any results from it,” Budraitskis told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It is a proof of the effectiveness of [Putin’s] strategy, which is that there is no need to make any compromises – you need to stubbornly repeat your maximalist positions, and at some point, everyone will be so tired of this that they will be forced to accept them, and the international isolation of Russia will gradually disappear.”</p><p>Budraitskis believes the meeting holds a similar value for Trump.</p><p>“The fact he is confused about whether Russia should give up its territory shows he doesn’t take any meaningful agenda of this meeting very seriously,” he continued.</p><p>“What the symbolic meaning of this meeting is for Trump is in showing he continues to play a key role in the situation in Ukraine, that he is the only person who is capable of talking to Putin, whom Putin listens to and respects.”</p><p>While Russia currently occupies vast chunks of eastern Ukraine, Ukraine no longer occupies any Russian territory after being ousted from the Kursk region of western Russia earlier this year.</p><p>Bloomberg reported on Friday that Russian and US diplomats were hammering out a deal that would allow Russia to keep the territory it has conquered so far, halting its invasion along the existing battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions of southern Ukraine.</p><p>The Polish online newspaper Onet said Trump envoy Steve Witkoff proposed to Putin a de facto recognition of what the Kremlin considers its “new territories” and the lifting of sanctions.</p><p>Officially, the Kremlin lays claim to the entire Donbas area of eastern Ukraine. If Ukraine were to abide by those terms, its forces would have to retreat from those parts of its Luhansk and Donetsk regions still under its control.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/zelenskyy-rejects-trumps-proposal-ukraine-swap-territories-russia-rcna224022\">fired back</a> in a Telegram post on Saturday, reiterating: “Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupiers.”</p><p>But Zelenskyy will not be present at Friday’s meeting.</p><p>“The summit will be held without the participation of the EU countries and Ukraine,” stated Zaurbek Khugaev, director of the Digoria Platform think tank.</p><p>“This is an eloquent signal that both Trump and Putin understand the destructive position of Zelenskyy and European officials for the development of mutually acceptable agreements, who, by the way, are persistently trying to include the Ukrainian leader in the agenda of the event.”</p><p>Budraitskis said certain token measures may be granted without seriously hindering the war effort.</p><p>“It’s possible that Putin will take some symbolic steps, for example limiting or temporarily refraining from bombing Ukraine, because, in general, this aerial warfare does little to help advance Russian troops.”</p><p>Although Putin and Trump have spoken several times by phone this year, Friday’s talks will mark the first face-to-face meeting between the two statesmen since they met in Osaka, Japan, in 2019. Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, but because the United States is not a member of the ICC, it is under no obligation to arrest him.</p><p>Alexey Nechayev, a political scientist and member of the Digoria Expert Club, said Ukraine is unlikely to be the only item on Friday’s agenda. Also of interest are arms control treaties, the situation in the Middle East and of course, given how the meeting is taking place in Alaska, the Arctic Circle.</p><p>“Finally, the key issue for Russia is the new security framework in Europe,” Nechayev said.</p><p>“Moscow views the Ukrainian conflict as part of a broader crisis in relations with NATO. This means that the solution requires eliminating the root causes, including legally enshrined nonexpansion of the alliance to the east.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Reports of unusual jet activity over Srinagar triggered widespread panic among residents.</p><p data-start=\"95\" data-end=\"840\">This evoked harrowing memories of similar aerial activity coupled with a similarly bizarre set of rumours in the tense days leading up to August 5, 2019. People waited anxiously.</p><p data-start=\"842\" data-end=\"1636\">The bombshell that came on the sixth anniversary was an official order <a href=\"/features/2025/8/9/attack-on-peoples-memory-kashmirs-book-ban-sparks-new-censorship-fears\">banning 25 books</a> that focus on Jammu and Kashmir’s history and politics – all accused of promoting “false narratives” and “secessionism” – a sweeping judgement that does not stand the test of scrutiny and is not based on any evidence.</p><p data-start=\"842\" data-end=\"1636\">My book A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370, published in December 2022 by HarperCollins, is one of them. The book is a rare chronicle of the day-to-day reality in Jammu and Kashmir after 2019. Based on ground research, extensive interviews and the collation of data from other primary and secondary sources, it punctured the Indian government’s claims of “normalcy” in Jammu and Kashmir.</p><p data-start=\"1638\" data-end=\"2208\">The government justified the actions of August 5, 2019 on the grounds that they would usher in peace and development in the region, while glossing over the unprecedented physical and cyber-restrictions imposed across the erstwhile state, during which thousands of people, including pro-India politicians (three former chief ministers included), were arrested. Barbed wire and military barricades turned the region, particularly the Kashmir Valley, into a curfewed zone, and communication channels – from internet to telephone lines – were pushed into some black hole.</p><p data-start=\"2210\" data-end=\"2698\">Six months later, when some of these restrictions were slightly eased and the internet was partially restored, the stranglehold of the Indian state became even more oppressive, with an exacerbation of raids and crackdowns against journalists, political and social activists, and civil rights defenders. The policy of widespread detentions under laws like the Public Safety Act, which allows the government to detain anyone without charge for up to two years, was ramped up significantly.</p><p data-start=\"2700\" data-end=\"3072\">These realities were hardly ever reported. Journalism was severely curtailed under the state’s clampdown, particularly affecting local publications. Newspapers that refused to fall in line were choked financially until they were out of print. Those that did comply were rewarded with lavish government advertisements that kept the businesses going, minus the journalism.</p><p data-start=\"3074\" data-end=\"3425\">Either co-opted or terrorised, the newspapers were no longer daily chroniclers of the events, developments and incidents in the region. Community voices were silenced while journalists no longer asked questions. The rich archives of some newspapers, showcasing the complex day-to-day history of the region, became inaccessible or were removed.</p><p data-start=\"3427\" data-end=\"3982\">In the last six years, the government has been extremely intolerant of any criticism. Any word of dissent invites punitive measures ranging from mere intimidation and interrogation to confiscation of devices, and from the slapping of income tax and money laundering cases to terrorism accusations, sometimes accompanied by short detentions or prolonged arrests. While local journalism was reduced to an extension of the government’s public relations department, all civil society voices were throttled by intimidation, leaving major gaps in information.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"3984\" data-end=\"4584\">It was this vacuum that my book aimed to fill. Focused on the first two years of the revocation of Article 370, and in 12 chapters, I documented what was happening on the ground – the increased suppression of the masses, the lack of space for freedom of expression, the shrinking space for civil society and political activism, the criminalisation of dissent, the continuation of terrorism as opposed to the claims of peace and normalcy, and the hollowness of the development claims by the government even as the new policies and actions robbed the people of their homes and agricultural lands.</p><p data-start=\"4586\" data-end=\"5124\">The book is a pursuit of truth – the naked truth, which challenged everything the Indian state was saying. A paranoid state whose only method of engagement in Jammu and Kashmir is through increasing its military footprint, merciless subjugation of the residents and silencing of all voices of dissent was obviously uncomfortable with what I documented. The book was a warning to the government that its methods of control, creation of a police and surveillance state, and misplaced development models were unsustainable and would fail.</p><p data-start=\"5126\" data-end=\"5972\">In the last six years, the government has been pulling the wool over the eyes of the world by trumpeting its achievements of bringing peace, normalcy, tourism and development. The April 22 killings this year of 26 innocent civilians punctured this bubble. It was a wake-up call for the government to sit back and review its policies in Kashmir and begin course correction.</p><p data-start=\"5126\" data-end=\"5972\">Instead, it clamped down even further with a horrific scale of demonisation of Kashmiris, ruthless detentions and even more brutal demolitions of houses. This, even as there was widespread public condemnation of terrorism, including vigils and calls to reject violence – something unprecedented in the more than three-decade-long history of rebellion in the region – and even as the investigators indicated foreign militants, not locals, were involved in the killings.</p><p data-start=\"5974\" data-end=\"6447\">In the last three months, the government has demonstrated that its policy of control through harsh security measures and pervasive surveillance would be further accelerated. The ban on 25 books, many of which provide rich, well-researched, and layered historical, political and legal narratives about the complex and trouble-torn region, is an extension of the pattern. Through this ban, there is an attempt to erase every trace of a counter-narrative and alternate memory.</p><p data-start=\"6449\" data-end=\"6913\">By branding all criticism of the state and narratives that are out of sync with the official version as “seditious”, the government can now seize and destroy these books. Not only are the written words being criminalised – even the act of reading will be wrongfully deemed a threat to the security and integrity of the nation. While this may not stop ideas and memory from being suppressed, policing what people write and read is likely to be further intensified.</p><p data-start=\"6915\" data-end=\"7256\">Though senseless, shocking and irrational in scale and scope, the ban, which ironically coincides with a government-backed Chinar Book Festival in Srinagar, sends a chilling message: Knowledge and information will be regulated by the state. What people write and read will be decided by the state. The thought police will penetrate deeper.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\">Last year, during Jammu and Kashmir’s first assembly elections as a Union Territory, India’s home minister, Amit Shah, took a dig at the regional political parties and alleged that while “they (local politicians) gave the youth stones in their hands”, his government had given them “books and laptops”.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\">The hollowness of such claims is laid bare when the daily reality is one of confiscation of digital devices, including laptops, during raids and interrogations, alongside a blanket book ban that only reinforces the central message of my work: Kashmir is anything but normal.</p><p data-start=\"7258\" data-end=\"7836\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
