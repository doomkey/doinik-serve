Also, the recent war in these areas likely resulted in compromised vetting and screening abilities,” the White House said.</p><p>“In light of these factors, and considering the weak or nonexistent control exercised over these areas by the PA, individuals attempting to travel on PA-issued or endorsed travel documents cannot currently be properly vetted and approved for entry into the United States.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, slammed the ban, accusing Trump and his top aide <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/fact-check-do-ice-officers-really-have-federal-immunity-in-the-us\">Stephen Miller</a> of pushing to alter the demographics of the country.</p><p>“This administration’s racist cruelty knows no limits, expanding their travel ban to include even more African and Muslim-majority countries, even Palestinians fleeing a genocide,” she said in a social media post.</p><p>The move to ban Palestinians from entering the US comes as Israel continues its daily deadly attacks in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, where Israeli settlers have killed at least <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/another-us-citizen-killed-by-israeli-settler-attack-in-west-bank-family\">two US citizens</a> this year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ban on Syrians coincides with rapprochement between Washington and Damascus after Syrian President <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/ahmed-al-sharaa-meets-trump-as-us-extends-syria-sanctions-relief\">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a> visited the White House in November.</p><p>“While the country is working to address its security challenges in close coordination with the United States, Syria still lacks an adequate central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures,” the White House said.</p><p>On Thursday, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard cited the mass shooting that killed 15 people at a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/14/world-condemns-mass-shooting-at-jewish-festival-in-sydneys-bondi-beach\">Jewish festival</a> in Australia to laud Trump’s immigration restrictions.</p><p>“Islamists and Islamism is the greatest threat to the freedom, security, and prosperity of the United States and the entire world. It is probably too late for Europe – and maybe Australia,” she wrote on X.</p><p>“It is not too late for the United States of America. But it soon will be. Thankfully, President Trump has prioritized securing our borders and deporting known and suspected terrorists, and stopping mass, unvetted migration that puts Americans at risk.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump’s Republican allies have been increasingly using Islamophobic rhetoric, and calling for Muslims to be blocked from entering the country.</p><p>On Sunday, Senator Tommy Tuberville called Islam a “cult”, baselessly accusing Muslims of aiming to “conquer” the West.</p><p>“Stop worrying about offending the pearl clutchers,” he wrote in a social media post. “We’ve got to SEND THEM HOME NOW or we’ll become the United Caliphate of America.”</p><p>When Trump first ran for president in 2015, he called for a complete ban on Muslims entering the US, and when he started his first term, he imposed a travel ban on several <a href=\"/news/2017/6/30/trumps-muslim-ban-comes-into-effect\">Muslim-majority countries</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

On December 5, Colombia signed a deal in Doha with the EGC to initiate a peace process aimed at the EGC’s disarmament.</p><p>“The designation of the EGC and its command structure as terrorists makes it almost impossible to continue these talks outside the country with security guarantees,”  said Gerson Arias, conflict and security investigator at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a Colombian think tank.</p><p>He added that it complicates discussions on extraditions, a key point of contention in ongoing negotiations. According to Arias, the FTO designation effectively eliminates the possibility of the Colombian state providing guarantees that it will not extradite EGC leaders to a US prison.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last week, the group’s chief negotiator, Alvaro Jimenez, told Reuters that the group’s commanders would likely face jail time in a potential deal, raising the stakes for non-extradition guarantees.</p><p>A breakdown in talks could intensify the conflict between the state and the EGC, according to Crisis Group’s Dickinson: “If peace talks were to end … I do think that that would lead to an escalation in violence across the north of the country, particularly.”</p><p>Earlier this year, the EGC killed dozens of state security officials in a targeted campaign.</p><p>But Dickinson stressed that the FTO designation does not preclude peace talks, citing the successful 2016 deal with the FARC, which was then a US-designated FTO.</p><p>“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves for now … the important thing is that Colombia will have to take a step back and decide how to proceed with negotiations,” the analyst told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Civil society members, charities – ‘What are they trying to hide?’ is the question that comes to mind.”</p><p>The Israeli agency that oversees affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, COGAT, told CBC News on Tuesday that the group arrived at Allenby Bridge “without prior coordination” and members were denied entry for “security reasons”.</p><p>But Kalsi noted that he and the other delegates had received Israel Electronic Travel Authorization permits before they reached the border. Those permits state that “entry into Israel will be subjected to an inspection and approval of the border control officer at the border crossing”.</p><p>He told Al Jazeera that Canada must get answers from Israel about why this happened – and why Canadian parliamentarians, in particular, were deemed a safety risk.</p><p>“I think it’s super, super important for our government to ask those questions and get those answers,” Kalsi said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Kwan, the NDP lawmaker, also said in a statement that Canada had informed Israel of the delegation before it travelled.</p><p>“I categorically reject the assertion that elected officials and civil society organizations engaging in humanitarian and fact-finding work pose any risk to public safety, security, or public order,” she said.</p><p>“The denial of entry to elected parliamentarians and civil society organizations engaged in peaceful, transparent parliamentary activity raises serious concerns regarding the openness of channels for dialogue.”</p><h2 id=\"call-for-sanctions\">Call for sanctions</h2><p>Canada has been a staunch ally of Israel for decades.</p><p>But the Canadian government has faced sustained calls to cut off its longstanding support for the country amid Israel’s <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/16/israeli-raids-across-west-bank-as-gaza-reels-from-aftermath-of-storm\">genocidal war against Palestinians</a> in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 70,000 people since October 2023.</p><p>The West Bank also has seen a surge in Israeli military and settler violence in the shadow of Israel’s war on Gaza, with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/israels-emptying-of-west-bank-refugee-camps-amounts-to-war-crimes-hrw\">tens of thousands</a> of Palestinians forced from their homes over the past year.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Tuesday, advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East (CJPME) condemned Israel’s decision to block the Canadian delegation.</p><p>The group called on Canada to impose diplomatic sanctions against the Israeli government and expel the country’s ambassador in response.</p><p>“Israel is an illegitimate occupying power in Palestine, and simply does not have the right to bar entry to Canadian lawmakers into the country,” the group’s president, Yara Shoufani, said in a statement.</p><p>Shoufani noted that the entry denial comes just months after Canada, along with several of its European allies, <a href=\"/news/2025/9/21/canada-australia-join-uk-in-recognising-palestinian-statehood\">announced plans to recognise</a> an independent Palestinian state.</p><p>“Just months after Canada recognized Palestinian statehood, Israel is demonstrating its apartheid rule over Palestine and fundamental denial of Palestinian self-determination.

I know I can pick him apart and score points.”</p><h2 id=\"what-has-joshua-said-about-the-fight\">What has Joshua said about the fight?</h2><p>Despite being the odds-on favourite for victory, Joshua says he is approaching the eight-round contest seriously.</p><p>“You can’t underestimate anyone. I’m going to take him seriously,” Joshua said. “After a year out, I’ve realigned a lot in my life. I got my focus back to where it needs to be.”</p><p>Joshua, who has 25 career KOs as a pro, acknowledged that anything short of a quick knockout win will be perceived as additional erosion of his standing among the elite heavyweights.</p><p>“I’ve seen it. I’ve heard it,” he added. “As I said to Jake respectfully, I need to cut him up. I need to break him up, and I need to hurt him. That’s just what we do.”</p><h2 id=\"who-is-fighting-in-the-co-main-event\">Who is fighting in the co-main event?</h2><p>In the co-main event, it will be an all-North American women’s matchup with Alycia Baumgardner of the United States putting two of her three World super featherweight titles (IBF, WBO) on the line against Canadian challenger Leila Beaduoin.</p><p>Baumgardner, aka “The Bomb”, hasn’t been defeated since 2018 and will start as the strong favourite in the eighth title match of her professional career.</p><p>Beaduoin, who is riding a four-fight winning streak, will need to be at her all-time best to upset the champ on Friday.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4178074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4178074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4178074\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-04-10T021330Z_1930407168_MT1USATODAY25890285_RTRMADP_3_BOXING-TAYLOR-VS-SERRANO-3-PRESS-CONFERENCE-1765897128.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alycia Baumgardner reacts.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4178074\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alycia Baumgardner (pictured) will defend her undisputed junior lightweight titles against Leila Beudoin [File: Vincent Carchietta/Imagn Images via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"full-undercard\">Full undercard</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\"><strong>Main card (From 8pm | 01:00 GMT on Saturday)</strong></p><ul>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua – heavyweight (8x3min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Alycia Baumgardner vs Lela Beaudoin – IBF &amp; WBO super-featherweight world titles (12x3min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Anderson Silva vs Tyron Woodley – cruiserweight (6x3min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Jahmal Harvey vs Kevin Cervantes – featherweight (6x3min rounds)</li>\n</ul><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\"><strong>Preliminary card (From 4.45pm | 21:45 GMT on Friday)</strong></p><ul>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Cherneka Johnson vs Amanda Galle – undisputed bantamweight title (10x2min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Yokasta Valle vs Yadira Bustillos – WBC strawweight world title (10x2min rounds)</li>\n<li class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Avious Griffin vs Justin Cardona – welterweight (8x3min rounds)</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"
