This is not what we stand for. This is going to upset our base,'” Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of history at New York University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Those agendas included US President Donald Trump’s preoccupation with opening Venezuela’s nationalised oil industry, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s desire for a more pugilistic military approach abroad, and adviser Stephen Miller’s fixation on migration and mass deportation.</p><p>“So that’s the way that Rubio was able to bring into line not quite competing, but really divergent agendas, all of them to focus on Venezuela as a way to advance a particular end,” Velasco said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4220019\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4220019\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4220019\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695d5fe48d9c-1767727076.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"AFP PICTURES OF THE YEAR 2025 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio whispers in the ear of President Donald Trump during a roundtable about Antifa in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on October 8, 2025.

That has, to date, seen the Trump administration launch bombing campaigns against Yemen and Iran, strike armed groups in Nigeria and Somalia, and attack alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean.</p><p>The approach of Trump 2.0 has more closely aligned with Rubio’s vision of Washington’s role abroad, which has long supported maximum-pressure sanctions campaigns and various forms of US intervention to topple governments.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>The US secretary of state’s personal ideology traces to his South Florida roots, where his family settled in the 1960s after leaving Cuba three years before the rise of Fidel Castro, in what Velasco described as an “acerbically anti-communist” political environment.</p><p>“I think for him, it started as a question of finally making real the hopes and dreams of Cubans in Florida and elsewhere to return to their homeland under a capitalist government,” Velasco explained.</p><p>“It went from that to what this could represent, if we think about it more hemispherically – a bigger shift that would not only increase, but in fact ensure, US hegemony in the region for the 21st century.”</p><h2 id=\"vacuum-was-his-to-fill\">‘Vacuum was his to fill’</h2><p>After tangling with Trump in the 2016 presidential election, in which the future president deridingly dubbed his opponent “Little Marco” while Rubio decried him as a “con man”, the pair forged a pragmatic working relationship.</p><p>Rubio eventually endorsed Trump ahead of the 2016 vote, helping to deliver Florida. In Trump’s first term, Rubio came to be seen as the president’s “shadow secretary” on Latin America, an atypical role that saw the lawmaker influence Trump’s eventual recognition of Juan Guaido as interim president in opposition to Maduro.</p><p>Analysts note Rubio’s approach to Venezuela has always been directly aimed at undermining the economic support it provides to Cuba, with the end goal of toppling the island’s 67-year-old Communist government. Following Maduro’s <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abduction</a> on Saturday, Rubio quickly pivoted to the island nation, telling reporters: “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned”.</p><p>Still, in the early months of Trump’s second term, Rubio appeared largely sidelined, with the president instead favouring close friends and family members to spearhead marquee negotiations on ceasefires in Gaza and Ukraine.</p><p>During this time, Rubio was slowly amassing a sizeable portfolio. Beyond serving as secretary of state, Rubio became the acting administrator of the Trump-dismantled US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the acting archivist of the US National Archives. Most notably, he became the acting director of National Security, making him the first top US diplomat to also occupy the impactful White House role since Henry Kissinger.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4220081\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4220081\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4220081\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/epa_695d664353ec-1767728707.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"epaselect epa12624353 Venezuelans in Miami hold a picture of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio while taking part in a rally in response to the US military strikes in Venezuela, Miami, Florida, USA, 03 January 2026.

The National Security Strategy released by the White House in December exemplified that approach.</p><p>The document, which is drafted by the National Security adviser with final approval from the president, offered little in tough language towards Russia, despite Rubio’s previous hard lines on the war in Ukraine. It supported the gutting of US foreign aid, despite Rubio’s years-long support for the system. It offered little of the human-rights language with which Rubio had earlier in his career styled himself as a champion.</p><p>It did, however, include a “Trump corollary” to the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/what-is-the-monroe-doctrine-which-trump-has-cited-over-venezuela\">Monroe Doctrine</a>, which dovetailed with Rubio’s worldview by calling for the restoration of US “preeminence” over the Western Hemisphere.</p><h2 id=\"a-pyrrhic-victory\">A pyrrhic victory?</h2><p>To be sure, the toppling of Maduro has so far proved a partial, if not pyrrhic victory for Rubio, far short of the comprehensive change he has long supported.</p><p>In a news conference immediately following Maduro’s abduction, Trump doused support for exiled opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who has hewed close to Rubio’s vision for a future Venezuela. Several news agencies have since reported that US intelligence assessed that installing an opposition figure would lead to widespread chaos in the country.</p><p>Rubio has so far been the point man in dealing with Maduro’s former deputy and replacement, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a>, who has been a staunch supporter of the Hugo Chavez-founded Chavismo movement that Rubio has long railed against. Elections remain a far-off prospect, with Trump emphasising working with the government to open the oil industry to the US.</p><p>The secretary of state has not been officially given a role connected to the country, but has earned the less-than-sincere title in some US media of “viceroy of Venezuela”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On news shows, Rubio has been tasked with walking back Trump’s claim that the US would “run” the South American country, while selling the administration’s oft-contradicted message that the abduction of Maduro was a law enforcement action, not regime change, an act of war, or a bid for the country’s oil.</p><p>“I think he’s sort of lying through his teeth,” Lee Schlenker, a research associate at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Even he doesn’t seem to believe a lot of the sort of rhetorical and discursive pretexts that have been deployed about drugs, about narco-terrorism, about a law enforcement-only operation, about just sort of enforcing a Department of Justice indictment,” he said.</p><p>Having to work with Rodriguez, and reportedly, Venezuela’s security czar and Minister of Interior Diosdado Cabello, has been a “bucket of cold water on Rubio’s broader illusions”, Schlenker added, noting that Rubio’s end goal still remains “the end of the Chavista project”.</p><p>Rubio is also likely to face further reality checks when it comes to his expected attempts to pitch the overthrow of what he will likely argue is a weakened Cuba.</p><p>The island, without the economic resources of Venezuela and no known drug trade, is seen as far less appealing to Trump and many of his allies.</p><p>“Compared to Venezuela,” Schlenker said, “there are a lot more reasons why Trump would have less interest in going after Cuba.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They’re vicious.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Over the past year, some Democrats have called for impeaching Trump over alleged misconduct, pointing to incidents like June’s military strikes against Iran, which were not authorised by Congress. But with the left-wing party in the minority, no impeachment proposals have advanced.</p><p>Trump was impeached twice during his first term. The first instance came in 2019, when he was accused of <a href=\"/news/2019/12/19/us-house-votes-to-impeach-trump-for-abuse-of-power-obstruction\">abuse of power</a> for allegedly using US aid to Ukraine as leverage to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate former US President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.</p><p>The second impeachment came in 2021, after Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6 of that year. Trump was accused of inciting an insurrection, after he spread false claims about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost.</p><p>The Senate acquitted Trump both times. In the 2021 trial, 57 senators <a href=\"/news/2021/2/13/donald-trump-acquitted-on-charge-of-inciting-us-capitol-riot\">found him guilty</a> after he had left office, but the result fell short of the 67 votes required for a conviction.</p><p>Had Trump been convicted, he would not have been able to run again in 2024.</p><p>No US president has ever been removed from office by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned from the White House over the Watergate scandal in 1974 before a vote was taken on his impeachment.</p><p>In more recent times, Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 for lying under oath about having sexual relations with a White House intern.

United States presidents conduct unilateral military actions abroad. Congress shrugs.</p><p>On Saturday, in the hours after the US military <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abducted</a> Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, Democrats in the Senate pledged to raise yet another <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/what-is-the-war-powers-act-and-can-it-stop-trump-from-attacking-iran\">resolution</a> to rein in US President Donald Trump’s military actions.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has said the party will push for a vote within the week. By all accounts, the odds of its success remain long.</p><p>Since Trump took office for a second term in 2025, Congress has weighed multiple bills that would force him to seek legislative approval before initiating a military strike.</p><p>But the latest attack on Venezuela offers a stark instance of presidential overreach, one that is “crying out for congressional action”, according to David Janovsky, the acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight.</p><p>Experts say it is also one of the clearest tests in recent history of whether Congress will continue to cede its authority to check US military engagement abroad.</p><p>“There are a lot of angles where you can come at this to say why it’s a clear-cut case,” Janovsky told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He pointed out that, under the US Constitution, Congress alone wields the authority to allow military action. He also noted that the Venezuela attack “is in direct contravention of the UN Charter, which is, as a treaty, law in the United States”.</p><p>“Any of the fig leaves that presidents have used in the past to justify unilateral military action just don’t apply here,” Janovsky added. “This is particularly brazen.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"an-uphill-battle\">An uphill battle</h2><p>Since August, the Trump administration has signalled plans to crank up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela.</p><p>That month, Trump reportedly signed a secret memo calling on the US military to prepare for action against criminal networks abroad. Then, on September 2, the Trump administration began conducting dozens of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts.</p><p>That deadly bombing campaign was itself condemned as a violation of international law and an affront to Congress’s constitutional powers. It coincided with a build-up of US military assets near Venezuela.</p><p>Trump also dropped hints that the US military campaign could quickly expand to alleged drug-trafficking targets on Venezuelan soil. “When they come by land, we’re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats,” Trump said on September 16.</p><p>The strikes prompted two recent votes in the House of Representatives in December: one that would require congressional approval for any land strikes on the South American country, and one that would force Trump to seek approval for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats.</p><p>Both resolutions, however, failed roughly along party lines. A similar resolution in the Senate, which would have required congressional approval before any more attacks, also fell short in November.</p><p>But speaking to reporters in a phone call just hours after the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/how-the-us-attack-on-venezuela-abduction-of-maduro-unfolded\">US operation</a> on Saturday, Senator Tim Kaine said he hoped the brashness of Trump’s latest actions in Venezuela would shock lawmakers into action.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Republicans, he said, can no longer tell themselves that Trump’s months-long military build-up in the Caribbean and his repeated threats are a “bluff” or a “negotiating tactic”.</p><p>“It’s time for Congress to get its a** off the couch and do what it’s supposed to do,” Kaine said.</p><p>In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, US Senator Chris Murphy also agreed that it was “true” that Congress had become impotent on matters of war, a phenomenon that has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p><p>Bash pointed to former President Barack Obama’s 2011 military deployment to Libya, which went unchecked by Congress.</p><p>“Congress needs to own its own role in allowing a presidency to become this lawless,” Murphy responded.</p><h2 id=\"republicans-ho-hum-about-resolutions\">Republicans ho-hum about resolutions</h2><p>Under the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war, something it has not done since World War II.</p><p>Instead, lawmakers have historically passed Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to approve committing troops to recent wars, including the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the strikes on alleged al-Qaeda affiliates across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p><p>No AUMFs have been passed that would relate to military action in Venezuela.</p><p>When lawmakers believe a president is acting beyond his constitutional power, they can pass a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-curb-trumps-power-to-go-to-war-with-iran\">war powers resolution</a> requiring Congressional approval for further actions.</p><p>Beyond their symbolism, such resolutions create a legal basis to challenge further presidential actions in the judiciary.</p><p>However, they carry a high bar for success, with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress needed to override a presidential veto.</p><p>Given the current makeup of Congress, passage of a war powers resolution would likely require bipartisan support.</p><p>Republicans maintain narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, so it would be necessary for members of Trump’s own party to back a war powers resolution for it to be successful.</p><p>In November’s Senate vote, only two Republicans — co-sponsor Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska — split from their party to support the resolution. It failed by a margin of 51 to 49.</p><p>December’s vote on a parallel resolution in the House only earned 211 votes in favour, as opposed to 213 against. In that case, three Republicans broke from their party to support the resolution, and one Democrat opposed it.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump’s abduction of Maduro has so far only received condemnation from a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/us-republicans-back-trump-on-venezuela-amid-faint-maga-dissent\">tiny fragment</a> of his party.</p><p>Overall, the response from elected Republicans has been muted. Even regular critics of presidential adventurism have instead focused on praising the ouster of the longtime Venezuelan leader, who has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.</p><p>Senator Todd Young, a Republican considered on the fence ahead of November’s war powers vote, has praised Maduro’s arrest, even as he contended the Trump administration owed Congress more details.</p><p>“We still need more answers, especially to questions regarding the next steps in Venezuela’s transition,” Young said.</p><p>Some Democrats have also offered careful messaging in the wake of the operation.</p><p>That included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents a large Venezuelan diaspora community in Florida.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/DWStweets/status/2007515364553568526?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Saturday, Wasserman Schultz focused on the implications of Maduro’s removal, while avoiding any mention of the military operation that enabled it. Instead, she asserted that Trump owed Congress an explanation about next steps.</p><p>“He has failed to explain to Congress or the American people how he plans to prevent the regime from reconstituting itself under Maduro’s cronies or stop Venezuela from falling into chaos,” she wrote.</p><p>In December, however, Wasserman Schultz did join a group of Florida Democrats in calling for Congress to exercise its oversight authority as Trump built up military pressure on Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>For its part, the Trump administration has not eased up on its military threats against Venezuela, even as it has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/fact-checking-trump-following-us-capture-of-venezuelas-maduro\">sought to send</a> the message that Maduro’s abduction was a matter of law enforcement, not the start of a war.</p><p>Trump has also denied, once again, that he needed congressional approval for any further military action. Still, in a Monday interview with NBC News, he expressed optimism about having Congress’s backing.</p><p>“We have good support congressionally,” he told NBC. “Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn’t they support us?”</p><p>Since Saturday’s attack and abduction, Trump has warned that a “second wave” of military action could be on the horizon for Venezuela.</p><p>That threat has extended to the potential for the forced removal of Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, who was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/delcy-rodriguez-sworn-in-as-venezuelas-president-after-maduro-abduction\">formally sworn in</a> as the country’s interim president on Monday.</p><p>“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine.</p><p>The administration has also said that strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela will continue and that US military assets will remain deployed in the region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Constitutional expert Janovsky, however, believes that this is a critical moment for Congress to act.</p><p>Failure to rein in Trump would only further reinforce a decades-long trend of lawmakers relinquishing their oversight authorities, he explained. That, in turn, offers tacit support for the presidency’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/2025-trumps-year-of-emergency-invasion-and-narcoterrorism\">growing power</a> over the military.</p><p>“To say this was a targeted law enforcement operation — and ignore the ongoing situation — would be a dangerous abdication of Congress as a central check on how the United States military is used,” Janovsky said.</p><p>“Continued congressional inaction does nothing but empower presidents to act however they want,” he added.</p><p>“To see Congress continue to step back ultimately just removes the American people even farther from where these decisions are actually being made.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
