You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”</p><p>Trump’s comments come days after the US and Iran held a second round of indirect talks.</p><p>On Wednesday, Iran’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi said the two sides made “good progress in the negotiations” in Geneva and “were able to reach broad agreement on a set of guiding principles” for an agreement.</p><p>But the US has continued to amass <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/white-house-says-iran-would-be-wise-to-take-deal-amid-military-buildup\">military assets</a> in the Gulf region, including two aircraft carriers and dozens of fighter jets.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Iran, which denies seeking a nuclear weapon, has said it would agree to curbing its uranium enrichment and placing it under rigorous international inspection.</p><p>But the Trump administration has said that it would oppose any Iranian enrichment. Washington has also sought to place limits on Tehran’s missile arsenal, but Iranian officials have ruled out any concessions over the issue, which they say is a non-negotiable defence principle.</p><p>On Thursday, Trump said his diplomatic aides Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have had “very good meetings” with Iran’s representatives.</p><p>“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” he said.</p><p>Last week, Trump said the US and Iran should come to an agreement “over the next month”, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/trump-threatens-iran-with-something-very-tough-if-us-demands-are-not-met\">warning Tehran</a> of “very traumatic” consequences otherwise.</p><p>But Iranian officials have expressed defiance against the US president’s threats.</p><p>“The Americans constantly say that they’ve sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,” Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei wrote on X on Thursday.</p><p>“However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Tensions between Washington and Tehran have been escalating since late 2025, when Trump, while hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in December, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/trump-says-us-would-back-strikes-against-irans-missile-programme\">promised to strike</a> Iran again if attempts to rebuild its nuclear or missile programmes.</p><p>Days later, antigovernment protests broke out in Iran. Trump encouraged the demonstrators to take over state institutions, promising them that “help is on the way”.</p><p>Trump appeared to step back from the brink of attacking Iran last month, saying that the country agreed to halt the execution of dissidents under US pressure.</p><p>The two countries later <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/6/iran-foreign-minister-arrives-in-oman-for-talks-with-us\">renewed negotiations</a> with the first round of talks since the June war taking place in Oman on February 6.</p><p>But threats and hostile rhetoric between Washington and Tehran have persisted despite the ongoing diplomacy.</p><p>In 2018, during his first term, Trump nixed the multilateral nuclear deal that saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting international sanctions against its economy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Nearly 1,400 people were killed, and more than 20,000 were wounded, according to the country’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), which later found Hasina guilty of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/sheikh-hasina-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity-what-we-know\">crimes against humanity</a> and sentenced her to death. She is currently in exile in India, where she fled after her ouster.</p><p>After Hasina went into exile, her Awami League party, which had been in power for 15 years under her leadership, was also <a href=\"/news/2025/5/11/bangladesh-bans-activities-of-awami-league-the-party-of-ousted-pm-hasina\">banned</a> from all political activities. The latest election was the first since the uprising.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-july-charter\">What is the July Charter?</h2><p>After Hasina was ousted, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took over as the country’s interim leader of a caretaker government in August 2024.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/bangladesh-election-2026-what-happens-when-and-whats-at-stake\">July National Charter 2025</a> was drafted by the caretaker government, outlining a roadmap for constitutional amendments, legal changes and the enactment of new laws.</p><p>It contains more than 80 proposals to overhaul Bangladesh’s system of governance, with key reforms being “increasing women’s political representation, imposing prime ministerial term limits, enhancing presidential powers, expanding fundamental rights, and protecting judicial independence”, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA).</p><p>The charter also recommends creating a 100-member upper chamber alongside Bangladesh’s current single parliamentary body, the 350-member Jatiya Sangsad.</p><p>The BNP was <a href=\"/features/2026/2/13/what-does-bnps-landslide-mean-for-bangladeshs-post-uprising-order\">sceptical</a> about the July National Charter referendum for months during the transitional government, at times signalling a “no”, until party leader Tarique Rahman publicly endorsed a “yes” vote on January 30 and the BNP said it would adopt the charter if approved in the referendum.</p><p>In particular, analysts say, the BNP appeared opposed to proposals to use proportional representation to fill the upper house, which, it has argued, could dilute large parliamentary majorities under the current electoral system.</p><p>Now that the charter has been approved, the new MPs must set up the Constitution Reform Council to enact the constitutional amendments in the charter. The implementation process is required to be completed within 180 days of forming the council.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-the-referendum-caused-division-in-bangladesh\">Has the referendum caused division in Bangladesh?</h2><p>On Tuesday, newly elected members of parliament were sworn in.</p><p>They were asked to take two oaths. The first was the standard pledge to uphold the Constitution of Bangladesh. The second bound them to respect and implement the July National Charter 2025.</p><p>But the newly elected MPs from the BNP did not take the second oath, prompting criticism from members of Jamaat and its ally, the National Citizen Party (NCP), a party formed by students who led the protests against Hasina in 2024.</p><p>Under an implementation order that sets out how the July National Charter will be turned into law, the Constitutional Reform Council is to be composed of MPs who, at the same ceremony, also take an oath as council members. This technically means only the Jamaat, the NCP and a small number of others who took the second oath are currently eligible to sit on the Council.</p><p>Because more than two-thirds of the MPs did not take the second oath, the Council has not yet been constituted. It is unclear what will happen next regarding the formation of the council.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-main-sticking-point-for-the-bnp\">What is the main sticking point for the BNP?</h2><p>Salahuddin Ahmed, a BNP standing committee member and MP, told local media after the ceremony that BNP lawmakers had refused to take the Charter oath because, in their view, the Constitution Reform Council, which will be charged with enacting the reforms, has not yet been approved by parliament.</p><p>“None of us have been elected as the members of this ‘Constitution Reform Council’. This council is not even a part of the constitution yet. It will be considered legitimate only when it is approved by the elected parliament,” Ahmed said, according to local media reports.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, he reaffirmed the BNP’s promise to enact the reforms: “We are committed and pledged to implement the July National Charter exactly as it was signed as a document of political consensus.”</p><p>The main concern the BNP is understood to have about the reforms relates to the formation of a second, 100-member upper chamber of parliament.</p><p>“Major parties appear to agree on almost all the core referendum issues. However, disagreements remain regarding specific details, particularly in regard to the formation of the proposed Upper House,” Asif Nazrul, a law professor at Dhaka University, told Al Jazeera earlier.</p><p>Bangladesh currently conducts all elections using the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system. Each voter picks one candidate, and whoever gets the most votes in a seat wins it.</p><p>This can create a large gap between a party’s overall vote share and its actual share of seats. Theoretically, one party could win 51 percent of the vote in every seat, while another could win 49 percent in every seat. The first party would receive 100 percent of the seats, however.</p><p>Any party that wins at least 151 of the 300 seats can form a government alone, while the runner-up in seat count becomes the official opposition.</p><p>In last week’s election, the BNP-led alliance won 212 seats, followed by 77 for the Jamaat-led alliance, out of the 297 parliamentary seats for which results were announced.</p><p>The BNP wishes to retain the system of FPTP, but the July Charter recommends that the upper house be filled with representatives elected according to the proportional representation electoral system, which would give parties a share of seats more in line with their share of overall votes.</p><p>Forming the upper house in line with the FPTP system, by contrast, would put the BNP at an advantage due to the large proportion of seats it won in parliament.</p><p>“The BNP favours forming it [the upper house] in proportion to parliamentary seats, while Jamaat and the NCP prefer a system of proportional representation. Resolving this dispute remains a key challenge,” Nazrul said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak frequently used the apartment for extended stays.</p><p>While the property was technically owned by a company linked to Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein, the disgraced financier essentially controlled it. The units in the building were frequently loaned to Epstein’s associates and used to house underage models, the report said.</p><p>Barak served as prime minister from 1999 to 2001. Under Israeli law, former prime ministers receive state-funded security after leaving office. The documents expose a direct operational relationship between Israel’s permanent mission to the United Nations and Epstein’s enterprise.</p><p>Rafi Shlomo, the former director of protective services at the Israeli mission and head of Barak’s security detail, personally controlled access to the apartment. Shlomo conducted background checks on Epstein’s employees and cleaning staff and held meetings with them to coordinate the installation of surveillance equipment.</p><h2 id=\"coordinated-surveillance\">Coordinated surveillance</h2><p>The structural modifications carried out by the Israeli government required permission from Epstein.</p><p>In a January 2016 email exchange, Barak’s wife, Nili Priell, discussed the installation of alarms and surveillance tools with Epstein’s longtime assistant Lesley Groff. Priell noted the system included sensors on the windows and remote access capabilities.</p><p>“They can neutralize the system from far, before you need somebody to enter the appartment [sic],” Priell <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00331291.pdf\">wrote</a>. “The only thing to do is call Rafi from the consulate and let him know who and when is entering.”</p><p>Groff later confirmed to Barak and Priell that Epstein had personally authorised the physical alterations to the property, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02062130.pdf\">writing</a>: “Jeffrey says he does not mind holes in the walls and this is all just fine!”</p><p>The correspondence between the Israeli mission and Epstein’s representatives continued regularly throughout 2016 and 2017 to manage access for maids and coordinate subsequent visits by Barak.</p><h2 id=\"state-ties-and-political-fallout\">State ties and political fallout</h2><p>After Epstein’s death in a New York jail in 2019 while he was awaiting a sex-trafficking trial, Barak tried to downplay his relationship with the financier, claiming that while they had met, Epstein never supported or paid him.</p><p>The political fallout from the relationship has been seized upon by Barak’s rivals in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently weaponised the newly released documents, arguing that the ties implicated Barak rather than Israel.</p><p>“Jeffrey Epstein’s unusual close relationship with Ehud Barak doesn’t suggest Epstein worked for Israel. It proves the opposite,” Netanyahu <a href=\"https://x.com/netanyahu/status/2019739136660222088\">stated</a>, accusing Barak of working with the “anti-Zionist radical left” to undermine Israel’s current government.</p><p>However, the emails released by the US Justice Department demonstrate that the entanglement extended beyond Barak to other active Israeli state officials.</p><p>Yoni Koren, a longtime aide to Barak who died in 2023, was also a frequent guest at the 66th Street apartment. Congressional investigations and leaked emails indicated Koren stayed at the Epstein-controlled residence multiple times, including in 2013 while he was serving as the bureau chief for the Israeli Ministry of Defence. Further records showed Koren continued to use the apartment while receiving medical treatment in New York until Epstein’s final arrest in 2019.</p><h2 id=\"intelligence-and-settler-funding\">Intelligence and settler funding</h2><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">The ties between Epstein and Israel</a> have come into sharp focus since the release of millions of documents relating to the criminal investigations into Epstein. Beyond his interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak, the files document Epstein’s financial support for Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli army and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund as well as his connections to the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency.</p><p>Barak has expressed remorse over his ties to Epstein. Despite the financier pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008, which resulted in a prison sentence, Barak maintained a close personal and business relationship with him. The former Israeli leader claimed he remained unaware of the full scope of Epstein’s crimes until a wider federal inquiry was opened in 2019.</p></div></div></body></html>"

On Tuesday, the Gates Foundation’s India office posted on X that Gates would attend the summit and “deliver his keynote as scheduled”.</p><p>Then, on Thursday, hours before the scheduled speech, it released a statement saying that “After careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities, Mr Gates will not be delivering his keynote address.”</p><p>It added that Ankur Vora, president of the Gates Foundation’s Africa and India offices, would deliver the speech instead.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-alleged-links-between-epstein-and-gates\">What are the alleged links between Epstein and Gates?</h2><p>Bill Gates was named in documents related to Epstein released in January by the US Department of Justice.</p><p>In a draft email included among the documents, Epstein alleged Gates had engaged in extramarital affairs and sought his help in procuring drugs “to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls”.</p><p>It was unclear whether Epstein actually sent the email, and Gates denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>The Gates Foundation, in a statement to The New York Times, called the allegations “absolutely absurd and completely false”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-india-s-government-said\">What has India’s government said?</h2><p>Very little.</p><p>Despite criticism and calls from opposition figures to explain the invitation to Gates, the Indian government has not directly addressed the controversy that culminated in Gates’s withdrawal.</p><p>While unnamed government sources told local media he would not attend the summit, officials stopped short of explaining why.</p><p>Asked about Gates’s participation, Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw declined to give a clear answer to reporters, while Modi made no reference to the issue in his public remarks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-are-the-epstein-files-a-sensitive-subject-for-india\">Why are the Epstein files a sensitive subject for India?</h2><p>The controversy surrounding Gates’s planned participation comes close on the heels of a series of disclosures in the Epstein files that have forced the Modi government on the backfoot.</p><p>In one email to an unidentified individual he referred to only as “Jabor Y”, Epstein referred to Modi’s historic visit – the first by an Indian prime minister – to Israel in July 2017.</p><p>Epstein wrote: “The Indian Prime minister modi took advice. and danced and sang in israel for the benefit of the US president. they had met a few weeks ago.. IT WORKED. !”</p><p>Modi’s visit to Israel – and his subsequent embrace of the Benjamin Netanyahu government, with military, intelligence and other ties strengthened over the past decade – had already drawn criticism from the opposition Congress party and others, who have accused him of reversing decades of Indian support for the Palestinian cause. India was the first non-Arab nation to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, and did not establish full diplomatic relations with Israel until 1992.</p><p>But the Epstein email turbocharged the opposition criticism of Modi’s Israel policy – with questions now also asked about whether it was influenced by Washington.</p><p>The Indian Ministry of External Affairs dismissed the Epstein email in an unusually sharply worded statement.</p><p>“Beyond the fact of the prime minister’s official visit to Israel in July 2017, the rest of the allusions in the email are little more than trashy ruminations by a convicted criminal, which deserve to be dismissed with the utmost contempt,” spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.</p><p>But the Epstein cloud continues to hover over India.</p><p>The files also show that India’s current oil minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, exchanged dozens of emails with Epstein after he joined Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014.</p><p>In many of them, Puti appears to be taking Epstein’s help in getting US investors, such as LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, to visit India. In others, he appears to suggest that he had a fairly comfortable personal relationship with Epstein.</p><p>“Please let me know when you are back from your exotic island,” Puri wrote in December 2014, for instance, asking to set up a meeting in which Puri could give Epstein some books to “excite an interest in India”.</p><p>Puri, in a new conference, has claimed that he only met Epstein “three or four times”, but the Congress party has argued that the emails suggest a much closer relationship.</p><h2 id=\"gates-s-work-in-india\">Gates’s work in India</h2><p>The Gates Foundation has long been a key partner in India’s public health and development sectors, backing major vaccination drives, disease prevention campaigns and sanitation programmes.</p><p>At the same time, he has had vocal critics, including environmental activist Vandana Shiva, who has argued that Gates’s brand of “philanthro-imperialism” uses wealth to control global food systems.</p><p>Gates also faced heavy criticism after a 2024 podcast in which he said India was “a kind of laboratory to try things … that then, when you prove them out in India, you can take to other places” when discussing development programmes and the foundation’s work there.</p><h2 id=\"orion-the-robodog-and-other-controversies\">‘Orion’ the robodog and other controversies</h2><p>Beyond the fallout over Bill Gates’s cancelled keynote, the AI Impact Summit has faced several controversies.</p><p>One incident involved a robotic dog named “Orion”, which Galgotias University, based in the New Delhi suburban town of Greater Noida, presented as its own innovation.</p><p>Online users quickly identified the machine as a commercially available Chinese-made model, prompting organisers to ask the institution to vacate its stall.</p><p>The event also drew criticism on its opening day after facing logistical issues, including long queues and confusion over entry procedures, according to local media.</p><p>On Wednesday, large crowds were seen walking for miles after police cordoned off roads for VIP access.</p><p>Dhananjay Yadav, the CEO of a company exhibiting high-tech wearables, made headlines after he reported on social media that devices had been stolen from the company’s stand.</p><p>The Times of India later reported that two maintenance workers at the event had been arrested for allegedly stealing the wearables.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
