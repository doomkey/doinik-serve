It brings joy – you can see it on the faces of children and even the elderly. People drift into a different world for a moment,” he told Al Jazeera’s Ibrahim al-Khalili.</p><p class=\"s4\">“They look at the artwork and see an image completely different from what they’ve been used to since the war began – the bombings, destruction, and the buzzing of drones. Through our drawings, even a small picture can change how they feel.”</p><p class=\"s4\">With no professional equipment left amid the widespread destruction of Gaza, the artists use anything they can find as tools – a small brush, a broken tile, a stick pulled from the shore.</p><p class=\"s4\">But, like the coastline itself, their work is temporary.</p><p class=\"s4\">Majd Ayada, another artist, told Al Jazeera that he and others are at the shore every day drawing from morning until night, even though the tides erase the work by evening.</p><p class=\"s4\">“We come back the next day and start again. Art is our talent – we love sculpting and drawing on Gaza’s soil,” he said.</p><p class=\"s4\">“And even after two years of war, we never give up.”</p><p class=\"s4\">Other Palestinian families observe the artwork from nearby tents and flimsy plastic coverings, which <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/gazas-shelter-crisis-is-most-dangerous-disaster-of-war-authorities\">they are forced to use as meagre protection</a> against the winter cold after being repeatedly displaced by Israel.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4124965\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4124965\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4124965\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-23-at-2.03.05-PM-1763895948.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C444&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinian sculptors create art on Gaza beach sand to escape Israel's war \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4124965\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinian sculptors create art on Gaza beach sand to escape Israel’s war [Screengrab/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p class=\"s4\">Fathi Abu Maoud, a displaced father, said it makes his family happy to see the children and young people sculpting and creating images of Gaza, as it strengthens their attachment to the place even more.</p><p class=\"s4\">“We were born here, our children were born here… This is our home.

Ukrainian and Western media have suggested that the president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, may also be implicated.</p><p>The way the investigation is revealing facts and identifying suspects – slowly, theatrically, strategically – smacks of a political campaign aimed at achieving specific political outcomes under the cover of an anticorruption drive.</p><p>The scandal has delivered a devastating blow to Zelenskyy’s international reputation and to the Ukrainian cause at large. The Ukrainian president is emerging out of it as a lame duck who will do what he is told by whoever is pulling the strings, which may be the administration of United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>One area in which there is already dramatic change is Ukrainian policy on talks with Russia. On November 11, British newspaper The Times ran a story on Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, the man tasked with leading the negotiations, in which he made clear that engagement with Moscow was suspended because it was yielding no result. Just a week later, Zelenskyy announced he wanted to reactivate talks with Russia.</p><p>Then immediately, talk began of an emerging American peace plan that envisages Ukraine succumbing to all the key Russian demands for ending the war, if we are to believe media leaks. Despite a couple of defiant statements by Ukrainian officials, Zelenskyy didn’t reject it outright and promised to cooperate with the US. The corruption scandal has drastically limited his room for defiance.</p><p>What makes the prospect of peace more realistic today is that there is now a clear scapegoat for what essentially is Ukraine’s looming defeat – the Ukrainian president himself.</p><p>Indeed, the talks spearheaded by Trump earlier this year did not progress primarily because nobody wanted to take responsibility for an outcome that contrasts drastically with the expectations the cheerleaders of this war had built. While a military defeat today may mean salvation for Kyiv, it would be a deadly blow for war-mongering politicians and lobbyists who promoted the idea that Russia, a major nuclear power, could be coerced into accepting Western primacy by force.</p><p>That illusion underpinned the entire Western policy with regards to Russia throughout the conflict. It is the main reason why Kyiv resisted accepting an outcome of the war that the West was unable to change.</p><p>It has long been clear that Ukraine’s Western allies have hit a wall when it comes to military supplies and funding for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Nineteen packages of harsh sanctions against Moscow have failed to stop its army, which has grown only stronger and far more technologically advanced than it was at the start of the conflict.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukraine has been struggling with draft dodging and territorial and human losses. It could reportedly run out of Western funding by April. Worse still, close European allies – like Poland and Germany – have indicated they are not ready to keep funding the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees they are hosting.</p><p>The appetite for more war with Russia is largely exhausted in Europe, but of course, no one wants to be blamed for reaching a much worse settlement than could have been achieved had this all-out war been avoided altogether.</p><p>Being blamed for a Ukraine defeat is not a huge risk for Trump, who has long dismissed this conflict as “Biden’s war”, accusing his predecessor President Joe Biden of starting it.</p><p>It is much harder for European leaders and Zelenskyy himself to accept it, given how invested they have been in the promise that Russia could be defeated on the battlefield.</p><p>To understand their predicament today, one needs to recall December 2019 when Zelenskyy met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Paris, and the two sides agreed on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, which ended hostilities and froze the front line over the next 12 months.</p><p>The war could have ended then on terms Kyiv could only dream of today. In particular, Ukraine would have retained its formal sovereignty over the Donbas region, only a part of which would have become a Russian-influenced autonomy. Ukraine would have lost the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia occupied and annexed in 2014.</p><p>But with the arrival of Biden to the White House in January 2021, Zelenskyy made a U-turn on the peace process, embarking on a strategy of pressing Russia on all fronts to coerce it into agreeing to better conditions for Kyiv.</p><p>He clamped down on Putin’s main political ally in Ukraine and launched a loud campaign for Ukraine’s accession to NATO while his Western allies tried to pressure Germany into stopping work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a major Russian export energy project. London also challenged Moscow by sending a battleship into the waters off Crimea, which Russia considers its territory. More than a year of dangerous brinkmanship ended with Putin unleashing an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>This year, Ukraine finally ditched its rightful but entirely unrealistic demands for a full Russian withdrawal and reparations in favour of a comprehensive ceasefire along the current front lines. It did so after having lost swaths of territory, a lot of infrastructure, 14,500 civilians and up to 100,000 military personnel.</p><p>A peace agreement on Russia’s terms would be extremely unfair to Ukraine and would indeed be against international law. But the only alternative to it is the country being sucked even deeper into the black hole of devastation and collapsing nationhood.</p><p>The reaction to the draft of the peace plan was the expected mix of virtue signalling, performative defiance and jingoism. It reflects the complete absence of a realistic plan that could improve Ukraine’s negotiating position. Conveniently though, the corruption within Zelenskyy’s entourage gives pro-Ukrainian cheerleaders in the West a way out that absolves them from responsibility for the deadly mess they helped create.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

and its western allies.</p><p class=\"s3\">The Specialized Criminal Court in the capital Sanaa handed down the sentences on Saturday morning in the cases of “espionage cells within a spy network affiliated with American, Israeli, and Saudi intelligence”, Houthi-run media said.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"s3\">The court sentenced the 17 men to execution “to be carried out in a public place as a deterrent”, Saba and other outlets said, also publishing a list of names.</p><p class=\"s3\">A woman and a man were sentenced to 10 years in prison, while another man was acquitted of all charges, bringing the total number of people put on trial in this case to 20.</p><p class=\"s3\">Houthi-run media said state prosecutors had charged the defendants, who can theoretically appeal the sentences, with “espionage for foreign countries hostile to Yemen” in 2024 and 2025, which also included the United Kingdom.</p><p class=\"s3\">Israel’s Mossad spying agency reportedly “directed” intelligence officers who were in contact with the accused Yemeni citizens, whose work allegedly “led to the targeting of several military, security, and civilian sites and resulting in the killing of dozens and the destruction of extensive infrastructure”.</p><p class=\"s3\">The United States and the UK <a href=\"/news/2025/4/30/uk-joins-latest-us-air-strikes-in\">conducted dozens of deadly joint air strikes</a> across Yemen after the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023, as the Houthis launched attacks on Israel and international maritime transit through the Red Sea in a stated attempt to support Palestinians under fire.</p><p class=\"s3\">The Houthis have stopped their attacks since last month’s Gaza ceasefire deal.</p><p class=\"s3\">Israel has also unleashed huge air attacks on Yemen and its infrastructure, repeatedly hitting fuel tanks, power stations and a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/21/israel-says-it-has-attacked-houthi-targets-in-yemens-hodeidah-port\">critical port city</a> where desperately needed humanitarian aid flows through, killing political leaders and dozens of civilians.</p><p>In August, the Houthis confirmed that an Israeli air raid killed the prime minister of their government in Sanaa.</p><p>Ahmed al-Rahawi was killed with “several” other ministers, the Houthis said in a statement at the time.</p><p class=\"s3\">Houthi authorities, who control Sanaa and parts of Yemen to the north after an armed takeover more than a decade ago, made no mention of any links with the United Nations or other international agencies in the cases announced Saturday.</p><p class=\"s3\">But they have, over the past year, increasingly raided UN and NGO offices, detaining dozens of mostly local but also international staff and confiscating equipment.</p><p class=\"s3\">Amid condemnation and calls for the release of staff by the UN and international stakeholders, the Houthis have framed the efforts as necessary to stave off Israeli

IT WAS SEDITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND SEDITION IS A MAJOR CRIME. THERE CAN BE NO OTHER INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THEY SAID!”</p><p>The latest post came after Trump caused a firestorm on Thursday when he appeared to call for <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/punishable-by-death-trump-threatens-democrats-with-sedition-charges\">the death penalty</a> for the Democrats in the video.</p><p>“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The 90-second video was first posted on Tuesday by Senator Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA officer.

You can refuse illegal orders,” they say.</p><p>The Democratic legislators did not specify which illegal orders members of the military should refuse. But their message coincided with Trump’s effort to deploy <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/on-edge-trumps-military-deployment-in-us-capital-sparks-fear-confusion\">federal forces</a> to several Democratic-led US cities.</p><p>Trump’s invoking of the death penalty prompted condemnation from Democrats, with critics accusing the president of calling for killing the lawmakers.</p><p>“There’s no other way to explain it than to say that emphatically the president has put our lives in danger,” Chrissy Houlahan, one of the Democrats who appeared in the video,  told CNN on Thursday.</p><p>“He directly, literally said that we were seditious and traitors and literally said that we should be hung. So there’s no other way to interpret that other than a call for our death.”</p><p>The controversy came as the US continues to reel from political violence after the assassination of right-wing commentator <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/israeli-leaders-heap-praise-on-charlie-kirk-as-a-staunch-ally-of-israel\">Charlie Kirk</a> in September and the killing of Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman in June.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite the outcry over his earlier comments about the death penalty, Trump appeared undeterred by the criticism.</p><p>“MANY GREAT LEGAL SCHOLARS AGREE THAT THE DEMOCRAT TRAITORS THAT TOLD THE MILITARY TO DISOBEY MY ORDERS, AS PRESIDENT, HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME OF SERIOUS PROPORTION,” he wrote on Saturday.</p><p>The president serves as the commander-in-chief of the US military, and the law requires officers to follow the orders of their superiors.</p><p>But some legal scholars have highlighted that the service members swear an oath to the Constitution, and that the Uniform Code of Military Justice – which applies to all active duty officers – only details penalties for members who disobey “lawful orders”.</p><p>Moreover, the laws of war do not offer legal protection for soldiers who follow illegal orders.</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross database of international humanitarian law says “manifestly unlawful” orders “must be disobeyed”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s very strong in Nigeria, in East Africa ... What is unique about Ghana is the camps in the north.”</p><p>Although accusations occur in other parts of Ghana, women in those areas are more likely to be ostracised than banished. Meanwhile, in the north, the accused are often sent to the “witch camps” that usually serve as their last refuge.</p><p>The camps are often located near or within villages and are overseen by traditional priests or camp chiefs, typically appointed by village leaders. The camp in Gambaga is the oldest and most well-known, but others exist in Kukuo, Gnani, and Kpatinga.</p><p>Women, often elderly, widowed, or without strong family protection, are most frequently targeted, Azumah says. Many, too, are “the poorest of the poor”, he added. Once accused, they are vulnerable to mob violence, abandonment, or lifelong banishment.</p><p>Sometimes, the accusations have deadly consequences. In July 2020, 90-year-old Akua Denteh was lynched in a public market after being accused. Her brutal killing shocked the nation, and sparked calls for reform.</p><p>“It is violence against women - a demonisation of women,” Azumah says, explaining how witchcraft is not always viewed as inherently evil. Women accused of witchcraft are feared and condemned, while men who are accused of it are thought to use it for protection or good, he explains.</p><p>Almost any misfortune can be interpreted as evidence of witchcraft, says Azumah. “Sometimes people are just accusing others maliciously, or to get them out of the way for some reason. It could be fights over property or farmland, or it could just be pure jealousy, like somebody's child is doing well in school.”</p><p>Once a woman is accused and sent to a camp, she may undergo a traditional \"trial\", involving the slaughter of a chicken or guinea fowl. \"When the guinea fowl or chicken is dying, the position of the body determines the outcome [of the trial],\" explains Alasan Shei, the traditional spiritual leader who oversees the Gnani camp. \"If it falls on its back with the head facing up, it means the woman has some witchcraft. But if it lies face down, then she is innocent.\"</p><p>Yet even when this ritual “proves” innocence, returning home is rare. For most women, the accusation alone is enough to drive them from their communities.</p><p>“Most often, the communities where the women are accused will not be ready to accept them back,” says Shei.</p></div></div></body></html>"

On Thursday, Tunisian journalists protested against the widening crackdown on the freedom of the press and the temporary suspension of several prominent civil society organisations.</p><p>Saied was democratically elected in 2019, succeeding <a href=\"/news/2019/7/25/tunisian-president-beji-caid-essebsi-dies-at-92\">Beji Caid Essebsi</a>, who died earlier this year. The 70-year-old suspended parliament and consolidated all branches of power in 2021 before moving to prosecute political opponents and former officials.</p><p>Early in Saied’s tenure, the Tunisian government focused its crackdown on the Ennahdha Party, which was part of Essebsi’s governing coalition.</p><p>Tunisian courts have handed several jail sentences to Ennahdha’s leader, former Parliament Speaker <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/tunisian-court-hands-lengthy-prison-sentences-to-ex-officials\">Rached Ghannouchi</a>, in cases that his supporters say are politically motivated.</p><p>Even Saied’s former allies have not been spared by the crackdown.</p><p>Nadia Akacha, the Tunisian president’s former chief of staff, who was considered one of his close and influential aides, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in absentia in July.</p><p>Rights groups have also accused Saied of pushing to suppress civil society in Tunisia.</p><p>Amnesty International said earlier this month that the crackdown on rights groups has reached critical levels with arbitrary arrests, detentions, asset freezes, banking restrictions and suspensions targeting 14 NGOs.</p><p>Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, has said that more than 50 people, including politicians, lawyers, journalists and activists, have been subjected to arbitrary arrest or prosecution since late 2022, for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly or political activity.</p><p>The rights group also warned that broad antiterrorism and cybercrime laws were being utilised to criminalise dissent and tame all forms of free speech.</p><p>Saied denies having become a dictator or using the judiciary against opponents, saying he is cleansing Tunisia of “traitors”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
