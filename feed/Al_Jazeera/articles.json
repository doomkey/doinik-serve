The US quietly removed sanctions on five individuals and companies allegedly tied to the regime’s arms trade on July 24.</p><p>“This is a major step backward for international efforts to save lives by restricting the murderous junta’s access to weapons,” Andrews said in a statement. “It is unconscionable to undermine these efforts by rolling back sanctions on Myanmar arms dealers and junta cronies.”</p><p>The move has drawn criticism amid an ongoing civil war in Myanmar, where the military, led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, seized power in a 2021 coup that overthrew the government of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p><p>Andrews said the companies removed from the sanctions list had been implicated in brokering weapons and materials for the regime’s military operations.</p><p>“What makes this action even more appalling is that sanctions against the junta are proving to be effective,” Andrews added, pointing to data showing a more than 30 percent decline in Myanmar’s imported military equipment from 2023 to 2024, which he attributed in part to US-led sanctions.</p><p>The move comes despite US President Trump signing a notice in February extending the executive order underpinning Myanmar-related sanctions, saying the 2021 coup “continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>And in a June statement to the UN, the US representative accused the military regime of bombing civilians and conscripting Rohingya to fight on its behalf.</p><p>But the decision to ease sanctions came two weeks after Myanmar’s military chief sent a glowing letter of praise to US President Donald Trump. In the letter, the general commended Trump’s “strong leadership” and praised his administration for defunding US-backed media outlets critical of the regime.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>A senior official from Trump’s administration said the sanctions decision was unrelated to the letter.</p><p>But critics say the timing raises serious concerns. John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, called the move “extremely worrying” and warned that it “suggests a major shift is underway in US policy, which had centered on punitive action against Myanmar’s military regime”.</p><p>Andrews urged the Trump administration to reverse course. “Rather than removing sanctions, the US should be extending them to include Myanmar Economic Bank, the key military-controlled financial institution that it relies on to pay for imported military equipment.”</p><p>“This is a dangerous and disturbing trend,” he added. “I urge the Trump administration to stand with the people of Myanmar and reconsider its decision to make it easier for the military junta to attack them with sophisticated weapons of war. It is literally a matter of life and death.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

A statement on Dalhmeier’s Instagram page said it had been her wish that nobody risk their life to recover her body after an accident.</p><p>German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier offered his condolences to Dahlmeier’s parents, writing that she “was an exceptional sportswoman”. He recalled that he presented her with the highest honour in German sport, the Silver Laurel Leaf, shortly after she won her first Olympic gold medal in 2018.</p><p>“Laura Dahlmeier was an ambassador for our country in the world, a role model for peaceful, cheerful and fair coexistence across borders,” he said.</p><p>Authorities launched the rescue mission Monday after receiving a distress signal from Dahlmeier’s climbing partner, Marina Eva, who managed to descend to base camp with help from rescuers on Tuesday.</p><p>Dahlmeier’s partner had tried for several hours to rescue her, but that wasn’t possible because of the difficult terrain and persistent rockfall, the statement on Dahlmeier’s Instagram page said. “Her partner, who could no longer hear any signs of life, eventually decided to leave the danger zone and resume her descent,” according to the statement.</p><p>It was Dahlmeier’s express wish “that in a case like this, no one should risk their life to recover her”, the statement said, calling for that wish to be respected. It said Dahlmeier’s family members thank the rescue team and climbers, who did their best to make her rescue possible.</p><p>Bodies of foreign climbers who die attempting to summit mountains in Pakistan are typically recovered at the request of their families, but if the family declines a rescue, the remains are left at the spot where the climber died.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Dahlmeier, age 31, was injured at an altitude of about 5,700 metres (18,700 feet) around noon Monday, according to her management team in Germany.</p><p>Dahlmeier had been in the region with friends since the end of June. The 6,069-metre (20,000-foot) Laila Peak was the second peak on her tour after she climbed the 6,287-metre (20,626-foot) Great Trango Tower on July 8.</p><p>Military helicopters were on standby to assist in any rescue, but have been unable to deploy because of bad weather, Faraq said. Climbers including two Americans have been attempting the same ascent done by Dahlmeier to try to join the rescue operation, he said.</p><p>Dahlmeier won seven gold, three silver and five bronze medals at the Biathlon World Championships, along with 20 World Cup races and the overall World Cup in the 2016-17 season, according to her website.</p><p>She won gold medals in the sprint and pursuit races at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea in 2018 and the bronze medal in the individual competition.</p><p>Dahlmeier ended her biathlon career in 2019, when she was 25. She grew up in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the German Alps and turned to mountaineering challenges after ending her biathlon career. She had been a state-certified mountain and ski guide since 2023 and volunteered for the Garmisch-Partenkirchen mountain rescue team.</p><p>Hundreds of climbers try to scale mountains in northern Pakistan every year, and accidents are common because of avalanches and sudden weather changes.</p><p>The region has also been battered by above-normal seasonal rains, triggering flash floods and landslides. Since last week, at least 20 Pakistani tourists have been missing after floodwaters swept them away near the northern district of Chilas.</p></div></div></body></html>"
