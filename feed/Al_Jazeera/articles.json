A ceasefire was agreed on November 27, 2024, but since then, Israel has killed more than 300 people, including at least 127 civilians, according to the United Nations. The talks come as Israel continues to attack Lebanon on a <a href=\"/tag/israel-lebanon/\">near-daily basis</a> and threatens to <a href=\"/features/2025/11/27/beirut-attacks-leaves-lebanon-worried-and-waiting-for-another-israeli-war\">expand</a> its war on the country.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about the talks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-is-meeting\">Who is meeting?</h2><p>A special committee of representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon, and the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, which is based in Naqoura.</p><p>The committee is chaired by a US general and was originally composed of military officials. But due to Israeli pressure, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun appointed Simon Karam, a Lebanese diplomat, to participate earlier this month.</p><p>Israel reportedly wants the inclusion of civilians to discuss nonmilitary issues, such as plans for potential economic cooperation.</p><p>Israel also appointed a civilian representative from its National Security Council, Uri Resnick, and the meeting was also attended by US Special Representative for Lebanon Morgan Ortagus.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-goal\">What is the goal?</h2><p>The committee’s plan of action is to monitor the ceasefire agreed last year.</p><p>The terms of the ceasefire were left relatively undefined, but it was widely assumed that attacks from both sides would cease, the Lebanese army would disarm Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and that Israel would withdraw its troops from its northern neighbour.</p><p>Officials say Lebanon has largely met its side of the bargain. Speaking at a conference in Beirut on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Mitri said the army’s task of disarming Hezbollah below the Litani River, which runs across southern Lebanon, was nearly completed, apart from the places where Israel still occupies Lebanese land.</p><p>However, Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/2/9/heres-how-israel-is-repeatedly-violating-the-lebanon-ceasefire\">violated</a> the ceasefire repeatedly and continues to occupy five locations in southern Lebanon.</p><p>“The main task of the mechanism is to oversee and verify and do everything possible to respect the agreement,” Mitri said.</p><p>Lebanon has been “strictly observing” the ceasefire agreement since day one, but that is not the case for Israel, he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-outcome-of-the-last-meeting\">What was the outcome of the last meeting?</h2><p>The members of the so-called mechanism met in Naqoura, south Lebanon, on December 3. The meeting was reportedly positive.</p><p>The inclusion of civilians “reflects the Mechanism’s commitment to facilitating political and military discussions with the aim of achieving security, stability, and a durable peace for all communities affected by the conflict”, the US embassy said in a statement about the meeting</p><p>The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement that emphasised potential future economic agreement between his country and Lebanon. However, analysts believe that is a far-fetched proposition considering Israel is still occupying territory in southern Lebanon, and more than 88,000 Lebanese are still displaced from their homes in the region.</p><p>Despite the alleged positivity of the meeting, Israel <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/4/another-devastating-israeli-strike-on-lebanon-captured-on-video\">attacked</a> Lebanon the very next day.</p><h2 id=\"is-normalisation-on-the-agenda\">Is normalisation on the agenda?</h2><p>From the Lebanese side, no. Normalising relations with Israel after a war that killed thousands, including many civilians, would anger a large segment of the population.</p><p>But there has been US and Israeli pressure to find a peace agreement and to move towards normalisation.</p><p>The mechanism meeting is also a place for other bilateral discussions between Israel and Lebanon, which do not have direct relations.</p><p>On the Lebanese side, border delineation is a priority. On the Israeli side, a <a href=\"/features/2025/9/1/will-us-backed-economic-zone-incentivise-lebanon-to-disarm-hezbollah\">US-backed economic zone</a> is high on the agenda.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-if-israel-is-unhappy-with-the-talks-will-it-launch-a-war\">So if Israel is unhappy with the talks, will it launch a war?</h2><p>That is still unclear.</p><p>Israel has claimed Hezbollah is rearming, though analysts say the group is not an <a href=\"/features/2025/9/28/after-war-with-israel-how-is-lebanons-hezbollah-regrouping\">existential threat</a> to Israel. The group, long the political and military hegemon in Lebanon, was badly weakened during last year’s war with Israel. Much of its senior military leadership was assassinated, including its longtime leader <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>With Hezbollah weakened, some analysts believe Israel’s decision will be based on internal Israeli politics and dependent on international pressure on Israel.</p><p>Officials from the US, Saudi Arabia, and France met the head of the Lebanese army in Paris on Thursday in an effort to coordinate positions and possibly avoid an Israeli intensification in Lebanon. They also agreed to document the Lebanese military’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah, according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-hezbollah-in-all-of-this\">Where is Hezbollah in all of this?</h2><p>Publicly, it has refused the Lebanese government’s plans for full disarmament.</p><p>The group says Israel’s behaviour – continuing to attack and occupy Lebanese territory – justifies its position.</p><p>But how it will respond should the ceasefire move forward is yet to be seen. In the proposed second phase, the Lebanese army would start to dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure between the Litani and Awali Rivers – the area between Sidon in the south, and Beirut, roughly in the middle of Lebanon.</p><p>Hezbollah has been militarily and politically weakened since last year’s war. But while analysts and diplomats have told Al Jazeera that they do not believe the group is strong enough to pose a threat to Israel, it could still cause problems domestically if it feels that it is being cornered.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Even during World War II, German state assets were not seized, analysts note.</p><p>Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever told parliament on Thursday that he remained deeply concerned about the legal and financial risks, having previously opposed the measures over fears Belgium could be forced to compensate Russia if courts later rule the use of the frozen assets is unlawful.</p><p>Belgium is demanding binding commitments from other EU states to cover all potential liabilities, and wants assurances that Russian assets held outside Belgium would also be used.</p><p>The majority of frozen Russian assets in Europe – about $185bn – are held by Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial services company.</p><p>Some countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have said they are prepared to back up the loan, while others, such as Italy and Bulgaria, remain hesitant.</p><p>Although the plan requires only a qualified majority rather than unanimity, EU officials are keen to secure Belgium’s support. A Belgian vote against the proposal would be politically damaging, given Brussels’s role as the EU’s institutional centre.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"risk-of-antagonising-russia\">Risk of antagonising Russia</h2><p>Russia’s central bank said on Thursday it would sue European banks in Russian courts over any attempt to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine.</p><p>Chris Weafer, chief executive of the consultancy Macro-Advisory, told Al Jazeera that Moscow would likely see such a move as the start of a financial war with the EU.</p><p>“Moscow is now drawing a line on this issue,” Weafer said, adding that Russia would likely “retaliate based on what Europe does”.</p><p>Russia’s central bank has already launched legal proceedings against Euroclear, which holds most of the frozen assets, as well as against institutions in France, Austria and the United Kingdom, Weafer said.</p><p>He added that the EU was unlikely to proceed without Belgium’s backing and that many EU states were increasingly reluctant or financially unable to continue funding Ukraine directly.</p><p>“So the EU is desperately looking for an alternative source of money,” Weafer said.</p><h2 id=\"attacks-continue-along-the-front-line\">Attacks continue along the front line</h2><p>Inside Ukraine, Russian forces carried out attacks across multiple regions, injuring dozens of people, including in Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhia, Cherkasy and Odesa regions.</p><p>In Russia, three people – including two crew members of a cargo vessel – were killed in Ukrainian drone attacks on the port of Rostov-on-Don and the nearby town of Bataysk, according to the regional governor.</p><p>Russia shelled Ukraine’s Donetsk region 18 times, killing three residents, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.</p><p>Ukraine’s acting Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said Russian attacks overnight cut electricity supplies in five regions, affecting about 180,000 people.</p><p>Ukrainian shelling in Russian-occupied Kherson killed a 72-year-old woman and injured six others, according to regional Governor Volodymyr Saldo.</p><p>Heavy ground and air fighting continues across eastern Ukraine, including around Kupiansk, Lyman and Sloviansk.</p><p>Ukraine said it shot down 330 drones during what it described as major Russian air attacks, while Russia said its air defences intercepted 47 Ukrainian drones overnight.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The US Senate voted overwhelmingly to approve its annual defence budget on Wednesday, authorising <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/us-senate-passes-901bn-defence-bill\">$901bn</a> in military spending while also pressing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to hand over video footage of military strikes on suspected drug-running boats in international waters close to Venezuela.</p><p>The fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes a 3.8 percent pay rise for service members, advanced through Congress with broad support from both parties. Senators approved the bill 77–20 on Wednesday, as lawmakers prepared to leave Washington for a holiday recess. It will now go to Trump for signature.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But the more than 3,000-page-long bill also imposed some constraints on the Trump administration’s deployment of the military. In addition to demanding more information about maritime strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, the bill locks in current US troop numbers in Europe and sets out new allocations for specific forms of military assistance to Ukraine, as demanded by Democrats who want greater oversight of military affairs and assurance of support for Ukraine.</p><p>The bill reflects a negotiated middle ground, therefore, shaped by rare areas of agreement between Republicans and Democrats on defence priorities. It enacts many of Trump’s executive actions, including proposals to <a href=\"/news/2025/1/23/what-do-trumps-executive-orders-on-workplace-diversity-programmes-say/%5d\">dismantle diversity and inclusion initiatives</a> within the armed forces, but also strengthens congressional scrutiny of the Department of Defense.</p><h2 id=\"were-there-to-the-bill\">What objections were there to the bill?</h2><p>Despite its passage, the expansive bill drew criticism from representatives of both parties. Two Republicans – Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee – and 18 Democrats voted against it.</p><p>They raised specific concerns over a provision that allows military aircraft to fly without transmitting precise location data – a practice that was used by an Army helicopter during a January <a href=\"/news/2025/1/30/plane-collides-with-helicopter-mid-air-in-washington-dc\">midair collision</a> with a commercial plane over Washington, DC, which killed 67 people.</p><p>“The special carve-out was exactly what caused the January 29 crash that claimed 67 lives,” Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, said during a news conference this week.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Cruz said he plans to push for a bipartisan vote next month on legislation that would require military aircraft to use exact location-sharing technology and enhance coordination with commercial aviation in congested airspace.</p><p>Elsewhere, the NDAA does not include funding to pay for a name change from the Department of Defense to the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/trump-symbolically-changes-department-of-defense-to-department-of-war\">Department of War</a>, something Trump has said he wants but cannot formally do without congressional approval.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-the-democrats-demand\">What did the Democrats demand?</h2><p>Many of the Democrats’ concerns relate to Ukraine.</p><p>Democratic lawmakers have been repeatedly blindsided by the Trump administration over the past year, including on decisions to <a href=\"/news/2025/3/5/us-suspends-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine\">suspend intelligence sharing with Ukraine</a> and to scale back US troop deployments in eastern NATO countries.</p><p>However, Democrats managed to ensure that the bill included a requirement for advance notice to Congress of such actions, as well as of the removal of senior military leaders – an area in which Democrats have also sought greater oversight.</p><p>Under the new legislation, the Pentagon must keep at least 76,000 troops and major military assets stationed in Europe, despite the release of Trump’s latest <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">national security strategy</a>, which is viewed by many as overly friendly to Russia and too critical of Europe.</p><p>Typically, between 80,000 and 100,000 US troops are deployed across Europe.</p><p>Congress also approved $400m annually over the next two years to produce weapons for Ukraine. Most of these funds have been earmarked for US weapons manufacturers.</p><h2 id=\"what-demands-did-democrats-make-regarding-venezuela-operations\">What demands did Democrats make regarding Venezuela operations?</h2><p>Since early September, the US has engaged in a series of aerial strikes against suspected Venezuelan drug trafficking operations in the Caribbean Sea. About 90 people have been killed in more than 20 strikes.</p><p>But lawmakers have grown increasingly sceptical about the boat strikes and their legality – many have expressed concern that the operation’s end game is, in fact, to oust Venezuelan President <a href=\"/news/2013/4/3/profile-nicolas-maduro\">Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>Many legal experts say targeting vessels in international waters <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/experts-say-us-boat-strikes-are-illegal-killings-can-they-be-stopped\">likely violates</a> US and international law and amounts to extrajudicial executions.</p><p>On Tuesday, Hegseth visited Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers about the US military operation in international waters near Venezuela. Reactions to the briefing were mixed, with most Republicans supporting the campaign and Democrats voicing unease, arguing they lacked sufficient information.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><span>Representatives from both parties, therefore, agreed to freeze 25 percent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel funds until he submits unedited footage </span>of attacks off the coast of Venezuela – along with strike authorisation orders – to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.</p><p>Admiral Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the Navy officer who ordered a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/trumps-boat-bombings-how-the-us-has-long-used-double-tap-strikes\">“double-tap” strike</a> – a second hit on a boat which had already been destroyed and which killed two survivors in the water in September – testified in a classified session before the committees on Wednesday, which did include video footage of the incident.</p><p>Democrats, however, are demanding that portions of the footage be released publicly and that all members of Congress be granted access to the full video.</p><p>“The American people absolutely need to see this video,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.</p><p>“I think they would be shocked.”</p><h2 id=\"does-this-bill-assuage-democrat-fears-about-a-potential-war\">Does this bill assuage Democrat fears about a potential war?</h2><p>Not really. While the NDAA has strengthened legislative oversight over recent military operations in Venezuela, many lawmakers continue to worry about <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-orders-total-blockade-of-sanctioned-venezuelan-oil-tankers\">growing tensions</a> between Washington and Caracas.</p><p>“The Constitution vests this body with authority over matters of war and peace. That power has too often been ceded to the executive branch,” Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks said on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday.</p><p>“Congress must make clear to all of us that no president can unilaterally draw the United States into a conflict,” he added.</p><p>“It’s easy to get into a war. It’s hard as hell to get out of war,” Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern warned. “I’ve been around long enough to hear representatives of both parties talk about war as something simple, ‘You can get into it. We get out of it easy. No big deal.’ That’s never happened.</p><p>“Even the Pentagon says it will be very, very complicated to topple Maduro,” he said.</p><p>Furthermore, the bill was passed on the same night that a Democrat-led resolution requiring explicit congressional approval for US military action in Venezuela was voted down. Introduced by lawmakers including McGovern and Meeks, the measure reflected concern that Trump’s strikes risk sliding into an undeclared war.</p><p>While the Constitution does give Congress sole authority to declare war, presidents have been known to act under broader authorities. The Democrat bill aimed to close that gap. Its defeat leaves the administration wide latitude to continue operations without new congressional consent, Democrats fear.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
