            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The intensity of the current backlash against Alaa Abdelfattah in Britain is striking – not because it reflects a renewed concern for justice, but because it exposes how selectively outrage is deployed.</p><p>Alaa, an Egyptian-British writer and activist, spent more than a decade in and out of Egyptian prisons following the 2011 uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. His detention was marked by prolonged hunger strikes, denial of basic rights and treatment that human rights organisations described as cruel and degrading. He was <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/egyptian-british-activist-alaa-abd-el-fattah-freed-after-sisi-pardon\">released</a> on September 23 after a years-long campaign by his mother, sister and close friends. A travel ban on him was lifted only this month, and he was able to join his family in the UK on December 26.</p><p>Alaa left behind a decade of repression in Cairo only to be welcomed in London with public attacks and a call for the revocation of his British citizenship and his deportation. Public hostility was whipped up by the uncovering of a social media post from 2010 in which Alaa said he considered “killing any colonialists … heroic”, including Zionists.</p><p>The tweet has been widely condemned, referred to the counter-terrorism police for review, and seized upon by politicians calling for punitive measures.</p><p>The speed and intensity of this reaction stand in stark contrast to the silence surrounding far more consequential statements and actions that the UK not only tolerates but actively enables.</p><p>This is what selective outrage looks like.</p><p>While Alaa’s words are dissected and framed as a moral emergency, the UK continues to host and collaborate with senior Israeli officials who have been accused of participating in and inciting genocide.</p><p>In July, for example, Israel’s air force chief Tomer Bar – the man who has overseen the carpet bombing of Gaza, destruction of hospitals, schools and homes and the extermination of entire families – was granted special legal immunity to visit the UK. Reporting by Declassified UK <a href=\"https://www.declassifieduk.org/israeli-air-force-chief-given-special-immunity-to-visit-britain/\">showed</a> that this immunity shielded him from arrest for war crimes while on British soil.</p><p>There has been no comparable outcry over this.</p><p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog was also able to pay a visit to the UK in September and hold high-level meetings. This is the same man who, at the start of the genocide, suggested that the “entire [Palestinian] nation” is responsible and that “This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved – it’s not true.” This and other statements by Herzog <a href=\"/opinions/2024/1/14/intent-in-the-genocide-case-against-israel-is-not-hard-to-prove\">have been collected</a> in a large database that currently supports the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).</p><p>Yet, despite being accused of incitement to genocide, the Israeli president entered the UK without a problem and was welcomed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Those quarters concerned about Alaa’s tweet displayed no outrage over the visit of a potential war criminal.</p><p>They have also been silent about British citizens who have travelled to serve in the Israeli military, including during Israel’s offensives in Gaza and the ongoing genocide. These operations, documented by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths, the destruction of hospitals and universities, and the devastation of entire neighbourhoods.</p><p>Despite extensive documentation of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the ICJ’s warning of a serious risk of genocide, there has been no systematic investigation into whether British nationals may have been involved in violations of international law.</p><p>Again, there is little sustained outrage.</p><p>At the same time, the UK continues to license arms exports to Israel and to engage in political, military and intelligence cooperation. These policies have persisted even as international bodies have warned of grave humanitarian consequences and potential violations of international law. All of this unfolds with relatively little political cost.</p><p>And yet it is a decade-old tweet – not mass killing, not siege, not the destruction of civilian life on a vast scale, not incitement to genocide – that triggers political panic in the UK.</p><p>This contrast is not incidental. It reveals a hierarchy of outrage in which dissenting voices are policed and punished, and state violence is not, and in which public hostility is directed downward at individuals rather than upward at power. Alaa’s case shows how moral language is deployed selectively – not to restrain impunity, but to manage discomfort.</p><p>This asymmetry corrodes the credibility of the principles the UK claims to uphold. When human rights are defended selectively, they become tools of convenience rather than universal norms. When outrage is loud but inconsistent, it becomes performative. And when accountability is withheld from powerful allies, impunity hardens into policy.</p><p>Those who defend this approach often invoke “quiet diplomacy”, arguing that restraint is more effective than confrontation. Yet there is little evidence that silence has delivered accountability – either for Alaa or for civilians subjected to mass violence in Gaza. In both cases, discretion has functioned less as a strategy than as permission.</p><p>The UK has the tools to act differently: Suspending arms exports, investigating potential crimes by its nationals, conditioning cooperation on respect for international law, restricting visits by officials implicated in serious abuses. That these tools remain largely unused is itself revealing.</p><p>Until that changes, outrage will remain selective, accountability conditional, and impunity intact – widening the gap between the values the UK professes and the violence it continues to enable.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It would also disrupt vital global shipping routes through the Taiwan Strait.</p><p>Alexander Huang, director-general of Taiwan’s Council on Strategic and Wargaming Studies, told Al Jazeera the drills were similar to those held after Pelosi’s visit in August 2022.</p><p>“For this drill, it actually interfered with international civil aviation routes and also maritime shipping routes. In previous drills, they tried to avoid that, but this time they actually disrupted the air and maritime traffic,” he said.</p><p>The drills also put pressure on Taiwan’s maritime and transport links to Kinmen and Matsu islands, which are closer to the Chinese mainland.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"why-did-china-stage-the-exercises-now\">Why did China stage the exercises now?</h2><p>China has a history of holding military exercises to express its anger with Taiwan and its allies, but large-scale exercises have become more frequent since Pelosi’s Taiwan visit.</p><p>Beijing claims Taiwan as a province and has accused the US of interfering in its internal affairs by continuing to sell weapons to Taipei and supporting its “separatist” government led by President William Lai Ching-te.</p><p>Washington does not officially recognise Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China, but it has pledged to help Taipei defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances.</p><p>The Justice Mission 2025 came just days after Washington approved a record-breaking $11.1bn arms sale to Taiwan.</p><p>China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that the drills were a “punitive and deterrent action against separatist forces who seek ‘Taiwan independence’ through military build-up, and a necessary move to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Beijing <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/china-sanctions-30-us-firms-individuals-over-taiwan-weapons-sales\">sanctioned 30 US firms and individuals</a> over the arms sale.</p><p>Experts also say the exercises were linked to a separate but related diplomatic row between China and Japan.</p><p>Beijing was angered in November by remarks from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi that an attack on Taiwan would be a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan. Such a scenario would legally permit Japan to exercise its “right of collective self-defence” and deploy its military, she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203185\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203185\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203185\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-30T012929Z_1402405084_RC2OQIATOZLA_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-TAIWAN-DRILLS-1767075644.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='A display screen shows information on cancelled flights at Taipei Songshan Airport, as China conducts \"Justice Mission 2025\" military drills around Taiwan, in Taipei, Taiwan, December 30, 2025.

He wrote poetry when he was a teenager, studied literature at university in Kharkiv, and joined the local Zolochiv newspaper at age 20. At 31, he stepped away to work for the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, where he investigated corruption in the district. Ten years later, he returned to the weekly.</p><p>“I can’t imagine doing anything other than journalism,” he says.</p><p>Vassyl is proud that his newspaper was among the first to be de-nationalised in 2017. He helped draft the legislation that allowed Ukrainian local newspapers to be privatised, a step he saw as essential to reducing state pressure and safeguarding editorial independence.</p><p>Throughout the war, he has continued to investigate local political corruption, though he acknowledges that much of his focus has shifted to the war.</p><p>“Russia feeds on our internal divisions. Even if holding our own authorities to account remains part of the job, currently, my priority is to counter the enemy’s lies,” he says.</p><p>The fight against Russian disinformation has put his life at risk more than once.</p><p>On April 5, 2022, at 9:30am, two Russian shells hit the weekly's newsroom, partially destroying the 140-year-old building that housed it. Vassyl would normally have been sitting at his desk at the time, but he was spared because he stayed in bed longer than usual that day.</p><p>“I was running late to work ... The night before, we partied with one of my friends and drank a lot of terrible vodka,” he says with a dark laugh. “It is a time of war. The quality of the alcohol is very bad, but this is all we had.</p><p>“That’s what saved me. I usually wake up early, but I was hungover.”</p><p>When he finally got moving and was walking with a friend, two shells passed overhead.</p><p>\"Half a second later, everything exploded.”</p><p>Luckily, nobody was in the newsroom at the time. Vassyl’s old desk is still covered in debris more than three years later, and he knows he had a lucky escape.</p><p>“Given the shrapnel marks in the room, I would have been dead,” he says.</p><p>His newsroom has been targeted 10 times — twice with artillery, eight times with guided aerial bombs — with the latest strike hitting in spring 2025.</p><p>At the beginning of the war, Kremlin news outlets claimed that Vassyl was responsible for spreading disinformation.</p><p>“Apparently, I run a propaganda outlet,” Vassyl says ironically. “In 2022, Russian state television aired a report accusing me of illegally entering one of their villages to spread false information.</p><p>“I have never been there. What I have done, since the start of the war, is document missile remnants embedded in the ground to show where they came from.”</p><p>Tracing the origins of missile remnants could expose Russian attacks as war crimes or violations of international law.</p><p>“This work is the reason why my newsroom has been targeted,” Vassyl says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4154154\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4154154\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4154154\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/273A6607-1765002367.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine newspaper\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4154154\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kostyantyn Neoneta, the newspaper's accountant, delivers the weekly edition in Zolochiv, far from first-person view (FPV) drones near the Russian border [Louis Lemaire/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Following the 2022 invasion and the bombing of its printing press in Kharkiv, the newspaper ceased publication for nearly half a year. Russian forces were closing in, prompting many from Zolochiv to flee to safer areas, at least temporarily. But Vassyl chose to remain.</p><p>“I had to stay and bear witness, but I couldn't do it if my loved ones were also in danger,” he says, explaining how he sent his family to western Ukraine and then began documenting the destruction engulfing his hometown.</p><p>At the time, enemy forces were less than 10km (6.2 miles) away. With his phone, he filmed bombings, civilian evacuations and shattered buildings.</p><p>“If I didn’t film what I was seeing with my own eyes, who would have done it? We live in very remote areas. I had to show the world what was happening to us.”</p><p>Vassyl taught himself how to edit videos, which he posted on YouTube and social media to reach more people.</p><p>“The Russians were claiming they were striking command posts or tank repair facilities,” he says, still outraged. “In reality, they were hitting residential buildings, the hospital and a kindergarten.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4154149\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4154149\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4154149\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/273A6557-1765002348.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine newspaper\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4154149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kostyantyn delivers the newspaper in Zolochiv [Louis Lemaire/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>When the Ukrainian army began liberating the first villages near Zolochiv, Vassyl became determined to restore access to news in areas that had been deprived of it for six months. He found a new printing press and got to work.</p><p>“In these rural areas, there is often no alternative source for reliable information. People trust us, and we cannot walk away from that,” he says proudly.</p><p>Two members of the newsroom returned to work remotely, while Kostyantyn Neoneta, the newspaper’s accountant, remained in Zolochiv like Vassyl.</p><p>“I didn’t want to leave,” says Kostyantyn, who distributes the newspaper in the town every week by bicycle. “I knew I was far more useful here than in other cities.”</p><p>In those villages where Russian signals bleed into people’s homes, “people are left with propaganda,” Vassyl says, adding, “My mission is to make sure it does not happen.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

December 30:</p><h2 id=\"alleged-attack-on-putin-s-residence\">Alleged attack on Putin’s residence</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said that an <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/kyiv-rejects-russias-claim-of-ukrainian-strike-on-putins-residence\">attack took place</a> on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s residence in northwestern Russia’s Novgorod on Sunday, “practically immediately after” talks in Florida between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</li>\n<li>The strike “will not go unanswered”, Ushakov said in remarks reported by Russian media, following a call between Trump and Putin.</li>\n<li>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russian air defence systems shot down 91 long-range strike drones used in the attack and that no one was injured.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/29/zelenskyy-denies-russian-claim-of-ukrainian-strike-on-putin-residence\">denied the claim</a>, accusing Russia of trying to derail peace talks.</li>\n<li>However, Trump expressed anger over the alleged attack, telling reporters: “I was very angry about it.” When asked if the United States had evidence of the attack, Trump said, “We’ll find out.”</li>\n<li>Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that “the response to Kyiv’s attacks will not be diplomatic” and that Russia would be revising its negotiating position in the attack’s wake.</li>\n<li>The United Arab Emirates’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it “strongly condemned” the “deplorable attack” and “the threat it poses to security and stability”.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"diplomacy\">Diplomacy</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that a phone call between Putin and Trump on the issue of Ukraine on Monday was “positive”, without elaborating.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he spoke by phone with the leaders of Germany, Latvia and Finland to update them on the outcomes of his meeting with Trump and where peace negotiations stood.</li>\n<li>Lavrov said in an interview with Russian news agency RIA Novosti that “Kyiv and its Western backers must recognise the new territorial realities that have emerged following the incorporation of Crimea, Sevastopol, the Donetsk People’s Republic, the  Luhansk People’s Republic, and the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions into the Russian Federation.” He was referring to the Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions that Moscow claims to have annexed, which include Donetsk and Luhansk, renamed by Russian-backed separatists as the DPR and LPR.</li>\n<li>A survey published by the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation (DIF), a Ukrainian think tank, on Monday showed that recognising occupied Ukrainian territories “as part of the Russian Federation” remained deeply unpopular in Ukraine, with 76 percent of Ukrainians saying they considered it “unacceptable”.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"fighting\">Fighting</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russian forces attacked the front-line town of Orikhiv in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, killing a 46-year-old man and wounding a 49-year-old woman, Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Russian forces killed one person and injured five in attacks on Ukraine’s Donetsk region on Sunday, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, said on Telegram that Russian forces killed seven civilians who had been hiding in a basement in the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said it had launched an investigation into reports that Russian soldiers shot dead two captured Ukrainian soldiers in the village of Shakhove, Pokrovsky, on Saturday.</li>\n<li>“The deliberate killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and qualifies as a grave international crime,” the prosecutor general’s office said.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian attacks injured five civilians in Russia’s Belgorod region, according to Russia’s TASS state news agency, citing local officials.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian attacks also injured four civilians in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian region of Zaporizhia, and three civilians in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian region of Donetsk, TASS reported, citing local officials.</li>\n<li>In a televised address from the Kremlin, Putin made a wide range of claims about Moscow’s ongoing war on Ukraine, including that Russian troops were advancing towards the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia.</li>\n<li>General Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s army chief, said during the same address that Russian forces had captured 6,460 square kilometres (2,494sq miles) of territory in Ukraine in 2025, including 334 villages.</li>\n<li>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) quoted its director general, Rafael Grossi, as saying that power line repairs near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant had been successfully completed.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

We need leadership now.”</p><p>The calls for an inquiry into anti-Semitism came as Albanese on Monday announced the terms of an independent review into whether law enforcement and intelligence agencies could have done more to prevent the attack.</p><p>Albanese and his government colleagues have resisted calls for a public inquiry into the attack, arguing that such a process would take years and could undermine social cohesion by platforming extremist voices.</p><p>Albanese told a news conference that the review, led by former intelligence chief Dennis Richardson, would examine what authorities knew about the suspected gunmen before the attack and information sharing between federal and state agencies, among other issues.</p><p>“Just over two weeks ago, anti-Semitic terrorists tried to tear our country apart, but our country is stronger than these cowards,” Albanese said.</p><p>“They went to Bondi Beach to unleash mass murder against our Jewish community. We need to respond with unity and urgency rather than division and delay.”</p><p>Anti-Jewish sentiment, as well as anti-Islam and anti-immigration sentiment, are rising in Australia. Many Australians have expressed their concerns over a rise in right-wing extremism in the country, where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas.</p><p>In September, thousands of people held rallies in cities, including Sydney, Perth, Canberra and Brisbane, demanding an end to “mass migration”.</p><p>The Australian government has condemned the rallies, which took place under the banner of “March for Australia”, as racist, while Minister for Multicultural Affairs Anne Aly said the gatherings were “organised by Nazis”.</p><p>The group behind “March for Australia” said on its website and social media that “mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together” and that its rallies aimed to do “what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration”.</p><p>But Australia also experienced a sharp rise in both anti-Semitic and Islamophobic incidents since October 7, 2023.</p><p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, which supports the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, documented 1,654 anti-Jewish incidents nationwide between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025, after more than 2,060 incidents the previous year.</p><p>The Islamophobia Register Australia recorded 309 in-person incidents of Islamophobia and 366 online incidents between January 1, 2023 and November 31, 2024.</p><p>Numerous rights organisations, including some Jewish groups, have criticised the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, arguing that it has been used to conflate legitimate criticism of Israel – particularly of its genocidal war on Gaza – with anti-Jewish bigotry.</p><p>One of Albanese’s highest-profile critics in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – he blamed Albanese’s government for failing to protect Australia’s Jewish community and also linked the shooting to Australia’s recent decision to <a href=\"/news/2025/9/21/canada-australia-join-uk-in-recognising-palestinian-statehood\">recognise Palestinian statehood</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Tipu has since spent his days on the pavement opposite the hospital gate, promising to stay put until he receives news of her recovery.</p><p>“She is like my mother. She sacrificed everything for democracy,” he told Al Jazeera. “My only prayer is that God allows her to see the upcoming election,” he added, referring to the national elections scheduled for February 12.</p><p>But it was not to be. Early in the morning, on December 30, the 79-year-old Khaleda passed away in hospital, her party announced.</p><p>“Our beloved national leader is no longer with us.

While Khaleda, unlike Hasina, was never accused of carrying out mass atrocities against critics, she was also a polarising figure.

Rahman – who had stabilised the country after years of coups and counter-coups – left behind a fragile political order and a governing party, the BNP, that was suddenly without its founder.</p><p>Although Khaleda had not been politically active during her husband’s presidency, senior BNP leaders saw her as the only figure who could unify the party’s competing factions and preserve Rahman’s legacy.</p><p>After Rahman’s death, Vice President Abdus Sattar became acting president and later won an election. But within months, army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in March 1982, imposing martial law. It was in this volatile context – with the military back in control and political parties fighting for survival – that Khaleda began her ascent, eventually emerging as a central civilian figure challenging hardline rule.</p><p>Khaleda joined the BNP as a general member in January 1982, became its vice chair in 1983, and was elected party chairperson in August 1984. In the decades that followed, she would win three elections to become prime minister in a political landscape that she dominated alongside her longtime rival, Sheikh Hasina, and her Awami League party.</p><p>Her public life unfolded alongside personal struggles: her elder son, Tarique Rahman, went into exile in 2008 after being arrested during a military-backed caretaker government’s anticorruption drive; her younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko, died of cardiac arrest in 2015 while living abroad. Khaleda herself later spent long periods in prison after her 2018 convictions in corruption cases brought under the Awami League government, followed by years of political isolation and deteriorating health.</p><p>Tarique eventually returned to Dhaka on December 25, after the cases against him were dropped by the interim government of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took office after Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>“Her [Khaleda’s] entire life was filled with hardship, yet she chose her country over personal comfort,” said Dilara Choudhury, a political scientist who observed both Khaleda and her husband closely. “That is why she is remembered across political lines as one of the most emblematic leaders of her time.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203068\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203068\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203068 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1996-02-13T120000Z_1761746045_PBEAHUMSTEL_RTRMADP_3_ZIA-1767066438.jpg?resize=770%2C518&amp;quality=80\" alt='Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia speaks to reporters from below an Islamic inscription in Arabic reads \"God is one and Mohamad is his prophet\" February 13 in Dhaka.

She married army officer Rahman in 1960, when she was about 15, long before he emerged as a national figure.</p><p>Rahman rose to prominence after Bangladesh’s 1971 independence war, later assuming the presidency in 1977 and founding the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1978. Zia would later inherit her husband’s politics – centred on nationalism, multi-party democracy and a market-oriented economy.</p><p>From 1978 to 1981, she lived with her family in a modest military residence at 6 Moinul Road in Dhaka Cantonment, then designated as the residence of the deputy chief of the army, where then-Captain (later Colonel) Harunur Rashid Khan served as an aide-de-camp to her husband, President Rahman.</p><p>“She coordinated the house herself, welcomed guests and managed family matters,” Colonel Khan told Al Jazeera. “I never saw her raise her voice. She was humble, kind and thoughtful.”</p><p>He recalled her calm approach to parenting. When her younger son, Arafat, then aged 7, struggled to gain admission to a school, she asked only for other alternative school options. And when the boy later injured himself imitating a television stunt, she expressed no anger towards the staff who were supposed to be minding him.</p><p>“That was the kind of person she was,” Khan said. “Graceful, composed and considerate.”</p><p>But everything changed on May 30, 1981.</p><p>At dawn that day, Khan learned that Rahman had been assassinated in the port city of Chattogram, in an attempted coup by a group of army officers. The coup would eventually be crushed by Ershad, Rahman’s army chief, though Ershad would himself grab power months later.</p><p>“For a moment [after learning of the assassination], I felt the ground slip beneath my feet; but I did not share the information with Madam [Begum Zia] for moments,” Khan said.</p><p>Fearing that the family residence might be the next target, he immediately ordered an entire company of about 120 soldiers to be ready to defend the family.</p><p>In the early morning, the two boys came out of their bedrooms, preparing to leave for school, but Khan stopped them. Minutes later, Khaleda stepped out of her bedroom. “She asked me, ‘What has happened?’ I told her there was unrest outside,” he said.</p><p>Without asking anything else, she retreated to her bedroom as a member of the house staff switched on the radio, and the announcement of her husband’s death filled the room.</p><p>“She stepped back, looked at my eyes, and she understood,” the former aide-de-camp said. “She sank into the floor.”</p><p>Khan remained to support the family for two more months. “She was mentally shattered,” he said.</p><p>As Rahman had left no other personal residence for his family, the government later permanently allocated the house at 6 Moinul Road to Khaleda, and she lived there until she was evicted in 2010 by Hasina’s administration.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203072\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203072\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203072 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1995-06-16T120000Z_700472488_PBEAHUNBVDF_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-1767066566.jpg?resize=770%2C563&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia (L) and Finance Minister Saifur Rahman discuss Bangladesh's 1995/96 budget placed in parliament June 15.

After taking over as president, the army chief suspended the constitution and imposed martial law.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s, the BNP and the Awami League – the two largest political parties – led parallel but often coordinated street movements calling for the restoration of parliamentary democracy.</p><p>According to Choudhury, the political scientist, a key turning point arrived in 1986, when Ershad announced a national election that the opposition denounced as unconstitutional, because martial law remained in force and political freedoms were restricted. While the Awami League eventually chose to contest the polls, the BNP, under Khaleda’s stewardship, boycotted the election.</p><p>“Her decision to boycott the 1986 election – which she denounced as illegal even as the Awami League participated – reinforced her public image as someone unwilling to trade principle for expediency,” Choudhury said.</p><p>Repeated house arrests under the Ershad regime cemented this perception. “Khaleda Zia was unwavering in her objective to remove Ershad and restore democracy,” Choudhury said. “Her readiness to endure arrest, even in ill health, earned her respect.”</p><p>The 1991 election – the first after the end of military government in December 1990 – produced a hung parliament. The BNP won 140 seats, short of the 151 needed to form a government. The Awami League won 88 seats, the Jatiya Party 35 and Jamaat-e-Islami 18.</p><p>Jamaat chief Ghulam Azam opened negotiations with Hasina. Meanwhile, Golam Wahed Choudhury, the husband of Dilara Choudhury and a former minister of communications of undivided Pakistan, arranged a discreet meeting at his Dhaka residence, bringing together Khaleda, Jamaat leaders Ghulam Azam and Motiur Rahman Nizami, and the army chief, Lieutenant General Nuruddin.</p><p>Khaleda arrived alone, without informing other BNP leaders. The negotiations ultimately paved the way to allow Bangladeshi citizenship for two very contrasting political figures.</p><p>Jamaat chief Azam, who had supported Pakistan during the war of independence, had previously been stripped of his citizenship as a result. Kader Siddique, a prominent 1971 war hero aligned with the Awami League’s political legacy, had been in exile in India after leading his private militia against the government and military following the 1975 assassination of Hasina’s husband, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – the leader of the country’s independence struggle and its first prime minister and president.</p><p>In return, Jamaat agreed to back the BNP in parliament, giving Khaleda the numbers needed to form a government.</p><p>“This negotiation showed her political prudence and firmness,” Choudhury said. “It could easily have failed.”</p><p>Khaleda was sworn in as Bangladesh’s first elected female prime minister, joining a line of South Asian women who had already held the region’s highest offices, including Indira Gandhi, Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Benazir Bhutto.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203074 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1997-10-07T120000Z_1945019786_PBEAHUMPXBI_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-1767066707.jpg?resize=770%2C499&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Workers produce export quality garments at a Bangladesh factory in Dhaka October 6.

She succeeded in many areas.”</p><p>Supporters credit Khaleda’s government with policies aimed at stabilising a state emerging from years of hardline government. Her administration pursued economic liberalisation, export-led growth, revival of industry, expansion of the garment sector, and wider access to education – particularly for girls. Her tenure also coincided with the expansion of a relatively free press.</p><p>When her last elected term ended in 2006, Bangladesh’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate stood at about 7 percent – one of the highest in the country’s post-independence history and well above the average of roughly 4.8 percent in the 1990s, as well as about 3.8 percent in the 1980s. At that time, the World Bank described Bangladesh as “Asia’s next tiger economy”.</p><p>Her administrations, however, drew criticism, too.</p><p>In 1995, an acute fertiliser shortage and a resulting sharp increase in prices – driven by hoarding and distribution failures at a crucial time for the winter paddy crop – led to protests by thousands of farmers. Police opened fire in several districts: At least a dozen farmers and one officer died in clashes, an incident that damaged her government’s reputation amid widespread rural frustration.</p><p>During her 2001–2006 term, critics accused her elder son, Tarique, of building an alleged parallel centre of influence around his political office, widely known as Hawa Bhaban.</p><p>Allegations of corruption and claims that key decisions were being influenced through this parallel structure fuelled persistent questions about governance under her watch.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203078\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203078\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203078 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2006-10-28T000000Z_177212197_GM1DTUXWEYAA_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-POLITICS-1767066909.jpg?resize=770%2C532&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh's Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia addresses a Bangladesh Nationalist Party rally in Dhaka October 28, 2006.

A 1994 by-election in the Magura-2 parliamentary constituency was widely criticised as having been manipulated to benefit the BNP. Later, towards the end of her 2001–06 term, Zia was accused of trying to install a partisan caretaker government tasked with carrying out the next election.</p><p>Political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed, the author of the book Khaleda – an independent historical account of the former prime minister’s legacy – pointed to other instances that he said hurt her credibility.</p><p>A grenade attack on a rally of Hasina’s then-opposition Awami League on August 21, 2004, in Dhaka, killed at least 24 people and injured hundreds. The investigation under the BNP-led government was widely criticised for failing to promptly pursue credible leads into the role of Islamist armed groups, including Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, which investigators ultimately blamed for the attack.</p><p>A Dhaka court in 2018 convicted several individuals in connection with the attack. However, subsequent appeals and High Court rulings have overturned some convictions and acquitted others. Questions about accountability for the attack remain unresolved for many Bangladeshis.</p><p>In another incident, in April 2004, police and the coastguard intercepted a large consignment of illegal weapons believed to be destined for the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), an armed separatist group in India’s Assam region.</p><p>“These incidents deepened political hostility at home and created significant discomfort in Bangladesh’s relations with neighbouring India,” Ahmed told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Zia’s missteps during her 2001-06 government contributed to the political instability that culminated in a military-backed takeover of power on January 11, 2007.</p><p>The army’s senior leadership then pressed then-President Iajuddin Ahmed to declare a state of emergency, resign as chief adviser of the sitting caretaker government and cancel elections scheduled for later that month. With the army’s backing, former Bangladesh Bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed was appointed chief adviser of a new interim caretaker government tasked with stabilising the country and preparing for future elections.</p><p>The move effectively sidelined both Khaleda and Hasina from front-line politics for nearly two years.</p><p>“Her [Khaleda’s] party created the circumstances [for the events of January 11, 2007], and the party – as well as her family – eventually became the victims of it,” Ahmed said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203083\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203083\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4203083 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-25T124237Z_1166516131_RC2MNIAXK4XY_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-BNP-1767067222.jpg?resize=770%2C518&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman addresses his supporters after his return from London, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 25, 2025.

He was referring to the years of imprisonment, political persecution and sustained pressure endured by her and her family.</p><p>“Right or wrong, she rarely walked back from her stated positions, which we did not see among other contemporary politicians,” Ahmed said, citing her firmness during the anti-Ershad movement and her insistence on elections only under caretaker governments.</p><p>That she became the first woman to occupy the nation’s highest elected office in a socially conservative society traditionally sceptical of female leadership will always also remain a part of her legacy.</p><p>Her refusal to flee the country during crises – whether after January 2007, when her elder son was forced into exile as they faced numerous cases, or when she faced retribution under Hasina – also helped hold the BNP together, say analysts.</p><p>“She could have left, but she chose to stay and face the consequences. That determination set her apart,” Ahmed said.</p><p>The political historian also pointed to Khaleda’s restraint in political language. “Even when she was targeted with harsh propaganda and abusive remarks, she did not respond in that manner.”</p><p>Her message following the fall of Hasina in August 2024 was an example.</p><p>Freed from house arrest on August 6, after student-led protests forced Hasina to flee to India, Khaleda urged her supporters not to pursue retaliation.</p><p>“For many, it was an almost unimaginable moment,” Mohiuddin said. “She avoided inflammatory language even when the political tide turned in her favour.”</p><p>For many everyday Bangladeshis, this trait is central to how she will be remembered. “Both Hasina and Khaleda ruled the country well, but in my opinion, Khaleda did better,” said 77-year-old Nazim Uddin, speaking to Al Jazeera in early December while chatting with friends outside a commercial complex not far from Evercare Hospital.</p><p>But a key question now looms: What awaits the BNP in a post-Khaleda era?</p><p>At the centre of any answer to that question is Khaleda’s only surviving son, Tarique Rahman.</p><p>“Like the Awami League, the BNP has become a one-person-centric party,” political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed said. “With Tarique Rahman’s leadership still untested, the BNP is likely to face a serious leadership crisis.”</p><p>But others disagree.</p><p>Choudhury, the political scientist who knew Khaleda well, said that the BNP would now unite under Tarique. “There will be no division in the party,” she said.</p><p>Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, the former minister under Khaleda, said that he believes Tarique, who has led the party as acting chair since 2018 from exile in the United Kingdom, has already “taken up the torch that his mother carried from his father, Ziaur Rahman”.</p><p>Tarique was greeted with a significant show of support by the party faithful when he returned to Dhaka from exile on Christmas Day, weeks ahead of the national election, in which the BNP is in a close race for poll position with its former ally, the Jamaat-e-Islami.</p><p>In his first comments since returning, Tarique spoke of wanting to build an inclusive Bangladesh. Some experts believe the 60-year-old might also be able to repair ties with India, which have suffered since Hasina’s removal and her decision to flee to New Delhi. Though India and the BNP have traditionally not enjoyed warm ties, with New Delhi preferring Hasina’s Awami League as its partner in Dhaka, both have sent overtures to each other in recent days.</p><p>Now the BNP’s, and Tarique’s, big test awaits: February’s elections will not just determine who leads Bangladesh, but could reveal whether the country trusts Khaleda’s heir to continue her legacy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Asif Nazrul, who holds the law portfolio in the interim government, said Khaleda’s funeral will be held on Wednesday, with funeral prayers to be held in front of parliament after midday prayers, before she is buried alongside her late husband, the assassinated former President Ziaur Rahman.</p><p>Khaleda died at the Evercare Hospital in Dhaka, where she was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/bangladeshs-khaleda-zia-hospitalised-in-very-critical-condition\">admitted</a> on November 23 with symptoms of a lung infection, according to The Daily Star, a Bangladesh news website.</p><p>Her doctors said she had advanced ​cirrhosis ‌of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, and chest ‌and heart ‌problems.</p><p>Khaleda’s death closes a chapter spanning more than three decades during which she and her rival Sheikh Hasina — who were known as the “battling begums” — dominated Bangladeshi politics. Hasina, who was forced from power last year and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/tension-high-as-bangladesh-tribunal-convicts-ex-pm-hasina\">sentenced to death in absentia</a> for her crackdown on student protesters, is now in exile in India.</p><p>Bangladesh’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, expressed his “profound sorrow” at Khaleda’s death in a statement on X.</p><p>He called the three-time prime minister a “symbol of the democratic movement” in Bangladesh and said the “nation has lost a great guardian”.</p><p>“I am deeply saddened and grief-stricken by her death,” he added.</p><p>In a television broadcast to the nation, he acknowledged it was a “deeply emotional” time for the country and appealed for calm.</p><p class=\"p1\">“I humbly appeal to everyone to maintain discipline while observing all forms of mourning, including the funeral prayers. I know you are all deeply emotional at this time.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Shehbaz Sharif also offered their condolences.</p><p>Modi expressed deep sadness in a post on X and said Khaleda’s “important contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, as well as India-Bangladesh relations, will always be remembered”.</p><p>Sharif described Khaleda as a “committed friend of Pakistan” and said his government and the people of Pakistan stand with Bangladesh “in this moment of sorrow”.</p><p>“Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he added.</p><p>Reporting from outside Khaleda’s residence in Dhaka, Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury said, while her health issues had been public knowledge for weeks, Bangladeshis were in shock at the loss of a towering figure in their country’s national life.</p><p>“The nation is in mourning,” he said.</p><p>Thousands had gathered outside the hospital where she died to show their respect, he said.</p><p>“She has always been admired,” he said. “She was at the forefront of the democratic movement.”</p><h2 id=\"first-female-prime-minister\">First female prime minister</h2><p>Khaleda’s legacy, like Hasina’s, remains deeply contested.</p><p>Both women fought for democracy, against authoritarianism. But while Khaleda – unlike Hasina – was never accused of carrying out mass atrocities against critics, she too was known to be a polarising figure.</p><p>Her uncompromising style while in opposition – leading election boycotts and prolonged street movements – combined with recurring allegations of corruption when she was in power, made her a figure who inspired intense loyalty among supporters and equal distrust among her critics.</p><p>Khaleda was born on August 15, 1946, in Dinajpur, then part of India’s East Bengal, now northern Bangladesh. She married army officer Rahman in 1960 when she was about 15. Rahman gained prominence after Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence, later assuming the presidency in 1977 and founding the BNP in 1978.</p><p>Khaleda’s political career began not through ambition, but tragedy.</p><p>Her husband was assassinated in an abortive military coup in 1981, plunging Bangladesh into turmoil. Rahman – who had stabilised the country after years of coups and countercoups – left behind a fragile political order.</p><p>Khaleda, who was then 35 years old and a mother of two, inherited the BNP leadership.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Initially dismissed as a political novice, she proved a formidable opponent, rallying against military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad, and later joining forces with Hasina, the daughter of assassinated independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to remove him in 1990.</p><p>The following year, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election, and Khaleda secured a surprise victory over Hasina with support from the country’s largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami.</p><p>She became only the second woman to lead a democratic government in a predominantly Muslim nation, after Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto three years earlier.</p><h2 id=\"rivalry-with-hasina\">Rivalry with Hasina</h2><p>Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.</p><p>She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but returned five years later with a surprise landslide win.</p><p>But their intractable rivalry fuelled crises, including a standoff in January 2007 that brought military-backed emergency rule. Both women were detained for more than a year.</p><p>Hasina later dominated, ruling from 2008 until her violent overthrow in 2024.</p><p>In 2018, Khaleda, her son Tarique Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up during her last term as prime minister – charges she denounced as part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.</p><p>She ‍was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated. Hasina’s government also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.</p><p>Khaleda was released shortly after Hasina was forced from power.</p><p>Earlier this year, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court acquitted Khaleda and her son in the corruption case. Rahman, who had also been acquitted of charges related to a 2004 grenade attack on Hasina, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/why-bnp-leader-tarique-rahmans-return-to-bangladesh-matters-ahead-of-vote\">returned</a> to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday.</p><p class=\"p1\">Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Khaleda had promised in November to campaign in elections set for February – the first vote since the mass uprising that toppled her archrival last year.</p><p>Rahman will <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/bangladesh-opposition-leader-tarique-rahman-returns-after-17-years-in-exile\">lead the BNP</a> in the February 12 general election and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.</p><p>Rahman had these words to day about his mother: “To many, she was the leader of the nation, an uncompromising leader, the Mother of Democracy, the Mother of Bangladesh.”</p><p>“To me, Khaleda Zia was a tender and loving mother who devoted her entire life to the country and its people. Throughout her life, she stood firm against autocracy, fascism, and domination, leading the struggle for freedom, sovereignty, and the restoration of democracy,” he added.</p><p>“She endured repeated arrests, denial of medical care, and relentless persecution. Yet even in pain, confinement, and uncertainty, she never stopped sheltering her family with courage and compassion. Her resilience was not loud, but it was unbreakable, ” Rahman said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
