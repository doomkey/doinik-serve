The network’s town hall with Erika Kirk — wife of the murdered far-right provocateur Charlie Kirk, saw a 11 percent decline in viewership compared to typical viewership in the same time slot.</p><p>Weiss has also been behind several other missteps in her short tenure at the network thus far. She delayed the airing of a 60 Minutes segment about the notorious CERCOT mega prison in El Salvador. Weiss claimed that the segment, which was already set for air, needed more reporting, which correspondent <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/backlash-after-cbs-pulls-60-minutes-report-on-salvadors-cecot-prison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sharyn Alfonsi criticised, </a>calling it a “political decision” in an email.</p><p>She also oversaw the relaunch of the CBS Evening News with a new host, former CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil, who has been with the network since 2016. The show has gone through five different anchor teams since he joined the network.</p><p>“We put too much weight on the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you,” Dokoupil said in a video promoting his new spot.</p><p>But that was not well received.</p><p>“You wouldn’t want ‘academics and elites’ who have actually studied a subject to outweigh the off-the-cuff opinions of village idiots. This is how we’re seeing the resurgence of measles, and the widespread belief in almost non-existent vote fraud, among many other great leaps backward in the Trump era,” Larry Sabado, director of the Center For Politics at University of Virginia, said in a post on X.</p><p>And that message has not won over viewers either. While CBS has been last place among broadcast evening news programmes for decades, it continues to lose its market share under Weiss. The network’s flagship news show lost more than a million viewers during its inaugural week under the new host compared to the same time the year before.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It comes as the network’s parent company <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/22/paramount-skydance-extends-warner-bros-takeover-bid-offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">continually lobs hostile takeover bids</a> to Warner Bros Discovery, which would include another news network often in the White House’s crosshairs – CNN.</p><p>In December, <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/paramounts-warner-bros-discovery-bid-faces-conflict-of-interest-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ellison visited</a> the White House, as per media reports, and told Trump that Paramount would execute “sweeping changes” if it acquired CNN’s parent company.</p><p>On Wall Street, CBS parent Paramount Skydance is down 2.6 percent in midday trading.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed, and many public facilities were badly damaged. Entire villages have been wiped out by muddy floodwaters.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Indonesia team has followed the story on the ground, hearing firsthand accounts from survivors, as emergency services fight to reach those in need. Weeks after the disaster, the struggle continues. People shelter in flimsy tents, which offer little protection from the extreme heat. Illnesses continue to spread. Survivors and political analysts alike question whether the government’s response has been efficient and coordinated enough.</p><p>Over several weeks, our cameras captured not just the immediate aftermath, but the systemic challenges as well. Intense deforestation, high rates of poverty, and budget cuts all combined to make communities more vulnerable when disaster struck.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 27 Jan 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">27 Jan 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The escalation of state violence in the United States has been unprecedented. In the span of three weeks, two people were shot dead in Minneapolis during “anti-immigration” raids. Both were branded “domestic terrorists”.</p><p>Meanwhile last week, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/us-officers-detain-5-year-old-boy-as-minnesota-immigration-raids-continue\">used five-year-old Liam Ramos</a> as bait to get his asylum-seeking father to come out of their home; the two have now been taken to a detention centre in Texas. The administration calls this – the act of locking up children in mass detention camps – “immigration enforcement”. ICE <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2025/12/17/children-immigration-detention-dilley-ice\">detained</a> at least 3,800 children last year, including 20 babies.</p><p>Across the country, the violence inflicted by ICE is creating a culture of fear within migrant communities.</p><p>I know this fear; I know this violence. These are the fear and violence that have long devastated my birthplace – Palestine. I hope Americans never have to deal with the scale of death, forced disappearances and violence that generations of Palestinians have had to suffer. But under US President Donald Trump, they are already now experiencing the tactics that are so familiar to Palestinian victims of the Israeli military and illegal Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The parallels are impossible to ignore.</p><p>In 2025, 32 people, called “illegals”, died in ICE custody, making it the deadliest year in two decades. They died of seizure, heart failure, stroke, respiratory failure, infectious disease, suicide or neglect. ICE accepted no responsibility for their deaths. In the occupied West Bank, where I was born, Israeli forces and settlers have killed more than 1,100 Palestinians in two years and four months.</p><p>Nearly 75 percent of the 68,440 people ICE detained last year had no criminal record. Thousands of Palestinians are currently being held in Israeli prisons without charge or a trial.</p><p>With the latest killings and kidnapping of US citizens, even people who are “legally” here are now afraid. There is a growing atmosphere of insecurity and anxiety that anyone at anytime can be disappeared or harmed.</p><p>Across the country, ICE violence is depriving children of education and businesses. For example, in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, 30,000 students, nearly 20 percent of district enrolment, were <a href=\"https://www.ms.now/news/charlotte-public-schools-attendance-ice-rcna244619\">absent</a> the week after raids began in 2025, and in Los Angeles, shop owners reported a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-17/immigration-sweep-rattles-l-a-s-fashion-district-deepening-fears-slumping-sales\">significant loss</a> in sales as customers stayed home.</p><p>I know what it feels like to dread passing by armed security personnel who at any moment may shoot you and then call you a “terrorist”. My family members know what it is like to be besieged and stormed; to witness a public execution.</p><p>This type of violence has been the daily reality of Palestinians across historic Palestine long before October 7, 2023. After that day, it has just intensified. Just like in the US, children have also not been spared. Of the 240 Palestinians killed in the occupied West Bank in 2025, 55 were children.</p><p>Just this month, Israeli soldiers killed 14-year-old Mohammed Naasan during a raid on his village. They claimed he was running to them with a rock in his hand.</p><p>The Israeli military routinely fires live ammunition at Palestinian children and justifies it by claiming they were throwing stones. Apparently, a Palestinian child with a rock poses an existential threat to one of the most heavily armed militaries in the world, to soldiers in full body armour shooting from armoured vehicles.</p><p>Palestinian children are regularly used by Israeli soldiers as “human shields” when they raid neighbourhoods; their detention and abuse is often used to put pressure on family members to surrender — just as ICE did with Liam Ramos and his father.</p><p>In Israeli detention, at least 75 Palestinians were <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ohchr-press-release-17sep25/\">killed</a> between October 7, 2023 and August 2025, including 17-year-old <a href=\"https://www.dci-palestine.org/17_year_old_palestinian_child_prisoner_starved_to_death_by_israeli_prison_guards\">Walid Ahmad</a>. In at least 12 cases, detainees <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ohchr-press-release-17sep25/\">died</a> after being beaten or tortured by Israeli security forces.</p><p>The United Nations has documented systematic torture and ill-treatment including repeated beatings, waterboarding, stress positions, and the use of <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/meeting-summaries/2025/11/experts-committee-against-torture-commend-israels-initiative-frontline\">rape</a> and other sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>More than 300 Palestinian children are currently being <a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/statistics/minors_in_custody\">held</a> in military detention as of November 2025. These children are detained indefinitely without charge or trial based on secret evidence that is neither disclosed to them nor to their attorneys.</p><p>Among them was Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American from Florida, who was held for over nine months. Upon his release, he had to be taken to hospital due to his poor condition and malnutrition. Ibrahim told his family he witnessed another teenager die in front of him in detention after being <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/from-hell-to-heaven-american-describes-teen-sons-release-from-israeli-jail\">denied</a> medical attention for scabies and a severe stomach virus.</p><p>The reason why the violence we see in the US is so reminiscent of what happens in the West Bank is because what we face: Security structures shaped by white supremacy and a colonial mindset.</p><p>The Israeli state perceives the Palestinian people as less than human and an immediate threat; that is why, in the Israeli state’s logic, they need to be kept in an apartheid system where they are surveilled, subjugated and eventually forced out.</p><p>Palestinians are murdered for simply being Palestinian, for refusing to leave their ancestral land, for serving as a testament that Palestine was never “without a land without people”.</p><p>In the US, too, the state has decided that there are some people who are less than human and pose an immediate threat. It too has deployed a heavily militarised force to spy on, subjugate and force them out, using technology <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/08/usa-global-tech-made-by-palantir-and-babel-street-pose-surveillance-threats-to-pro-palestine-student-protestors-migrants/\">first tested</a> on Palestinians and imported to America.</p><p>Both repressive systems operate on the same principle that brown bodies and their allies can be detained without cause, shot without consequence, and left to die.</p><p>Of course, we cannot make a full parallel between the violence in the US and in Palestine.</p><p>The Israeli state has expressed through both actions and words a clear intent to fully eliminate the Palestinian people.</p><p>The Palestinians are currently facing a genocide in Gaza and at a slower rate in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Israeli state has a clear project of erasure that seeks to wipe out even the historical records of Palestinian existence.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is clear that today Americans are getting a taste of what Palestinians have experienced for decades: state terror. This is what deploying armed forces who shoot citizens, who use five-year-old children as tactical bait, who let detainees die at unprecedented rates is called. In the United States, in Palestine and wherever power decides that certain lives do not count, the patterns of state terror repeat.</p><p>George Orwell <a href=\"https://www.yellowdogbookshop.com/books/1984-by-george-orwell\">wrote</a> in 1984 that the Party’s final, most essential command was to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. Before he died, his publisher released a <a href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2014/11/george-orwells-final-warning.html\">statement</a>: “The moral to be drawn from this dangerous nightmare situation is a simple one. Don’t let it happen. It depends on you.”</p><p>We are living that nightmare now, watching videos of executions and being told they were self-defence. We must be the ones to fight for change. Everywhere, we must be the ones who take the struggle for freedom into our own hands.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Other board members endorsed the idea of replacing Bangladesh if they refused to play in India.</p><h2 id=\"why-have-pakistan-become-involved-in-this-affair\">Why have Pakistan become involved in this affair?</h2><p>While the controversy has to do with sport, the underlying tensions are deeply political, and the three nations share decades-long fractured ties.</p><p>After the 1947 partition of British India, India emerged as an independent state while a Muslim-majority Pakistan was created with eastern and western wings separated by more than 2,000km (1,300 miles).</p><p>Less than 25 years later, the eastern wing broke away after a bloody war to become Bangladesh. Indian troops played a decisive role in supporting Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh’s founder and Hasina’s father.</p><p>Fast forward to 2024 – the once-close ties between India and Bangladesh were fractured with Hasina’s ouster, and the ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan, previously near rock bottom, improved rapidly.</p><p>So as Bangladesh were locked in negotiations with the ICC, Naqvi, Pakistan’s cricket chief, publicly criticised the governing body.</p><p>“You can’t have double standards,” Naqvi said on Saturday.</p><p>“You can’t say for one country [India] they can do whatever they want and for the others to have to do the complete opposite. That’s why we’ve taken this stand and made clear Bangladesh have had an injustice done to them. They should play in the World Cup. They are a major stakeholder in cricket.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-have-pakistan-reacted-and-what-can-they-do-next\">How have Pakistan reacted, and what can they do next?</h2><p>Within days of the BCCI’s decision to remove Mustafizur from the IPL, the PCB reacted by offering the star Bangladeshi bowler an option to register for the Pakistan Super League, the country’s premier franchise T20 tournament.</p><p>Despite reports in Pakistani media that the PCB may pull out of the T20 World Cup, Naqvi has not indicated that might be the case.</p><p>There has also been speculation that Pakistan may forfeit their match against India on February 15 in Colombo as a symbolic gesture in support of Bangladesh.</p><p>With a final decision expected on Friday or Monday, the ongoing uncertainty could disrupt Pakistan’s preparations for the tournament. They are scheduled to play the tournament’s opening game on February 7 against the Netherlands.</p><p>Ehsan Mani, former chairman of the ICC and the PCB, has warned the PCB against withdrawing from the World Cup.</p><p>“This brings politics into the game, and I have always advocated that the two should be kept strictly separate,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-if-pakistan-withdraws-from-the-t20-world-cup\">What happens if Pakistan withdraws from the T20 World Cup?</h2><p>The rivalry between Pakistan and India on the political pitch has long spilled over onto the cricket field, which has increasingly become a proxy battleground, especially since <span>tensions escalated drastically after a four-day military confrontation between the two neighbours in May.</span></p><p>India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy, which they went on to win unbeaten in the UAE, further strained relations.</p><p>When the teams met again at the Asia Cup in September, Indian players declined to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts. After a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/operation-sindoor-how-cricket-became-latest-india-pakistan-weapon-of-war\">tense final</a>, which India won, the Indian team also refused to accept the trophy from Naqvi, who also heads the Asian Cricket Council.</p><p>Ali Khan, a professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences and author of Cricket in Pakistan: Nation, Identity, and Politics, described Pakistan’s support of Bangladesh as “absolutely the principled stance to take”.</p><p>“If India and Pakistan can both be accommodated in similar situations, then why not another full ICC member [Bangladesh]? It is also important for Pakistan to stand up for the way the ICC is operating now,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Khan cautioned, however, that threatening a boycott was a step too far.</p><p>“It veers towards performative and petty point-scoring then. Pakistan should continue to bring up the inequity within the ICC at every meeting forcefully, persuade and shame others to speak up as well. That requires strong diplomacy rather than chest-thumping.”</p><p>Meanwhile, veteran Indian cricket writer Sharda Ugra said Pakistan’s intervention appeared aimed at building an alliance.</p><p>“If Pakistan does back out of the tournament, it will obviously disappoint the cricket community,” she said.</p><p>Ugra believes Naqvi’s move is aimed at “annoying the ICC and the BCCI and putting them on the back foot”, especially as he is also Pakistan’s interior minister.</p><p>“But if Pakistan pulls out, it could have enormous consequences.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-will-this-controversy-impact-cricket\">How will this controversy impact cricket?</h2><p>Khan argued that while the ICC has taken principled positions in the past, including the reintegration of apartheid-era South Africa, its balance has shifted.</p><p>“Sadly, India’s enormous financial clout in cricket has unbalanced the body so much that it has simply become a mouthpiece for the Indian government with other member nations also responsible for this through their timid acceptance of Indian diktat,” he said.</p><p>Ugra also criticised the England and Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia for their respective silence on the matter.</p><p>“Bangladesh is part of the ICC community and a full member, and these two boards should have played their part in making it more equitable,” she said. “It is like they are all pliant to BCCI and acting as if they have no power.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so, but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,” the bank said in a statement.</p><p>While the lawsuit was filed in his personal capacity, the concept of debanking has long been in the crosshairs of the Trump White House.</p><p>Late last year, the White House launched a high-profile effort targeting the nation’s largest financial institutions, accusing them of closing accounts based on political bias. Within days, Trump signed an executive order restricting banks from denying accounts on those grounds.</p><p>Trump has long framed “debanking” as a systemic effort targeting conservatives. But evidence for this claim is limited.</p><p>A Reuters news agency review of more than 8,000 complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found only 35 related to political or religious reasons, let alone targeting Christians or conservatives specifically.</p><p>The push by banks centres on the use of “reputational risk” as a standard that allows them to weigh the social or political fallout of doing business with a client.</p><p>Critics say this practice makes banks arbiters of morality – freezing, withholding, or closing accounts based not on financial considerations but on social and geopolitical concerns. This approach has pulled financial institutions into the middle of cultural and geopolitical debates.</p><p>While often cast as a partisan issue, data show that Trump’s core base, evangelical Christians, are not the ones typically targeted by debanking efforts.</p><p>A report from the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), a research organisation that looks at the experience of the US Muslim community, found that 27 percent of Muslim Americans and 14 percent of Jewish Americans have faced trouble banking, compared with negligible rates among Christian denominations, especially with Trump’s core base, evangelicals, at 8 percent.</p><p>Overall, 93 percent of Muslim Americans reported experiencing trouble with banking access. In one situation involving Citibank, the New York Chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) accused the financial institution of not opening the account of a Muslim woman because of her husband, whom she wanted to nominate as a beneficiary and who is a Palestinian Muslim. CAIR did not release the name of the woman at the centre of the complaint.</p><p>“It [debanking] is a huge barrier for actually Muslims fulfilling philanthropic goals,” Erum Ikramullah, a senior research project manager at the ISPU, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s a huge barrier for the actual Muslim-based, Muslim-led organisations who are managing relief both domestically and overseas.”</p><p>Between October 2023 and May 2024, <a href=\"/economy/2024/11/29/muslim-charities-face-discrimination-as-palestinians-are-desperate-for-aid\">at least 30 US nonprofits</a> providing humanitarian aid to Gaza have had accounts closed.</p><p>“Muslim Americans and Armenian Americans have faced de-banking on account of their last names,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts who founded the CFPB in 2013, said in a Senate Banking Committee hearing last year.</p><p>But Trump continues to allege that groups like Christians and conservatives are the ones discriminated against.</p><p>Among them include the National Committee for Religious Freedom, led by former Republican Senator and Kansas Governor Sam Brownback. Brownback alleges that Chase closed his account on religious grounds, a claim the bank denies.</p><p>Regardless, the push to take on the problem of debanking is a rare spot of bipartisanship in Washington, with Trump and Warren both agreeing that banks should change their ways.</p><h2 id=\"industry-turmoil\">Industry turmoil</h2><p>A US banking regulator said last month that the nine largest US banks put restrictions on industries that it deems risky, but this has been a long-term issue for several industries.</p><p>Operation Choke Point, under the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama, targeted exploitative industries like payday lenders and arms dealers. The initiative pushed banks to consider entire categories of businesses – and the individuals who worked in them – as reputationally risky, even when that view lagged cultural sentiment.</p><p>In response, Frank Keating, the then-CEO of the American Banking Association, slammed the move in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, saying that the “Justice Department [is] telling bankers to behave like policemen and judges”.</p><p>Ultimately, that scrutiny affected people working in several industries over the last decade, most particularly in adult entertainment, cannabis, and cryptocurrency.</p><p>Within months of the new guidance from the Obama administration, hundreds of adult performers lost access to banking services from Chase Bank. The ability to keep a bank account persisted for adult performers. In 2022, adult performer Alana Evans penned an op-ed for The Daily Beast describing how Wells Fargo closed her account.</p><p>The Free Speech Coalition, an adult industry trade group, found that 63 percent of adult workers have lost access to a bank account because of their work in the legal industry, and nearly 50 percent have been rejected for a loan because of the nature of the profession.</p><p>“I think that when I talk to a lot of people about this issue, or when I’ve talked to even legislators about this, they really can’t believe it, because it’s never been anything that they’ve encountered personally. The idea that a bank could shut off your account because they disagreed with the type of work you do is sort of inconceivable to most people,” Mike Stabile, the director of public policy for the Free Speech Coalition, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The cannabis business has faced similar problems. Over the last decade, both laws and public sentiment around marijuana use have drastically changed. Now, more people use marijuana daily than drink alcohol, and recreational use is legal in 24 states as well as Washington, DC.</p><p>Yet, legitimate businesses that cater to this growing market share and those who work for them have been subject to debanking.</p><p>Kyle Sherman, the CEO and founder of Flowhub, a cannabis payment processing company, testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee last year that his employees are routinely discriminated against in consumer banking. He alleged that one of his employees was denied a mortgage because of what he does for a living, as well as others who have had their personal accounts closed.</p><p>While state laws have shifted on marijuana’s stance, federal laws have not kept up, making it harder for banks to navigate the reputational risk.</p><p>Trump recently eased pressure on the marijuana industry by reclassifying the substance as Schedule III, which means it is less harmful, but it does not change the legality of sale and interstate commerce on the federal level.</p><p>“In some of the states that have recently gone legal with recreational and medical cannabis, the individual entrepreneurs [there] were previously considered outlaws. It is hard for a banker to get over the perception that yesterday, you were an illegal activity, and today, you’re a legal activity,” said Terry Mendez, the CEO of Safe Harbor Financial, a financial services company for the cannabis industry.</p><p>There has been a bigger about-face with regard to the cryptocurrency industry. At first, crypto was seen as a safe haven for illicit transactions because the underlying technology allowed for anonymous transfers, making it difficult for banks to determine which transactions were legitimate and legal and which ones were not.</p><p>As the industry began to move into the mainstream, the challenges were amplified. Exchanges and startups faced debanking or sudden account closures, and even major platforms like Coinbase struggled to maintain reliable banking partners.</p><p>“Historically, banks were kind of more naturally averse to crypto companies, going back to like 2018, to 2020, 2021. Crypto companies would often, when registering for accounts with banks, say that they were software development companies to try and avoid the mention of crypto because of fear of not being able to open a bank account, which, of course, then means it’s harder to make a payroll. It’s hard to take in funds from investors; you can’t pay vendors,” Sid Powell, the CEO of the asset management firm Maple Finance, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>That was not helped by the collapse of FTX, the notorious cryptocurrency exchange, pushing banks to pull back from working with the crypto industry.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Sentiment is shifting now. Under Trump, who has embraced crypto, financial regulators last year withdrew guidance that suggested that banks should be careful when working with the crypto industry. Powell says the executive order could help crypto avoid debanking in the future.</p><p>“It [the executive order] kind of signals to the FDIC and the OCC that they should act in a more balanced way when it comes to crypto companies and crypto startups, instead of taking a more hostile approach, or the approach of kind of lumping everyone in with the worst of the industry, which tended to happen post-FTX,” Powell added.</p><p>Powell was referring to the The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an independent agency created by Congress to maintain stability in the nation’s financial system, and The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent bureau of the US Department of the Treasury, which charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-personal-gripes\">Trump’s personal gripes</h2><p>Trump has also accused <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/5/trump-accuses-banks-of-discriminating-against-his-supporters\">banks of not doing business</a> with him, the primary driver of his interest in the debanking issue.</p><p>Banks can generally refuse to create accounts for potential customers who could be deemed as high risk.</p><p>“The president’s companies have filed [for] bankruptcy repeatedly. There have been years of reporting about financial institutions’ concerns with suspicious financial activity, and the president was found civilly liable for inflating the value of his assets that served as collateral for loans from financial institutions,” Graham Steele, an academic fellow at the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Reuters reported last year that banks gauged Trump as a financial risk due to his plethora of legal challenges after his first term, including the suit brought by E Jean Caroll, which found Trump liable for sexual abuse. He has declared bankruptcy six times.</p><p>He also defaulted on loans totalling hundreds of millions of dollars several times, including a loan to Deutsche Bank. In 2024, a <a href=\"/economy/2024/4/2/trump-posts-one-hundred-seventy-five-million-dollar-bond-to-avoid-asset-seizures\">New York court ruled</a> that the president fraudulently inflated his financial worth by more than $2bn.</p><p>“Notwithstanding the fact that the president is an inherently political figure, a financial institution could reasonably rely on any of these concerns, grounded in financial and legal risks, not ‘political’ beliefs, as a basis for declining to do business with a customer,” Steele said.</p><p>That did not stop the president from <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/5/trump-accuses-banks-of-discriminating-against-his-supporters\">pointing fingers at banking giants</a>, including Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.</p><p>“I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that includes a place called Bank of America,” Trump told the executive during a Q&amp;A session at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last year.</p><p>The Trump family also sued Capital One last March. The lawsuit alleged that it debanked The Trump Organisation after Trump incited an insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, after spreading misinformation alleging that he won the 2020 presidential election even though he had lost by a significant margin.</p><h2 id=\"trump-debanks-liberal-causes\">Trump debanks ‘liberal’ causes</h2><p>Trump’s rhetoric on debanking is among his latest attempts to punish entities for political bias, while actively pushing actions that punish those who have viewpoints that oppose his own.</p><p>Trump has argued that debanking disproportionately targets conservatives and conservative-leaning businesses like firearms manufacturers. His pressure has moved the needle at Citibank. In June, it lifted its ban on banking services to gun sellers and manufacturers, a policy it put in place in 2018 after the shooting in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.</p><p>In March, his administration announced it would shut down a set of climate grants under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund – known as the “green bank” – a $20bn programme created through the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act signed by his predecessor, President Joe Biden, in 2022 to channel financing for climate projects into underinvested regions.</p><p>Environment and Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin justified the decision by citing “misconduct, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud”, allegations he offered without evidence, and forced Citibank, which was holding the fund’s money for nonprofit distribution, to return the funds to the EPA.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The decision faced legal hurdles. But earlier this month, a US court of appeals allowed the Trump administration to continue axing the programme. The 2-1 ruling was decided by two judges appointed by Trump.</p><p>Last year, the White House also pressured companies seeking federal contracts to abandon diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes, which it has long portrayed, without evidence, as undermining merit-based hiring.</p><p>Citigroup, historically one of the most vocal supporters of DEI in the financial services sector, scrapped its programme. Citibank holds multiple federal contracts with agencies including the Department of Defense and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p><p>Bank of America and Wells Fargo followed suit in February, scaling back their initiatives as well, as did many other companies.</p><p>As part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns, the White House has also pressured banks to cut financial services to immigrants. The administration is doing so by trying to cancel the social security numbers of migrants who have legal status in the US, which would essentially cut them off from access to basic financial services, including bank accounts and credit cards, The New York Times reported.</p><p>At the time, Leland Dudek, then the Social Security Administration’s acting commissioner and a Trump administration appointee, said the move to cut access would end their “financial lives”.</p><p>“There’s a real telling disconnect. They are saying, on the one hand, we wanna put a thumb on the scale and ensure that conservative groups are included in the financial system, while actively working to push out liberal coded groups by either freezing them out of the bank accounts when they get government grants, or trying to investigate and potentially bring criminal charges against the payment platform that serves liberal groups,” Steele said.</p><p>Steele questioned if taking on political bias would actually help communities that do not align with the Trump administration’s stated values and conservative viewpoints.</p><p>“I think one of the other concerns here is that a lot of this depends on how the executive order is going to be enforced,” Steele said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The new deal, analysts noted, could give India an edge in several sectors, including textiles, pharmaceuticals, machinery, steel, petroleum products and electrical equipment.</p><p>Overall, the EU is giving India access to 144 services subsectors while India is opening 102 subsectors to the EU, including in the financial, maritime and telecommunications industries.</p><p>On Tuesday, Modi told Indian workers and industry leaders in sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery that “the agreement will prove very helpful for you,” adding that it will not only boost manufacturing in India but will also expand India’s services sector.</p><p>“This free trade agreement will strengthen confidence in India for every business and every investor in the world.

Cars costing more than this will be divided into three categories, each with quotas and separate tariffs.</p><p>Electric vehicles, however, will be excluded from import duty reductions for the first five years to protect investments by domestic Indian electric car manufacturers.</p><p>After that, imports from the EU will be restricted to 160,000 internal combustion engines and 90,000 electric vehicles per year.</p><p>Despite these safeguards, shares in Indian carmakers dipped by about 1.6 percent after the announcement of the trade deal.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4268485\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268485\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4268485\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-26T074224Z_704819240_RC2T8JA45FXW_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-REPUBLICDAY-1769506351.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ursula von der Leyen\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4268485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Modi, von der Leyen and Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh attend the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on January 26, 2026 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-will-the-deal-benefit-the-eu\">How will the deal benefit the EU?</h2><p>Indian tariffs on 30 percent of goods imported from the EU will fall to zero immediately.</p><p>Overall, tariffs on 96.6 percent of EU goods exports to India will be eliminated or reduced, EU officials said.

Under the deal as it stands, India would be allowed to export 1.6 million tonnes of steel to the EU duty-free, but this is only about half what it exports annually at present.</p><p>The EU has not granted India an exemption from its carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which taxes “carbon-intensive” goods – those that require large amounts of energy to produce, such as steel, cement, fertiliser and electricity.</p><p>Only countries that are associated with the EU, such as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland are exempt from these due to their participation in the EU emissions trading system or related agreements. Countries whose emissions-trading systems are linked directly to the EU’s, such as Switzerland, are also exempt.</p><p>However, India will be able to negotiate this if the EU grants flexibility to another country.</p><h2 id=\"how-significant-is-india-eu-trade-now\">How significant is India-EU trade now?</h2><p>The US remains the biggest overall trading partner for both India and the EU.</p><p>However, over the past decade, goods trade between India and the EU has grown substantially, rising from about $74bn in 2020 to $136bn in 2024-2025, making the EU India’s largest goods trading partner.</p><p>India has a favourable trade surplus with the EU of more than $15bn as its exports of $75.85bn outpace imports of $60.68bn.</p><p>EU exports are heavy on machinery, transport equipment and chemicals while India mostly exports chemicals, base metals, mineral products and textiles.</p><p>The two sides hope to increase that to about $200bn by 2030.</p><p>From 2019 to 2024, India-EU trade in services also grew with Indian exports rising from $22.5bn to $44bn while EU exports increased from about $17bn to $34bn. The two mainly trade in business consulting and IT services.</p><p>India is the EU’s ninth largest trading partner, accounting for 2.4 percent of its total trade, compared with 17.3 percent for the US and 14.6 percent for China.</p><p>As of 2024, 931,607 Indians resided in the EU, according to the Indian government.

Half of that is punishment for India’s continued purchase of Russian crude oil, which White House officials said is financing the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>EU tensions with the Trump administration have been building as well, particularly over Trump’s insistence that the US be allowed to buy Greenland, which is a territory of EU member Denmark.</p><p>This month, Trump threatened additional tariffs of 10 percent – rising to 25 percent in June – against eight European countries that had objected to Trump’s demand to buy Greenland. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stated that the island, which is politically part of Europe but is geographically located in North America, is not for sale.</p><p>However, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Trump walked back this threat and said he would not impose tariffs. Instead, he said, constructive talks had laid the basis for a framework of an agreement over Greenland.</p><p>The EU is still subject to up to 15 percent tariffs by the US under an EU-US trade deal signed last year.</p><p>Experts said the finalisation of the India-EU trade agreement has been expedited, in part, in response to this pressure from the Trump administration.</p><p><span>“The global trade disruptions have become a norm, and there is an urgent necessity for both [India and the EU] to provide a certain degree of certainty to their businesses,” Dhar said. “The US is mired in uncertainty, and one just doesn’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”</span></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-will-the-us-react-to-the-india-eu-trade-deal\">How will the US react to the India-EU trade deal?</h2><p>The White House has already criticised the agreement.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent lashed out at the EU over the pact with New Delhi. “We have put 25 percent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,” Bessent told ABC News on Sunday.</p><p>“They [the Europeans] are financing the war against themselves,” he added.</p><p>While the EU <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/28/eu-and-us-announce-deal-a-breakdown-of-the-trade-agreement\">signed a trade deal</a> with the US fairly quickly after Trump announced his <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\">trade war</a> last year, New Delhi is still trying to negotiate one with Washington. It is also seeking to diversify trade to other parts of the world.</p><p>“India has taken a policy of strategic patience [in dealing with Trump’s trade war],” Trigunayat said. “The deal with the EU is part of the same process to cushion the impact and find new partners.”</p><p>Harsh Pant, vice president of the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, told Al Jazeera: “You have two big economic players coming together, which is a signal to the US that they are willing to move forward with their own agenda.”</p><p>“There is a quite extraordinary geopolitical realignment between India and the EU,” Pant said. “The Trump effect has accelerated the process of this convergence, and we are going to see more strategic engagement between the two.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Gulf Arab states said they want to stay out of any attack, despite hosting US military personnel.</p><p>At the same time, Trump stressed diplomacy remains an option. “They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions. They want to talk.”</p><p>Top Iranian military figures have reiterated the country’s readiness to engage in another war with Israel and the US in case of an attack similar to June’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day conflict</a>, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has promised a “comprehensive and regret-inducing response”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Now US President Donald Trump wants to create a new organisation, a “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2026/01/21/the-world-needs-stronger-un-not-trump-led-board-of-peace\">Board of Peace</a>” with himself as lifetime chairman.  While many countries were invited, those signing up appear to be a rogues’ gallery of leaders and governments with human rights records ranging from questionable to appalling.</p><p>The United States played a central role in establishing the UN in 1945 to prevent a repeat of the crimes against humanity and genocide during World War II. Ever wary of perceived threats to its autonomy, the US has always had a love-hate relationship with the UN. But the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/16/how-save-un-trump\">emphasised</a> the hate and dispensed with the love, denouncing what it perceives as “anti-American” and “hostile agendas.”</p><p>The administration has <a href=\"https://x.com/loucharbon/status/2009336871902695752?s=20\">disregarded and defunded</a> dozens of lifesaving UN programs. It has also withheld much of the  assessed contributions, which member states are obligated to pay. The administration has pulled out of the UN World Health Organization, UN climate bodies, and international climate agreements, and stopped funding the UN population fund, which supports and protects women and girls in armed conflicts and crisis zones.</p><p>US negotiators have <a href=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20260118/p2g/00m/0op/018000c\">pushed</a> Trump’s ideological agenda in UN negotiations, demanding the removal of selected human rights language from resolutions and statements. According to UN diplomats, targeted language includes words like “gender,” “diversity” and “climate” because the Trump administration views them as “woke” or politically correct. While the administration has had some success with its ideological campaign in the UN Security Council thanks to its veto power, it has been less successful in the General Assembly, where the US is just one of 193 voting members and has no veto.</p><p>But it is the Security Council that the administration appears determined to recreate in a Trumpian form. The Board of Peace’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-board-of-peace-charter-full-text\">charter</a> describes it as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”</p><p>The charter doesn’t mention human rights, which is doubtless music to the ears of the Russian and Chinese governments, which have <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/06/un-needs-protect-its-vital-yet-underfunded-human-rights-work\">worked for years to de-emphasize human rights</a> at the UN.</p><p>Trump’s board appears to be a kind of pay-to-play, global club, judging from the $1 billion fee for permanent membership. With several notorious human rights abusers and leaders implicated in war crimes – and few countervailing voices – it is hard to imagine this body giving priority to ending suffering, hatred and bloodshed, as Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/president-trump-ratifies-board-of-peace-in-historic-ceremony-opening-path-to-hope-and-dignity-for-gazans/\">declared</a> at the launch event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. Among those Trump has invited to join are two who are subject to International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity – Russian President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/trump-asks-putin-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-even-as-ukraine-war-rages\">Vladimir Putin</a> and Israeli <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. Trump has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">invited leaders of other countries</a> with appalling human rights records to join his board: From China and Belarus to Kazakhstan.</p><p>The charter makes clear that Trump as board chairman would have supreme authority “to adopt resolutions or other directives” as he sees fit.</p><p>So far, the only European Union members that agreed to join are Hungary and Bulgaria. Hungary’s far-right populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long been a Trump supporter. French President Emmanuel Macron is among those who turned down an offer to join – Trump responded with a threat to significantly increase tariffs on French wine and champagne.</p><p>Trump also offered Canada a permanent seat on the board. But he <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/trump-revokes-canadas-invitation-to-join-board-of-peace\">withdrew</a> the offer after  Prime Minister Mark Carney’s <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/davos-2026-special-address-by-mark-carney-prime-minister-of-canada/\">speech</a> in Davos. Without naming Trump or the US, Carney said the UN and other multilateral organisations are under threat, and sharply criticised great powers’ use of economic coercion against smaller countries. Carney urged middle powers to band together and resist great power bullying.</p><p>Originally the Board of Peace was meant to oversee the administration of Gaza following over two years of onslaught and destruction by Israeli forces that left at least 70,000 Palestinians dead, with which the US was complicit. The board’s charter doesn’t mention Gaza. But Gaza was the focus of a side event at Davos led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kushner will be a member of the “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">Gaza Executive Board</a>,” a subsidiary body of the Board of Peace.</p><p>Kushner offered a surreal vision of a “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/imperial-agenda-whats-trumps-gaza-development-plan-unveiled-in-davos\">New Gaza</a>” complete with glistening office towers and pristine beaches packed with tourists. The Gaza Executive Board includes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vx7kn33elo\">no Palestinians</a> but has former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Trump negotiator Steve Witkoff, and senior officials from Türkiye and Qatar.</p><p>Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks, governments should work together to protect the UN and other institutions established to uphold international human rights and  humanitarian law, the global rule of law, and accountability. They should use all available resources to counter unjust US actions like Trump’s sanctions on ICC judges and prosecutors, a UN special rapporteur, and prominent Palestinian human rights groups. They should press for accountability for grave international crimes by all warring parties, whether in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, Myanmar, or elsewhere.</p><p>Anything less would hand Trump a dangerous victory and allow him and his board to sideline the UN and other vital international organizations. The UN has its problems, including when it comes to upholding human rights. But it’s worth strengthening, not replacing with a club of rights abusers and alleged war criminals.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The selection process expected to take at least a few days, as 75 potential jurors are questioned each day through at least Thursday.</p><p>Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks.</p><p>The case involves a 19-year-old from California, identified as KGM, who said she became addicted to the companies’ platforms at a young age because of their attention-grabbing design, according to court filings.</p><p>She blames her depression and ​suicidal thoughts on the apps she used ‌and is seeking to hold the companies that designed them responsible.</p><p>KGM “reached an agreement in principle to settle her case” with TikTok, said Joseph VanZandt, a lawyer ‌for KGM.</p><p>TikTok’s settlement comes after Snap last week confirmed it had settled to avoid the trial brought by KGM.

And yes, this is a general pattern that applies to other countries, too, though Japan has an especially high level of debt, making its position more vulnerable.”</p><p>Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio already exceeds 230 percent, following decades of deficit spending by governments aiming to reverse the country’s long-term economic stagnation.</p><p>The East Asian country’s debt burden stands far above that of peers such as the US, UK and France, whose debt-to-GDP ratios are about 125 percent, 115 percent and 101 percent, respectively.</p><p>At the same time, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been scaling back bond purchases as part of its move away from decades of ultra-low interest rates, limiting its options for interventions to bring yields down.</p><p>“Bond investors reacted because her headline package looks like large, near-term fiscal loosening at exactly the moment the BOJ is trying to normalise policy,” Sayuri Shirai, a professor of economics at Keio University in Tokyo, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-all-this-affect-the-rest-of-the-world\">How does all this affect the rest of the world?</h2><p>The sell-off in Japanese bonds reverberated through markets overseas, with yields on 30-year US Treasuries rising to their highest level since September.</p><p>As Japanese bond yields rise, local investors are able to earn higher interest payments at home.</p><p>That can incentivise investors to offload other bonds, such as US Treasuries.</p><p>As of November, Japanese investors held $1.2 trillion in US Treasuries, more than any other foreign group of buyers.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed concern about the impact of Japan’s bond market on US Treasury prices and said he anticipated that his Japanese counterparts would “begin saying the things that will calm the market down.”</p><p>Japan’s long-term bond yields fell on Monday amid the expectations that Japanese and US authorities would step in to prop up the yen.</p><p>On Friday, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had inquired about the cost of exchanging the Japanese currency for US dollars.</p><p>“Japan matters globally through flows. If Japanese government bond yields rise, Japanese investors can earn more at home, potentially reducing demand for foreign bonds; that can nudge global yields and risk pricing,” Shirai said.</p><p>“This is why global-market pieces have framed Japan’s bond move as a wider rates story.”</p><p>Higher bond yields in Japan, the US and elsewhere raise the cost of borrowing and servicing the national debt.</p><p>In a worst-case scenario, a sharp escalation in interest rates can lead to a country defaulting on its debts.</p><p>Masahiko Loo, a fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management in Tokyo, said that the reaction of international investors to Takaichi’s plans reflects growing sensitivity to fiscal credibility in highly indebted economies.</p><p>“Yes, Japan may be the spark, but the warning applies equally to the US and others with large structural deficits,” Loo told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"is-japan-on-the-verge-of-a-financial-crisis\">Is Japan on the verge of a financial crisis?</h2><p>Probably not.</p><p>While Japan is more indebted than its peers, its fiscal position is more sustainable than it might appear due to factors specific to the country – at least in the short to medium term – according to economists.</p><p>The vast majority of Japan’s debt is held by local institutions and denominated in yen, reducing the likelihood of a panic induced by foreign investors, while interest rates are far lower than in other economies.</p><p>“The debt situation is more manageable than a lot of people think,” Thomas Mathews, head of markets for Asia Pacific at Capital Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Net debt-to-GDP is on a downward trajectory, and Japan’s budget deficit isn’t all that big by global standards.”</p><p>Loo of State Street Investment Management said that the turmoil surrounding Japan had more to do with a “communication gap around fiscal sustainability and policy coordination” than the country’s solvency.</p><p>“That said, markets are likely to continue testing the feasibility of the agenda, as even fiscally sanguine countries have, at times, been disciplined by market forces,” Loo said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He explained that approaching the cemetery was impossible, as tanks enforced a deadly perimeter, firing at anything that moved.</p><p>From his position near the “Yellow Line”, Israel’s self-proclaimed buffer zone inside Gaza, al-Rifi described a “wall of fire” created by artillery and helicopters to protect the engineering units. Inside this sealed zone, witnesses and video footage obtained later revealed that the forces spent two days churning up the earth.</p><p>“They dug up about 200 graves,” al-Rifi said. “They pulled the martyrs out, tested them one by one until they found the [Israeli] body.”</p><p>The disparity was most evident in the aftermath. Gvili’s remains were airlifted for dignified burial in Israel. The Palestinian bodies, however, were left to the mercy of bulldozers.</p><p>“When citizens went to the area [after the withdrawal], they found the martyrs put back randomly … covered with sand by the bulldozers,” al-Rifi said. “Some bodies were still visible on the surface.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"he-world-s-largest-graveyard\">‘The world’s largest graveyard’</h2><p>While Israel used satellite technology and DNA labs to close the chapter on its missing policeman, Palestinian families are denied even the basic machinery to dig.</p><p>Alaa al-Din al-Aklouk, spokesperson for the National Committee for Missing Persons, stated last November that Gaza has become “the world’s largest graveyard”.</p><p>“These martyrs are buried under the rubble of their homes … without their last dignity being preserved,” al-Aklouk said. He highlighted the “fatal injustice” of an international community that mobilised resources for Israeli captives while blocking the entry of heavy civil defence equipment needed to recover Palestinian victims.</p><p>Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, told Al Jazeera on Monday that while he respects the right of any family to bury their dead, the contrast is inescapable. “The lack of equal treatment, the lack of respect to Palestinians as equal human beings, is really astonishing,” he noted.</p><h2 id=\"a-cost-paid-in-blood\">A cost paid in blood</h2><p>The dark irony of this Israeli mission is that it created new victims. On Tuesday morning, as residents approached the desecrated cemetery to check on the graves of their loved ones, Israeli fire struck again.</p><p>“Four martyrs fell in the area this morning,” al-Rifi said, noting that one of them, his relative Youssef al-Rifi, had simply gone to inspect the destruction left behind.</p><p>In its quest to close a raw chapter that has shaken its national psyche since October 2023, Israel opened new graves in 2026. The operation serves as a grim microcosm of the entire war: The sanctity of one side’s life and death is upheld at the absolute expense of the other’s.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
