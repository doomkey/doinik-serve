All US assets throughout the region are considered legitimate targets for Iran’s army, it added.</p><p>At least one person has been killed in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, after several missiles launched from Iran were intercepted, according to the country’s state news agency.</p><p>Bahrain says a missile attack targeted the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet, which it hosts.</p><p>The government called it a “treacherous attack” and “a blatant violation of the kingdom’s sovereignty and security”.</p><p>Al Jazeera Arabic has meanwhile confirmed the sound of explosions in Kuwait, home to the US military’s Central Command headquarters.</p><p>In Qatar, the Defense Ministry says it “thwarted” several attacks on the country.</p><p>“The Ministry of Defense confirms that the threat was dealt with immediately upon detection, in accordance with the pre-approved security plan, and that all missiles were intercepted before reaching Qatari territory,” it said.</p><p>Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE have all closed their airspaces.</p><p>An Al Jazeera correspondent reported that Erbil Airport in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq was targeted twice on Saturday. A drone attack attempted to target Erbil International Airport, but air defences intercepted and shot it down, they added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Doha, said the only country in the Gulf Cooperation Council that Iran has not struck today thus far is Oman.</p><p>Oman has for years served as a liaison between Iran and other nations in the region and beyond. It has played a central role in recent indirect talks between Iran and the US in Oman and Geneva.</p><p>Oman’s foreign minister on Friday had voiced optimism that <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/peace-within-reach-as-iran-agrees-no-nuclear-material-stockpile-oman-fm\">peace was “within reach”</a> as Iran had agreed during the talks never to stockpile enriched uranium. Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi described the development as a major breakthrough. Hours later, Israel and the US attacked, and those talks are now dead and buried.</p><p>The GCC is an alliance of six countries in the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, established in 1981 to promote economic, security, cultural and social cooperation.</p><p>“Here in Doha, in the last few hours, we’ve heard at least a dozen explosions. The majority of them sound like they were Patriot defence missiles intercepting incoming Iran missiles,” Basravi said.</p><p>“As far as Iran is concerned, with the US and Israel firing the first shot in this latest go-round, everything is now probably fair game,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In recent weeks, Washington has assembled a large fleet of fighter jets and warships in the region, its most significant military buildup there since the Iraq War.</p><p data-start=\"778\" data-end=\"853\">Trump described the operation as “massive and ongoing”.</p><p data-start=\"855\" data-end=\"1125\">The US Department of Defense later said the mission was named “Operation Epic Fury”, marking the first public statement from the US military since the start of the joint US-Israeli attack.</p><p></p><p><strong>Where in Iran have the US and Israel attacked?</strong></p><p>Several missiles struck University Street and the Jomhouri area in Tehran, and close to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters, Fars reported.</p><p>The Associated Press news agency reported that a strike in Iran’s capital happened near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p><p>Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported that explosions also occurred in Tehran’s northern Seyyed Khandan area.</p><p>Explosions have also been reported in the cities of Kermanshah, Qom, Tabriz, Isfahan, Ilam and Karaj, as well as in Lorestan province, according to local media.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4345858\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-IRAN-ATTACKS-BY-ISRAEL-FEB28-2026-map-1772278937.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - IRAN ATTACKS BY ISRAEL - FEB28 2026 map-1772278937\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p> </p><h2 id=\"what-did-donald-trump-say\">What did Donald Trump say?</h2><p>While announcing “major combat operations”, Trump said that the aim of the US campaign was to “destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground”.</p><p>“We are going to annihilate their navy,” Trump added.</p><p>Here are the key points of his message</p><ul>\n<li data-start=\"121\" data-end=\"216\">The US has begun major combat operations in Iran, describing them as “massive and ongoing”.</li>\n<li data-start=\"219\" data-end=\"317\">The stated aim is to eliminate what Washington calls imminent threats from the Iranian government.</li>\n</ul><p>Trump said the campaign’s military objectives include:</p><ul>\n<li data-start=\"599\" data-end=\"638\">Destroying Iran’s missile capabilities.</li>\n<li data-start=\"643\" data-end=\"674\">Target Iran’s navy.</li>\n<li data-start=\"679\" data-end=\"729\">Disrupting Iran-backed armed groups in the region.</li>\n<li data-start=\"679\" data-end=\"729\">Making sure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.</li>\n</ul><p>He also laid out a warning-cum-offer to Iran’s military personnel. If they laid down their weapons, Trump said, he would ensure they had amnesty. But if they did not, he warned, they would face “certain death”. He acknowledged US forces could face casualties.</p><p>Reuters quoted a US official as saying that the Trump administration was planning a “multiday operation”.</p><p></p><p>The US president’s comments suggest that Trump was setting “the table for a revolution in Iran” — 73 years after the CIA orchestrated a coup against democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher reported from Washington.</p><p>“They’ve done it before. This time, they’re doing it with weapons and bombs rather than covertly through the CIA,” Fisher said. “It’s clear that this is going to be a continuous military operation, with Donald Trump accepting the fact that there may be casualties.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-iran-s-response\">What is Iran’s response?</h2><p>Iran retaliated by first launching missiles towards Israel, according to the Israeli military. Air-raid sirens sounded in several parts of the country, and explosions were reported in northern Israel.</p><p>“The public is requested to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command,” Israel’s military said in a statement. “At this time, the Israeli Air Force is operating to intercept and strike threats where necessary to remove the threat.”</p><p>But soon after, Iranian forces launched missiles at several locations linked to US military operations across the region, including:</p><ul>\n<li>Al Udeid airbase in Qatar.</li>\n<li>Al-Salem airbase in Kuwait.</li>\n<li>Al-Dhafra airbase in the United Arab Emirates.</li>\n<li>The US Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain.</li>\n<li>Explosions were also heard in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</li>\n</ul><p>Earlier, Ebrahim Azizi, head of the Iranian parliament’s national security commission, threatened a “crushing” response. “We warned you!” Azizi wrote on social media. “Now you have started down a path whose end is no longer in your control.”⁠</p><h2 id=\"where-are-iran-s-leaders\">Where are Iran’s leaders?</h2><p>It is not immediately clear where the 86-year-old Khamenei is. He hasn’t been seen publicly in days as tensions with the United States have grown.</p><p>Roads to Khamenei’s compound in downtown Tehran were shut down by authorities as blasts rang out across the capital.</p><p>Meanwhile, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency quoted a source in the presidential office as saying that President Masoud Pezeshkian was unharmed.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Neither US intelligence nor the UN nuclear watchdog have found any evidence that Iran was pursuing an atomic weapon, a narrative Israel and some in the Trump administration have nevertheless pushed.</p><h2 id=\"what-have-the-us-and-israel-said-about-khamenei\">What have the US and Israel said about Khamenei?</h2><p>Officials from both countries have previously issued threats against Khamenei.</p><p>In June, after the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a> of US-Israeli attacks on Iran, and Tehran’s retaliation against Israel, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz said Khamenei “cannot continue to exist”.</p><p>“A dictator like Khamenei who stands at the head of a state like Iran and has the horrible goal of destroying Israel – cannot continue to exist,” he said.</p><p>The same month, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Israel had not ruled out attempting to assassinate Khamenei, an act he said would “end” the long-running conflict between the US and Iran.</p><p>In the US, President Donald Trump has also made remarks appearing to threaten Khamenei. In an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Trump said the Iranian leader should be “very worried”, as the US amassed military assets in the region. In separate remarks, he said regime change in Iran would be “the best thing that could happen” and that “there are people” who could assume leadership, without elaborating.</p><p>As he ordered attacks on Iran last year, Trump then claimed Khamenei would be an “easy target” if the US decided to go after him.</p><p>“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” said Trump. “He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-goal-of-the-latest-attack\">What was the goal of the latest attack?</h2><p>In remarks following the attacks, Trump pledged to “annihilate” Iran’s navy and missile sites, and urged Iranians to overthrow their government.</p><p>“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take,” said Trump. “This will be probably your only chance for generations.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, who has covered Iran extensively, said it is clear that the US-Israeli attacks are “mainly aimed at decapitating [the political elite]”.</p><p>“How successful or unsuccessful this was, that is too early to tell.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">“The Swedish Armed Forces can now confirm that a Russian drone has carried out an unauthorised flight,” it added.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">Sweden’s Defence Minister Pal Jonson said “technical data” confirmed the origins of the drone as being the Russian vessel “Zhigulevsk”, noting also that the incident “constitutes a breach of Sweden’s access regulations and a violation of Swedish airspace”.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">“The Swedish Armed Forces responded firmly and professionally with countermeasures that disrupted the drone,” Jonson said.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">According to the AFP news agency, a Swedish navy vessel, HMS Rapp, used technical equipment to disable the drone about 13km (eight miles) from the French carrier.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">Swedish forces took action when the Russian drone was deemed to be flying without authorisation.</p><p data-start=\"125\"

the Baltic Sea.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">The French carrier and its escort ships had docked in Malmo on Wednesday for a visit by the vessel to the Swedish port before taking part in

“the only conclusion I would draw is that it would be a ridiculous provocation”.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">“The drone was neutralised away from the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier and in no way was the security of the aircraft carrier and its group threatened,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"125\" data-end=\"320\">Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said an investigation had

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On May 13, 1990, in Zagreb, two of Yugoslavia’s biggest football teams, Red Star Belgrade and the home team, Dinamo Zagreb, were set to play in the Maksimir Stadium of the Croatian capital. Among the excited Red Star fans riding on the train to Zagreb that day was a young law student named Aleksandar Vucic.</p><p>On the streets, fights began breaking out between rival fans. Cafe tables were flipped over, windows smashed. But the real ruckus erupted at the stadium, where Red Star fanatics, led by Serbian gangster Zeljko Raznatovic, aka Arkan, broke through the barrier holding them back and rushed at the Dinamo supporters, with punches and chairs thrown by both sides.</p><p>“They threw everything they had at us [until] there were no more chairs to hurl at each other,” Vucic <a href=\"https://vreme.com/mozaik/slucaj-maksimir-dvadeset-godina-posle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recounted</a> in a magazine interview 20 years later.</p><p>Dinamo supporters then stampeded the pitch, where their team jumped into the fray, assaulting police officers, and the game was officially called off before it began.</p><p>Over the next hour, authorities tried to restore order, playing soothing music over the loudspeakers to try to calm the mob. Two fire engines were dispatched to hose the fans, who pelted the trucks with stones.</p><p>Trading insults and fisticuffs are hardly unusual in football hooliganism, but the riots laid bare the ethnic fault lines that would soon lead to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia.</p><p>“It was already a conflict between Serbs and Croats, not Red Star and Dinamo fans,” Vucic explained in the same interview. “Football is always just a reflection of what is happening in society.”</p><p>Maksimir exemplified the toxic nationalism and football hooliganism that have shadowed Vucic’s rise to dominate Serbian politics for more than a decade as prime minister from 2014 to 2017, and since then, as president.</p><p>As war raged through the former Yugoslavia, Vucic began his political career with a far-right group calling for a “Greater Serbia”. In 1995, merely days after Bosnian Serb forces perpetrated a genocide against Bosniaks, Vucic threatened to kill hundreds if outside powers intervened.</p><p>Two decades later, after founding a new, more centrist party, Vucic paid his respects to the Srebrenica victims and called the killings a “monstrous crime”. However, he has never recognised the crimes as a genocide and <a href=\"/news/2024/5/23/un-approves-resolution-to-commemorate-1995-srebrenica-genocide\">opposed the 2024 United Nations vote</a> establishing an annual remembrance day. Meanwhile, he has led negotiations for Serbia to join the European Union and strengthened ties with China and Russia. Since taking the presidency in 2017, he has consolidated power and curbed democratic freedoms.</p><p>Throughout, allegations of criminality have plagued his presidency – from football thugs to graft reaching the halls of power – as anticorruption <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/thousands-rally-in-serbia-as-students-continue-fight-against-corruption\">protests</a> continue into their second year.</p><p>Amid the antigovernment protests, what motivates his grip on power, and how does he see the world today?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4335471\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4335471\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4335471\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2001-05-09T000000Z_143911293_RP2DRIKNCZAA_RTRMADP_3_SPORT-SOCCER-1771950980.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C581&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Red Star soccer fans fight each other during Yugoslav Cup final match against Partizan in Belgrade May 9, 2001.

The family left after Vucic’s grandfather, a prosperous merchant, was murdered by collaborators in 1941. He’d offended them by serving a keg of rakija (a strong Balkan brandy) to passersby outside his shop in solidarity with anti-German demonstrations in Belgrade.</p><p>The Ustase sought a Greater Croatia, attempting to achieve this by throwing Serbs, Jews and Roma into death camps. A violent Serb movement, the Chetniks, organised in response, but their own ambitions of a Greater Serbia led them to massacre Bosniaks and Croats, and eventually, to collaborate with the Nazis.</p><p>But it was Josip Broz Tito’s communist, multiethnic Partisans who ultimately prevailed against the Nazi occupation.</p><p>Tito went on to lead post-war Yugoslavia, refusing to be drawn into either camp during the Cold War. Yugoslavs were much freer and enjoyed a decent standard of living compared with their neighbours behind the Iron Curtain, and could easily travel abroad, including a young Vucic, who spent a year learning English in the British seaside town of Brighton in the late 1980s. It was, nevertheless, a dictatorship, where nationalism and religion were suppressed.</p><p>After the death of Tito – who was of Croat-Slovene descent – in 1980, his vision of a multiethnic Yugoslavia began crumbling. The Yugoslav army, as well as the central government in Belgrade, became increasingly dominated by Serbs led by strongman and eventual president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p><p>It was around this time that Vucic, then in his late teens, got drawn into the football hooligan scene through his favourite team, Red Star, whose fans had a reputation as hardcore Serbian nationalists.</p><p>Vucic <a href=\"https://vreme.com/en/vreme/aleksandar-vucic-sam-o-sebi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">often</a> brings up this past. Once, he boasted of having been in 50 fights. “Even when I was beaten up around the stadium or in the stands, I never reported it to the police. I behaved like a slobbery [rascal] who still held onto his honour,” he told a Serbian tabloid.</p><p>According to a New York Times article about Vucic’s alleged underworld ties, after one particularly heated game in 1988, the future president and his friends went “hunting” for Albanians on the streets of Belgrade and got into a fight.</p><p>“I don’t like him now, but he was brave, brave in the fight,” said a self-professed hooligan who fought alongside Vucic that day.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3830179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3830179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3830179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP95071102157-1752154254.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C508&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Srebrenica live page\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3830179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Branizlav Saric, 47, helps his friend Mustafa Cemalovic, 40, who has just been hit by shrapnel from a mortar shell that exploded less than 90 metres (295 feet) from the UN’s main headquarters in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on July 11, 1995, during the city’s nearly four-year siege [Enric F Marti/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"kill-one-serb-and-we-will-kill-100-muslims\">‘Kill one Serb and we will kill 100 Muslims’</h2><p>The Yugoslav wars began in 1991, when Slovenia, followed by Croatia, and then Bosnia, declared independence. Common criminals became warlords as paramilitaries, such as <a href=\"/news/2014/12/9/arkans-balkan-tigers-escape-accountability\">Arkan’s Tigers</a>, backed by Milosevic’s government in Belgrade, committed atrocities against Bosniaks and Croats.</p><p>“Reports suggest that figures like Arkan recruited supporters directly from [football stadium] stands [into paramilitaries],” explained Sasa Dorđevic, a Serbia expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.</p><p>Bosnia – with its multiethnic population of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats – suffered the most.</p><p>From 1992 to 1995, the capital Sarajevo was besieged by Bosnian Serb forces, the longest siege in modern history, as they tried, but never succeeded, to take the city. Civilians ran for cover through the main boulevard of the city, nicknamed <a href=\"/features/2020/5/3/a-camera-doesnt-lie-documenting-besieged-sarajevo\">Sniper Alley</a>, dodging bullets fired from nearby hillsides.</p><p>Vucic, then a law student in Belgrade, felt isolated on campus due to the political landscape – then split between Milosevic’s government and the opposition. In 1992, he volunteered with Bosnian Serb forces for 40 days behind the front lines. What he did exactly remains a matter of contention. Jovana Polic, a Serbian journalist who directed two documentaries about Vucic, said he worked at the Bosnian Serb propaganda television station Kanal S in Pale.</p><p>“He claims to have interviewed [Bosnian Serb leader] Radovan Karadzic, and even managed to play a quick game of chess with [General] Ratko Mladic,” Polic said, emphasising that both men were later convicted of war crimes.</p><p>As commander of the Bosnian Serb army, Mladic orchestrated the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica genocide.</p><p>After returning from Bosnia, Vucic, then 23, found a political home with the far-right Serbian Radical Party.</p><p>A spiritual successor to the Chetniks, the Radicals’ chief platform was a “Greater Serbia” encompassing most of the former Yugoslavia.</p><p>A video from 1995 shows Vucic visiting Serb positions in the wooded valley around Sarajevo alongside the Radicals’ leader Vojislav Seselj, often described as Vucic’s “political father,” who <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2011/05/04/seselj-s-most-memorable-quotes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">once said</a> he’d scoop out Croats’ eyeballs with a rusty spoon.</p><p>In the clip, Vucic is seen carrying a long, thin object, speculated to be a rifle, which he has denied, claiming to have never fired a gun.</p><p>Vucic’s rise through the party was meteoric. In 1993, he was elected to parliament as the country’s youngest MP, and less than two years later, became the party’s general secretary.</p><p>Then, in July 1995, the worst atrocity in Europe since the second world war took place in <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/7/10/what-happened-in-the-srebrenica-genocide\">Srebrenica</a> in eastern Bosnia. Bosnian Serb forces rounded up and systematically murdered more than <a href=\"/the-srebrenica-genocide-as-it-happened-30-years-ago/\">8,000 Bosniak men and boys</a>.</p><p>Just days later, speaking before Serbia’s parliament, Vucic warned against the interference of outside powers. “If you kill one Serb, we will kill a hundred Muslims,” he said.</p><p>Nevertheless, in late 1995, following NATO bombardment against Bosnian Serb forces, the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia agreed to end the conflict by signing the <a href=\"/news/2020/11/20/dayton-25-years\">Dayton Accords</a>.</p><p>In 1997, Serbia held elections, and the Radicals, to the extreme right of Milosevic and his followers, joined his governing coalition. The same year, Vucic married his first wife, Ksenija Jankovic, a journalist, with whom he’d have two children: a son, Danilo, and a daughter, Milica.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4335543\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4335543\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4335543\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/472708011_10170199110450265_404316969255187636_n-1771951872.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"[Niko Vorobyov/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4335543\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The former Ministry of Defence building in Belgrade remains as a memorial, its side obliterated by a NATO bomb [File: Niko Vorobyov/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"minister-of-wartime-propaganda\">Minister of wartime propaganda</h2><p>But there was still the question of Kosovo: an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, formally part of Serbia but populated chiefly by ethnic Albanians.</p><p>Albanians wanted their own republic and ultimately, independence. But Kosovo, as the site of the 1389 battle between Serbs and Ottoman forces, holds immense <a href=\"/opinions/2019/8/26/why-kosovo-keeps-extending-blind-support-to-israel\">symbolic, patriotic value</a> in Serb national memory. In early 1998, clashes broke out between Albanian guerrillas and the Yugoslav army (now consisting of only Serbia and Montenegro).</p><p>At about this time, Vucic’s pragmatic, or perhaps opportunistic, approach became apparent. Despite publicly disparaging Milosevic in the past, Vucic accepted the post of minister of information in his government. He was 28.</p><p>Amid mounting opposition, Milosevic’s regime grew increasingly repressive, and Vucic oversaw what were, at the time, the tightest media restrictions in Europe.</p><p>Newspapers were held responsible for their interviewees’ words and could be heavily fined for printing what the government deemed untrue, effectively banning any suggestion that Serbian soldiers could have committed atrocities. Vucic took a very strict line, personally signing a letter to the <a href=\"https://www.danas.rs/dijalog/licni-stavovi/kako-je-vucic-zabranio-list-danas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">newspaper, Danas,</a> warning it’d be shut down if they didn’t cease its critical, “defeatist” tone over the Kosovo war.</p><p>“Dismissals, intimidation and arrests of journalists became everyday occurrences; some independent media outlets were shut down or taken over by the state,” explained Polic.</p><p>“Mandatory censorship was also introduced. Editors would … submit the next day’s editions to the censors for approval.”</p><p>Vucic publicly defended this position, accusing the noncompliant media of working to bring about “the destruction of Serbia as an independent and free state and … the destruction of the entire Serbian people” at the behest of the United States.</p><p>After soldiers <a href=\"/features/2019/1/16/memories-still-fresh-villagers-remember-1999-racak-massacre\">massacred</a> 45 Albanian villagers in the village of Racak, NATO, fearing another Bosnia-style genocide, deployed its warplanes in March 1999.

The windows shook, but the players were unharmed. Vucic was one move away from winning, but Seselj took advantage of the impact to flip over the game board, denying victory to his protege.</p><p>In a news release, Vucic decried the “evil, terrible, subversive, cowardly attack by the NATO army on Serbia and Yugoslavia”.</p><p>“Serbia will defend itself against the aggressor and will defeat the enemy.”</p><p>But after two months of bombings, Milosevic capitulated, and Yugoslav troops withdrew from Kosovo, replaced by international peacekeepers.</p><p>For his services in silencing dissent, Vucic was awarded an apartment in Belgrade, but his new job wouldn’t last.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4335281\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4335281\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4335281\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2000-10-23T000000Z_884645440_RP2DRHZTPSAB_RTRMADP_3_YUGOSLAVIA-GOVERNMENT-1771948350.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C518&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Former Serbian Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic (R) of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radicals is held by the Secretary General of the Serbia's ruling Socialist Party, Zoran Andjelkovic, as he argues with the parliament speaker Dragan Tomic, in Belgrade October 23, 2000.

Enraged, the opposition called for a nationwide strike.</p><p>The student-led Otpor (“Resistance”) movement protested in the streets, and even football hooligans had had enough, chanting, “Kill yourself, Slobodan!” at matches.</p><p>On October 5, a mob of protesters smashed a bulldozer through the front doors of RTS, the state-run broadcaster, before tearing the offices apart. Milosevic resigned that night.</p><p>While some celebrated the fall of Milosevic, Vucic remembered it as a very dark day.</p><p>By his own account, he was walking outside with his son when they were attacked by men high on drugs.</p><p>“I knocked them both out,” he stated in a 2003 interview.</p><p>“I went back to the house, and I knew, of course, that Serbia was going to enter years of decline and destruction.”</p><p>But the former editor of Pravda, a Serbian tabloid, once close to Vucic, claimed the future president spent that day quietly sitting at home, waiting to see what would happen next. Observers see the anecdote as bolstering a tough image.</p><p>Vucic’s party was out. The new democratically elected Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic tried to face up to Serbia’s role in the Yugoslav wars, speedily extraditing war criminals, including Milosevic.</p><p>Organised crime had flourished in the 1990s, when the government worked closely with smugglers to bypass wartime sanctions and prop up the economy. Djindjic, who tried to clean up the country from the Milosevic-era crime, was assassinated in 2003 by a gang of ex-Arkan’s Tigers (Arkan himself had already been shot dead in an underworld feud before he could face justice).</p><p>Djindjic’s centre-left Democratic Party governed Serbia for just under a decade. In this new, pro-Western Serbia, Vucic and the Radicals were back in the opposition. His “political father,” Seselj, had already been indicted in The Hague in 2003 for inciting ethnic cleansing.</p><p>During the manhunt for Hague fugitive Mladic in 2007, Vucic brought a sign to parliament reading “safe house for Ratko Mladic,” and stuck posters saying “Ratko Mladic Boulevard” along the Belgrade boulevard named after Djindjic. Vucic claimed he was “prosecuted only because he was defending his country”.</p><p>The following year, he led rallies against Radovan Karadzic’s arrest.</p><p>But by now, Vucic was realising that ultranationalism was no longer so popular, and his next steps would prove politically savvy. In September 2008, he defected from the Radicals to cofound the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), a more moderate party with aspirations of joining the EU. Observers argue he was guided by both ambition and pragmatism.</p><p>“He changed his clothes, removed Seselj from his lapel, put on a European suit and stepped into a new political chapter,” Polic explained.</p><p>He moderated his stance and highlighted how EU membership – the country formally applied in 2009 – was in the best interest of Serbia’s struggling post-war economy.</p><p>“He realised that with that radical position, you cannot get a majority in Serbia,” said Florian Bieber, professor of Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz, Austria.</p><p>“So in that sense, he moderated his position for pragmatic reasons, because it’s more important for him to come to power than to promote that particular agenda.”</p><p>But it is unclear how far his beliefs have evolved. Vucic visited Srebrenica in 2015 and acknowledged that terrible crimes took place. “[It] is a move away from where he was ideologically 20 years ago or so,” Bieber said.</p><p>He, however, has repeatedly denied that it was a genocide.</p><p>Meanwhile, as Seselj raged at Vucic’s SNS from his prison cell, calling them traitors, Vucic rose in the polls.</p><p>By appealing to moderate, Eurocentric voters while keeping their nationalist base, the SNS became the dominant party in Serbia, winning key plebiscites in 2012 and 2014.</p><p>Vucic became prime minister after the 2014 elections, and in 2017, he <a href=\"/news/2017/5/31/former-pm-aleksandar-vucic-sworn-in-as-president\">won the presidency</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4335435\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4335435\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4335435\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20250902__736W476__v1__HighRes__ChinaPoliticsDiplomacy-1771950841.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) walks with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic for a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on September 2, 2025.

Officials describe the president as a workaholic who only sleeps for three hours a night and routinely calls them at six o’clock in the morning.</p><p>“He’s incredibly intelligent, and everybody knows this about him … he’s very, very hardworking,” said Anthony Godfrey, the former US ambassador to Serbia from 2019 to 2022, who developed a close working relationship with Vucic.</p><p>A lot of the economic improvements came as a result of investment from China, which has poured billions of dollars into Serbian infrastructure through its Belt and Road Initiative. Vucic has visited China at least seven times, more than any other European leader.</p><p>“Vucic calls his relationship with China ‘the friendship made of steel’,” Godfrey told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Godfrey described Vucic, who he says is “six-foot-seven, easy,” as towering over everyone else in the room and making a “serious impression,” as well as being a skilled diplomat.</p><p>“He’s very respectful and humble when he meets with visitors. He’s a good host when people come to visit, and he genuinely wants to see what benefit a relationship can provide for Serbia.”</p><p>The president and the ambassador connected over their shared interests.</p><p>“One of his hobbies, or actually a passion I would say, is the study of wine. He’s an oenophile, and he’s got a collection of very fine wines … Serbia now produces good wine, and a lot of that is his passion coming through.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the ambassador added, Vucic has openly provided armaments to Ukraine, staving off criticism from the West over undemocratic practices. At the same time, he has refused to sanction Russia, asserting that “85 percent of Serbians will always side with Russia, whatever happens.”</p><p>Russophilia is common in Serbia, dating back to the 19th century when Russia, a fellow Slavic Orthodox nation, supported Serbia’s independence from the Ottoman Empire. More recently, the two countries share a suspicion of NATO and the West.</p><p>“He’s been trying to balance these competing global powers, which, of course, requires some level of skill considering the kind of global competition,” Bieber said.</p><p>But he also pointed to Vucic’s strategy of dodging EU demands that could threaten his hold on power. For instance, late last year, the EU expressed concern that a proposed judicial overhaul may undermine the rule of law and corruption investigations, at a time when prosecutors were probing high-ranking officials’ dealings with organised crime.</p><p>“When a country is a candidate for EU membership, as Serbia is, we expect it to behave in a European manner,” said EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos. “This is a serious step backwards.”</p><p>“It was said that Vucic must not sign, that Brussels ordered him not to. Someone ordering me? Anyone who thinks that is possible is not normal. I will listen to everyone, but I make the decisions,” the president fired back as he signed the proposal into law this year.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4091271\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4091271\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4091271\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-04T140657Z_2072381531_RC2QPHALEYLX_RTRMADP_3_EU-ENLARGEMENT-SERBIA-1762512440.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and European Council President Antonio Costa\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4091271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vucic is welcomed by European Council President Antonio Costa in Brussels, Belgium, on November 4, 2025 [Yves Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Vucic has to maintain a delicate balance at home, too. While he may have once held together a big tent of Europhiles and nationalists, according to Godfrey, the president has come to rely on the latter, including Serbs living in Kosovo or Bosnia who are eligible to vote in Serbian elections.</p><p>“They are going to vote for Vucic, provided he still sings the right nationalist song,” Godfrey explained.</p><p>“So as long as he keeps saying ‘NATO bad, Kosovo is Serbia,’ things like that, the people on the right will continue to vote for him.</p><p>“But it’s pushing him to become even more extremist the more dependent he is on these votes.”</p><p>This doesn’t mean Vucic is a serious nationalist so much as an opportunist, according to Polic.</p><p>“When he is speaking to the West, he is a reformist who strives for peace. When he is speaking to his voters, he is a warrior, defending every inch of the land,” she said. “In reality, Kosovo is his political currency with which he pays for his survival on the throne.”</p><p>Vucic has <a href=\"/news/2023/1/24/serbia-under-western-pressure-to-reach-deal-on-kosovo-vucic-says\">not recognised</a> Kosovo’s 2008 declared independence, which Godfrey said would be extremely politically “costly”.</p><p>But some believe Vucic’s nationalist fervour is still very real.</p><p>Milos Injac, a local government representative for the Green-Left Front in Belgrade, considers figures like Seselj as useful stand-ins for Vucic’s real beliefs, which he says haven’t changed since the 1990s. Since his release from a Dutch prison in 2014, Seselj has become a public supporter of Vucic.</p><p>“I think he’s exactly the same as he was, but for the sake of looking normal and not having Europe breathing down his neck, he has his own goons that will say what he doesn’t want to say,” Injac said.</p><p>Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped public disillusionment with Vucic, culminating in mass anticorruption protests since 2024 that threaten his grip on power.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3628080\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3628080\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3628080\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-02T075223Z_2125263587_RC2PDDAG650Z_RTRMADP_3_SERBIA-PROTESTS-SOUND-1744027934.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters in Serbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3628080\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A placard with a photo of Vucic is held as students and antigovernment demonstrators take part in a protest in Belgrade on March 15, 2025.

The majority of newspapers and TV stations are controlled by his allies, but independent media still exists in Serbia. Still, non-state-aligned journalists are threatened, harassed and occasionally assaulted, while oppositionists are smeared.</p><p>“If [the opposition] are talked about, they’re slandered,” said Bieber. “They’re called scum, foreign traitors, collaborators with external powers.”</p><p>“[Vucic] does not use the media — he owns them,” added Polic.</p><p>“He orders ‘exclusives’, makes targets out of people, with a standard dose of state paranoia. Criticism of him or the regime is translated into this machinery as treason, and any suspicion as hatred towards Serbia.”</p><p>After the broadcast of her documentary about Vucic, “The Ruler”, on Serbian television, for example, Vucic’s lawyers presented Polic with a lawsuit in 2023. There was an outcry, and Vucic announced on Instagram that he was withdrawing the lawsuit, which he claimed was filed behind his back.</p><p>The ongoing protest movement is demanding early elections before Vucic is officially due to step down in 2027.

This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces.”</li>\n</ul><p>Iran has repeatedly said it would never build a nuclear weapon and that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only. Neither US intelligence, nor the UN nuclear watchdog have found any evidence that Iran was pursuing an atomic weapon, a narrative Israel and some in the Trump administration have nevertheless pushed.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, said sources told him that “US involvement in this attack is aimed at “decapitating the Iranian regime”.</p><p>“They say that from what they can understand, the attacks were concentrated on areas where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may be sheltering, so the intention was to try and take out the head of the regime and then see what would happen afterwards,” he added.</p><p>One of the areas targeted in Iran’s capital was near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, The Associated Press reported. Khamenei is not in Tehran and has been transferred to a secure location, according to an official quoted by Reuters.</p><p>“There are countries that have been cautioning the US against this attack and wanted to know what the plan for the day after would be, simply because you can’t guarantee that by removing the supreme leader you would necessarily form a pro-US government,” Fisher said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Smoke was seen rising in the city, according to an Al Jazeera correspondent on the ground.</p><p>Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim News Agency reported that explosions also occurred in Tehran’s northern Seyyed Khandan area. Other Iranian media reported attacks nationwide, including in the western Ilam province, while Israel’s military confirmed carrying out attacks in western Iran.</p><p>An Israeli strike hit an elementary girl’s school in Minab, a city in the Hormozgan province of southern Iran, killing at least 40 people, according to according to the state-run IRNA news agency..</p><p>Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the attacks targeted a range of military and defence sites, as well as civilian infrastructure, in various cities.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said the joint attacks were aimed at “eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime”.</p><p>“Short time ago, US military began major combat operation in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating threats from the Iranian regime,” he said.</p><p>An Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran ⁠is preparing ⁠for a retaliation that is set ⁠to be ⁠”crushing”. Iran is preparing to “take revenge” on Israel and deliver a “strong response”, State TV reported.</p><p>A senior Iranian official told Al Jazeera that “all American and Israeli assets and interests in the Middle East have become a legitimate target” and that “there are no red lines after this aggression”.</p><h2 id=\"explosions-in-israel-bahrain-uae-kuwait\">Explosions in Israel, Bahrain, UAE, Kuwait</h2><p>Explosions rocked northern Israel as the country worked to intercept incoming Iranian missiles shortly after it attacked Iran. The blasts echoed just after the Israeli military said it would be using its air defence systems to bring down the Iranian fire. There was no immediate word on any casualties or damage from the ongoing attack.</p><p>Blasts also occurred across numerous Gulf Arab states that host US military assets, including Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Iran’s Fars News Agency confirmed the country had carried out attacks targeting military bases in each of the states, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet in Bahrain.</p><p>Qatar’s Defence Ministry said it had “successfully thwarted a number of attacks targeting the country’s territory”, after several rounds of alerts sounded.</p><p>The UAE’s state news agency reported one person was killed in Abu Dhabi after Iranian missiles were intercepted.</p><p>Muhanad Seloom, assistant professor in Critical Security Studies at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera that Iran wants to “raise the cost” for countries in the region that are close to the US.</p><p>“They are trying to draw other countries in the region into this war,” said Seloom. “They want to raise the cost for these countries, with the hope probably that these countries will pressure the US administration to stop this war.”</p><h2 id=\"joint-us-israeli-action\">‘Joint US-Israeli action’</h2><p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks on Iran aimed to remove an “existential threat”. Netanyahu projected that “joint action” by Israel and the US “will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands” and praised Trump for his “historic leadership”.</p><p>A US official told Al Jazeera earlier that the attacks were carried out as a joint military operation between Israel and the US, which has assembled a vast fleet of fighter jets and warships in the region to try to pressure Iran into a deal over its nuclear programme. A US official told Reuters that attacks were being carried out by air and sea.</p><p>One of the areas targeted in Iran’s capital was near the offices of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reported The Associated Press. Khamenei is not in Tehran and has been transferred to a secure location, according to an official quoted by Reuters.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Maziar Motamedi, reporting from Tehran, said cellphone communications have been disrupted in several areas of the capital. “No calls are possible at present,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"sirens-in-israel\">Sirens in Israel</h2><p>As sirens sounded and a state of emergency was declared in Israel, the Israeli military said it had issued a “proactive alert to prepare the public for the possibility of missiles being launched toward the state of Israel”.</p><p>The Israel Airports Authority announced its airspace had been closed to all civilian flights and urged the public not to come to the airport.</p><p>According to an Israeli defence official quoted by Reuters, the attacks had been planned for months and the ⁠launch date ⁠decided ⁠weeks ago, even as the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/iran-says-us-must-drop-excessive-demands-in-nuclear-negotiations\">US and Iran carried out negotiations</a>.</p><p>Mehran Kamrava, director of the Iranian studies unit at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies and professor at Georgetown University in Qatar, said Israel “appears to have launched an attack designed to derail the negotiations”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4345034\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4345034\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4345034\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-IRAN-ATTACKS-BY-ISRAEL-FEB28-2026-1772267240.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - IRAN ATTACKS BY ISRAEL - FEB28 2026-1772267240\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4345034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"
