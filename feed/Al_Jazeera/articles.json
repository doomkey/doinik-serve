But for women like Mariam*, the horror of war followed her even as she tried to flee.</p><p>Attempting to escape from Gezira State to Khartoum early last year, Mariam’s vehicle was stopped by armed men. She was the only passenger singled out.</p><p>“We were coming from Gezira State… They stopped us on the street and forced us down,” Mariam told Al Jazeera Arabic’s correspondent Asma Mohammed.</p><p>“They said they wanted to search us. Two of them consulted with each other, then called me over,” she recounted, her voice trembling. “They took me to a place… It was an empty room with a mattress. They told me to lie down, and then they raped me.”</p><p>Mariam returned to her family in the waiting car, shattered.</p><p>“She told us immediately what happened… How many of them there were,” her aunt told Al Jazeera. “Of course, they were from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).”</p><h2><strong>‘Is there a girl in this house?’</strong></h2><p>Mariam’s story is not unique. In el-Fasher, the tragedy repeats itself with even greater brutality.</p><p>Um Kulthum*, a medical student, told Al Jazeera she was forced to witness mass rape and murder before becoming a victim herself.</p><p>“The RSF forces entered … and besieged the area,” Um Kulthum said. “They killed my uncle, the one who raised me … right in front of us.</p><p>“We were four girls, along with our neighbour’s daughter. The RSF forces then gang-raped us in a brutal manner.”</p><p>These exclusive accounts align with a harrowing new report released last November by the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA), which documented nearly 1,300 cases of sexual and gender-based violence across 14 states since the war began in April 2023.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera in November, Hala Al-Karib, the regional director of SIHA, explained that these are not random acts, but a strategy rooted in viewing women as “property”.</p><p>“Kidnappings often occur at the beginning of an invasion… When homes are entered, there is a specific question asked: ‘Is there a girl in this house? Are there young women?'” Al-Karib said.</p><p>“We have heard from many witnesses who were told by RSF soldiers: ‘I am coming to take this girl.'”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>Sexual slavery and trafficking</strong></h2><p>The violence extends beyond immediate assault to long-term captivity. Al-Karib described a terrifying reality of “sexual slavery” and forced labour.</p><p>“Women are kidnapped for ‘sexual slavery’, specifically young, middle-aged women, and also to serve the soldiers – forced labour, washing clothes, cooking,” Al-Karib told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Even more disturbingly, she revealed that the exploitation has crossed international lines.</p><p>“Women are also kidnapped for the purpose of enslavement and sale in markets,” Al-Karib said. “They are transported across the border to African countries neighbouring Sudan.”</p><p>She added that women’s bodies are being used “as weapons in this war … to defeat communities”, leaving survivors crushed by stigma and often refusing to return to their families out of shame.</p><h2><strong>Punishing the Masalit</strong></h2><p>The systematic nature of these crimes was further confirmed by Arnold Tsunga, a lawyer and former Africa director for the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), who led a fact-finding mission to eastern Chad to interview refugees fleeing the violence.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera Arabic from Harare, Tsunga described his mission to Adre and Geneina as “heartbreaking”.</p><p>“The RSF are the ones who attacked the Masalit group… They were the majority of those subjected to sexual violence and rape,” Tsunga said.</p><p>“It is sad to see that violence is now being used systematically as a means and weapon of war … to forcibly remove people from their land and to punish Masalit men who tried to defend their land.”</p><p>Tsunga warned that the collapse of the rule of law has created an “absolute environment” for these crimes.</p><p>“The RSF are now the responsible authority in these areas… There are no justice institutions working,” he explained. “Impunity leads to more impunity … and this problem is related to rewarding criminals.”</p><h2><strong>Targeting infants</strong></h2><p>The scale of the violence has overwhelmed local hospitals. At the Omdurman Maternity Hospital, the director general described a pattern of atrocities that spares no one – not even babies.</p><p>“The rapes are in very large numbers, far more than what is recorded,” Imad al-Din Abdullah al-Siddiq told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“More than 14 female infants less than the age of two were raped. An infant! This is documented by NGOs,” he said.</p><p>Al-Siddiq noted that the hospital received a flood of victims aged 11 to 23, mostly unmarried girls. “They come as a result of pregnancy… Abortions were performed for those less than three months… For those more than three months, we didn’t have a licence to abort, so the pregnancy continued, and births took place here.”</p><p>UNICEF has confirmed more than 200 cases of sexual assault on children since the start of 2024, some less than the age of five.</p><h2><strong>A systematic pattern</strong></h2><p>The SIHA report outlines a calculated three-stage pattern accompanying RSF advances: Initial home invasions and looting accompanied by rape, followed by attacks in public spaces, and finally long-term detention.</p><p>This violence occurs against a backdrop of worsening famine. The United Nations’ World Food Programme warned it will cut rations in Sudan from January due to severe funding gaps, leaving millions at risk of starvation.</p><p>Meanwhile, international pressure is mounting. The United Kingdom recently sanctioned four senior RSF commanders over alleged mass killings and sexual violence.</p><p>But for survivors like Mariam and Um Kulthum, the diplomatic moves offer little solace. As Al-Karib noted, the international investment in reintegrating these women remains “very, very small”.</p><p><em>*Names have been changed to protect the identity of survivors.</em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Much of its military leadership was killed during the intensification, including its longtime leader <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>. In the war’s aftermath, the group is being pressured to give up the weapons that have long defined its identity as a “resistance” group to Israel.</p><p>In August 2025, the Lebanese government <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/hezbollah-to-treat-lebanons-disarmament-decision-as-if-it-does-not-exist\">approved a plan</a> to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah. The decision was domestically popular outside of Hezbollah’s support base as a way of strengthening the Lebanese state, but also came as a result of increasing pressure from the US and Israel.</p><p>For its part, Hezbollah has repeatedly rejected calls for disarmament. The group says that Israel has not abided by its side of the ceasefire.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“To demand exclusive arms control while Israel is committing aggression and the United States is imposing its will on Lebanon…means that you are not working in Lebanon’s interest but rather in the interest of what Israel wants,” Nasrallah’s successor, Naim Qassem, said in a speech on January 3, 2026.</p><p>“We call for equipping the Lebanese Army to enable it to be an army for the country that protects against enemies, in addition to the other tasks it is doing in the face of drug and theft gangs, all spies and those who tamper with the country’s security.”</p><h2 id=\"internal-confrontation-in-lebanon\">Internal confrontation in Lebanon?</h2><p>Still, Hezbollah has largely been disarmed south of the Litani River, according to Lebanese Army and government officials. Lebanese military officials have said the only places they were unable to operate in removing Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure were near the Israeli-occupied five points.</p><p>The deadline to disarm below the Litani was the end of 2025. Lebanon’s cabinet is set to meet on Thursday to discuss “phase two” of the disarmament plan, which would entail disarming Hezbollah and Palestinian militias from the area between the Litani River, situated about 30km (19 miles) from the Israeli border and running along southern Lebanon, to the Awali River, which runs just north of Sidon. There are about 40km (25 miles) of territory between the Litani and Awali.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam wrote on social media that his government was focused on ending Israeli attacks, removing Israeli troops from the five points in south Lebanon and returning Lebanese detainees held by Israel.</p><p>“We promise to continue together the path of reform and the extension of state authority,” he wrote.</p><p>Salam and others in the Lebanese government admit that the LAF are not strong enough to confront Israel directly. In turn, they have tried to appeal to regional allies and the international community.</p><p>“Appealing to the international community to pressure Israel is a necessary but limited strategy,” Imad Salamey, a political scientist at Lebanese American University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“While diplomatic engagement can help restrain the scale of Israeli operations and preserve space for negotiations, it is unlikely on its own to halt attacks unless paired with clear, verifiable progress on disarmament and credible security guarantees. In practice, international actors tend to place greater pressure on Lebanon to deliver results on the ground than on Israel to exercise restraint, which reduces the effectiveness of this approach unless Lebanon can anchor it to a concrete bargain linking implementation to measurable Israeli de-escalation.”</p><p>The Lebanese government is in a difficult position, without many cards to play. Hezbollah has largely not impeded the Lebanese Army’s work south of the Litani. But should Israeli attacks continue, analysts believe the group won’t be as accommodating going forward.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese political analyst close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera that for the group to begin discussions of disarmament, Israel must first stop attacking Lebanon and release prisoners, and the Lebanese state must begin reconstructing the damage done by Israel during and since the war.</p><p>“Only then can the future of weapons be discussed,” he said.</p><p>Kassir warned that failure to address those issues before implementing the second phase of the disarmament plan will spark tensions.</p><p>“Otherwise, we will face a confrontation.”</p><h2 id=\"hezbollah-battered-but-not-defeated\">Hezbollah battered but not defeated</h2><p>The Lebanese government, meanwhile, is caught between increasing pressure from the US and Israel, and Hezbollah’s refusal to disarm.</p><p>“As long as Israeli strikes continue, Hezbollah and its constituency can plausibly argue that disarmament beyond the south exposes them to greater vulnerability,” Salamey said.</p><p>“Israeli strikes function not only as military actions, but also as strategic messaging, aimed at undermining Lebanon’s claim that it has restored state authority and completed disarmament south of the Litani.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Israel has meanwhile tried to argue that Hezbollah is <a href=\"/features/2025/9/28/after-war-with-israel-how-is-lebanons-hezbollah-regrouping\">regrouping in the south</a>, despite counterclaims by the UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL, and has said the Lebanese Army is moving too slowly in its disarmament mission.</p><p>“If Israel continues its attacks while the LAF proceeds with phase two disarmament north of the Litani River, the repercussions could be severe,” Salamey said. “Israel may interpret any disruption or delay as justification to broaden its target set, thereby deepening instability and raising the risk of a wider confrontation at a moment when Lebanon is least able to absorb it.”</p><p>Should the Lebanese Army proceed with the second phase while Israel continues striking targets in Lebanon, analysts believe Hezbollah could feel threatened and respond aggressively.</p><p>And while foreign diplomats and analysts say that Hezbollah was greatly weakened by Israel’s war on Lebanon in 2024, they still believe the group is strong enough to confront any domestic challenges.</p><p>“Consequently, phase two risks evolving from a technical security measure into a broader political confrontation over sequencing, guarantees, and internal stability in Lebanon,” Salamey said.</p><p>“The LAF may face internal friction and localized resistance, placing strain on civil–military relations and national cohesion,” Salamey added. “Hezbollah, even if avoiding direct confrontation with the army, could respond through political obstruction or calibrated escalation with Israel, increasing the risk of miscalculation.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

These groups include state-controlled militias and neighbourhood defence committees. The largest of these, the Territorial Troops Militia, serves as a civilian reserve aimed at assisting the regular army against external threats or during internal crises.</p><p>In Venezuela, members of pro-government armed civilian groups known as “colectivos” have been accused of enforcing political control and intimidating opponents. Although not formally part of the armed forces, they are widely seen as operating with state tolerance or support, particularly during periods of unrest under Maduro.</p><p>In Colombia, right-wing paramilitary groups emerged in the 1980s to fight left-wing rebels. Although officially demobilised in the mid-2000s, many later re-emerged as criminal or neo-paramilitary organisations, remaining active in rural areas. The earliest groups were organised with the involvement of the Colombian military following guidance from US counterinsurgency advisers during the Cold War.</p><p>In Mexico, heavily armed drug cartels function as de facto paramilitary forces. Groups such as the Zetas, originally formed by former soldiers, possess military-grade weapons and exercise territorial control, often outgunning local police and challenging the state’s authority.

The oil companies are ready to go.”</p><p>But are they? It is less certain than Trump makes it sound.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>When reporters sought concrete details about the investments, Trump declined to offer them. Speaking on ABC’s This Week on January 4, Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed Trump, saying he expects “dramatic interest from Western companies”, without offering specifics.</p><p>When contacted for comment, the White House told PolitiFact that the administration has had <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/5/trump-administration-sets-meetings-with-oil-companies-on-venezuela-report\">conversations with multiple oil companies</a>, without naming any of them.</p><p>“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.</p><p>The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry’s leading trade association in the US, said in a statement to PolitiFact that the group is “closely watching” the developments.</p><p>“Globally, energy companies make investment decisions based on stability, the rule of law, market forces, and long-term operational considerations,” the statement said.</p><p>A ConocoPhillips spokesperson gave a similar response, according to media reports, saying the company “is monitoring developments”, but that it would be “premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.”</p><p>Experts told PolitiFact that there is ample reason for caution about a surge of new private investment in Venezuelan oil infrastructure. While Venezuela’s oil reserves are the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">world’s largest</a>, obstacles include the high up-front costs for building infrastructure, limited profit potential amid today’s low oil prices and continuing concerns about political stability.</p><p>“I do not see a compelling business case for any US-based company to invest billions of dollars over years to decades to try to turn a profit in Venezuelan oil,” said Hugh Daigle, a professor with the University of Texas at Austin’s petroleum and geo-systems engineering department.</p><p>Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis with GasBuddy, a gasoline price app, said the uncertainty over Venezuela’s governance is likely to worry oil companies.</p><p>“Oil companies probably aren’t chomping at the bit to invest billions of dollars and take their chances until there’s clarity in the Venezuelan regime,” De Haan said. “I don’t believe there will be, beyond a negligible impact from the situation, potentially for years, and even then, only if things go very right.”</p><h2><strong>What would be the upsides of oil industry investment in Venezuela?</strong></h2><p>US companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips exited Venezuela after Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s predecessor, moved to nationalise the oil industry in 2007. Chevron is the only major US oil company that has been consistently producing oil in Venezuela in recent years.</p><p>How Venezuela’s nationalised, and in some cases internationally sanctioned, oil resources are opened will determine who benefits, said Kenneth Gillingham, a Yale University professor of environmental and energy economics.</p><p>If the market were opened only to the biggest US oil corporations, those companies would <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye\">mainly benefit</a>, but their gains would be more limited if the market also were opened to companies based outside the US, Gillingham said. US motorists could benefit from increased production pushing prices lower, but those gains would depend heavily on global market factors.</p><p>Some oil companies could be attracted to Venezuela because it would allow them to diversify their investments, said Skip York, a fellow at Rice University’s Centre for Energy Studies.</p><p>Compared with crude oil in many countries, Venezuelan crude is relatively heavy. That means it takes longer to extract, but once the wells are in place, they can keep producing for longer periods of time.</p><p>The US generally doesn’t produce heavy crude from its own deposits, but a portion of the US refinery sector is specifically built to handle it. So having a steady supply of heavy Venezuelan crude could keep these refineries operational. Rubio cited this opportunity on This Week.</p><p>If Venezuela returns to political and economic stability, York said, “one could expect returns of 15 percent to 20 percent, which could be competitive with other development opportunities.”</p><h2><strong>Obstacles remain for US oil companies </strong></h2><p>Oil experts cited several challenges to achieving large profits from Venezuelan reserves:</p><p><strong>The up-front cost of improving infrastructure will be significant.</strong> “The Venezuelan oil industry has been nationalised for many decades now and has suffered from a lack of investment, both foreign and domestic,” Daigle said. New investment would be needed to keep facilities and operations up to date, with no certainty of payback.</p><p><strong>Venezuela’s political situation remains unsettled.</strong> “Not many companies are going to rush to go into an environment where there’s not stability,” Ali Moshiri, who headed Chevron’s operations in Venezuela until 2017 and now runs a private oil company with interests there, told The New York Times.</p><p>At a minimum, Venezuela would need a new petroleum law framework, York said. Even after all the legal and financial issues have been resolved, he said, it would take “years to refurbish infrastructure and drill new wells”.</p><p><strong>Oil prices are low.</strong> High up-front infrastructure costs and risks from political instability could be justified financially if oil prices were high enough. But prices are relatively low. Since Trump became president, crude oil’s price per barrel has fallen by about one-quarter.</p><p>“With oil (prices) near multi-year lows, oil companies likely won’t be running to spend money in Venezuela that could further erode oil prices,” De Haan said.</p><p>The reluctance to spend significantly to expand production can already be seen domestically in declining industry efforts to drill new US wells. A weekly count of oil rigs in use in the US shows a 16 percent decline since their most recent peak in April. If companies aren’t eager to spend on drilling in the US, with its established infrastructure and relative political stability, it’s not clear that they would go all in on Venezuela.</p><p><strong>The long-term importance of oil depends on the future of electric vehicles. </strong>“If we continue using lots of oil and oil prices stay high, then it is likely that new entrants in Venezuela would recoup their investments over time,” Gillingham said. “However, if electric vehicles continue to come down in price and really take off, in the US and globally, this will keep a lid on oil prices and make it less likely that the investment costs will be recouped.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US launched a war against Mexico in 1846 that saw US troops occupy Mexico City and annex enormous swaths of territory, including modern-day California, Nevada, and New Mexico.</p><p>Later, during the Mexican Revolution, from 1910 to 1920, US Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson worked with conservative forces in Mexico to overthrow the country’s pro-reform president.</p><p>US forces also bombed the port city of Veracruz in 1914 and sent forces into northern Mexico to hunt down revolutionary leader Pancho Villa.</p><p>“These are seen as important moments in Mexican history,” said Piccato.</p><p>“There is a quote attributed to Mexican President Porfirio Diaz, ‘Poor Mexico. So far from God, so close to the United States.'”</p><p>In recent statements, Trump has linked the US’s history in the region to his present-day agenda. While announcing Saturday’s strike, he cited the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century policy that the US has used to assert primacy over the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>“The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot. They now call it the ‘Donroe Doctrine’,” Trump said.</p><p>On Monday, the US State Department also <a href=\"https://x.com/StateDept/status/2008221563888292207?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared</a> an image of Trump on social media with the caption: “This is OUR hemisphere.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"balancing-on-a-thin-wire\">‘Balancing on a thin wire’</h2><p>Sheinbaum’s insistence on Mexican sovereignty has not prevented her from offering concessions to Trump on key priorities, such as migration, security and commerce.</p><p>When faced with Trump’s threats of 25 percent tariffs last February, Sheinbaum <a href=\"https://x.com/Claudiashein/status/1886434747238514776\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agreed</a> to deploy 10,000 Mexican National Guard troops to her country’s border with the US, to help limit irregular immigration and drug-trafficking.</p><p>Mexico has also maintained close security ties with the US and cooperated in its operations against criminal groups<strong>,</strong> including through the extradition of some drug traffickers.</p><p>In February, for instance, Sheinbaum’s government extradited 29 criminal suspects that the US accused of drug trafficking and other charges. In August, it sent another 26 suspects to the US, earning a statement of gratitude from the Trump administration.</p><p>Washington has historically pressured Mexico to take a hardline stance towards combating drugs, leading to policies that some Mexicans blame for increasing violence and insecurity in their country.</p><p>Still, while Sheinbaum has received praise for managing relations with Trump, she has consistently said that unilateral US military action on Mexican territory would be a red line.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Experts say Sheinbaum’s willingness to cooperate should be an incentive for the US government not to launch attacks on Mexican soil.</p><p>“Sheinbaum has gone out of her way to cooperate with the US,” said Stephanie Brewer, the director of the Mexico programme at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a US-based research group. “There would be no rational reason to break this bilateral relationship by crossing the one red line Mexico has set out.”</p><p>But the strikes on Venezuela have also underscored the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive posture towards Latin America.</p><p>“I don’t think US strikes on Mexican territory are any more or less likely than they were before the attacks in Venezuela,” said Brewer. “But they do make it abundantly clear that the Trump administration’s threats need to be taken seriously, and that the US is willing to violate international law in its use of military force.”</p><p>“Sheinbaum is doing a balancing act on an increasingly thin wire,” she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

There’s not much of a precedent for this kind of thing, to say the least, at least not in the US,” Montgomery told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Analysts say restoring Venezuela’s production to anything close to its 1990s peak of more than three million bpd would require massive investment and could take years.</p><p>Venezuela’s oil sector would need capital investment of about $110bn to return to output of about two million bpd, according to an estimate by Rystad Energy, a Norway-based consultancy.</p><p>“A significant amount of upfront scientific and engineering work has to be done to understand the condition of the productive reservoirs – these have changed over time, with key properties altered,” Montgomery said.</p><p>Some market watchers are sceptical that US companies will commit to large investments in the country, given their experiences of asset seizures under Chavez and the glut of oil in the global market.</p><p>ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were awarded $1.6bn and $8.7bn, respectively, in international arbitration following the Chavez government’s nationalisation of the country’s last privately-operated oil fields in 2007. Venezuela’s government did not pay out in either case.</p><p>Chevron is the only major US oil company still operating in Venezuela, producing about 150,000 bpd.</p><p>Venezuela once ranked among the world’s top oil producers, but US sanctions and years of underinvestment, mismanagement, and corruption under Maduro and Chavez reduced the sector to a shadow of its former self.</p><p>While the Latin American country holds the largest known oil reserves, its current output accounts for less than 1 percent of global supply.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The offensive has been broadly condemned as a <a href=\"/features/2026/1/5/what-the-us-did-in-venezuela-normalises-power-grabs-expert\">violation of international law</a>.</p><p>Venezuela on Tuesday released a list of the 24 soldiers killed in the predawn assault. Cuba also announced that 32 members of its military had died. Rodriguez declared a seven-day period of mourning to commemorate the fallen military members.</p><p>Since seizing Maduro from his residence, the administration of US President Donald Trump has offered little clarity about its plans for Venezuela.</p><p>Trump said on Saturday that the US would “run” Venezuela, a statement US Secretary of State Marco Rubio walked back the next day.</p><p>The top diplomat instead said that US officials would guide the “direction” of how the country is run and use sanctions and an ongoing embargo to force more access to Venezuela’s oil industry.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rubio, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine briefed a bipartisan group of Congress members on Monday about the Venezuela operation.</p><p>But several lawmakers said that the administration had offered scarce insight into its justification for conducting the strike without first seeking approval from Congress, much less its plans for Venezuela’s future.</p><p>“This briefing, while very extensive and long, posed far more questions than it ever answered,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterwards.</p><p>On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Trump ally in the Republican Party, said the next few days would show Venezuela’s “government structure and how willing they are to work with the US”.</p><p>In a social media post, Thune called Rodriguez a “practical person, pragmatic person” who “will understand the importance of figuring out a path forward to where America’s national security priorities can be prioritized by Venezuela”.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, offered few new details on the operation during a retreat with Republicans on Tuesday, beyond praising the abduction as an “amazing military feat” and “brilliant tactically”.</p><p data-start=\"153\" data-end=\"480\">Speaking from exile in Miami, Florida, former Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said the country had a “wonderful and incredible opportunity”.</p><p data-start=\"482\" data-end=\"776\">Guaido, who fled Venezuela in 2023, said that rebuilding the country’s democracy would allow millions of Venezuelans to return, and help “bring back to life the oil fields” and restore prosperity.</p><p data-start=\"811\" data-end=\"1067\">He condemned Rodriguez as “an acting dictator”, describing the current period as “a phase of transition” that will only be complete “once the rule of law has been reinstalled”.</p><h2 id=\"unease-in-caracas\">Unease in Caracas</h2><p>In Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, crowds gathered on Tuesday for a state-organised display of support for the government.</p><p>Some marchers flashed “V” victory signs. Hardline Minister of Interior Diosdado Cabello – who, like Maduro, has been indicted by the US Department of Justice – was seen wading through the gathering. He wore a blue cap emblazoned with the slogan, “To doubt is to betray.”</p><p>But Noris Argotte Soto, a Venezuelan reporter in Caracas, told Al Jazeera that the situation in the capital continues to be tense, with most residents staying inside their homes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“In the peripheral areas of the city, everybody remains at home. The tension is rising; people are on edge. And people are very much afraid of going out into the streets, mostly because [of] the security forces that we see at the main points of the city,” she said.</p><p>Soto added that government-aligned paramilitaries have been working alongside the military in recent days to maintain security and crack down on potential dissent.</p><p>“They were working yesterday with the security forces,” she said.</p><p>“They were basically bullying people, intimidating people, searching their cars, even demanding their cell phones to check their messages, check their social media.”</p><h2 id=\"regional-uncertainty\">Regional uncertainty</h2><p>Anxiety was also felt across the region, as the Trump administration has upped its threats against Venezuela’s neighbour, Colombia, as well as the island of Greenland in the northern Atlantic.</p><p>In the aftermath of Saturday’s attack, Trump said he had not ruled out an attack on Colombia for allegedly failing to tamp down on the illegal drug trade.</p><p>He described the country’s president, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/colombias-petro-promises-to-defend-homeland-amid-trump-threats\">Gustavo Petro</a>, who has been a vocal critic of US operations in Venezuela, as a “sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”.</p><p>On Tuesday, Colombia’s Foreign Affairs Minister Rosa Yolanda Villavicencio announced she will meet with the US Embassy’s charge d’affaires in Bogota to present a formal complaint over the recent US “threats”.</p><p>Villavicencio said she hopes to reassure the Trump administration “about all that we are doing in the fight against drug trafficking”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Greenland and Denmark also called for an expedited meeting with Rubio on Tuesday to “discuss the significant statement made by the United States”, Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, wrote on social media.</p><p>In the wake of Maduro’s abduction, Trump again floated taking control of Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.</p><p>Trump aide Stephen Miller later said that Washington has a right to seize sovereign territories if it deems such moves to be in its national interest.</p><p>The statement was in line with a White House national security strategy released in December, which pledged to re-establish US “pre-eminence” in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>The White House on Tuesday again said it was exploring options to seize Greenland, adding that “utilizing the US military is always an option”.</p><p>An array of European countries, as well as Canada, have rushed to support Greenland, noting that Denmark is a NATO member. Therefore, an attack on the island would constitute an attack on the entire bloc.</p><p>On Tuesday, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom joined with Denmark to issue a joint statement denouncing Trump’s remarks.</p><p>“Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” the statement said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The protesters appeared to have vastly outnumbered the security personnel deployed to contain them.</p><p class=\"s5\">In the city of Ilam, the province’s capital, videos showed security forces storming the Imam Khomeini Hospital to root out and arrest protesters, something rights group Amnesty International said violates international law and again shows “how far the Iranian authorities are willing to go to crush dissent”.</p><p></p><p class=\"s5\">The hospital became a target after protests in the county of Malekshahi earlier this week, where multiple <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/a-timeline-of-protests-in-iran-after-the-1979-islamic-revolution\">demonstrators were shot dead</a> while gathering at the entrance of a military base. Some wounded protesters were taken to the hospital.</p><p class=\"s5\">Several graphic videos from the scene of the shooting circulating online showed people being sprayed with live fire and falling to the ground as they fled from the gate. The local governor said the shooting is under investigation.</p><p class=\"s5\">State-linked media confirmed that at least three people were killed. They also announced on Tuesday that a police officer was shot dead after armed clashes took place in the aftermath of funeral processions for the dead protesters.</p><p class=\"s5\">In Tehran, numerous videos showed traders and business owners at the Grand Bazaar, who closed down their shops, clashing with security forces in riot gear with batons and using tear gas.</p><p class=\"s5\">People could be heard chanting “freedom” in the bazaar and shouting “dishonourable” at police officers. “Execute me if you want, I’m not a rioter,” one man shouted when pressured by security forces, to cheers and clapping from the crowd.</p><h2 id=\"show-no-mercy\">‘Show no mercy’</h2><p class=\"s8\">Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, in his first reaction to the protests this week, that rioters must be “put in their place”.</p><p class=\"s8\">Meanwhile, Chief Justice Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei said, “We will show no mercy to rioters this time.”</p><p class=\"s5\">The situation was similarly tense in adjacent streets and neighbourhoods, where the protests were <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/protests-strikes-after-irans-economic-situation-rapidly-deteriorates\">originally started by shopkeepers</a> on December 28. Multiple other major shopping areas in Tehran saw huge strikes and protests on Tuesday, including Yaftabad, where police were met with shouted slogans, “Neither Gaza nor Lebanon; my life for Iran”.</p><p>Iran’s government has been accused of providing support for armed groups in Gaza and Lebanon.</p><p class=\"s5\">More clashes were recorded around the Sina Hospital in downtown Tehran, but the Tehran University of Medical Science said in a statement that the tear gas canisters filmed inside the hospital compound were not thrown by security forces.</p><p class=\"s5\">Demonstrations also occurred in Lorestan and Kermanshah in the west; Mashhad in the northeast; Qazvin, south of the capital; the city of Shahrekord in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari to the southwest; and the city of Hamedan, where a woman was filmed braving a police water cannon in the winter cold.</p><p>A foreign-based human rights monitor opposed to the theocratic establishment in Iran claimed at least 35 people have been killed in the protests so far.

But the oil price jump was very sudden, prompting the government to announce official prices of its own, though it remains to be seen whether the market will listen.</p><p class=\"s5\">Using the resources to be freed from eliminating the cheaper subsidised currency, the government has offered to allocate online credits, each amounting to 10 million rials ($7 at the current exchange rate), to help people buy food.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"s5\">Two renowned singers, Homayoun Shajarian and Alireza Ghorbani, joined the ranks of many people and celebrities online who said they would stop their professional activities, including scheduled concerts, in solemn observance and support for the protests.</p><p class=\"s5\">“How can our officials lay down their heads and sleep?” asked Ali Daei, a <a href=\"/news/2022/11/15/iran-football-legend-daei-will-not-attend-world-cup-amid-protests\">legend of Iranian football</a> and a respected national figure among the people, in a video interview released on Tuesday that is going viral.</p><p class=\"s5\">“Perhaps many of them are not even Iranians, since they don’t feel sympathy for the Iranian nation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
