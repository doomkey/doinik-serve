Those talks did not yield a breakthrough.</p><p>“This time, the idea is to discuss a broader range of issues, including, in fact, the main ones,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. “The main issues concern both the territories and everything else related to the demands we have put forward,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ukraine, meanwhile, said Russia was unwilling to compromise and wants to keep fighting.</p><p>“Even on the eve of the trilateral meetings in Geneva, the Russian army has no orders other than to continue striking Ukraine. This speaks volumes about how Russia regards the partners’ diplomatic efforts,” Zelenskyy said in a social media post on Monday.</p><p>“Only with sufficient pressure on Russia and clear security guarantees for Ukraine can this war realistically be brought to an end,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"serious-intentions\">‘Serious’ intentions</h2><p>The Russia-Ukraine war has spiralled into Europe’s deadliest conflict since 1945, with tens of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes and many Ukrainian cities, towns and villages devastated by the fighting.</p><p>Russia occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before the 2022 invasion. It wants Ukrainian troops to withdraw from swaths of heavily fortified and strategic territory as part of any peace deal. Kyiv has rejected the demand, which would be politically and militarily fraught, and has instead demanded robust security guarantees from the West.</p><p>The Kremlin said the Russian delegation would be led by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>However, the fact that Ukrainian negotiators have accused Medinsky in the past of lecturing them about history as an excuse for Russia’s invasion ⁠has further lowered expectations for any significant breakthrough in Geneva.</p><p>Military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov will also take part in the talks, while Putin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitriev will be part of a separate ⁠working group on economic issues.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Vladmir Sotnikov, a political scientist based in Moscow, said the Russian team will consist of about 20 people, many more than delegations in previous rounds of talks.</p><p>“I think the Russian intentions are serious. Because you know, the situation here in Russia is that ordinary people are just tired of this war,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kyiv’s delegation will be led by Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Kyrylo Budanov. Senior presidential aide Serhiy Kyslytsya will ‌also be present.</p><p>Before the delegation left for Geneva, Umerov said Ukraine’s goal of “a sustainable and lasting peace” remained unchanged.</p><p>As well as land, Russia and Ukraine also remain far apart on issues such as who should control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the ‌possible ‌role of Western troops in post-war Ukraine.</p><p>US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will represent the Trump administration at the talks, according to the Reuters news agency. They are also attending talks in Geneva this week with Iran.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And they’ll be very important,” he said. “Iran is a very tough negotiator.”</p><p>Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran had learned the consequences of its tough approach last June, when the US joined in Israel’s 12-day war on Iran and bombed three of its nuclear sites.</p><p>The attacks came amid indirect talks between Iran and the US on Tehran’s nuclear programme and resulted in their derailment.</p><p>However, Trump suggested Tehran was motivated to negotiate this time. “I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite the US president’s comments about Iran seeking an agreement, the talks face major potential stumbling blocks. Washington has demanded that Tehran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil and has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues, such as Iran’s missile stockpile.</p><p>But Tehran, which insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, has said it is only willing to discuss curbs on its programme in exchange for sanctions relief. It has said it will not accept zero uranium ‌enrichment and that its missile capabilities are off the table.</p><h2 id=\"fair-and-equitable-deal\">‘Fair and equitable deal’</h2><p>Araghchi, who arrived in Geneva earlier on Monday, said he was in the city “with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal”. He added, in a post on X, “What is not on the table: submission before threats.”</p><p>The Iranian diplomat also met with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, in Geneva for a round of technical discussions. Tehran had suspended cooperation with the United Nations watchdog body after the US and Israel’s attacks on its nuclear sites.</p><p>The IAEA has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440kg (970 pounds) of highly-enriched uranium following the Israeli-US strikes and to let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.</p><p>Tehran has allowed IAEA some access to the sites that were not damaged, but has not allowed inspectors to visit other sites, citing a potential risk of radiation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Tehran, said there was “optimism” in the Iranian capital ahead of the talks.</p><p>“Officials here say the Iranian delegation in Geneva includes fully authorised economic, legal, political and technical teams. This signals that the Iranian side is ready for some serious concessions, particularly regarding its nuclear programme,” he said.</p><p>But Serdar noted that the talks come in the face of a massive US military build-up in the region, which continues to grow. The Iranians, too, he said, were not “stepping back”, with the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launching military drills in the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf on Monday.</p><p>Iran has ⁠repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, in retaliation against any attack. The move would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.</p><p>Iran has also threatened to strike US military bases in the region in the event of an attack, promoting concerns of a wider war.</p><p>“This military escalation is going on in parallel with the diplomatic engagement. The regional countries are also stepping up diplomacy, because they have their concerns and they have their own fears,” Serdar said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Paul Morcos on Monday comes amid growing pressure from the United States and Israel for <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/lebanons-mission-to-complete-disarmament-plan-of-hezbollah\">Hezbollah to disarm</a>, including near-daily Israeli attacks on Lebanon.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span

Hezbollah.</p><p>The conflict left the Lebanese armed group badly weakened, with much of its leadership killed.</p><p>Under the ceasefire deal, Lebanon’s government committed to dismantling Hezbollah’s arsenal and tasked its military with drawing up a plan to do so.</p><p>The military said last month that it had <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/first-phase-of-hezbollahs-disarmament-close-to-complete-lebanons-salam\">completed the first phase</a> of the five-stage plan, covering the area between the Litani River and the country’s southern border with Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The second phase concerns the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, about 40km (25 miles) south of the Lebanese capital, Beirut.</p><p>Morcos, Lebanon’s information minister, told a news conference after a cabinet session that the government “took note of the army leadership’s presentation” on the second stage of the plan.</p><p>“There is a timeframe of four months, extendable depending on available capabilities, Israeli attacks and hindrances on the ground,” he said.</p><p>Hezbollah, which has dismissed efforts to disarm it as a US-Israeli plan, has rejected calls to surrender weapons north of the Litani River, saying it understands the ceasefire agreement to apply “exclusively south” of the waterway.</p><p>Before the cabinet session on Monday, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said that “what the Lebanese government is doing in focusing on disarmament is a grave sin, because this issue serves the goals of the Israeli aggression”.</p><p>“Stop all action to restrict weapons,” he added in a televised address, saying the government’s “successive concessions” were partly to blame for Israel’s persistent attacks.</p><p>Qassem’s comments came as the Israeli military launched new raids on southern Lebanon, striking a bus in the town of Hanine and a car in the town of Talloussah, killing at least two people.</p><p>The Israeli military confirmed the attack on Talloussah, saying it had targeted a Hezbollah fighter who was trying to rebuild the group’s infrastructure in southern Lebanon.</p><p>Israel has previously criticised the Lebanese military’s progress on disarming Hezbollah as insufficient.</p><p>In addition to the regular strikes, it also continues to occupy five areas in Lebanese territory, blocking the reconstruction of destroyed border villages and preventing tens of thousands of displaced people from returning to their homes.</p><p>According to Lebanese authorities, Israeli forces have killed more than 370 people since the ceasefire, while the United Nations said Israel has launched more than 10,000 air and ground attacks in the year since it agreed to halt hostilities.</p><p>Lebanon <a

a complaint</a> with the UN last month about the repeated Israeli violations, urging the UN Security Council to push Israel to end its attacks and fully withdraw from the country.</p><p>The complaint

Israeli army officers called by the family to enforce the ruling, issued two weeks prior, sided with the attackers.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“The ruling was supposed to make things better for us, but the opposite happened,” Ballal told Al Jazeera on Monday. “Israeli authorities did nothing to enforce the decision, but joined the settlers in the attack.”</p><p>One of his brothers was held in a chokehold by an army officer and later hospitalised with breathing difficulties. Four other relatives – two brothers, a nephew, and a cousin – were detained for several hours as they arrived at the scene. They have all since been released.</p><p>The Palestinian film director said his family was ambushed by the same Israeli settler who led an attack against him as he returned from the Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles last March. Then, he had been <a href=\"/news/2025/3/26/palestinian-oscar-winner-feared-for-his-life-during-israeli-settler-attack\">taken away in a blindfold</a> by a group of Israeli settlers and army officers and released a day later with injuries to his head and stomach, leading to global condemnation.</p><p>Ballal said the retaliation for the documentary has since been directed against his family, rather than himself, to avoid media attention. His relatives have been routinely prevented from grazing sheep and ploughing the land. At times, they have been arrested, questioned about his work and whereabouts, or intimidated to vacate their homes.</p><p>“My family is paying because of me; because I shared the movie and I shared the truth,” he said.</p><p>The film, which won the Oscar for best documentary on March 2, follows Palestinian journalist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham as they try to protect Palestinian homes amid tensions with settlers in Masafer Yatta in the South Hebron Hills. Israeli filmmaker Rachel Szor also shares directing credits.</p><p>Israeli settlers in the area often graze their animals on Palestinian land to assert control, signal unrestricted access, and lay the groundwork for establishing illegal outposts, cutting Palestinians off from their farms and livestock.</p><p>The Israeli army argues that it has to demolish the Palestinian villages to convert the area into a military “firing” or training zone. It did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on Sunday’s incident.</p><p>Across the occupied West Bank, Israel’s far-right coalition government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been openly promoting new measures to expand Israeli control over the Palestinian territory.</p><p>Most recently, it announced the resumption of the land <a href=\"/news/2026/2/15/israel-approves-proposal-to-register-west-bank-lands-as-state-property\">registration processes</a> for the first time since 1967, which Israeli rights groups say will accelerate the dispossession and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/israels-move-to-register-land-systematises-dispossession-of-palestinians\">displacement of Palestinians</a> in violation of international law.</p><h2 id=\"right-to-live\">‘Right to live’</h2><p>Ballal’s family has not been the only one to pay the price for the acclaimed documentary.</p><p>Adra, the Palestinian protagonist in the film, had his home in at-Tawani raided by the Israeli army in September, after clashes broke out with a group of Israeli settlers that trespassed in his olive grove.</p><p>In July, Awdah Hathaleen, an activist, football player and a consultant for No Other Land, was <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/who-was-awdah-hathaleen-palestinian-activist-killed-by-an-israeli-settler\">shot dead, in the chest</a>, in the village of Umm al-Khair.

His assailant, Israeli settler <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/who-was-awdah-hathaleen-palestinian-activist-killed-by-an-israeli-settler\">Yinon Levi</a>, later said, “I’m glad I did it,” according to witnesses.</p><p>Ballal said he does not hesitate to describe these attacks as being “terrorist”, as they leave the Palestinian community in Masafer Yatta constantly fearing for their safety.</p><p>“It’s a simple right for Palestinians to feel safe in their homes,” he told Al Jazeera. “We are scared; we are in danger, and it’s been like this for a long time.”</p><p>“International law doesn’t work for Palestinians,” he continued. “But we are human, and we have a right to live.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The remaining 95 percent of staff will remain on duty but will work without pay until the DHS is funded.</p><p>Earlier this month, Democrats sent Republicans a list of 10 demands to rein in immigration enforcement. In a letter, authored by House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the politicians called for increased oversight of the DHS.</p><p>The letter called for DHS officers not to enter private property without a judicial warrant and to require verification that someone is not a US citizen before placing them in immigration detention.

It is critical that we come together to impose common sense reforms and accountability measures that the American people are demanding.”</p><p>Tom Homan, Trump’s border chief, dismissed the calls from Democrats on CBS’s Face the Nation, referring to the requests as “unreasonable”.</p><p>Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, meanwhile, echoed Homan’s stance. On CNN’s current affairs programme, State of the Union, he claimed that Democrats are engaging in “political theatre”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Duvall played the off-kilter, surfing-obsessed Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore.</p><p>The character’s famous line, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”, became legendary.</p><p>In all, Duvall appeared in almost 100 movies. And when he grew weary of Hollywood, he made his own films. He wrote, directed and won an Oscar acting nomination for The Apostle, the story of a conflicted preacher.</p><p>Duvall did the same with Assassination Tango, a movie that allowed him to exhibit his passion for the tango and Argentina, where he met his fourth wife, Luciana Pedraza.</p><p>In later life, Duvall split his time between Los Angeles, Argentina and a farm in Virginia, where he converted the barn into a tango dance hall.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He says he doesn’t need a calendar to know what day of the month it is. By the time his salary and that of his wife, who also works full time in a shop, run out, it is around the 15th.</p><p>From then on, they look for extra jobs, find things to sell, use their credit cards, and get small loans to pay for basics, including food, until the next paycheques arrive.</p><p>“I have never experienced anything like this,” Nacasio told Al Jazeera. “Over the past 25 years, we have worked hard, and our jobs allowed us to build a house from scratch, buy a car and give our 17-year-old son a decent life. Now, we have better jobs than we did then, and still cannot even afford food for the whole month.”</p><p>“Living on credit puts you in a very dangerous cycle. It’s very easy to fall behind with payments, and then it is a matter of chasing your own tail. Most people I know are in the same situation. We are living in a constant state of stress and anxiety, and it feels like there’s no way out.”</p><p>Nacasio’s story has become increasingly common in Argentina, where nearly half of the people say they are using savings, selling belongings or borrowing money from banks or relatives to cover basics, according to a report by Argentina Grande based on the latest official figures available. Another report, from Fundacion Pensar, found that 63 percent of Argentines have cut down on activities or services to make ends meet.</p><p>“The current situation in Argentina is extremely concerning. It is particularly worrying to see that even people who have one or several jobs are getting loans not to buy a house, a car or white goods [appliances], but to buy food,” Violeta Carrera Pereyra, sociologist and researcher at the Argentina Grande Institute and one of the authors of the report, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"a-tale-of-two-cities\">A tale of two cities</h2><p>Argentina’s President Javier Milei, who took office in December 2023, says his austerity economic plan, based on achieving fiscal balance while building up reserves of United States currency through drastic cuts to public spending, has revitalised the economy and lifted millions of people out of poverty. He is backed by the International Monetary Fund, which, despite Argentina’s record levels of foreign loans, projects an economic growth of four percent in 2026 and 2027.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4318092\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4318092\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Patricio-A.-Cabezas-%E2%80%93-Diego-Nacasio-works-full-time-as-a-salesman-at-a-large-hardware-store-in-Florencio-Varela-%E2%80%93-Al-jazeera-1771264486.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4318092\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Patricio-A.-Cabezas-%E2%80%93-Diego-Nacasio-works-full-time-as-a-salesman-at-a-large-hardware-store-in-Florencio-Varela-%E2%80%93-Al-jazeera-1771264486.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Diego Nacasio works full time as a salesman at a large hardware store in Florencio Varela in Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4318092\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diego Nacasio works full time as a salesman at a large hardware store in Florencio Varela, but needs to take loans to make ends meet [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>But a closer look at the figures shows a different, more sombre, picture.</p><p>While economic activity in Argentina has increased overall, growth has been uneven. In November 2025, the most recent month for which data is available, sectors such as banking and agriculture saw growth, but manufacturing and commerce experienced sharp declines, with many factories and shops closing due to falling demand. Consumption, particularly of food, has been falling, with a 12.5 percent drop reported by independent food retailers.</p><p>Then there’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/25/milei-tames-inflation-but-argentines-still-struggle-to-afford-basics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflation</a>, a key variable that in Argentina needs to be kept at bay in order to access essential foreign credit.</p><p>While Milei’s shock economic plan managed to significantly reduce inflation from record-high figures when he first took office in late 2023, experts say his administration has taken some <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/milei-vetoes-pension-disability-spending-increases-as-argentina-feels-cuts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">controversial measures</a> to keep it low. This includes forcing salaries to remain stagnant and under the rate of inflation, and opening the country up to cheaper imports. These policies have left many without money to spend and forced thousands of factories and small businesses to close.</p><p>Critics also say inflation figures are not representative of real price fluctuations. The tool used to measure inflation in Argentina, a sample basket of goods people consume, was developed in 2004 and does not reflect current consumption patterns, including the percentage that items like electricity and fuel – two areas that have seen price hikes considerably higher than inflation – represent in people’s real spending habits.</p><p>Carrera Pereyra says that figures also show that the rapid changes in Argentina’s economy have widened inequalities.</p><p>“On the one hand, we see that some sectors are able to consume more, so we see a rise in the sales of properties, cars, motorbikes, some as a result of the opening of imports,” she said. “But on the other hand, items like food and medicines are decreasing. So, some people can buy more things than before, while others are struggling to put food on the table.”</p><h2 id=\"an-obstacle-course\">An obstacle course</h2><p>Many Argentines who spoke with Al Jazeera said that making ends meet has become nothing short of an obstacle course. Juggling multiple demanding jobs, selling used items such as clothing, borrowing from relatives, seeking shark loans and bargain hunting have become a regular part of daily life.</p><p>“Shopping for food has become a job in itself,”  said Veronica Malfitano, 43, a teacher and trade unionist, whose salary was cut by a quarter when Milei slashed public spending. “I team up with relatives or people I work with, and we buy in bulk. I use my credit card or get small loans. This month, for the first time, I have only paid the credit card’s minimum, something I had never done before. It’s all very stressful. Everybody I know is in the same situation.”</p><p>Research confirms Malfitano is not alone. Nearly half of supermarket purchases in Argentina are paid with credit cards, a record, according to recent official data.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4318096\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4318096\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Patricio-A.-Cabezas-%E2%80%93-A-street-advertisement-offering-loans-outside-the-banking-system-with-very-high-interest-rates-%E2%80%93-Al-Jazeera-1771264652.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4318096\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Patricio-A.-Cabezas-%E2%80%93-A-street-advertisement-offering-loans-outside-the-banking-system-with-very-high-interest-rates-%E2%80%93-Al-Jazeera-1771264652.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A street advertisement in Argentina offering loans outside the banking system with very high interest rates\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4318096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A street advertisement in Argentina offers loans – one sign of the proliferation of informal lenders, which experts say has created a ‘dangerous situation’ [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Both borrowing and default rates have increased. It is estimated that around 11 percent of personal loans are unpaid, the highest rate since the Central Bank of Argentina began keeping records in 2010, according to Central Bank data.</p><p>Griselda Quipildor, 49, who lives with her husband, two daughters and two grandchildren, says that even though several people in her family work, money usually runs out by the 18th of every month and they have to start taking loans.</p><p>“At the start of the month, we pay debts, the bills and then the money runs out and we have to start borrowing again. It’s an endless vicious circle, one that is very difficult to get away from. We borrow from people we know and people we don’t know. It wasn’t like this before.”</p><p>Lucia Cavallero, an analyst, economics expert, and member of Movida Ciudad, told Al Jazeera that even though Argentina’s economic problems are longstanding, their impact on people’s homes is worsening.</p><p>“Debt has long been a serious problem in Argentina, and it has now become a crisis,” she said. “The proliferation of informal lenders has created a dangerous situation, leaving many people with no other options.”</p><p>In response, a political party has proposed a bill that would help people in lower-income sectors unify their loans and apply for a long-term payment plan at lower rates.</p><p>Cavallero says there are some positive aspects to the initiative, but that it largely misses the central point.</p><p>“It is good to see the political class recognising that debts are a serious problem for people,” she said. “However, this approach follows the logic of borrowing to pay off debt. While it may provide temporary relief, deeper structural changes are needed.</p><p>“Just as banks are bailed out, we are calling for families to be supported. A more sustainable solution is for wages to keep pace with the cost of the basic basket, so that people do not have to go into debt just to afford food,” Cavallero told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Despite all the challenges he and his family face, Nacasio says many people like himself still count themselves lucky.</p><p>“At least we own our house,” he said. “If we didn’t and we had to pay rent, I don’t know what we would do. I just need things to change, for us and for everybody. Things cannot continue like this.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

And Kerala, being among the states with the highest emigration rate in India, is largely dependent on workers from other regions to run its industries.</p><p>All businesses, including the beautiful tea, coffee, rubber, spice and coconut plantations spread across the state, are heavily dependent on workers from neighbouring or northern and eastern areas of India, with Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha among the top origins.</p><p>According to the United Nations, India recorded the highest number of people migrating abroad – more than 6.63 million – in 2024. There is no readily available data on migration within the country in recent years, as the census, which remains the primary source of information in India, was last conducted in 2011.</p><p>However, talk to people working in shops, factories, or any of these farms, and the chances are high that you will come across workers from other states.</p><p>Rajkumar Jani, a 23-year-old botany graduate from Odisha, is among them. Working at a tea garden in the hilly, verdant Wayanad, he did not have much time to spare as he wanted to pluck as many tender tea leaves as he could to meet the target he set for himself.</p><p>“We don’t work for a salary. Our earnings depend on the quantity of tea leaves we collect. So no work, no payment,” Jani says, gliding his harvesting shears along the top layer of the tea plants, careful to pluck only fresh, flavourful green leaves.</p><p>Asked how he landed in Kerala, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) from his hometown, Koraput in Odisha, Jani said he needed a job to support his family, and there were no decent work offers back home. He got the opportunity through his friend and coworker, Shyam Kalpadia, 26, also from Koraput.</p><p>“I was the first to come here six years ago. I came here looking for opportunities as many people from my hometown were arriving here for jobs,” says Kalpadia, who introduced many others to the tea industry in the southern state, including Rutu Nandiwali, 23, and 18-year-old Lakshman Kumar, who were all busy harvesting with him in the picturesque setting.</p><p>For Kalpadia, a decent income was the main reason behind moving to Kerala. He said he made 1,500 to 2,000 rupees ($17-$22) a day, much more than he could earn in Odisha, a state with a high poverty rate. In addition to providing payments, employers also arrange accommodation and some provisions for the workers – additional benefits – allowing them to save some money for home.</p><p>Being in “God’s own country” – a term coined in the 1980s to define Kerala’s abundant natural beauty, including its serene backwaters, lush greenery, rich flora and fauna, and long stretches of beaches, often linked to local legends in which the land was created by the gods – was another motivation for Kalpadia.</p><p>“This place is so beautiful. Wherever you go, it’s so green. People are also nice here,” he said.</p><p>Moreover, having studied botany, Jani found the job interesting, and somewhat related to his subject. This made him more passionate about his work.</p><p>“This place gets a lot of rain. It makes our work more challenging on these hilly slopes. But we avoid taking days off. What would we do sitting at home? Work not only pays, but it also keeps us entertained,” Jani says, smiling as he stacks the sacks of tea leaves.</p></div></div></body></html>"
