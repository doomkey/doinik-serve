The Civil War spanned from 1861 to 1865, and nearly 700,000 soldiers were killed.</p><p>The proclamation for the national holiday came about after a campaign led by <a href=\"https://www.npca.org/articles/5393-the-woman-behind-thanksgiving#:~:text=%2C%20and%20plenty.%E2%80%9D-,Abraham%20Lincoln,death%20of%20her%20lawyer%20husband.\">Sarah Hale</a>, a poet, editor and activist, that began in 1846. She’s most commonly known as the author of Mary Had a Little Lamb.</p><p>But long before Lincoln’s proclamation or even Hale’s campaign, the tradition that was formalised as Thanksgiving was common in the original settler communities of New England.</p><h2 id=\"when-and-where-was-the-first-thanksgiving\">When and where was the first Thanksgiving?</h2><p>In 1606, England’s King James I divided the east coast of what is now the US into the London Company, which later became the Virginia Company of London, and the Plymouth Company. Both were joint-stock trading companies, much like the British East India Company, which was set up in India in 1608.</p><p>This was still more than a century and a half before the US was born.</p><p>The goals of these British trading companies were to find gold, search for trade routes and compete with other European powers.</p><p>The first settlement by the English in the New World was in 1607 when the Jamestown colony was established on the banks of the James River in present day Virginia. This was the ancestral home of the Powhatan Indigenous people.</p><p>In 1619, the first recorded African slaves were brought to the colony to work in the profitable tobacco fields.</p><p>Jamestown as a colony was ravaged by famine, disease and resistance from Indigenous communities.</p><p>On November 11, 1620, a group of 102 English families, known as the Pilgrims, reached present-day Provincetown Harbor, Massachusetts, before anchoring their ship, the Mayflower, in present-day Plymouth Harbour on December 16. The colonists named it New Plymouth, which was the home of the Wampanoag people.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135613\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135613\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135613\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0702036-1764251694.jpg?quality=80\" alt='\"Indian Tribes and Linguistic Stocks, 1650,\" is attributed to authors Charles O.

Altercations between the colonists and Indigenous people grew. Ultimately, the Native people fled, and the trade ecosystem that the Plymouth Colony had set up with the Indigenous communities broke down.</p><h2 id=\"1763-proclamation-by-the-king\">1763 – proclamation by the king</h2><p>Under the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Great Britain set aside resources for the Native people.

In the letter, Jefferson welcomed Mandan leaders to Washington, DC, and outlined a paternalistic vision in which Indigenous peoples would “mix with us by marriage”, eventually becoming absorbed into the expanding US.</p><p>Historians see this as a blueprint for the federal “civilisation” programme that became the effort to replace Indigenous sovereignty with American identity through trade dependency, intermarriage and cultural transformation.</p><h2 id=\"1830-indian-removal-act\">1830 – Indian Removal Act</h2><p>Half a century after the birth of the US, the Indian Removal Act of 1830, signed by President Andrew Jackson, authorised the federal government to negotiate treaties with Indigenous communities.</p><p>Land was identified west of the Mississippi River for communities that had been displaced from elsewhere. This resulted in the forced migration of Indigenous people from the East Coast inland and in some cases all the way to the present-day Midwest.</p><p>The forced displacement of five Indigenous peoples from the southeastern US to what is today Oklahoma is called the Trail of Tears because of its high death toll. Nearly 60,000 people were forced to move overland without much say about their own destiny. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people died along the way.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135631\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135631\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135631\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/native-american-removal-from-the-southeast-1764251911.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"From the book The Making of America, published by National Geographic Society © 2002, National Geographic Books\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From the book The Making of America, published by the National Geographic Society in 2002 [National Geographic Books]</figcaption></figure><p>Among the people caught up in these forced removals were the ancestors of Rene Locklere’s community, the Lumbee Nation from North Carolina.</p><p>Her tribe has been recognised by the state since 1885 but is not federally recognised. Native American tribes that are recognised have certain rights of self-government, are considered dependent nations within the US, and are eligible for federal subsidies and grants to fund healthcare, education, housing and infrastructure.</p><p>Locklere, 60, is a former US Air Force lieutenant colonel who lives in Virginia and maintains a home in her ancestral lands in North Carolina. She worked for the armed forces for nearly 20 years, and after she retired, she began a journey to get her tribe recognised by federal authorities.</p><p>“I took my combat boots off and put my moccasins back on to try to help our people as much as I can,” Locklear says.</p><p>Her tribe is almost 60,000 people strong, and she has been recently to Capitol Hill with help from North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis to fight for her tribe’s chance for federal recognition. The Lumbee Fairness Act, which would grant the Lumbee full federal recognition, passed the House of Representatives in December but is awaiting Senate and presidential approval.</p><p>“It’s not because of charity. It’s not. It’s not because we’re standing in line for a handout or anything like that. It was a part of a larger policy and a requirement of a government-to-government relationship with Indigenous people,” Locklear says.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"1849-gold-rush\">1849 – Gold Rush</h2><p>On the West Coast in present-day California, which was still part of Mexico at the time, gold was discovered in January 1848, and the following month, the US government signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, making it part of US territory.</p><p>The rush of people migrating to California in 1848 onwards was called the Gold Rush. Hundreds of thousands of people moved into the area, where Indigenous tribes and nations were already living.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135643\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135643\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135643\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iiif-service_gmd_gmd436_g4361_g4361h_mf000059-full-pct_25-0-default-1764252036.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Gold mines and mining--California-Maps/Library of Congress Geography and Map Division Washington, D.C.\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135643\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gold mines and mining [California-Maps/Library of Congress Geography and Map Division Washington, DC]</figcaption></figure><p>Charlene Njemeh, 53, is the chief of her tribe, the Mukame Ohlane, who trace their origins back to what is now Silicon Valley. Her ancestors lived during the influx of new residents during the Gold Rush.</p><p>Njemah says the original land of her nation is spread over five counties in present-day California. They are one of the many unrecognised tribes in the United States. Her mother was the chief before her.</p><p>“Our tribe has always been in a fight and a struggle to get a relationship with the government because that’s what federal recognition is. It’s a government-to-government relationship.”</p><p>The Mukame Ohalane people, like many other tribal nations, were forcibly pushed into the mission system, in which Catholic missions tried to convert them to Christianity.</p><h2 id=\"1851-indian-appropriations-act\">1851 – Indian Appropriations Act</h2><p>The 1851 Indian Appropriations Act marked a major turning point in US policy by creating the reservation system, which confined Indigenous nations to fixed parcels of land controlled by the federal government.</p><p>It ended the recognition of tribes as sovereign nations and paved the way for forced relocations, broken treaties and tighter military oversight. The act laid the groundwork for decades of displacement as tribes were pushed onto smaller, unfamiliar territories while white settlements rapidly expanded across the continent.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135655\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135655\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135655\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/service-gmd-gmd370-g3701-g3701g-ct002305-copy-1764252270.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Map showing Indian reservations within the limits of the United States | United States.

But the government instead carved up the new Native homelands into smaller, fixed allotments under federal oversight.</p><p>As their descendants grew, the size of individual land holdings shrank. “So there’s a lot of Natives here that have like a half an acre [2,023sq metres] left or a quarter of an acre [1,011sq metres] or they’ve lost all their land,” Carpella explains.</p><h2 id=\"indian-reorganization-act\">1939 – impact of Indian Reorganization Act</h2><figure id=\"attachment_4135671\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135671\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135671\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/service-gmd-gmd370-g3701-g3701g-ct002650-copy-1764252643.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Dept. of the Interior, Office of Indian Affairs, 1939.

Oklahoma, where Carpella lives, is a case in point.</p><p>A 2020 Supreme Court ruling declared a large portion of eastern Oklahoma as “Indian” country.</p><p>“But 80 percent of the people who live here are not Native and they live within cities, so it’s like this overlapping concept of municipalities on top of sovereign nations. And so you have regular police officers and then you have tribal police officers and then you have Bureau of Indian Affairs police officers,” he explained.</p><p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the US federal agency responsible for managing relations with American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, overseeing land, services and treaty obligations. It is housed within the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, and led by a presidentially appointed director. Many employees in the BIA are Natives, especially for tribal liaison, education and culture programmes.</p><p>As a result, Carpella says, there is a constant battle over jurisdiction. “Our cars have tribal plates, so police don’t want to stop us because we have a Native American licence plate,” he explains. If they are stopped, they have to call the tribal police, starting a time-consuming exercise.</p><p>“In our treaties, it says that Native people can hunt whenever we want wherever we want in Oklahoma in perpetuity without government intervening, but what happens is the state government will send out its wildlife officers to give tickets to individual citizens that are just out there hunting deer for their family,” he says.</p><h2 id=\"native-americans-today\">Native Americans today</h2><figure id=\"attachment_4135710\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135710\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135710\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/idc1-028635-1764253298.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Bureau of Indian Affairs -Department of Interior - US Government June 2016\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135710\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Bureau of Indian Affairs June 2016]</figcaption></figure><p>Carpella has spent the past 15 years putting together a map based on Native peoples’ voices and memories passed down from generation to generation about where their people came from and what languages they spoke.</p><p>This open source map is unique in the US. Carpella uses this map to do workshops in educational institutes to spread awareness. He copyrighted his map in 2012.</p><p>“I used to be an activist. I felt like I was outside of the fence, like shaking the fence trying to change at a city council meeting or at a school, trying to get them to change a racist mascot or something. And now I have these products that are in the schools changing minds,” Carpella says.</p><p>“It’s really good to see that there’s a growing awareness. I think 20 years ago, half of Americans didn’t even know that Native Americans still existed,” he says, citing polls that indicated at the time that about half of Americans thought Indigenous Americans were ”all gone”.</p><p>According to the 2020 US census, 9.6 million people in the US identify as having Native American heritage, which is an 85 percent increase from 2010. The growth is mainly attributed to how data are collected.</p><p>The blood quantum policy, created by the US government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, defined Native identity by calculating the fraction of “Indian blood” a person carried, often requiring at least one quarter to qualify. Many tribes say it is a colonial system that divides families and threatens the long-term survival of Native nations.</p><p>According to Locklear, there is no universal meaning of the word “Indian” in the United States.</p><p>“If both parents are Native, the child is considered 100 percent [Native],” he says. “If mixed-race parents, the child would be half, three-quarters, one-eighth or something like that.”</p><p>“Over time, blood quantum was a genocidal policy because it helps limit membership or citizenship over time,” Locklear says. “One of our sovereign powers is to decide who can be a Lumbee citizen. I think this right is essential to our ability to self-govern.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135687\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135687\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.tribalnationsmaps.com/\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135687\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Native-American-Nations-NO-Borders-1764252864.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Courtesy Tribal Nations/Aaron Carpella\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135687\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Courtesy Tribal Nations Maps/Aaron Carpella]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

It is not currently clear how these compounds could be expanded to accommodate all Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“If they [the US and Israel] could establish a proper situation, people might move there, but it’s not feasible,” Hussein, a Palestinian from Gaza City, said of the US plans. “What are they going to establish, with what infrastructure? It would need water, electricity. It would take years.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-will-pay\">Who will pay?</h2><p>Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza has killed more than <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/gaza-tracker\">69,700 Palestinians</a>. Now, more than a month after a ceasefire officially began in Gaza, there are still questions over what the next phase of the agreement will bring and when full-scale reconstruction will begin.</p><p>In the meantime, Israel continues to attack periodically, killing at least 347 people since the ceasefire began on October 10.</p><p>For those still alive, life is incredibly difficult. At least 1.9 million people in Gaza are displaced. Many of them have had to flee multiple times. Ninety-two percent of Gaza’s housing stock has been damaged or reduced to rubble, leaving hundreds of thousands of people living in tents, a particularly precarious situation as winter approaches.</p><p>The destruction of Gaza’s buildings has come as a result of Israeli air strikes and shelling as well as a systematic campaign to deliberately demolish vast swaths of the territory.</p><p>Officials quoted in The New York Times said the first ASC compound was still months away from completion. Israeli soldiers were expected to begin clearing an area around what remains of Rafah in the south this week. But that work could be delayed if tunnels, unexploded ordnance or human remains are encountered.</p><p>Two people involved in the project estimated that the cost for just the initial compound could reach tens of millions of dollars. Overall, the cost of reconstructing Gaza is expected to come to at least $70bn and take several decades. Where the funding for the reconstruction will come from is unclear.</p><p>Who will pay for the proposed ASCs is equally ambiguous. The administration of US President Donald Trump is reported to have ruled out funding their construction while Israeli politicians have yet to confirm their final position.</p><p>The US State Department spokesperson did not comment on the funding, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2933403\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2933403\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2933403\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-05-28T222239Z_441867712_RC2QZ7A9FVPY_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-USA-POLICY-1716968482.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A man looks on as Palestinians inspect a tent camp damaged in an Israeli strike during an Israeli military operation, in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2933403\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The remains of the southern city of Rafah, where the first compound is slated to be established [Hatem KhaledReuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"engineering-a-new-gaza\">Engineering a new Gaza</h2><p>While few Palestinians currently live in Gaza’s Israeli-controlled zone, US hopes are understood to rest on the idea that development, security and presumably access to medical care and welfare would be enough to draw people from other areas of Gaza.</p><p>But complicating US ambitions is that access to the “green zone” is heavily restricted for Palestinians, a situation that is likely to continue going forward.</p><p>According to The New York Times, Israeli security services are likely to conduct background checks on Palestinians seeking shelter in the new compounds, giving Israel a veto over who will be allowed in.</p><p>The outlet added that European diplomats have expressed concern that the eventual criteria could exclude large numbers of Palestinians, including civil servants, such as police and medical staff, who have worked under Hamas’s 18-year administration of the enclave as well as their family members.</p><p>And aid agencies said the idea of providing aid only to people in certain areas to the exclusion of others goes against humanitarian principles.</p><p>“We deliver aid where people are,” said Tamara Alrifai, the director of external relations for the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA. “We don’t provide services where we’d like people to be.

Critics have decried the move as an incendiary show of force out of step with the needs of the federal district.</p><p>A judge last week ruled that Trump’s deployment of the National Guard was illegal but delayed enforcement of the decision until December 11.</p><p class=\"p1\">After Thursday’s attack, the Trump administration quickly ordered 500 more National Guard soldiers to Washington, DC, adding to the nearly 2,200 military members already stationed there.</p><h2 id=\"revetting-afghans\">Revetting Afghans</h2><p>In the wake of the attack, the Trump administration <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/27/trump-to-review-afghan-immigrants-after-washington-dc-shooting\">pledged</a> to “re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under [Former President Joe] Biden”.</p><p>The administration also announced it was pausing all processing of “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals”.</p><p>On Thursday, Trump administration officials continued to focus on the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, which was conducted after a deal struck by Trump and the Taliban during the Republican leader’s first term.</p><p>During the withdrawal, the Biden administration launched Operation Allies Welcome to quickly relocate Afghans to the US, including those who had worked alongside US forces and Western entities in Afghanistan for more than two decades.</p><p>About 77,000 Afghans came to the US under the programme.</p><p>On Thursday, John Ratcliffe, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), said in a statement that the attacker had worked with the agency “as a member of a partner force” in the southern Taliban stronghold of Kandahar before coming to the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The attack has sparked fear for Afghan evacuees in the US and those still seeking relocation from Afghanistan after many were already reeling from the Trump administration’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/trump-administration-to-retroactively-vet-refugees-already-resettled-in-us\">hardline restrictions</a> on refugees and asylum seekers.</p><p>Many Afghans who worked with US and Western forces face threats of reprisals from the Taliban government.</p><p>In a statement, Shawn VanDiver, the president of the AfghanEvac humanitarian advocacy group, urged “the media, elected leaders and decision-makers and other people of influence not to demonize the Afghan community for the deranged choice this person made”.</p><p>Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, echoed that sentiment, saying the “entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual”.</p><p>“That would be terribly unjust and complete nonsense,” he said. “Cool heads must prevail.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Pereira had been preparing to stand as the main opposition candidate in the election, but his PAIGC party was barred after the electoral commission said it had failed to submit its application on time.

The former army general was first elected in 2019, backed by a coalition of parties known as Madem G15, which had separated from the then-ruling PAIGC party.</p><p>PAIGC, which launched an independence war against Portugal in 1974, has dominated the government in the decades since.</p><p>However, after Embalo was sworn in, in February 2020, the opposition challenged his victory and the Supreme Court did not recognise him as president until September 2020.</p><p>The president was subjected to what he called attempted coups in February 2022, December 2023, and in October this year, leading to multiple arrests, especially of military officers.</p><p>Embalo’s critics, however, have accused him of fabricating crises in order to crack down on dissent. Following the December 2023 coup attempt, for example, which began as a clash between a unit in the army and the presidential guard, Embalo ordered that the opposition-controlled parliament be dissolved. Parliament has not reconvened since, and Embalo has ruled through decrees.</p><p>In March, President Embalo announced he would again run for office, amid tensions with opposition groups who questioned his legitimacy.</p><p>He said he aimed to make history in the turbulent country by being the first leader in 30 years to secure a second consecutive term. But opposition groups said they did not recognise his presidency and accused him of delaying elections till November, when his mandate originally ended in February 2025. A Supreme Court ruling said Embalo’s term ended in September.</p><p>In October, PAIGC also accused Embalo of heavy-handed tactics after the party was barred from the vote on a technicality. It was the first time in the country’s history that the former governing party had been excluded from elections.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-the-election-go\">How did the election go?</h2><p>In the lead-up to Sunday’s tightly contested elections, Embalo campaigned on stability while the Pereira-backed Dias campaigned on change. Campaigns were marred by accusations of corruption and hate speech from both sides, but the votes passed without incident.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, both Embalo and Dias declared victory in the elections.</p><p>In a Facebook statement following the coup, PAIGC said the military intervention was an attempt to stop the electoral authority from declaring victory for Dias.</p><p>PAIGC “considers this fact as manoeuvres to disrupt the electoral process, which was already in the final stage of dissemination of provisional results”, the party said. It urged the electoral commission to go ahead and publish election results “which gave Dr Fernando Dias da Costa a big victory, assuring him victory right on the first lap”.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Bissau-Guinean civil society coalition, Frente Popular or Popular Front, also accused Embalo and the army of staging a “simulated coup” to block the release of election results.</p><p>“This manoeuvre aims to prevent the publication of the electoral results scheduled for tomorrow, Nov 27,” the group said in a statement on Wednesday. It claimed Embalo’s statements to international media were proof of this.</p><p>The deposed president, the group alleged, planned to name a new president and interim prime minister, then call new elections in which he intended to run again.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4132850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4132850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251126__869964X__v1__HighRes__GbissauPoliticsElectionUnrest-1764171484.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A soldier stops a car near the scene of gunfire in Guinea-Bissau's capital\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4132850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A soldier stops a car near the scene of gunfire near the Presidential Palace in Bissau on November 26, 2025, three days after the country’s presidential and legislative elections, with both major candidates claiming victory [Patrick Meinhardt/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"was-embalo-s-government-vulnerable\">Was Embalo’s government vulnerable?</h2><p>Beverly Ochieng, West Africa analyst at the intelligence firm Control Risks, told Al Jazeera that the constant infighting had made Embalo’s government vulnerable.</p><p>“Over the course of Embalo’s presidency, the legislature, judiciary and various government institutions have either been rendered nonoperational or operating under capacity,” she said.</p><p>Political infighting and the banning of PAIGC “likely contributed to a military intervention – even though there is a school of thought that this may have been staged to play up vulnerabilities against Embalo”, Ochieng added.</p><p>Political analyst Ryan Cummings said Embalo’s past moves lent credibility to claims of a sham coup against him that could see him reinstated by the military government. But, he added, it is also “highly plausible” the military acted alone to avoid a deadlock in a country where about 70 percent of the 2.2 million population is poor.</p><p>“There have been growing concerns that longstanding disputes between Embalo and (the opposition) had forced Guinea-Bissau into a political deadlock which has been detrimental to the socioeconomic trajectory of the country,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-there-a-link-to-the-drug-trade\">Is there a link to the drug trade?</h2><p>It’s unclear how much the country’s rising profile as a drug hub is tied to the coup. The military coup leaders claim there was an effort to “manipulate” the election by “national leaders” working with drug cartels, but have not provided any evidence.</p><p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) first warned in 2008 that Guinea-Bissau risked becoming a “narco state”. Since then, major drug busts in the country continue to cement it as a drug-trafficking hub, with dealers found by investigators to be working with help from the military.</p><p>In September 2019, a major drug operation by local security officials and backed by the UNODC led to the arrests of Bissau-Guinean, Colombian, Mexican and Portuguese nationals who were tried and sentenced to 16 years in prison.</p><p>A 2020 report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime warned that the drug trade could increase under the newly elected Embalo because key figures in the military had backed his presidency. The report did not allege direct links between Embalo and the drug trade.</p><p>Ex-navy chief Jose Bubo Na Tchuto was arrested off the country’s coast by US forces and sentenced in October 2016 to four years in prison by a Manhattan court for conspiring to import drugs into the United States. He was the highest-ranking government official to be sentenced for drug trafficking.</p><p>“The drug cartels’ influence is depending on the lack of the legitimacy (of the government),” political analyst Aly Fary Ndiaye told Al Jazeera. “If, for example, we have a military coup, they will be more likely to create an environment through which they can grow their business by supporting or funding those who are in the army, so that they can shut their eyes and let them grow their business.”</p><p>Election observers from the AU and ECOWAS were still in Bissau when Wednesday’s coup occurred, including former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan and former Mozambican president Filipe Nyusi. The delegation appears to now be trapped in the country.</p><p>In a joint AU-ECOWAS statement signed by the former leaders, the blocs condemned the coup and called for the electoral process to be resumed. Both candidates, the statement said, had agreed to accept the vote results after the delegation engaged them in talks.</p><p>“We deplore this blatant attempt to disrupt the democratic process and the gains that have been achieved thus far,” the statement read. “We express concern of the arrests of top officials including those that are in charge of the electoral process. In this regard, we urge the armed forces to immediately release the detained officials to allow the country’s electoral process to proceed to its conclusion.”</p><p>Analyst Ochieng said ECOWAS was not vocal enough during the course of Embalo’s “political overreach”, including when he unilaterally dissolved parliament. The bloc, she said, is struggling to instil respect for democratic practices and public institutions because it fails to proactively uphold strict democratic standards, something the militaries are exploiting.</p><p>Meanwhile, the governments of Ghana and Nigeria have condemned the coup. Portugal and Qatar have also called for a resumption of the electoral process.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “appeals to all national stakeholders in Guinea-Bissau to exercise restraint and respect the rule of law,” Stephane Dujarric, his spokesperson, told reporters on Wednesday.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>On Thursday, the military announced the reopening of borders after swearing in General Horta Inta-A for a transitional period of 12 months. He formerly served as personal Chief of Staff to the president and later on, as the Chief of Army General Staff.</p><p>Bissau was quiet and still being heavily patrolled by security forces on Thursday, although PAIGC called for a rally in front of the Ministry of the Interior, according to reporting by French radio channel, RFI.</p><p>The calm, though, belies what is likely to be a period of political uncertainty ahead, whether Embalo is reinstated or not, analysts say. Opposition candidates are unlikely to accept military rule and Embalo’s return may cement the theories of a ruse, and prompt protests which could be violent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the African Union and ECOWAS will likely pressure the military to return to democratic rule as soon as possible, Cummings said. Both have, in the past, suspended and sanctioned countries in which coups have taken place, before reinstating them after clear timelines for elections are set.</p><p>ECOWAS upheld suspensions on the military-led Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger for several months before the three exited the bloc and formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) in January.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The identity of the suspect was confirmed by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which spelled his surname as Lakamal. He was shot and injured by law enforcement responding to the attack.</p><p>The suspect sustained wounds that were described as not being life threatening, The Associated Press news agency reported, quoting an anonymous law enforcement official who had not been authorised to publicly discuss the matter.</p><p>The DHS said he arrived in the US in 2021 through the Biden administration’s Operation Allies Welcome programme.</p><p>The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021 as the US withdrew its forces there and then-President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.</p><p>Biden immediately launched the Open Allies Welcome programme to allow vulnerable Afghan nationals, particularly those who might be viewed as US “collaborators” by the Taliban, to enter the US for two years without a permanent immigration status.</p><p>According to Congressional Research Service estimates, about 77,000 Afghans came to the US under the programme, which remained in place for one year until the US moved to its longer-term resettlement plan known as Operation Enduring Welcome.</p><p>“The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden Administration,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in an X post on Wednesday.</p><p>“This program let in thousands of unvetted Afghan nationals including terrorists into our country,” Noem said in a statement published on the DHS website.</p><p>Quoting multiple unnamed law enforcement officials, CNN reported that Lakamal had applied for asylum in 2024 and was granted it in 2025 under the Trump administration.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-us-government-responded-to-the-attack\">How has the US government responded to the attack?</h2><p>In a video address from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump called the shooting a “monstrous ambush-style attack” and “an act of evil and act of hatred and an act of terror”.</p><p>“As president of the United States, I am determined to ensure that the animal who perpetrated this atrocity pays the steepest possible price,” Trump added.</p><p>He continued: “I can report tonight that based on the best available information, the Department of Homeland Security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hellhole on Earth. He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021.”</p><p>Trump alleged that during the Biden administration, “nobody knew who was coming in” on the flights from Afghanistan to the US. He said Lakamal’s status “was extended under legislation signed by President Biden”.</p><p>“This attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation. The last administration let in 20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from places that you don’t want to even know about.”</p><p>Trump announced: “We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden. And we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.”</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/9/14/fbis-patel-faces-us-congressional-hearings-after-kirk-death-probe-missteps\">Patel</a> said the shooting in the US capital “is a matter of national security”.</p><p>“We have assembled the full force of both the federal and state and local law enforcement agencies to bring all of our resources to make sure we find the perpetrators responsible for this heinous act,” Patel added.</p><p>The White House filed an emergency motion in federal court in the District of Columbia to halt an earlier ruling that would have seen the National Guard removed from Washington, DC.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-came-to-the-us-from-afghanistan-under-operation-allies-welcome\">Who came to the US from Afghanistan under Operation Allies Welcome?</h2><p>According to the DHS website, more than 40 percent of the Afghans who arrived in the US through the programme were eligible for special immigrant visas (SIVs), a visa granted to Afghans who assisted the US military during its 20 years of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>Afghans worked with the US military in several support roles, including as interpreters, guides, drivers, engineers and medics. They often placed themselves in direct danger from the Taliban, which viewed them as collaborators. Many also were exposed to active combat zones, were forced to flee their homes and risked losing their livelihoods when the US pulled out of the country.</p><p>In August 2021, <a href=\"/news/2021/8/16/afghans-cling-to-plane-defining-image\">video footage</a> emerged of Afghans clinging to a taxiing US Air Force plane in a desperate attempt to flee the country. A clip showed two people falling from the sky as the plane took off.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have fled Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, fearing persecution and economic collapse. Many have tried to escape to neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan and Iran, while others have gone to the US, United Kingdom and Europe.</p><h2 id=\"how-were-afghan-immigrants-vetted-during-the-biden-administration\">How were Afghan immigrants vetted during the Biden administration?</h2><p>The Trump administration claims Afghans were allowed into the US without proper vetting.</p><p>But the DHS webpage detailing the Operation Allies Welcome programme at the time stated: “The US government is working around the clock to conduct the security screening and vetting of vulnerable Afghans before they are permitted entry into the United States, consistent with the dual goals of protecting national security and providing protection for our Afghan allies.”</p><p>The website added that the DHS sent about 400 personnel from multiple agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service to Bahrain, Germany, Kuwait, Italy, Qatar, Spain and the United Arab Emirates to work with the Departments of Defense (DOD) and State and other federal partners to process, screen, vet and interview Afghan nationals.</p><p>The DHS added that the screening process was “rigorous” and “multi-layered”. It involved biometric and biographic screenings conducted by intelligence, law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals from DHS and DOD alongside the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and other intelligence community partners.</p><p>Biometric data, such as fingerprints and photos, were reviewed for every single Afghan before they were cleared to travel to the US, it said.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-countries-face-visa-restrictions-under-the-trump-administration\">What other countries face visa restrictions under the Trump administration?</h2><p>In June, Trump signed a presidential proclamation banning <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-announces-travel-ban-on-people-from-12-countries\">citizens of 12 countries</a> from entering the US. Later that month, US media reported that the Trump administration was planning to add 36 more countries to the list, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/is-trump-planning-an-africa-visa-ban\">26 of which are in Africa</a>. However, the travel ban list has not yet been officially expanded.</p><p>The countries on the list are: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.</p><p>Citizens from these countries face a full ban on travel to the US and a suspension of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. However, people with existing visas or who are lawful, permanent residents of the US are exempt from this ban. Holders of Afghan SIVs are also exempt.</p><p>In the same proclamation, Trump placed partial restrictions on citizens from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.</p><p>Based on Trump’s proclamation, citizens from these countries may no longer apply for immigrant visas or nonimmigrant temporary visas covering permanent immigration, student visas and tourism visas. They may still apply for some other temporary visas.</p><p>In October, Trump announced a new refugee cap for the US of 7,500 for the 2026 fiscal year with priority given to white South Africans, who he <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/is-south-africa-confiscating-land-targeting-some-groups-as-trump-claims\">claims</a> are the subject of a “white genocide”.</p><p>On Monday, the Trump administration announced it would <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/trump-administration-ends-temporary-immigration-status-for-myanmar-citizens\">cancel temporary asylum</a>, including temporary protected status (TPS), for Myanmar nationals living in the US. TPS is a legal immigration pathway for foreign nationals whose home country is considered unsafe to return to, and 3,969 citizens of Myanmar currently have it. In 2021, the military took over in Myanmar, and the country has been at civil war since.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Twenty-eight individuals are appointed directly by him, with the remaining 568 seats carefully engineered to ensure the status quo.</p><p data-start=\"352\" data-end=\"507\">These 568 seats are divided into individual seats, contested by candidates running on their own, and list-based seats, allocated through party lists.</p><p data-start=\"509\" data-end=\"724\">In practice, almost all of the individual seats are accessible only to candidates with substantial financial resources or strong connections to state-aligned networks, as documented by <a href=\"https://zawia3.com/en/money-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigative reporting</a>.</p><p data-start=\"726\" data-end=\"873\">The remaining list-based seats are selected through an absolute closed-list system rather than through a proportional representation arrangement.</p><p data-start=\"875\" data-end=\"1020\">The absolute closed-list system is a winner-takes-all method, whereby voters choose only one party list from a notional collection of lists.</p><p data-start=\"1022\" data-end=\"1118\">Any list that attains 50 percent of the vote in a given district wins 100 percent of the seats in that district.</p><p>Importantly, only approved party lists are allowed to compete.</p><h2 id=\"no-suspense-and-a-predetermined-result\">No suspense and a predetermined result</h2><p data-start=\"3616\" data-end=\"3718\">The results of all elections and referendums in el-Sisi-era Egypt have been more or less predetermined.</p><p data-start=\"3720\" data-end=\"3974\">Since 2014, the regime has consistently <a href=\"/news/2018/2/7/egypt-curbs-opponents-of-presidential-election\">eliminated</a> potential presidential candidates preemptively, intimidated and arrested opposition campaigners, engaged in manipulation of voting processes, and used media crackdowns to ensure electoral dominance.</p><p data-start=\"3976\" data-end=\"4293\">The ongoing parliamentary elections have followed the expected pattern. With competition already tightly controlled through the individual-seat and list-seat systems, the National Elections Authority further narrowed the field by eliminating all but one list — el-Sisi’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/9/egyptians-set-to-head-to-the-polls-in-parliament-vote\">National List for Egypt</a> — from contention. It has been alleged that between 30 million and 70 million Egyptian pounds ($629504-$1.4m) were required for candidates to access the preferred el-Sisi list.</p><p data-start=\"4443\" data-end=\"4648\">During the first round of voting, held on November 10 and 11, widespread irregularities were alleged and some clearly <a href=\"https://zawia3.com/en/2025-egypt-elections-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documented</a>, including vote buying, illegal campaigning, and various other forms of voter manipulation.</p><p data-start=\"4650\" data-end=\"4859\">Embarrassing videos showing inducements being offered were circulated online, and el-Sisi ultimately had to cancel and reschedule a small number of individual seat elections for some districts.</p><p data-start=\"4861\" data-end=\"5095\">The second round of voting was carried out on November 25-26, with violations appearing to continue unabated despite the National Election Authority’s claims of having implemented preventive measures.</p><p data-start=\"5097\" data-end=\"5211\">Throughout both rounds of voting, el-Sisi’s media apparatus faithfully repeated the official government line.</p><p data-start=\"5213\" data-end=\"5403\">Media highlighted what they portrayed as regime successes — organisation, law and order, and high voter turnout — even as videos emerged on social media showing chaos and clear evidence of low turnout.</p><p data-start=\"5405\" data-end=\"5589\">Results will be announced next month, but there is no suspense — observers widely expect el-Sisi’s coalition to dominate the House, just as it dominates the Senate.</p><p data-start=\"5591\" data-end=\"5669\">Unsurprisingly, early results suggest el-Sisi’s coalition is performing well.</p><h2 id=\"buying-time\">Buying time</h2><p>El-Sisi has essentially rewritten the authoritarian playbook for modern Egypt.</p><p>His programme of widespread state violence, mass arrests, opposition party and media bans, and draconian legislation far surpasses the repression of his dictatorial predecessors.</p><p>His system of repression is perhaps the main reason why el-Sisi finds the idea of surrendering power, even in a pseudo-democratic handover, completely untenable — letting go of power could place him at risk of accountability.</p><p>The risk is real, in part because he has also created rivals from within the power structure.</p><p>El-Sisi will stand victorious at the conclusion of the ongoing House elections, and he will almost certainly be granted his wish: at least one additional six-year term as president.</p><p>If nothing else, this will buy el-Sisi time.</p><p>But the elections will also likely add to growing frustrations over Egypt’s one-man-show political system and the economy, which has long been in shambles.</p><p>The mix of economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression is a dangerous and familiar one.</p><p>It is reminiscent of the last years of Hosni Mubarak’s tenure in Egypt.</p><p>He, too, thought he was firmly in control.</p><p>Indeed, it could be just a matter of time before there is another popular uprising, or before the military empire decides to sacrifice el-Sisi the same way it sacrificed Mubarak in 2011.</p><p>It is paradoxical, but leaders often lose control even as the grip of their iron fist tightens.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
