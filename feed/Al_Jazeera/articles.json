She predicts that if current conditions continue, the sector risks losing capital, investments and jobs.</p><p>“Having this great uncertainty – one day it’s on, the next it’s off, who knows tomorrow – and based on no specific criteria, but rather on the president’s mood, creates chaos and severely damages the country and the economy,” she said.</p><p>On December 4, Trump suggested the US might let the USMCA expire next year, or negotiate a new deal. This follows comments by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to US news outlet Politico that the administration is considering separate deals with Canada and Mexico.</p><h2 id=\"a-booming-aerospace-sector\">A booming aerospace sector</h2><p>The Mexican aerospace market is valued at $11.2bn, and is expected to more than double to $22.7bn by 2029, Sheinbaum said, citing data from the Mexican Aerospace Industry Federation (FEMIA). Home to global companies like Bombardier, Safran, Airbus, and Honeywell, Mexico has established itself as a key player in the global aerospace market and is now the world’s twelfth-largest exporter of aerospace components.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Marco Antonio Del Prete, secretary of sustainable development in Queretaro, attributes this success in part to heavy investment in education and training. In 2005, the Queretaro government promised Canada’s Bombardier that it would invest in education and set up the Aeronautical University, which now offers programmes ranging from technical diplomas to master’s degrees in aerospace manufacturing and engineering.</p><p>“Since Bombardier’s arrival, an educational and training system was created that allows us to develop talent in a very efficient way, let’s say, fast track,” Del Prete told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Bombardier has served as an anchor, propelling Queretaro’s rise as a high-skilled manufacturing hub for parts and components.</p><p>While the Bombardier plant in Queretaro originally focused on wiring harnesses, it has evolved to specialise in complex aerostructures, including the rear fuselage for the Global 7500, Bombardier’s ultra-long-range business jet, and key components for the Challenger 3500, the mid-sized business jet.</p><p>Marco Antonio Carrillo, a research professor at the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ), pointed out that the area’s wide educational offerings have cultivated a powerful workforce, which has gained significant attention from aeroplane makers, mainly from the US, Canada and France.</p><p>“This development [of Queretaro] has been, if you look at it in terms of time, truly explosive,” Carrillo said.</p><p>Mexico also aims to join France and the US as the third country capable of fully assembling an engine for Safran.</p><p>But the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Union, which represents more than 600,000 workers in Canada and the US, is worried that progress could lead to more advanced manufacturing and assembly work to eventually shift to Mexico, given the local investment in aeronautical universities and training.</p><p>“Right now they’re [Mexican workers] doing more entry-level type things, but our concern is that later on, larger pieces of the aerospace operation will go to Mexico,” Peter Greenberg, the IAM’s international affairs director, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"high-skilled-low-cost-workforce\">High-skilled, low-cost workforce</h2><p>Of the three countries in the USMCA agreement, Mexico’s biggest attraction has been its low-cost manufacturing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Edgar Buendia and Mario Duran Bustamante, economics professors at the Rosario Castellanos National University, cite Mexico’s low labour costs and geographical proximity to the US as the country’s key advantages. This is partly why the US has intensified pressure on the Mexican government, including during the initial USMCA negotiations in 2017, to raise wages to level the playing field and reduce unfair competition.</p><p>“Most US companies have incentives to move their production here in Mexico, given the [low] wages and the geographic location. So, to prevent that from happening, the United States is pressuring Mexico to raise labour standards, ensure freedom of association, and improve working conditions,” Buendia told Al Jazeera, things that will benefit Mexican workers even as employer-dominated labour groups worry that they may lose their advantage.</p><p>The IAM originally opposed the USMCA’s predecessor, NAFTA. Greenberg said that while they acknowledge USMCA will continue, US and Canadian workers “would probably be perfectly happy” if the agreement ended as the NAFTA deal had led to plants being shuttered and workers being laid off as jobs moved from the US and Canada to low-cost Mexico.</p><p>“There is a need for stronger incentives to keep work in the United States and Canada. We want to see the wages in Mexico go up so that it doesn’t become automatically a place where companies go to because they know they will have lower wages and workers who do not have any bargaining power or strong units,” Greenberg added.</p><p>Under Sheinbaum’s Morena party, Mexico has raised the minimum wage from 88 pesos ($4.82) in 2018 to 278.8 pesos ($15.30) in 2025, with the rate in municipalities bordering the US reaching 419.88 pesos ($23). On December 4, Sheinbaum announced a 13 percent rise in the minimum wage — and 5 percent for the border zone— set to begin in January 2026.</p><p>Despite these increases and the competitiveness of wages in the aerospace sector, researchers agree that a significant wage gap persists between Mexican workers and their US and Canadian counterparts.</p><p>“The wage gap is definitely abysmal,” said Javier Salinas, a scholar at the UAQ Labor Center, specialising in labour relations in the aerospace industry. “The [aerospace] industry average is between 402 [Mexican pesos] and 606, with the highest daily wage being 815. [But] 815, converted to US dollars, is less than $40 for a single workday.”</p><p>By contrast, Salinas estimates that a worker in the US earns an average of about 5,500 pesos, or $300, per day.</p><h2 id=\"protection-unions\">‘Protection unions’</h2><p>The USMCA required Mexico to end “protection unions”, a longstanding practice where companies sign agreements with corrupt union leaders — known as “sindicatos charros” — without the workers’ knowledge. This system has been used to prevent authentic union organising, as these sindicatos often serve the interests of the company and government authorities rather than the workers.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Salinas argues that despite the 2019 labour reform, it remains difficult for independent unions to emerge. Meanwhile, “protection unions” continue to keep wages low to maintain competitiveness.</p><p>“But imagine, a competitiveness based on precarious or impoverished working conditions. I don’t think that’s the way forward,” Salinas said.</p><p>Even with new labour courts and laws mandating collective bargaining, organising in Mexico remains dangerous. Workers attempting to create independent unions frequently face firing, threats, or being blacklisted by companies.</p><p>Humberto Huitron, a lawyer specialising in collective labour law and trade unionism, explains that Mexican workers, including in the aerospace sector, often lack effective representation. “There’s discrimination during hiring or recruitment.

However, the lawsuit on Friday is the first formal effort to halt construction.</p><p>“The White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognised symbol of our powerful American ideals,” Carol Quillen, the president of the organisation, said in a statement.</p><p>“As the organisation charged with protecting places where our history happened, the National Trust was compelled to file this case,” she said.</p><p>The filing charges that the Trump administration has violated several laws in beginning construction of the ballroom, including failing to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission; failing to prepare an environmental assessment; and failing to obtain congressional approval for construction in a federal park.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It further states that the totality of the administration’s actions violates the property clause of the US Constitution, which “reserves to Congress the right to dispose of and make all rules regarding property belonging to the United States”.</p><p>The organisation had previously sent a letter to the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service, and the Commission of Fine Arts calling for a pause in construction.</p><p>The Trump administration has not immediately responded to Friday’s lawsuit but has maintained that planning and construction of the ballroom have been conducted in compliance with the law.</p><p>In October, Trump aide Steven Cheung, in a post on X, accused the organisation of being “run by a bunch of loser Democrats and liberal donors who are playing political games”.</p><h2 id=\"presidential-priority\">Presidential priority</h2><p>Trump, a real estate magnate known for a personal taste that tends toward the garish and gilded, has championed the construction of a new ballroom.</p><p>The president began demolishing a portion of the White House’s east wing in October. He said the ballroom will seat nearly 1,000 people, up from the 650 seats the administration had previously announced.</p><p>The price has ballooned from $200m to $300m, although the administration has maintained that the funding is coming from <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/who-are-the-private-donors-funding-trumps-white-house-ballroom\">private donors</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While Trump has sought to transform the powers of the executive office and reshape the wider US government, the construction would be the most lasting physical change in Washington, DC, since he took office.</p><p>Critics have said the ballroom would dwarf the White House’s current 55,000-square-foot (16,764-square-metre) footprint and disrupt the balance of the smaller east and west wings.</p><p>While presidents have made internal renovations and changes to the White House grounds, the building’s exterior has remained largely unchanged since its reconstruction in the early 1800s.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/sports/2025/12/9/liverpools-mohamed-salah-a-transfer-target-for-saudi-arabia\">a move to the Saudi Pro League</a> since Salah’s outburst following last Saturday’s 3-3 draw at Leeds United, when the 33-year-old claimed he had been “<a href=\"/sports/2025/12/7/mohamed-salah-claims-he-has-been-thrown-under-the-bus-by-liverpool\">thrown under the bus</a>” for their recent woes on the field.</p><p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot said on Friday morning that <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/12/liverpool-boss-slot-to-meet-salah-amid-transfer-tension\">he would speak with Salah</a> to decide whether the forward would return to the match-day squad for the Brighton game.</p><p>The eyes and ears of the world, and in particular in Saudi Arabia, will be on the Anfield club for news of the team and the squad before kickoff against Brighton on Saturday.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-liverpool-s-form-been-in-the-premier-league-this-season\">What has Liverpool’s form been in the Premier League this season?</h2><p>The Reds have lost six of their games in the Premier League this season – part of a run that saw them lose nine of 12 games in all competitions.</p><p>The struggling title holders have taken five points from their last three league games, however, starting with a 2-0 win at West Ham – the first game of Salah’s exile from the starting lineup.</p><p>The last two matches, though, have seen the Reds held to a 1-1 home draw by newly promoted Sunderland, before the draw at Leeds that led to Salah’s outburst.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-brighton-s-form-been-in-the-premier-league-this-season\">What has Brighton’s form been in the Premier League this season?</h2><p>Brighton’s solid season sees them sit two places above Liverpool on goal difference.</p><p>A win for either side could result in them climbing as high as fourth.</p><p>One league win in five to begin the season left the Seagulls sitting slightly perilously, but a run of only two defeats in 11 in the English top flight followed, with six wins in that time.</p><p>That form had expectations flying high on the south coast before two home games, but a 4-3 defeat by Aston Villa was followed by a 1-1 draw with West Ham in their last match.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-happened-the-last-time-liverpool-played-brighton\">What happened the last time Liverpool played Brighton?</h2><p>Brighton were 3-2 winners in a Premier League fixture on May 19, in the last encounter between the sides.</p><p>Liverpool twice took the lead in the first half of the game at Amex Stadium through Harvey Elliott and Dominik Szoboszlai.</p><p>Yasin Ayari’s 31st-minute goal kept the Seagulls in the game at the break before Kaoru Mitoma and Jack Hinshelwood, who netted five minutes from time, turned the game around in the second period.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-the-corresponding-fixture-between-liverpool-and-brighton-last-season\">What happened in the corresponding fixture between Liverpool and Brighton last season?</h2><p>Liverpool were 2-1 winners in the preceding match at Anfield last season, but were forced to come from behind after Ferdi Kadioglu gave the away team the lead in the 14th minute.</p><p>The Seagulls held the lead until the 70th minute, when Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah scored twice in three minutes to set up the win.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This is the 44th meeting between the sides, with Liverpool winning 23 of those encounters and Brighton emerging victorious on 8 occasions.</p><p>The fixture dates back to 1907 and an FA Cup tie at Anfield, where Brighton secured a 1-1 draw. Liverpool made no mistake in the reply, however, winning 3-0 on the south coast.</p><p>Brighton would have to wait a further six games for their first win against Liverpool, a 3-1 victory in the old second division of English football (now known as the Championship).</p><h2 id=\"liverpool-team-news\">Liverpool team news</h2><p>There is a question mark over Alexander Isak’s status for Saturday, with Slot saying the forward picked up a knock in the first half against Inter Milan, and that he will be evaluated on Friday before they decide whether or not he can start.</p><p>Slot is pleased with how Isak and Hugo Ekitike have played together, saying their partnership will continue to improve.</p><p>“The more they play together, the more they will adapt to each other and the better they will cooperate,” Slot said. “I saw promising things from the both of them, it’s only the second time they’ve played together. We will see more of them playing together in the future.”</p><p>Slot will have Federico Chiesa available on Saturday after he recovered from illness, while Wataru Endo and Cody Gakpo are expected to be out for a “few weeks”.</p><h2 id=\"brighton-team-news\">Brighton team news</h2><p>Stefanos Tzimas, Solly March, Adam Webster are all absent with knee injuries, while James Milner is also out for several months with a muscle problem.</p><p>Kaoru Mitoma will have a fitness test as he attempts a comeback from an ankle problem which has kept him out since September.</p><p>Yasin Ayari and Tom Watson could both return from knocks, but both are still being monitored at this stage.</p><h2 id=\"predicted-liverpool-starting-lineup\">Predicted Liverpool starting lineup:</h2><p>Alisson; Gomez, Konate, van Dijk, Kerkez; Jones, Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Szoboszlai, Isak, Wirtz</p><h2 id=\"predicted-brighton-starting-lineup\">Predicted Brighton starting lineup:</h2><p>Verbruggen; Wieffer, Dunk, van Hecke, Kadioglu; Baleba, Ayari; Minteh, Rutter, De Cuyper; Welbeck</p></div></div></body></html>"
