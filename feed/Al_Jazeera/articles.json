book that has seen the Merseyside club fall to 10th in the table.</p><p>Al Jazeera Sport takes a closer look at a game that will be the focus of the Saturday agenda in the English top flight, and beyond.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-latest-on-salah-s-future-at-liverpool\">What is the latest on Salah’s future at Liverpool?</h2><p>Salah has not started a game for Liverpool since the 4-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven in the UEFA Champions League on November 26.</p><p>The Egyptian forward was benched for the following three Premier League games and, following fierce criticism of the club’s treatment of him, was then dropped from the squad that travelled to Italy to face Inter Milan on Tuesday – a game <a

field.</p><p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot said on Friday morning that <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/12/liverpool-boss-slot-to-meet-salah-amid-transfer-tension\">he would speak with Salah</a> to decide whether the forward would return to the match-day squad for the Brighton game.</p><p>The eyes and ears of the world, and in particular in Saudi Arabia, will be on the Anfield club for news of the team and the squad before kickoff against Brighton on Saturday.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-liverpool-s-form-been-in-the-premier-league-this-season\">What has Liverpool’s form been in the Premier League this season?</h2><p>The Reds have lost six of their games in the Premier League this season – part of a run that saw them lose nine of 12 games in all competitions.</p><p>The struggling title holders have taken five points from their last three league games, however, starting with a 2-0 win at West Ham – the first game of Salah’s exile from the starting lineup.</p><p>The last two matches, though, have seen the Reds held to a 1-1 home draw by newly promoted Sunderland, before the draw at Leeds that led to Salah’s outburst.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-brighton-s-form-been-in-the-premier-league-this-season\">What has Brighton’s form been in the Premier League this season?</h2><p>Brighton’s solid season sees them sit two places above Liverpool on goal difference.</p><p>A win for either side could result in them climbing as high as fourth.</p><p>One league win in five to begin the season left the Seagulls sitting slightly perilously, but a run of only two defeats in 11 in the English top flight followed, with six wins in that time.</p><p>That form had expectations flying high on the south coast before two home games, but a 4-3 defeat by Aston Villa was followed by a 1-1 draw with West Ham in their last match.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-happened-the-last-time-liverpool-played-brighton\">What happened the last time Liverpool played Brighton?</h2><p>Brighton were 3-2 winners in a Premier League fixture on May 19, in the last encounter between the sides.</p><p>Liverpool twice took the lead in the first half of the game at Amex Stadium through Harvey Elliott and Dominik Szoboszlai.</p><p>Yasin Ayari’s 31st-minute goal kept the Seagulls in the game at the break before Kaoru Mitoma and Jack Hinshelwood, who netted five minutes from time, turned the game around in the second period.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-the-corresponding-fixture-between-liverpool-and-brighton-last-season\">What happened in the corresponding fixture between Liverpool and Brighton last season?</h2><p>Liverpool were 2-1 winners in the preceding match at Anfield last season, but were forced to come from behind after Ferdi Kadioglu gave the away team the lead in the 14th minute.</p><p>The Seagulls held the lead until the 70th minute, when Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah scored twice in three minutes to set up the win.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This is the 44th meeting between the sides, with Liverpool winning 23 of those encounters and Brighton emerging victorious on 8 occasions.</p><p>The fixture dates back to 1907 and an FA Cup tie at Anfield, where Brighton secured a 1-1 draw. Liverpool made no mistake in the reply, however, winning 3-0 on the south coast.</p><p>Brighton would have to wait a further six games for their first win against Liverpool, a 3-1 victory in the old second division of English football (now known as the Championship).</p><h2 id=\"liverpool-team-news\">Liverpool team news</h2><p>There is a question mark over Alexander Isak’s status for Saturday, with Slot saying the forward picked up a knock in the first half against Inter Milan, and that he will be evaluated on Friday before they decide whether or not he can start.</p><p>Slot is pleased with how Isak and Hugo Ekitike have played together, saying their partnership will continue to improve.</p><p>“The more they play together, the more they will adapt to each other and the better they will cooperate,” Slot said. “I saw promising things from the both of them, it’s only the second time they’ve played together. We will see more of them playing together in the future.”</p><p>Slot will have Federico Chiesa available on Saturday after he recovered from illness, while Wataru Endo and Cody Gakpo are expected to be out for a “few weeks”.</p><h2 id=\"brighton-team-news\">Brighton team news</h2><p>Stefanos Tzimas, Solly March, Adam Webster are all absent with knee injuries, while James Milner is also out for several months with a muscle problem.</p><p>Kaoru Mitoma will have a fitness test as he attempts a comeback from an ankle problem which has kept him out since September.</p><p>Yasin Ayari and Tom Watson could both return from knocks, but both are still being monitored at this stage.</p><h2 id=\"predicted-liverpool-starting-lineup\">Predicted Liverpool starting lineup:</h2><p>Alisson; Gomez, Konate, van Dijk, Kerkez; Jones, Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Szoboszlai, Isak, Wirtz</p><h2 id=\"predicted-brighton-starting-lineup\">Predicted Brighton starting lineup:</h2><p>Verbruggen; Wieffer, Dunk, van Hecke, Kadioglu; Baleba, Ayari; Minteh, Rutter, De Cuyper; Welbeck</p></div></div></body></html>"

billions of Russian funds held in Europe in line with a plan to use the cash to support Ukraine.</p><p>The bloc’s members were expected to approve the plan on Friday to immobilise 210 billion euros ($246bn) worth of Russian sovereign assets for as long as necessary, through a qualified majority vote, instead of voting every six months on extending the asset freeze.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>That would equate to the support of at least 15 of the bloc’s 27 member states, representing 65 percent of the EU population.</p><p>The move is an important step that would allow EU leaders to hash out the specifics of a plan at a summit to use billions in frozen Russian Central Bank assets to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/eu-proposes-using-russian-assets-loans-to-fund-105bn-package-to-ukraine\">underwrite a massive loan</a> that would <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/2/europe-should-seize-russias-frozen-assets-now\">assist Ukraine</a> in meeting its financial and military needs.</p><p>The 210 billion euros in Russian assets are frozen in Europe as a result of EU sanctions on Moscow over its war on Ukraine, with the vast majority held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.</p><p>The expected decision, which would stay in place until the immediate threat posed by the EU’s economic interests subsided, would replace the current arrangement where the freeze on the funds needs to be re-approved every six months unanimously.</p><p>That situation has raised concerns that Hungary and Slovakia, which have closer relations to Moscow than other states and oppose further support to Ukraine, could vote to block a rollover of the sanctions and force the EU to return the funds to Russia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"orban-slams-move\">Orban slams move</h2><p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the Kremlin’s closest ally in Europe, railed against the expected decision on Friday, accusing the European Commission, which prepared the measure, “of systematically raping European law”.</p><p>He said the anticipated move means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”</p><p>“It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote.</p><p>Belgium, where Euroclear is based, is <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/4/why-is-belgium-opposed-to-using-russian-assets-to-support-ukraine\">also opposed</a> to the bloc’s “reparations loan” plan, saying it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia’s Central Bank said on Friday that it had filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it claims were caused due to the stripping of Russian control of the frozen billions.</p><p>In a separate statement, the Central Bank said the wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine were “illegal, contrary to international law”, and in breach of “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets”.</p><h2 id=\"diplomatic-push\">Diplomatic push</h2><p>The legal battle over frozen funds is taking place as the United States pushes for a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv, which would consist of a framework for peace and separate documents on security guarantees and rebuilding Ukraine.</p><p>This week’s flurry of diplomatic efforts saw Ukraine send back a revised version of the US-drafted framework, which was initially criticised as a Russian wishlist that bowed to Moscow’s maximalist demands and territorial claims in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the US was proposing that a “<a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/zelenskyy-talks-security-with-us-as-it-pushes-for-free-economic\">free economic zone</a>” be established in the Kyiv-held parts of the eastern Donetsk region, located in the Donbas, that Moscow wants to control.</p><p>He said that Ukrainian troops would have to withdraw from the area, which Moscow has previously described as a “demilitarised zone”.</p><p>On Friday, Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said in comments published in Russian business daily Kommersant that it was possible that no troops would be positioned in the Donbas, whether Ukrainian or Russian.</p><p class=\"p1\">But, he added, “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organise life.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Ushakov also expressed the Kremlin’s doubts over efforts to amend the US framework. “We have an impression that this version, which is being put forward for discussion, will be worsened,” he said.</p><p class=\"p1\">On Friday, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that Kyiv had held a new round of talks on reconstruction with US representatives Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, as well as World Bank chief Ajay Banga and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.</p><p class=\"p1\">And the stage was set for more diplomatic activity next week, with Zelenskyy planning to attend the German-Ukrainian business forum in Berlin on Monday, where he will meet numerous European leaders, as well as the heads of the EU and NATO, according to German government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Zelenskyy

Oil giant Chevron has managed to keep operating there.</p><p>With a capacity of more than 300 billion barrels, Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.</p><p>However, its reserves have dropped sharply over the past three decades, since former President Hugo Chavez and then the succeeding Maduro administration squeezed control of the state-run oil company, PDVSA.</p><p>Currently, Chevron is the only US oil producer still active in Venezuela. The company secured a licence from President Biden in 2022 to operate outside US sanctions. The Trump administration extended the firm another waiver this year.</p><p>Chevron, which partners with PDVSA, accounts for about one-fifth of Venezuela’s official oil production.</p><p>Chevron increased shipments from 128,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October this year to 150,000bpd last month. The US group says it needs to recover billions of dollars PDVSA owes in unpaid bills and property seizures.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-sanctions-does-the-us-already-have-in-place-on-venezuela\">What other sanctions does the US already have in place on Venezuela?</h2><p>At the core of the US sanctions programme are targeted financial and asset-blocking measures. US citizens and companies are banned from dealing with various designated Venezuelan officials, business leaders and entities whose property and interests in property are frozen in the US, unless authorised to do so by OFAC.</p><p>In addition to individual sanctions, the US has imposed broad sectoral restrictions on Venezuela’s economy, most notably on its state-owned oil company, PDVSA, and related oil exports. Since 2017, Washington has barred the Venezuelan government from US financial markets and prohibited the purchase of Venezuelan debt.</p><p>In 2019, sanctions were extended to freeze PDVSA assets in the US, restrict US firms – except Chevron – from doing business with PDVSA, and deter international partners from engaging with Venezuela’s oil sector.</p><p>US policy also includes visa restrictions and travel bans on Venezuelan officials and their associates, whom they accuse of undermining democracy or being responsible for human rights violations.</p><p>The US has also sanctioned maritime and shipping operations connected to Venezuela’s oil trade, including designating vessels and shipping companies which transport Venezuelan crude.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to the US presidency earlier this year, the US has added terrorism-related designations to Venezuelan groups it alleges are involved in drug trafficking or broader criminal networks. These designations carry their own financial and legal restrictions, often intersecting with existing economic sanctions.</p><p>In November, the US government designated the Venezuelan <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/what-is-cartel-de-los-soles-the-latest-group-designated-terrorist-by-us\">Cartel de los Soles</a> as a terrorist organisation and alleged that the group, which is accused of drug trafficking operations, is overseen by Maduro himself.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169090\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169090\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169090\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-10T224806Z_2094381794_RC2WDIAZRGS9_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-ANNIVERSARY-MARCH-1765538677.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro points towards supporters, during a march to commemorate the Battle of Santa Ines, on the same day Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, in Caracas, Venezuela, December 10, 2025 [Gaby Oraa/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-affected-venezuela\">How have sanctions affected Venezuela?</h2><p>US sanctions against Venezuela have contributed to one of the most severe economic collapses in modern history outside of a war zone.</p><p>In the late 1990s, Caracas was producing 3.6 million barrels of oil per day, generating 95 percent of its export revenues. But US sanctions and years of mismanagement have brought production below 1 million bpd.</p><p>That severely reduced tax revenues from oil proceeds, a key source of government income. Eventually, after the central bank printed more money to cover budget shortfalls and imports became increasingly expensive, inflation exceeded 1 million percent in 2018.</p><p>Venezuela defaulted on its commercial debt in 2017. Together with bonds issued by PDVSA and the state-owned utility, Elecar, the government owes approximately $92bn. An additional $57bn is owed to China and in various arbitration awards.</p><p>In all, Venezuela’s debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated at 148 percent.</p><p>The US relieved some sanctions briefly during Biden’s presidency, under the 2023 Barbados Agreement, notably on oil and debt, in return for political guarantees such as holding free and fair elections and releasing detained US citizens.</p><p>The deal allowed Venezuela to earn an additional $740m in oil sales. But then Maduro blocked his main opponent, <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/who-is-maria-corina-machado-2025-winner-of-the-nobel-peace-prize\">Maria Corina Machado</a>, who remains in hiding but was awarded this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, from running for election, and Biden reimposed US sanctions in April 2024.</p><p>However, experts suggest, sanctions have actually helped Maduro stay in power to some extent. Venezuelan officials shifted to an illicit “black market” economy using shadow fleets to transport oil. That, in turn, strengthened a loyal circle of military and business elites who profit from evading sanctions, and circling back their support to Maduro.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169085\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169085\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169085\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-10T214724Z_415112225_RC2XDIAQZIJB_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-ANNIVERSARY-MARCH-1765538660.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"maduro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169085\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro dances, as he joins supporters during a march to commemorate the Battle of Santa Ines, on the same day Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, in Caracas, Venezuela, on December 10, 2025 [Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-there-ways-to-get-around-these-sanctions\">Are there ways to get around these sanctions?</h2><p>There are myriad methods Venezuela has adopted under Maduro to skirt US sanctions.</p><p>Caracas, in coordination with other sanctioned states such as Iran, has used a “shadow fleet” of older, lightly regulated oil tankers to transport crude to buyers such as Chinese refiners.</p><p>These vessels often turn off Automated Identification System (AIS) transponders, use falsified tracking data, change names or flags, or operate under opaque ownership structures in jurisdictions that do not enforce sanctions rigorously.</p><p>They aim to conceal the true origin and destination of the oil and frustrate enforcement of sanctions. The Skipper, which was seized off the coast of Venezuela by the US this week, is believed to be a part of this network of tankers which smuggle oil for countries facing stiff sanctions, including Venezuela, Russia and Iran.</p><p>Venezuelan oil shipped to China has, in some cases, been labelled as Brazilian crude or otherwise relabelled on certificates of origin, Reuters reported, allowing carriers and buyers to circumvent tagging that would flag cargo as subject to US sanctions.</p><p>Transshipment at sea or in intermediate ports, where sanctioned cargoes can be switched from one vessel to another which is not on a sanctions list, is another method of evading detection.</p><p>Some sanctioned entities have also been reported as using shell companies or intermediaries in tax havens to obscure beneficial ownership and make it harder for sanctions regulators to trace transactions.</p><p>In recent years, Venezuelan officials have also reportedly used cryptocurrencies to facilitate transactions and access foreign currency. While this does not directly replace large oil export proceeds, it reflects broader methods for accessing value outside the formal financial architecture subject to US controls.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The crisis is aggravated by vehicular and industrial emissions, massive road dust, construction activities and coal and biomass-fired residential heating.</p><p>As dozens of Indian cities grapple with “poor” or “very poor” air quality, per India’s pollution watchdog, China serves as a model for its neighbouring nation. Beijing, through stringent measures and effective air pollution control policies, has made a considerable effort to improve its air quality while also achieving impressive economic growth.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Beijing was crowned as the world’s smog capital. China’s <a href=\"https://wmo.int/media/magazine-article/air-quality-management-and-weather-prediction-during-2008-beijing-olympics#:~:text=Temporary%20emission%20reduction%20regulations%20were,et%20al.%2C%202008).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">temporary</a> emission reduction regulations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics set the stage for its war on air pollution. With the <a href=\"https://english.mee.gov.cn/News_service/infocus/201309/t20130924_260707.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launch</a> of a five-year national action plan in 2013, the country introduced a raft of measures, including the closure of coal-fired boilers, promoting public transport and new energy vehicles, accelerating technological reform of enterprises and boosting innovation and green energy.</p><p>Special emphasis was given to slashing the “particulate matter (PM2.5)”. These inhalable particles, equal or less than <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/how-air-pollution-is-destroying-our-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2.5 microns</a> in diameter, are a major source of air pollution and pose the greatest danger to human health over their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream.</p><p>Beijing’s efforts, coupled with the establishment of an early warning and emergency response system, better <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2021/02/china-tackling-air-pollution-big-data/\">regulation</a> of pollution activities, relocation of factories from populated areas and incentives for farmers to discourage agricultural burning, made a lasting impact, showing a dramatic 35 percent improvement in highly polluted areas by 2017.</p><p>In the following years, Beijing continued its campaign against air pollution. <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-battle-against-air-pollution-update\">Average PM2.5 concentration</a> dropped by a half, from 72 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) in 2013 to 36μg/m³ in 2019, dropping further to <a href=\"https://www.mee.gov.cn/ywdt/xwfb/202502/t20250224_1102786.shtml\">29.3μg/m³</a> in 2024. Although substantially higher than the World Health Organization’s <a href=\"https://www.iqair.com/newsroom/2021-who-air-quality-guidelines\">guidelines</a> – 5μg/m³ – it still marked a major breakthrough in China’s push against air pollution.</p><p>Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, China sustained its <a href=\"https://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2018-07/03/content_5303158.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">battle</a> for blue skies, rolling out targeted air pollution control policies such as limiting construction-related emissions, deploying clean industrial technologies, cutting steel production, retiring old cars and encouraging the adoption of electric energy vehicles. The measures paid dividends as China’s capital <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/23/china/china-air-pollution-mic-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transformed</a> from an environmental backwater into an emblematic case of urban air quality governance. Blue skies are indeed back in Beijing, given PM2.5 concentration <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/20251016/44cf9562f5184a9fa1eb6b01bbef0708/c.html\">averaged</a> 24.9μg/m³ in the first three quarters of 2025, per the government.</p><p>The recent improvement builds on prior gains. In 2022, average annual PM2.5 concentration across China <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-01-29/339-Chinese-cities-enjoy-good-air-quality-on-86-5-of-days-in-2022-1gYTmxFHeI8/index.html\">fell</a> to 29μg/m³, according to Chinese media, and the number of days classified as having good air quality in 339 cities reached 316 – a progress not many regional countries could match. As many parts of the world <a href=\"https://epic.uchicago.edu/insights/chinas-air-quality-policies-have-swifty-reduced-pollution-improved-life-expectancy/\">experienced</a> rising PM2.5 levels, China’s steep reductions were so substantial that they single-handedly drove a decline in global pollution, highlighting the country’s outsized contribution to improving air quality worldwide.</p><p>Independent research supports the data. Thanks to timely government <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/1063841/eawp-075-air-quality-peoples-republic-china.pdf\">intervention</a>, strong coordination between local and central administrations and international financial institutions, the Greater Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region notched a significant achievement. According to the Asian Development Bank, the region has made major gains in air quality: between 2015 and 2023, average annual PM2.5 levels fell by 44.2 percent, sulphur dioxide by 76.3 percent and nitrogen dioxide by 34.8 percent, while the share of days with good air quality rose by 10.3 points to 63.1 percent.</p><p>Experts <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-09-07/China-s-remarkable-global-achievement-in-air-pollution-control-1GtI6NZsWgE/p.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">underscore</a> that China’s environmental frameworks have boosted cross-sector cooperation and spurred active participation from industries that were once major polluters. Over the years, Beijing has developed the world’s largest and most comprehensive new energy industrial chain. Its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2rz08en2po\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leadership</a> in producing renewable energy and manufacturing electric vehicles positions it at the centre of the global clean energy transition, making it an important actor to combat air pollution at home and abroad.</p><p>With Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) growing by more than 73 percent between 2013 and 2024 and PM2.5 concentrations plunging to 26μg/m³ in the January-September period, the country demonstrates how a consistent, policy-driven approach can maintain a high growth rate and still strive to deliver clean air to its people. This experience offers a precedent for India and other nations, pursuing to curb pollution without impeding their development goals.</p><p>Air pollution is the greatest environmental health risk. It knows no borders, exacerbates climate change, causes economic losses and reduces agricultural productivity. Even in China, where three-quarters of cities met their annual PM2.5 targets in 2024, the monster is resurging sharply across several regions, urging Beijing to intensify its own measures and ensure enforcement.</p><p>The scale of this challenge necessitates strengthening cooperation and sharing best practices, particularly among countries in South, Southeast and East Asia that are worst affected. Being at the forefront of the air pollution crisis – what China faced a decade earlier amid rapid development and urbanisation – India cannot afford to be complacent in drawing valuable lessons both from Chinese past successes and nascent challenges.</p><p>By adopting elements of China’s clean-air playbook – from shutting down highly polluting factories and expanding electric bus fleets to establishing real-time dust monitoring at construction sites and reinforcing interprovincial coordination – India could make meaningful progress in securing cleaner air and a sustainable future for its people, while advancing its own development and economic growth.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

in exile for the second time, does, however, favour engaging with Afghanistan’s rulers.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span

barred women from most jobs and public services – and from playing sport.</p><p>Asghari, who in 2018 became Afghanistan’s first ever IOC member, accepts her “situation is quite challenging” and beating the drum for Afghan women’s sport “does require certain precautions”.</p><p>Nevertheless, the former international basketball player, like many top Afghan women athletes, is undeterred in speaking out about the treatment of women under the Taliban authorities.</p><p>“The reality is that when you take a public stand for women’s rights you do become a target, but I believe strongly in communication and engagement,” she said in an email interview with the AFP news agency.</p><p>“As long as the Taliban remain the reality on the ground in Afghanistan, we cannot afford to waste time doing nothing.</p><p>“In my role, I have tried to help smooth the discussions between the IOC and those currently in control, focusing on the sport rights of women and girls and particularly primary school girls who are still inside Afghanistan.”</p><p>Asghari, one of four children born to a retired professional makeup artist mother and a father who was a manager in the Afghan Olympic national committee, says the “conversations are not always easy”.</p><p>“They are not about legitimising any government,” she said.</p><p>“But they are very important for creating tangible opportunities for future generations of young boys and girls in Afghanistan.”</p><h2 id=\"i-hope-fifa-can-align-with-ioc-talks-with-the-taliban\">‘I hope FIFA can align with IOC talks with the Taliban’</h2><p>With

competed in FIFA Unites: Women’s Series 2025</a> in Morocco.</p><p>“This support for athletes outside Afghanistan is just the first step, and I hope FIFA can align with the IOC’s ongoing talks with the Taliban,” she said.</p><p>Asghari, who had been involved in the “project” for more than a year, hopes the message gets through to Afghanistan’s rulers.</p><p>“The Taliban were given the country and now they’re trying to maintain power while ignoring fundamental human rights, particularly for women,” she said.</p><p>“It’s very difficult for them to continue ruling Afghanistan this way in the long term, and the Taliban need to understand that their international acceptance is directly linked to respecting human rights, including the rights of women to education and sport.”</p><p>Asghari, who attended the recent Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh, where Afghan women and men competed, said she hoped for “small openings” in the Taliban’s stance.</p><p>“I also believe that if we can find small openings — like developing sport in primary schools where girls are still allowed to attend up to sixth grade — we should take them,” she said.</p><p>“This isn’t about accepting the Taliban’s restrictions, it’s about not abandoning the girls and women of Afghanistan.</p><p>“We have to work with reality, while continuing to push for fundamental change.”</p><p>Asghari says even achieving small breakthroughs like that could prevent the long-term harm women suffered during the Taliban’s first spell in power, from 1996 to 2001.</p><p>She said she had seen the impact on her return from her first period of exile, in Iran.</p><p>“What concerns me deeply is that we’re creating another lost generation,” she said.</p><p>“I remember when I was in sixth grade aged 12, and there was a 20-year-old woman sitting next to me in the same class because she couldn’t go to school during the previous Taliban era.</p><p>“I didn’t know how to communicate with her and it was difficult for both of us, but especially for her because she had lost so many years.</p><p>“I cannot accept seeing this happen again. That’s why even small opportunities matter so much.”</p><p>Asghari retains hope despite the bleak outlook and believes in “continued engagement and dialogue” with the Taliban.</p><p>“The future of Afghanistan is this young generation. We need to give them every opportunity we can, no matter how small, and never, ever give up on them.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

UN officials have warned the attacks amount to “war crimes”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Khodr explained that the attacks form part of a sustained military pressure campaign.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“This is all part of military pressure on Hezbollah to force it to disarm,” she said. Israel wants the group “to give up its strategic weapons, its long-range weapons, its precision-guided missiles, its drones” which the Israeli military believes are stored in the Bekaa Valley and further inland.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But Hezbollah has sharply refused to relinquish its arsenal as long as Israel bombards and occupies parts of Lebanon. The group “doesn’t want to give up its weapons because it would view that as surrender”, Khodr added, noting that “Hezbollah and Lebanon do not have the upper hand. Israel enjoys air superiority.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Tensions escalated further two weeks ago when Israel bombed Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing Hezbollah’s top military commander, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel\">Haytham Ali Tabatabai</a>. The group has yet to respond, but said it will do so at the right time.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The attacks come as Lebanon and Israel recently dispatched civilian envoys to a committee monitoring their ceasefire for the first time in decades, a move aimed at expanding diplomatic engagement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">However, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem criticised Lebanon’s decision to send former Ambassador Simon Karam to the talks, calling it a “free concession” to Israel.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Lebanese officials have expressed frustration over Israel’s near-daily attacks.</p><p>“It is one of the reasons why Lebanon agreed to sit down for face-to-face talks with the Israelis,” Khodr said, “engaging in diplomatic talks that are seen as very sensitive in Lebanon, in the hopes that it would avoid war.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">President Joseph Aoun said last week that Lebanon “has adopted the option of negotiations with Israel” aimed at stopping the continued attacks, while Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called for a more robust verification mechanism to monitor both Israeli violations and Lebanese army efforts to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure.</p><p>“But the US ambassador to Lebanon, Michel Issa, made it clear a few days ago that even though Lebanon is sitting down in a room with a longtime enemy, it does not mean that the Israeli attacks will stop,” Khodr said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
