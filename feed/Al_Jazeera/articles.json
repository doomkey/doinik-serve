This marks the country’s largest chikungunya outbreak since the virus was first identified there in 2008.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"193\">Here is what we know about the disease and how it is spreading.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-chikungunya-virus\" data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"193\">What is the chikungunya virus?</h2><p>Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These mosquitoes also carry and spread dengue, yellow fever and the Zika virus.</p><p>The name, chikungunya, derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, spoken in Tanzania and Mozambique, meaning “to become contorted”.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In most cases, patients will feel better within a week. In many cases, however, the joint pain can last for months or even years.</p><p>There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but deaths are rare. If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream.</p><p data-start=\"55\" data-end=\"214\">People most at risk of serious illness from chikungunya include newborns, older adults and those with existing health problems such as heart disease or diabetes.</p><p data-start=\"216\" data-end=\"268\">There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but the death rate is low, except in high-risk populations.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"216\" data-end=\"268\">If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream. If a non-infected mosquito bites a person who is already infected, it sucks the virus from that person’s blood and becomes a carrier capable of transmitting the virus to others through bites.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3270421 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-01-1729771918.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-transmission\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-bad-is-the-current-spread-of-the-virus\">How bad is the current spread of the virus?</h2><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current surge in cases began in early 2025, with major outbreaks in Indian Ocean Islands, including La Reunion, Mayotte and Mauritius.</p><p>In La Reunion, more than 47,500 cases of chikungunya and 12 associated deaths were reported up to May 2025, with sustained high transmission across the island, according to the WHO. The ECDC also reports that as of July 18, there were more than 54,000 cases reported from La Reunion.</p><p>This is now the most serious chikungunya outbreak in La Reunion since the 2005–2006 epidemic, which saw an estimated 244,000 to more than 300,000 cases, and prompted large-scale public health efforts to control mosquito breeding and limit transmission.</p><p>The virus has also spread to other countries, including Madagascar, Somalia and Kenya, and has shown signs of epidemic-level transmission in parts of Southeast Asia, as well as India, where financial capital Mumbai has seen a surge in cases since July.</p><p>The WHO has also raised concerns about the rising number of imported chikungunya cases in Europe. Since May 1, about 800 imported cases have been reported in mainland France.</p><p>According to the ECDC, the Americas as a region have reported the highest number of chikungunya cases globally. As of mid-July 2025, the countries with the most cases in the region include Brazil (185,553), Bolivia (4,721), Argentina (2,836) and Peru (55).</p><p>In China, infections have been reported in at least 12 cities across southern Guangdong province, in addition to Foshan.</p><p>Chinese authorities said that an “imported case triggered local transmission” in July, but did not specify where the infection originated. According to experts, rising global temperatures have led to warmer and wetter weather, allowing mosquitoes to thrive.</p><p>Separately, on Saturday, Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200897.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed</a> its first case of chikungunya: a 12-year-old boy who developed a fever, rash and joint pain since July 31, after visiting Foshan. This was the territory’s first case of the virus in six years.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3270415 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-02-1729771842.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-symptoms\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-are-china-and-other-countries-fighting-the-spread\">How are China and other countries fighting the spread?</h2><p data-start=\"138\" data-end=\"270\">According to a Bloomberg news report, China has promised to take swift and decisive action to contain the spread of the chikungunya virus.</p><p data-start=\"138\" data-end=\"270\">Drones are being used to find places where mosquitoes are breeding. At the same time, scientists are releasing large “elephant mosquitoes” – about 2cm (0.8 inches) long – whose larvae eat the smaller mosquitoes that spread the virus. Health experts hope these mosquito helpers will play an important role in stopping the outbreak.</p><p data-start=\"138\" data-end=\"270\">According to a report by the BBC, residents of affected areas in China have been ordered to eliminate standing water in and around their homes – including in flowerpots, coffee machines and empty bottles. Noncompliance may result in fines of up to 10,000 yuan (approximately $1,400), and in more serious cases, people could face criminal charges for “obstructing the prevention of infectious diseases”.</p><p data-start=\"987\" data-end=\"1255\">Citing local sources, The New York Times said that in some instances, infected residents in Foshan are being moved to “quarantine wards”, where they are kept behind mosquito nets and screens. Some patients also say they were given no choice but to seek treatment at their own expense.</p><p data-start=\"987\" data-end=\"1255\">In other places, such as La Reunion and Mayotte, authorities have also launched enhanced surveillance, mosquito control initiatives and targeted vaccination efforts.</p><p data-start=\"987\" data-end=\"1255\">The Basque Country in Spain activated preventive protocols after a case was detected in Hendaye, just across the border in France. The protocols include increased surveillance in border towns and encouraging people to make reports through apps such as Mosquito Alert.</p><h2 id=\"how-can-chikungunya-be-prevented-and-treated\">How can chikungunya be prevented and treated?</h2><p>Health authorities advise protecting oneself against mosquito bites as the most effective strategy against the spread of chikungunya.</p><p>This may involve wearing long sleeves and trousers, applying mosquito repellents, removing bodies of standing water where mosquitoes can breed, and staying in closed, air-conditioned spaces indoors or behind mosquito netting when outdoors.</p><p>While there are no specific medicines to treat the virus, rest, fluids and pain relievers may help alleviate symptoms, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"214\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">However, some pain relievers may be unsafe during a suspected infection. The CDC recommends avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until dengue is ruled out, as they can raise the risk of bleeding.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3874547\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3874547\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3874547\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2024-07-25T004356Z_362697650_RC2H09A5EM6M_RTRMADP_3_GUATEMALA-DENGUE-1754441362.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are examined at the entomology department of the Health Ministry, in Guatemala City, Guatemala, July 22, 2024.

successes, however, have come despite pay disparities compared with their male counterparts – when they are paid at all.</p><p>The women receive a training camp allowance, but the bulk of their pay comes from per-match bonuses, which vary depending on the team’s results.</p><p>Both the women’s basketball and football teams have been plagued by late or unpaid match bonuses for years, despite their records as arguably the best teams on the continent.</p><p>But when the Super Falcons landed in Abuja after their 3-2 WAFCON victory over hosts Morocco last month, none of the players answered questions shouted by an AFP reporter in the press scrum about whether they would ask the president, who was welcoming them at his villa, about being paid the same as the men’s team.</p><figure

largest on the continent, complemented by a widespread diaspora.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>They also benefitted from early investments in women’s football at a time when other African countries focused on men’s teams, Chukwu said, helping the Super Falcons win the first seven editions of the WAFCON, from 1991 to 2006.</p><p>Yet they only played a handful of test matches before they landed in Morocco for this year’s competition, cobbled together at the last second.</p><p>The Super Falcons have not been completely silent in the face of mismanagement and disinterest from authorities.</p><p>But rocking the boat too much appears to come with a cost.</p><p>“Players who lead or dare to protest… always risk not being invited or sidelined outrightly,” said Harrison Jalla, a players’ union official.</p><p>After Super Falcons captain Desire Oparanozie – now a commentator – led protests over unpaid wages at the 2019 Women’s

Then, if the tourist departs on or before their visa’s expiration, that amount would be refunded to them.</p><p>The money would also be returned if the visa were cancelled, if the travel does not occur, or if the tourist is denied entry into the US.</p><p>Should a tourist overstay their visa — or apply for asylum or another immigration-related programme while in the US — the federal government would keep the money.</p><p>More countries, in addition to Malawi and Zambia, are expected to be added to the list. The bond requirement is slated to take effect for those two countries starting on August 20.</p><p>“This targeted, common-sense measure reinforces the administration’s commitment to US immigration law while deterring visa overstays,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Tuesday.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has taken a hardline approach to immigration since his return to office in January for a second term.</p><p>On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order called “Protecting the American People Against Invasion”, which denounced the “unprecedented flood of illegal immigration” into the US.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>It pledged to forcefully execute US immigration laws. That executive order was ultimately cited as the basis for the new visa bonds.</p><p>The bonds are part of a pilot programme announced on Monday, slated to last 12 months.</p><p>“This [temporary final rule] addresses the Trump Administration’s call to protect the American people by faithfully executing the immigration laws of the United States,” a <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/05/2025-14826/visas-visa-bond-pilot-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filing to the Federal Register</a> reads.</p><p>Every year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) releases a report about visa overstays in the US.</p><p>The most <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1011_CBP-Entry-Exit-Overstay-Report-FY23-Data.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent report</a>, released in 2024, found that there were 565,155 visa overstays for fiscal year 2023. That amounted to only 1.45 percent of the total non-immigrant admissions into the US.</p><p>“In other words, 98.55 percent of the in-scope nonimmigrant visitors departed the United States on-time and in accordance with the terms of their admission,” the report explains.</p><p>In its breakdown of country-by-country overstay rates, the report indicated that both Malawi and Zambia had relatively high visa overstay rates, at 14.3 and 11.1 percent, respectively.</p><p>But Zambia and Malawi are both smaller countries with relatively few tourism- or business-related arrivals in the US.</p><p>According to the report, only 1,655 people arrived from Malawi in fiscal year 2023 for business or pleasure. Of that total, 237 overstayed their visas.</p><p>Meanwhile, 3,493 people arrived from Zambia for tourism or business during the same time frame. Of that total, 388 surpassed their visa limits.</p><p>Those numbers are dwarfed by the sheer numbers from larger, more populous countries with larger consumer bases. An estimated 20,811 Brazilians stayed in the US longer than their tourism or business visas allowed, for instance, and 40,884 overstays were from Colombia.</p><p>Critics have also pointed out that the newly imposed bonds put travel to the US — already a pricey prospect — further out of reach for residents of poorer countries.</p><p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an advocacy group, was among those that denounced the new bond scheme as discriminatory. It described the system as a form of exploitation — a “legalised shakedown” — in a <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-says-trump-admins-15000-visa-bond-program-is-legalized-shakedown-not-national-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Tuesday.</p><p>“This is not about national security,” said Robert McCaw, CAIR’s government affairs director. “It’s about weaponising immigration policy to extort vulnerable visitors, punish disfavored countries, and turn America’s welcome mat into a paywall.”</p><p>Citizens of countries that are part of the US’s visa waiver programmes are not subject to the visa bonds unveiled this week.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In July, however, Davidson County Chancery Court Judge Russell Perkins ruled that his defibrillator would have to be removed for the execution to proceed, to avoid the risk of “irreparable harm”.</p><p>The state of Tennessee, however, argued that it was difficult to find a medical professional who would agree to remove or deactivate the defibrillator, given the Hippocratic oath to avoid patient harm. It also argued that the pentobarbital used in the lethal injection would render Black unresponsive.</p><p>Tennessee’s Supreme Court ultimately sided with the state, saying that Perkins’s decision amounted to a “stay of execution”. The US Supreme Court, meanwhile, has declined petitions to take up the case.</p><p>Witnesses at Tuesday’s execution told US media that Black groaned as he died and appeared to be in distress.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Even before the latest Superman film premiered, it was already deemed controversial. A rather innocuous comment by director James Gunn referencing Superman’s backstory as an “immigrant that came from other places” was enough to spark a backlash among conservatives who called the movie “woke” and vowed to boycott it.</p><p>Why all the anger when this is indeed Superman’s origin story? He is sent to Earth as a refugee from a planet that is about to die.</p><p>Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, who created Superman in the 1930s, were both sons of Jewish immigrants to the United States and Canada, respectively. The two projected onto Clark Kent, Superman’s alter ego, their experiences, fears and longing as two shy young men of immigrant backgrounds who struggled to fit in. Like them, their hero does not quite feel he belongs – neither as Clark, who is timid and lacks the confidence to speak up or approach others, nor as Superman, who is feared by some for being an alien.</p><p>Growing up, reading the comics, I saw in Clark Kent someone I knew too well – a hesitant, modest man, shrinking himself to fit in. I saw myself. I too was an immigrant, and I too had had to leave my country before it started falling apart.</p><p>And so, I looked forward to seeing the new Superman film, hoping to see a return to the original premise. My children and I counted down to the premiere together, watching trailers and reading interviews. We went to see the film, and I felt a genuine sense of recognition. It was great to see the core of Superman’s story pushed to the fore once again.</p><p>But why did some see the immigrant backstory in Superman as a threat? As an attempt to make their favourite superhero “woke”?</p><p>Perhaps it has to do with the fact that for a long time, Superman was whitewashed into a pliant superhero who worked with and represented American power. How did it get to that?</p><p>When their creation became too popular, Siegel and Shuster lost control over it because their publisher decided to sideline them.</p><p>“Jack Liebowitz, the president of DC [Comics], sees that they can sell Superman pillowcases and pyjamas – but if Superman’s running around throwing people out of windows and threatening to wrap iron bars around their necks, it isn’t going to work,” Paul S Hirsch, author of Pulp Empire: A Secret History of Comic Book Imperialism, told the BBC.</p><p>The original Superman was a rebel. He was seen as a “socialist”, “anarchist” and even a “radical revolutionary”. On the comic book cover, he was described as a “champion of the oppressed”.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In one of his first adventures, Superman comes after a corrupt lobbyist and a weapons manufacturer who try to bribe a congressman into voting for US involvement in a foreign conflict.</p><p>This type of character didn’t serve the establishment. He challenged it. That is why it didn’t take long before those edges were sanded down. In the 1940s, Superman was enlisted, like other superheroes, in the propaganda war against the Axis powers. During the Cold War, he promoted American military prowess and values, eventually becoming a symbol of American empire, of power and hegemony – the very opposite of what his creators intended.</p><p>Superman had to be whitewashed not only to serve the government and the elites but also because his original character was dangerous. The story of a quiet, timid immigrant who finds in himself the power to rebel against injustice and oppression could inspire. And the political establishment do not want the marginalised to become Superman. They want them to be Clark Kent – shy, indecisive, weak, voiceless.</p><p>It is for the same exact reason that the government and the elites are coming after people of immigrant backgrounds who have found in themselves the strength to speak up and stand up.</p><p>People like Zohran Mamdani, the son of an Indian mother and Ugandan-Indian father who is running for mayor of New York while openly speaking up against injustice and corruption.</p><p>People like Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, two trailblazers for their immigrant communities who have been elected and re-elected to the US House of Representatives and who continue to be outspoken about issues that bother the powerful – Islamophobia, US war crimes and persecution of immigrants.</p><p>People like Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student who risked his education to speak up for his people facing genocide in Gaza. Even his kidnapping and detention by the federal government did not force him into silence. Upon his release, Khalil continued to speak up for the Palestinian people.</p><p>The fear of the marginalised finding a voice and demanding their rights is also driving the US government’s mass anti-immigration campaign, the dismantling of equity, diversity and inclusion (DEI) programmes and the war on academic freedom, targeting fields of study that openly challenge power and empire.</p><p>The elites saw the mass mobilisation for Gaza – in the streets, on campuses, at ballot boxes – and became terrified. The scale and scope of this movement cutting across communities, races and religions was laying the ground for a mass mobilisation that could go beyond the immediate goal of stopping a genocide. It could stand up to injustice and corruption. It could come for them.</p><p>The elites see what happens when Clark Kent realises that he no longer wants to stay timid and invisible to blend in, that he wants to be Superman, the champion of the oppressed. They are not afraid of the marginalised, of refugees and immigrants. They are afraid of these people finding their voices and strength to demand their rights.</p><p>And that’s the sentiment the original Superman was supposed to inspire – not blind infatuation with American power, not misplaced pride in American values, but belief in one’s own power to speak up, to stand up and create change.</p><p data-start=\"5207\" data-end=\"5522\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
