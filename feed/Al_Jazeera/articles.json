The Chornobyl plant, the site of the world’s worst civil nuclear catastrophe, lost all off-site power after a Russian attack, the IAEA said. Kyiv later said the plant had been reconnected.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha accused Russia of using the risk of nuclear disaster as a tool of coercion.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">The United Nations human rights chief, Volker Turk, expressed outrage over the “cruel” Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, saying civilians are “bearing the brunt”.</li>\n</ul><h3>Ceasefire talks</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Special envoys for US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting in Davos on the sidelines of the WEF. They described their meeting on a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine as “very positive” and “constructive”.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukrainian peace negotiators also met with national security advisers from France, Germany and the United Kingdom in Davos, according to Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council. Umerov said on Telegram that further meetings are expected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy urged the United States to put more pressure on Moscow, telling reporters that he believed the Americans were capable of doing more to bring Russia to agree on a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/zelenskyy-says-us-security-guarantee-text-ready-to-be-finalised-with-trump\">ceasefire deal</a>.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy also told reporters in Kyiv that he was worried Trump’s push to take over Greenland could be diverting focus away from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now approaching its four-year mark.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he was ready to travel to Davos if Washington was ready to sign documents on security guarantees for Ukraine and a post-war prosperity plan.</li>\n<li>Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov said he does not believe that European leaders are interested in ending the war, which his country started in 2022.</li>\n</ul><p> </p><h3>Military</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Zelenskyy has urged Ukraine and Europe to create a joint defence force of up to three million people to counter threats from Russia, as Moscow plans to increase its armed forces to 2.5 million people by 2030.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine’s new defence minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has promised a sweeping, data-driven overhaul of the Ukrainian army, which will give Ukrainian forces the upper hand against Russia’s bigger and better-equipped army.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Fedorov also said in his remarks to journalists that Ukraine would test, this month, its home-grown replacement to China’s DJI Mavic drone, which is widely used for aerial reconnaissance on the front lines by both sides.

Efforts to expropriate assets from foreign oil companies in 2007 have further fuelled criticism from the Trump administration, which <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">considers Venezuelan oil</a> “stolen” from US owners.</p><p>Legal experts, however, largely consider such arguments a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty.</p><p>Trump has nevertheless said the US will control Venezuela’s oil and has used the threat of further military attacks to pressure Venezuela’s government into compliance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration has also placed steep sanctions on Venezuela’s economy, as part of a trend stretching back to the Republican leader’s first term as president.</p><p>The US has framed the tanker seizures as a way of enforcing those sanctions, although the legality of using military force to enforce economic penalties is disputed.</p><p>Trump and his officials have said that the sale of <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/9/big-and-small-oil-companies-summoned-to-meet-trump-on-venezuelan-oil\">Venezuelan oil</a> on the world market will be dictated by the US and that the proceeds from those sales will be placed in a US-controlled bank account.</p><p>Trump has also used control over Venezuela’s oil to ratchet up <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/trump-says-no-more-venezuelan-oil-or-money-to-go-to-cuba-and-demands-deal\">pressure on Cuba</a>, for which access to Venezuelan oil is an important economic lifeline.</p><p>The US president told reporters on Tuesday at a White House briefing that he has taken 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela.</p><p>“We’ve got millions of barrels of oil left,” he said at the White House. “We’re selling it on the open market.

But the boos dissipated as the match went on and were virtually gone by the time Vinicius scored his first Champions League goal of the season in the 63rd minute.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The early boos were not nearly as loud as they were on Saturday in Madrid’s 2-0 win over Levante in the Spanish league. Both times fans jeered when Vinicius’s name was announced in the starting lineup, but this time, the game ended with fans on Vinicius’s side as he was chosen the man of the match.</p><p>Vinicius has been having a lacklustre season, and some fans viewed him as one of the reasons why coach Xabi Alonso was replaced last week.</p><p>Vinicius had spats with Alonso, a former Madrid and Spain great as a player, who was replaced as a coach following a tumultuous eight-month stint. Vinicius was reportedly the main player not backing Alonso in the locker room.</p><p>He scored his goal on Tuesday with a well-placed strike after getting past a couple of defenders and hitting the upper corner. He did not go towards the fans to celebrate, and instead hugged his teammates near the midfield. Then he ran towards the sideline to salute and hug the new Madrid coach, Alvaro Arbeloa.</p><p>Vinicius had assists in goals by Kylian Mbappe in the 26th and Franco Mastantuono in the 51st. The Brazilian also assisted with a cross that led to an own-goal by Monaco defender Thilo Kehrer in the 55th.</p><p>“Vini, we are behind you,” read a banner held by a fan at the Bernabeu.</p><p>Mbappe scored in the fifth minute to put the hosts ahead. He hugged Vinicius after his second goal later in the first half and again following the final whistle.</p><p>Mbappe and Arbeloa had come out defending Vinicius recently, with Mbappe saying the crowd should not single out Vinicius as the one to blame for the team’s struggles.</p><p>Many fans applauded a seventh-minute attempt by Vinicius, who just missed wide from inside the area. When he misplayed a ball in the 40th, some of the fans started to boo again, but many more applauded in response.</p><p>There were no immediate jeers towards club President Florentino Pérez as had happened against Levante.</p><p>Mbappe appeared to apologise to Monaco fans after scoring. He was a former Monaco player. Mbappe has 18 Champions League goals for Madrid, the most of any player in the first 20 appearances with the club, ahead of the 14 of Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><p>Jude Bellingham, who was also jeered by some fans on Saturday, scored Madrid’s sixth goal in the 80th minute.</p><p>Vinicius came close to scoring again on a breakaway in second-half stoppage time.</p><p>Madrid had entered the match against Levante coming off a two-game losing streak, which included a loss to Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia – prompting Alonso’s departure – and an embarrassing elimination against Albacete in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey.</p><p>There was a moment of silence before the match in honour of the victims of the train crash, in which more than 40 people were killed, in southern Spain on Sunday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Most claims were factually inaccurate.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Al Jazeera examined some of his statements on the economy:</p><p><strong>Core inflation has been at 1.6 percent for the past three months, and there is “no inflation”.</strong></p><p>Both claims are false. Core inflation in November and December stood at 2.6 percent year over year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).</p><p>A core consumer price index (CPI) report was not released for the month before due to the federal government shutdown, the longest in US history.</p><p>Overall, inflation rose by 2.7 percent compared with the same period last year.</p><p><strong>Drug prices under Trump’s “most favored nation” programme are down by “300, 400, 500, 600 percent”.</strong></p><p>This is incorrect. While the programme is intended to lower drug prices, reductions beyond 100 percent are mathematically impossible.</p><p>A 100 percent price reduction would mean a product is free. Anything beyond that would require pharmaceutical companies to pay consumers to take their products.</p><p><strong>Pending Supreme Court ruling on tariffs:</strong></p><p>Trump addressed a pending Supreme Court case that will rule on the legality of his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs. He claimed the US would have to return money if the court rules against his administration.</p><p>This is partially accurate but unclear. If the court rules <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/6/us-supreme-court-expected-to-rule-on-tariffs-on-friday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">against the administration</a>, the US would need to refund some of the money importers paid in tariffs. In September, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said the government could be required to refund roughly half of the tariffs it collected.</p><p>The White House’s economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, has said the administration is exploring alternative legal avenues to impose tariffs if the court blocks the current plan.</p><p><strong>Former President Joe Biden “did not do tariffs”.</strong></p><p>This is false. Biden <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/29/how-much-revenue-has-the-us-earned-from-trumps-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">imposed multiple tariffs</a> during his administration. In 2022, he imposed 35 percent tariffs on Russian imports as part of sanctions following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>In 2024, Biden raised tariffs on Canadian lumber to 14.5 percent from 8.5 percent, continuing a Trump-era policy.</p><p>That year, he also imposed tariffs on China, including 100 percent on electric vehicles, 25 percent on steel and aluminium, and 50 percent on semiconductor chips.</p><p><strong>Trump administration removed more than 270,000 bureaucrats from the federal government, but they are going to the private sector. </strong></p><p>The federal government has cut 277,000 jobs since January 2025, according to the BLS. But data shows limited growth in the private sector, especially in tariff-exposed industries.</p><p>In the most recent jobs report, the US economy added 50,000 jobs. The biggest gains were in food service, which added 27,000 jobs, and healthcare, which added 34,000 jobs.</p><p>The US economy added 584,000 jobs in 2025. This is significantly lower than the two million created the year before, under Biden.</p><p><strong>Gas prices are at $1.99 per gallon in some states</strong></p><p>This is inaccurate. According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), which tracks gas prices, the average price for a gallon of gas is $2.82. The cheapest gas prices are in the state of Oklahoma, at $2.31.</p><p><strong>More car factories are being built in the US now than ever before.</strong></p><p>Oxford Economics tracks private construction spending on transportation equipment factories. In 2025, nominal spending on manufacturing structures related to transportation equipment was down from its peak in 2024, it said.</p><p>Trump has been making claims like this for close to a year. Auto industry experts have long said they are <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/2/are-us-car-plants-being-built-at-record-rates-as-trump-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/economy/2025/4/2/are-us-car-plants-being-built-at-record-rates-as-trump-claims\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">exaggerated</a>, because while companies, including Hyundai and Stellantis, have increased investments in US manufacturing, these are additions to existing plants.</p><p>Oxford Economics, which tracks private construction on transportation equipment, found that “nominal spending” in 2025 was trending downwards after hitting a peak during the final year of the Biden administration. It peaked at $16.6bn annualised in April 2024 and is now at $14.4bn annualised, Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s chaos because it doesn’t actually serve anyone or anything.”</p><p>To critics, Trump has vastly increased his scorecard on international adventurism in the first weeks of 2026, after pursuing <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-many-countries-has-trump-bombed-in-2025\">bombing campaigns</a> in Yemen, Iran, Nigeria, Somalia and the Caribbean in 2025.</p><p>Military assets have remained stationed off the coast of Venezuela in the wake of Maduro’s January 3 abduction, with Trump floating the idea of using US troops to secure the country’s vast oil wealth. Experts have repeatedly warned that the relative stability under interim President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former deputy, remains tenuous, with the prospect of greater entanglement remaining very much on the table.</p><p>While threats against neighbouring Colombia have fizzled, Trump has appeared committed to the White House’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">stated goal</a> of establishing US “preeminence” in the Western Hemisphere. In an NBC News interview published on Monday, Trump again refused to rule out military force in seizing Greenland. Forebodingly, Trump told Norway’s leader in a text message on Sunday, “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Even Trump’s Republican allies have warned that US military aggression towards Greenland would effectively blow up the NATO alliance, as Democrats have sought to capitalise on the discord between Trump’s campaign messaging and his threats against purported US allies.</p><p>“The American people voted for affordability at home, not threats to invade our closest friends abroad,” Democrats on the House foreign affairs committee said in a January 6 post on X.</p><p>“Trump is ignoring Americans’ affordability concerns with his foreign escapades, and making things worse with more tariffs. This will only further raise costs for the American people,” the panel wrote earlier this week, referring to Trump’s threats to further tariff European countries over Greenland.</p><p>The Trump administration, for its part, has sought to connect both Venezuela and Greenland to cost-of-living issues.</p><p>That has included pushing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/fact-checking-trump-on-promised-us-oil-company-investment-in-venezuela\">dubious claims</a> over the effect US access to Venezuelan oil will have on markets, and floating far-flung plans to exploit the untapped natural resources of Greenland, ownership of which Trump has maintained is imperative to US national security.</p><h2 id=\"a-test-for-democrats\">A test for Democrats?</h2><p>Of course, with the midterms more than nine months away, much is subject to change under an administration that has relied not only on bold, attention-diverting policies, but their <a href=\"/news/longform/2026/1/20/act-fast-how-speed-defined-the-start-of-trumps-second-term\">rapid and unrelenting deployment</a>.</p><p>But several potential signs have emerged of brewing trouble for Trump’s Republican Party, which has so far broadly fallen in line with the president’s agenda, including refusing to exercise congressional oversight of his <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-senate-defeats-war-powers-resolution-designed-to-rein-in-trump\">military actions</a>.</p><p>Economists have argued that despite signs of economic growth, a relatively comfortable unemployment rate, and a so-far muted domestic impact of Trump’s wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs, inequality has <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/19/the-us-economy-seems-strong-after-a-year-of-trump-but-is-it-really\">continued to yawn</a> under Trump.</p><p>For many in lower and middle income brackets, there has been little shift in their lived experience and the daily life expenses that inform perceptions of affordability, as reflected in a slate of recent polls. That may dovetail with other public opinion surveys showing discontent over Trump’s actions abroad.</p><p>An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted January 8 to 11 found 61 percent of US adults disapproved of Trump’s foreign policy approach, with 56 percent saying they felt Trump had “gone too far” on military intervention, even as support for Maduro’s ousting remained relatively high. That was particularly pronounced among independents, a voter segment targeted by both parties, with 63 percent saying Trump had overreached.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll of US residents found particularly dismal support for the US acquiring Greenland, with just one in five respondents supporting such a move. A separate CBS poll found that just 14 percent approve of using military force to seize the island.</p><p>Democratic strategist Hasan assessed that messaging from both major parties has been inadequate on affordability, with Republicans asking voters “not to believe their own eyes”, and many old guard Democrats offering only “milquetoast” alternative visions.</p><p>An “antidote” in the months ahead, he said, could be embracing bold positions that weave US actions abroad and impacts felt at home. He pointed to the recent success of New York City Mayor <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/zohran-mamdani-sworn-in-as-new-york-city-mayor\">Zohran Mamdani</a> as a possible blueprint.</p><p>“We’re in a place where the Democrats really have a test as to whether or not their messaging can meet the very perilous moment that we’re in,” Hasan said. “They actually have to stand up for something.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

David Ellison’s father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. Paramount declined to comment on Tuesday on Netflix’s all-cash offer.</p><p>Warner Bros will hold a special investor meeting to vote on the Netflix deal, with the streaming pioneer saying that the meeting was expected to be held by April.</p><p>“Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement.</p><p>Shares of Netflix, which is slated to report quarterly earnings after the market close, are up 0.7 percent.

Now, it is up to Paramount to provide a clearly superior offer if they want to get this done.”</p><p>Netflix shares have fallen almost 15 percent since announcing the merger on December 5, closing at $88 per share on Friday, well below the $97.91 floor price of the original bid. That drop was part of Paramount’s argument that its bid was superior.</p><p>The new $27.75-per-share offer from Netflix replaces its earlier cash-and-stock bid for $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock.</p><p>“The merger consideration is a fixed cash amount to be paid by an investment-grade company, providing [Warner Bros] stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon closing the merger,” Warner Bros said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The company’s board also disclosed its valuation for Discovery Global, a planned spin-off that will contain television assets, including CNN and TNT Sports and the Discovery+ streaming service.</p><p>The board has maintained that the Netflix merger deal is superior to Paramount Skydance’s $30-per-share cash bid for the company because Warner Bros’s investors would retain a stake in the separately traded Discovery Global.</p><p>Warner Bros’s advisers used three separate approaches for valuing Discovery Global. The lowest share price they arrived at was $1.33 per share, by applying a single value across the whole company. The high end of the range they determined was a price of $6.86 a share, if the spin-off became involved in a future deal.</p><p>Paramount has said the cable spinoff central to the streaming giant’s offer is effectively worthless.</p><h2 id=\"a-looming-deadline\">A looming deadline</h2><p>The rival bidder went to court on January 12 to expedite the disclosure of this information, so investors could evaluate the competing offers for Warner Bros. A Delaware court judge rejected the request, finding that Paramount had failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm from the alleged inadequate disclosures about Warner Bros’s cable TV business.</p><p>Paramount Skydance, whose tender offer expires on January 21, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p><p>“Paramount will make another appeal to shareholders. Unless Paramount raises its bid, the appeal will be window dressing,” E-marketer analyst Ross Benes said.</p><p>The race is expected to come to a head at a shareholder vote later this year as Warner investors weigh the value of cable assets.</p><p>Warner Bros reiterated its reasons for rejecting the Paramount bid, saying its all-cash offer of $30 a share was insufficient after factoring in the “price and numerous risks, costs and uncertainties”.</p><p>“Netflix’s move to go all‑cash on the Warner Bros deal is a smart pivot at a time when its own falling share price had begun to weaken its hand,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “A cash bid strips away uncertainty and is unquestionably more appealing from Warner Bros’s perspective, even if it does nothing to ease regulatory scrutiny.”</p><p>A merger with Netflix would leave the combined company with roughly $85bn in debt, compared with $87bn for Paramount. But Netflix is worth considerably more, with a market valuation of $402bn, compared with $12.6bn for Paramount.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Netflix tie-up would be less leveraged – carrying a leverage ratio of under four – than a ratio of about seven with Paramount.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\">Netflix also agreed </a>to allow Warner Bros to reduce the amount of indebtedness to be borne by Discovery Global by $260m, according to the regulatory filing.</p><p>Netflix also has an investment-grade credit rating, whereas Paramount’s bonds are rated at junk levels by S&amp;P and would likely come under further pressure, Warner Bros said in its filing.</p><p>Winning over shareholders’ approval, however, may only be the first step in what could be a long process, given that lawmakers across ⁠the political spectrum have ​voiced concerns that further media consolidation could drive up prices and reduce consumer choice.</p><p>The Ellisons have argued that their relationship with Trump gives them an easier regulatory path to approval.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Already, Trump is bracing for this year’s midterm elections, which could result in one or both chambers of Congress switching party control.</p><p>“If we don’t win the midterms, I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me,” Trump told a gathering of Republican lawmakers earlier this month.</p><p>And while Trump has teased the prospect of running for an unconstitutional third term, the law limits him to only two. That opens the possibility that the presidency could change parties in 2028 as well.</p><p>“Assuming a Democratic administration follows the Trump administration, much of Trump's agenda and changes will be undone as quickly as possible,” Updegrove said.</p><p>“From executive orders to gold-leaf stencil on the White House walls, a lot of it can be undone.”</p><p>But there are downstream effects, the historian warned, that may not become apparent until well after Trump’s presidency. The speed of the change has rendered them somewhat invisible.</p><p>“When you think about this muzzle-velocity stuff, there are some things that we don't even realize has happened,” Updegrove said.</p><p>He pointed to the loss of institutional knowledge after Trump's widespread layoffs as an example of decisions with as-yet unseen consequences.</p><p>“Even the things that we know have gone through, we don't see the full effects and won't for many years.”</p><p>And yet, Updegrove speculates that a lack of velocity in one critical area may prove to be the downfall of Trumpism: economic growth.</p><p>The consumer prices repeatedly topped polls of voter concerns in the 2024 election, and Trump had promised that, “starting on day one”, he would “end inflation and make America affordable again”.</p><p>But Updegrove says average Americans are not seeing the promised turnaround in their pocketbooks.</p><p>“If we successfully turn the tide on Trump, I don't know that it will ultimately be driven by our fear of the erosion of our democracy, rather than a dissatisfaction with the pace of economic change,” he said.</p><p>“At the end of the day, we might see a revival of democracy due to the price of hamburger meat.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
