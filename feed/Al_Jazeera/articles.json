It ordered the formation of a medical team to examine Khan’s eye and directed that he be allowed phone contact with his sons, who both live in the United Kingdom, and ordered both tasks to be completed before February 16.</p><p>“The issue of Imran’s health is most important,” Chief Justice Yahya Afridi observed, adding that “intervention was necessary.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"health-concerns-mount\">Health concerns mount</h2><p>Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party founded by Khan, expressed “profound concern” in a statement on Thursday and strongly condemned the treatment meted out to him, “particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight”.</p><p>The party said it reserves the right to initiate legal proceedings against relevant officials over his declining health, warning that “any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for”.</p><p>“We demand that Imran Khan be granted <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/why-jail-access-to-pakistans-imran-khan-has-caused-a-political-storm\">immediate and unrestricted access</a> to his personal physicians and that, for specialized eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team. Unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights are his fundamental rights,” the statement read.</p><p>Khan, a popular former Pakistan cricket captain and World Cup winner, became prime minister in 2018 in elections that opponents alleged were rigged in his favour by the powerful military. Four years later, <a href=\"/news/2022/4/9/analysis-end-of-imran-khans-term\">he was removed</a> through a no-confidence vote that he claimed was orchestrated by the military, after their relationship soured, in collusion with Washington and Khan’s political rivals in Pakistan.</p><p>These allegations were denied by both the Pakistani military and the United States.</p><p>Since his ouster, he has blamed army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for his troubles and repeatedly urged supporters to stage public protests.</p><p>Following his removal from power, Khan faced a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/ex-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-wife-sentenced-to-17-years-in-corruption-case\">cascade of charges</a> that his party says were designed to sideline Pakistan’s most popular opposition leader. After being detained for less than two days in May 2023, he was arrested again in August 2023 on corruption charges.</p><p>He has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August 2023. He has remained there since, in what Safdar’s report confirms as solitary confinement for approximately two years and four months.</p><p>In June 2024, a United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Khan’s detention “had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running [for] political office.”</p><h2 id=\"political-fallout-deepens\">Political fallout deepens</h2><p>The Supreme Court’s decision to appoint an independent observer followed months of restricted access to Khan. Chief Justice Afridi had stressed that Safdar should be given “respectful and unhindered access” and not be kept waiting outside the jail.</p><p>The report states that Khan has been denied access to his lead counsel and legal team for the past five months. He also told Safdar that his sisters and other immediate family members had not been permitted to visit him. Only after the change in jail superintendent was he allowed to meet his wife – who is also behind bars on corruption charges – once a week for about 30 minutes every Tuesday.</p><p>Benazir Shah, a senior political analyst, said the public deserves transparency and his family deserves answers.</p><p>“The government has mishandled Imran Khan’s health from the very start, first by concealing the news until it was reported by a local English newspaper, then by dismissing it as a routine matter, and ultimately by performing a procedure without the knowledge or presence of his family,” she said.</p><p>“The treatment meted out to a former prime minister for so long shows that the current government in Pakistan has scant regard for basic human rights,” Lahore-based Shah told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Three other Americans and three members of the Syrian security forces were also wounded.</p><p>In response to the Palmyra attack, US President Donald Trump launched military operations aimed at eliminating ISIL fighters in the region.</p><h2 id=\"detainee-transfers\">Detainee transfers</h2><p>The security situation is further complicated by the status of thousands of detainees. Following a ceasefire agreement with Kurdish-led forces, the Syrian government has taken control of sprawling camps housing ISIL suspects and their families.</p><p>As of December, more than 25,740 people remained in the al-Hol and Roj camps in the northeastern part of Syria. The UN highlighted the humanitarian dimension of the crisis, noting that more than 60 percent of the camp residents are children.</p><p>In late January, the US military began transferring ISIL detainees held in northeastern Syria to Iraq to ensure they remain in secure facilities, with Baghdad pledging to prosecute the fighters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"47\" data-end=\"471\">On January 6, a group of 25 British members of parliament tabled a motion urging global sporting authorities to consider excluding the United States from hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup until it demonstrates compliance with international law. It followed weeks of mounting pressure across Europe over the political climate surrounding a tournament expected to draw millions of viewers and symbolising international cooperation.</p><p data-start=\"473\" data-end=\"738\">Dutch broadcaster Teun van de Keuken has backed a public petition urging withdrawal from the competition while French parliamentarian Eric Coquerel has warned that participation risks legitimising policies he argued undermine international human rights standards.</p><p data-start=\"740\" data-end=\"1117\">Much of the scrutiny has focused on US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and broad assaults on civil liberties. The deaths of Minneapolis residents Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti during immigration enforcement operations in January triggered nationwide outrage and protests. In 2026, at least eight people have been shot by federal immigration agents or died in immigration detention.</p><p data-start=\"1119\" data-end=\"1363\">These developments are serious, but they point to a broader question about power and accountability – one that extends beyond domestic repression and into the consequences of US policy abroad. The war in Gaza represents a far deeper emergency.</p><p data-start=\"1365\" data-end=\"1655\">For decades, Washington has served as Israel’s most influential international ally, providing diplomatic protection, political backing and roughly $3.8bn in annual military assistance. That partnership finances and shapes the destruction now unfolding across Palestinian territory.</p><p data-start=\"1657\" data-end=\"2289\">Since the day the war began on October 7, 2023, Israel’s military has killed more than 72,032 Palestinians, wounded 171,661 and destroyed or severely damaged the vast majority of Gaza’s housing, schools, hospitals, water systems and other basic civilian infrastructure. Nearly 90 percent of Gaza’s population – about 1.9 million people – has been displaced, many repeatedly, as bombardments move across the enclave. Meanwhile, Israeli forces and armed settlers have intensified raids, farmland seizures and sweeping movement restrictions across Palestinian communities in Jenin, Nablus, Hebron and the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank.</p><p data-start=\"2291\" data-end=\"2345\">By many accounts, Israel is carrying out a genocide.</p><p data-start=\"2347\" data-end=\"2518\">Across the African continent, this grave assault carries profound historical resonance because organised sports competitions have often been inseparable from liberation struggles.</p><p data-start=\"2520\" data-end=\"2806\">On June 16, 1976, 15-year-old Hastings Ndlovu joined thousands of schoolchildren in Soweto protesting against the imposition of Afrikaans language education. By the end of the day, he was dead, shot by police as officers opened fire on unarmed pupils marching through their own neighbourhoods.</p><p data-start=\"2808\" data-end=\"3123\">Hastings was murdered by a regime that viewed African children as political threats rather than students or even human beings. Police killed 575 youths and injured thousands more that day, yet the bloodshed failed to disrupt diplomatic and sporting relations between the apartheid state and several Western allies.</p><p data-start=\"3125\" data-end=\"3365\">Weeks later, as families buried their children in solemn funerals, New Zealand’s national rugby team, the All Blacks, landed at Jan Smuts Airport in Johannesburg on June 25, ready to play competitive matches inside the segregated republic.</p><p data-start=\"3367\" data-end=\"3642\">The tour provoked fury among many young African governments. Within weeks, the backlash reached the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games in Canada. Twenty-two African countries withdrew after President Michael Morris and the International Olympic Committee chose not to act against New Zealand.</p><p data-start=\"3644\" data-end=\"3901\">Athletes who had trained for years packed their bags and left the Olympic Village in Montreal, some after already competing. Morocco, Cameroon, Tunisia and Egypt began the Games before withdrawing as their delegations were urgently recalled by their governments.</p><p data-start=\"3903\" data-end=\"4367\">Nigeria, Ghana and Zambia pulled out of the men’s football tournament, collapsing first-round fixtures at Montreal’s Olympic Stadium and Varsity Stadium mid-competition. Television viewers worldwide watched empty lanes and abandoned tracks replace what had been promoted as a global event. More than 700 athletes forfeited Olympic participation, including world-record holders Filbert Bayi (1,500 metres) of Tanzania and Uganda’s John Akii-Bua (400-metre hurdles).</p><p data-start=\"4369\" data-end=\"4623\">African leaders recognised the scale of the decision. Nonetheless, they concluded that their countries’ Olympic participation would give “comfort and respectability to the South African racist regime and encourage it to continue to defy world opinion”.</p><p data-start=\"4625\" data-end=\"4921\">That moment offers a defining lesson for 2026: Boycotts come at a cost. They demand sacrifice, coordination and political courage. History shows that collective refusal can redirect global attention and force both institutions and spectators to confront injustices they might otherwise overlook.</p><p data-start=\"4923\" data-end=\"5031\">Nearly five decades later, Gaza presents a similar test amid a deepening and seemingly endless catastrophe.</p><p data-start=\"5033\" data-end=\"5114\">Take what happened to Sidra Hassouna, a seven-year-old Palestinian girl from Rafah.</p><p data-start=\"5116\" data-end=\"5305\">She was killed along with members of her family during an Israeli air strike on February 23, 2024, when the home they had sought shelter in was struck amid intense shelling in southern Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"5307\" data-end=\"5410\">Sidra’s story mirrors thousands of others and reveals the same truth: childhoods erased by bombardment.</p><p data-start=\"5412\" data-end=\"5699\">These killings have unfolded before a global audience. Unlike apartheid South Africa, Israel’s destruction of Gaza is being transmitted in real time, largely through Palestinian journalists and citizen reporters, nearly 300 of whom have been killed by Israeli air and artillery strikes.</p><p data-start=\"5701\" data-end=\"5962\">At the same time, the US continues supplying Israel with weapons, diplomatic cover and veto protection at the United Nations. While Trump’s civil liberties abuses are serious, they are not comparable in scale to the devastation endured by Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"5964\" data-end=\"6114\">The humanitarian toll is measured in destroyed hospitals, displaced families, enforced hunger and children buried beneath collapsed apartment blocks.</p><p data-start=\"6116\" data-end=\"6394\">The central question now is whether football can present itself as a weeks-long celebration of sporting prowess across 16 host cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June to July while the United States continues to sustain large-scale civilian destruction abroad.</p><p data-start=\"6396\" data-end=\"6594\">African political memory understands these stakes. The continent has witnessed how stadiums and international competitions can project political approval and how withdrawal can destroy that image.</p><p data-start=\"6596\" data-end=\"6890\">A coordinated boycott would require joint decisions by governments representing the qualified teams – Morocco, Senegal, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cape Verde and South Africa – supported by the African Union, regional institutions and the Confederation of African Football.</p><p data-start=\"6892\" data-end=\"6929\">The consequences would be immediate.</p><p data-start=\"6931\" data-end=\"7078\">The tournament would lose its claim to global inclusivity, and corporate sponsors would be compelled to confront questions they have long avoided.</p><p data-start=\"7080\" data-end=\"7135\">Most importantly, international attention would shift.</p><p data-start=\"7137\" data-end=\"7426\">Boycotts do not end conflicts overnight. They accomplish something different: They remove the comfort of pretending injustice does not exist. The 1976 Olympic withdrawal did not dismantle apartheid instantly, but it accelerated isolation and broadened the universal coalition opposing it.</p><p data-start=\"7428\" data-end=\"7728\">At present, FIFA’s longstanding political contradictions intensify the need for external pressure. At the World Cup draw in Washington, DC, on December 5, its president, Gianni Infantino, awarded Trump a “peace prize” for his efforts to “promote peace and unity around the world”.</p><p data-start=\"7730\" data-end=\"7867\">The organisation cannot portray itself as a neutral body while extending symbolic legitimacy to a leader overseeing mass civilian death.</p><p data-start=\"7869\" data-end=\"7940\">In that context, nonparticipation becomes a critical moral position.</p><p data-start=\"7942\" data-end=\"8104\">It would not immediately end Gaza’s calamity, but it would challenge US support for the sustained military onslaught and honour children like Hastings and Sidra.</p><p data-start=\"8106\" data-end=\"8307\">Although separated by decades and continents, their lives reveal a shared historical pattern: Children suffer first when imperial systems determine that Black and Brown lives hold absolutely no value.</p><p data-start=\"8309\" data-end=\"8564\">Africa’s stand in 1976 reshaped international resistance to apartheid. A comparable decision in 2026 could strengthen opposition to contemporary systems of domination and signal to families in Gaza that their suffering is recognised across the continent.</p><p data-start=\"8566\" data-end=\"8694\">History remembers those who reject injustice – and who choose comfort while children die under relentless air strikes and occupation.</p><p data-start=\"8696\" data-end=\"8886\">If African teams compete in the 2026 World Cup as if nothing is happening in Gaza City, Rafah, Khan Younis, Jenin and Hebron, their involvement risks legitimising colonial power structures.</p><p data-start=\"8888\" data-end=\"8990\">While European critics urge authorities to exclude the US, our history demands a complete withdrawal.</p><p data-start=\"8992\" data-end=\"9056\">Football cannot be played on the graves of Palestinian martyrs.</p><p data-start=\"9058\" data-end=\"9097\">Africa must boycott the 2026 World Cup.</p><p data-start=\"9058\" data-end=\"9097\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Voting will conclude later on Thursday with results anticipated on Friday.</p><p>More than 127 million eligible voters are participating in Bangladesh’s first election since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government fell in 2024 after widespread protests led largely by young people, who were killed in their hundreds by security forces at her order.</p><p>Hasina fled to India, where she remains in exile, and her party has been barred from the election. She has been sentenced to death in absentia for the crackdown.</p><p>Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has emerged as a frontrunner to form the next government. The son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Rahman returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London. He has committed to strengthening democratic institutions, re-establishing the rule of law, and addressing the country’s economic challenges.</p><p>Competing against the BNP is an 11-party coalition led by Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party. Previously banned under Hasina, the party has gained significant influence since her ouster.</p><p>After voting, Jamaat-e-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman expressed confidence, telling reporters, “It [the election] is a turning point. People demand change. They desire change. We also desire the change.”</p><p>The election is overseen by an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has promised a fair and transparent process. Approximately 500 international observers and foreign journalists, including delegations from the European Union and the Commonwealth, are monitoring the proceedings.</p><p>Bangladesh’s 350-seat Parliament includes 300 directly elected representatives and 50 seats reserved for women. The recent postponement of voting in one constituency following a candidate’s death leaves 299 seats being contested.</p><p>The outcome could fundamentally reshape Bangladesh, whose post-independence history since 1971 has been defined by entrenched political parties, military interventions, and contested elections. Young voters, including five million first-time participants who were instrumental in the 2024 uprising, are expected to significantly influence results.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It requires the Justice Department to publish all of its documents related to Epstein in an easily searchable format.</p><p>Though the law allows for some limited redaction to protect the identities of victims, critics argue that scores of documents have been published with heavy redactions. Some of those blacked-out sections appear to shield the identity of powerful figures involved with Epstein.</p><p>During her opening statement on Wednesday, Bondi, a prosecutor from Florida, defended her record of addressing sexual abuse.</p><p>“I have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"epstein-victims-were-present\">Epstein victims were present</h2><p>With several victims of Epstein seated behind her in the hearing room, Bondi forcefully defended the department’s handling of the files related to the well-connected financier, an issue that has dogged her tenure.</p><p>During her opening remarks, Bondi deemed Epstein a “monster” and issued an apology to the victims.</p><p>“I am deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster,” Bondi said.</p><p>At one point during the hearing, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, asked the Epstein victims to raise their hands if they had not had a chance to meet with a member of the Justice Department. All the victims raised their hands.</p><p>The victims included Danielle Bensky, who met Epstein in 2004 when she was 17 years old. She has accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her.</p><p>“There was such a lack of empathy today. There was such a lack of, honestly, humanity today,” Bensky told an NBC programme after the hearing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"bondi-clashes-with-democrats\">Bondi clashes with Democrats</h2><p>Congressional Democrats accused the US attorney general on Wednesday of engaging in a “cover-up” of the Jeffrey Epstein files and turning the Department of Justice into an “instrument of revenge” for Trump.</p><p>Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin criticised the slow release of the Epstein files and the redactions made to the documents.</p><p>“You’re running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “You’ve been ordered by subpoena and by Congress to turn over six million documents, photographs and videos in the Epstein files, but you’ve turned over only three million.”</p><p>When pressed by Representative Jayapal, Bondi refused to turn and face the Epstein victims in the audience and apologise for what Trump’s Justice Department has “put them through”. She accused the Democrat of “theatrics”.</p><p>Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett stormed out of the hearing after a spat with Bondi. “This is a big cover-up. And this administration is still engaged in it. In fact, this administration is complicit,” Crockett said.</p><p>During a heated exchange, Crockett said Bondi would be remembered as one of the worst attorneys general, prioritising loyalty to Trump over the law, before yielding the rest of her time.</p><p>Bondi shot back that Crockett had not even tried to question her and accused her of ignoring the fact that Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries had taken money from Epstein after his conviction, a claim Jeffries has denied.</p><p>The attorney general also clashed with Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California. Lieu asked whether Trump had attended a party with underage girls, a question Bondi deemed “ridiculous”.</p><p>Bondi insisted there was no evidence Trump had committed a crime.</p><p>Lieu suggested that her answer amounted to lying under oath, noting that Trump’s name appears repeatedly in the Epstein files. Bondi shot back: “Don’t you ever accuse me of committing a crime.”</p><p>Trump’s name appears multiple times in the released Epstein files, but not in connection with the sexual abuse of women. Rather, the records primarily show that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/how-well-did-trump-and-epstein-really-know-each-other-a-timeline\">he and Epstein were acquainted</a> and had a social relationship.</p><p>For instance, Trump was listed as a passenger on Epstein’s private jet at least eight times between 1993 and the mid-1990s.</p><p>On February 1, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One about his name being mentioned in the latest tranche of Epstein files: “I was told by some very important people that not only does it absolve me, it’s the opposite of what people were hoping, you know, the radical left.”</p><h2 id=\"republicans-join-democrats-in-questioning-bondi\">Republicans join Democrats in questioning Bondi</h2><p>Bondi accused Democrats of using the Epstein files to distract from Trump’s successes, even though it was Republicans who initiated the furore over the records and Bondi herself fanned the flames by distributing binders to conservative influencers at the White House last year.</p><p>Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to require the files’ release, accused the Justice Department of a “massive failure” to <a href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?search=all%3AL6N3WT1GT&amp;linkedFromStory=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comply with the law</a> as he questioned why billionaire Leslie Wexner’s name was redacted in an FBI document listing potential co-conspirators in the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.</p><p>Bondi said Wexner’s name appeared numerous times in other files the department released and that the DOJ unredacted his name on the document “within 40 minutes” of Massie spotting it.</p><p>“Forty minutes of me catching you red-handed,” Massie replied.</p><p>On Tuesday, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna revealed the names of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/six-men-named-in-us-congress-why-is-so-much-redacted-in-the-epstein-files\">six men</a>, including Wexner. The other names made public are Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the head of Dubai-based logistics company DP World, Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov and Nicola Caputo. Al Jazeera could not independently verify their identities or affiliations.</p><p>Khanna said he was revealing the men’s names after he reviewed the files with Massie.</p><h2 id=\"trump-orders-prosecutions-like-pizza-bondi-came-to-the-president-s-defence\">‘Trump orders prosecutions like pizza’: Bondi came to the president’s defence</h2><p>Raskin and other Democratic lawmakers condemned the prosecutions brought by the DOJ against Trump’s political foes, such as former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p>“You’ve turned the people’s Department of Justice into Trump’s instrument of revenge,” he said. “Trump orders up prosecutions like pizza and you deliver every time he tells you to.”</p><p>Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, is the only person behind bars in connection with Epstein. She was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking underage girls and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.</p><p>Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing regarding Epstein but he fought for months to prevent the release of the files about his one-time friend.</p><p>A rebellion among Republicans eventually forced the president to sign off on the law mandating the release of all the records.</p><p>The move reflected intense political pressure to address what many Americans, including Trump’s own supporters, have long suspected to be a cover-up to protect rich and powerful men in Epstein’s orbit.</p><p>Trump’s repeated denials of any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes have come under scrutiny due to a 2019 FBI interview – contained in the Epstein files – with Palm Beach’s then-police chief Michael Reiter.</p><p>Reiter told the FBI that Trump had called him in 2006 – when the sex charges against Epstein became public – to say: “Thank goodness you’re stopping him, everyone has known he’s been doing this.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Her security clearance was also revoked.</p><p>Palestinian leaders are now questioning whether Oslo’s foundational agreements of the two-state solution were brokered by a mediator vulnerable to elite blackmail and foreign intelligence pressure.</p><p>The plan was heralded in the Western world at the time, and in the 30 years since, has been trampled on by successive Israeli governments, with the far-right leadership now openly pushing for <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/palestinians-sense-west-bank-annexation-after-israel-approves-new-rules\">annexation of the occupied West Bank</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Investigations by the Norwegian broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.nrk.no/urix/slik-hjalp-rod-larsen-og-epstein-hverandre-med-rekruttering-1.17754499\">NRK</a> and newspaper <a href=\"https://www.dn.no/jus/utenriksdepartementet/terje-rod-larsen/jeffrey-epstein/rod-larsen-hjalp-epstein-med-visum-til-russisk-eks-modell/2-1-1937969\">Dagens Næringsliv</a> (DN) detail how Rod-Larsen used his position as president of the International Peace Institute (IPI) think tank in New York to launder the reputation of Epstein’s associates.</p><p>According to the files, Rod-Larsen wrote official letters of recommendation to US authorities to secure visas for young Russian women in Epstein’s orbit, claiming they possessed “extraordinary abilities” suitable for research roles.</p><p>In reality, these women were often models with no academic background who were allegedly trafficked and abused by the financier. One victim told NRK she believed Epstein sent her to Rod-Larsen’s institute “to manipulate” her, while another described how the diplomat facilitated her visa after a direct request from Epstein’s assistant.</p><p>The transactional nature of the relationship was explicit. Documents show Epstein loaned Rod-Larsen $130,000 in 2013. More damningly, reports indicate that Epstein’s last will and testament included a clause bequeathing $5m each to Rod-Larsen’s two children – a total of $10m.</p><h2 id=\"oslo-was-a-trap\">‘Oslo was a trap’</h2><p>For Palestinians living under the reality of the failed agreements Rod-Larsen forged, the scandal offers a disturbing explanation for a “peace process” that many believe was rigged.</p><p>Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative political party, told Al Jazeera he was “not surprised at all” by the corruption allegations.</p><p>“We never felt comfortable with this person from the very first moment,” Barghouti said. “Oslo was a trap … and I have no doubt that Terje Rod-Larsen was being effectively influenced by the Israeli side all along.”</p><p>Barghouti argued that the revelation of millions of dollars potentially flowing from a Mossad-linked figure like Epstein to the Rod-Larsen family suggests the corruption was “directed to serve Israel’s interests against the interests of the Palestinian people”.</p><p>The ties between the disgraced <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">Epstein and Israel</a> have come into sharp focus after the release of millions of documents.</p><p>The documents have revealed more details of Epstein’s interactions with members of the global elite, including former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. But they also document his funding of Israeli groups, including Friends of the IDF (Israeli army), and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his ties to members of Israel’s overseas intelligence services, the Mossad.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-missing-archive\">The missing archive</h2><p>The scandal has reignited calls in Norway to open the “private archive” Rod-Larsen kept regarding the 1993 secret negotiations.</p><p>Media investigations have revealed that <a href=\"https://www.dagogtid.no/samfunn/ud-dokument-finst-i-israelske-arkiv/614217\">documents</a> from the critical period between January and September 1993 are <a href=\"https://www.prio.org/publications/4097\">missing</a> from the official Foreign Ministry archive. Critics argue these missing files could obscure the extent to which personal leverage or blackmail played a role in the concessions extracted from the Palestinian leadership during the secret talks.</p><h2 id=\"governing-by-blackmail\">Governing by blackmail</h2><p>Analysts argue the Rod-Larsen case is symptomatic of a wider system of global governance driven by systematic blackmail and intelligence operations.</p><p>Wissam Afifa, a political analyst based in Gaza, drew a parallel between the exploitation of minors on Epstein’s island and the geopolitical treatment of Palestinians.</p><p>“We, as Palestinians, were treated as minors … considered as having no right to demand our rights,” Afifa said. “Today we discover that a large part of the international system is essentially ‘Epstein Island’”.</p><p>Afifa suggested that the “silence” of the international community regarding the current genocidal war on Gaza could be linked to similar networks of influence and extortion.</p><p>“The world was managed from Epstein’s island … in dark rooms,” Afifa added. “We are victims of the influence network that Epstein managed with politicians, leaders and states”.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.dn.no/politikk/jeffrey-epstein/terje-rod-larsen/international-peace-institute/ud-gjennomgar-forholdet-til-rod-larsens-tankesmie/2-1-1938768?abtest=a\">Norwegian authorities</a>, including the economic crime unit Okokrim, open investigations into the scandal, the legacy of the diplomat who once shook hands on the White House lawn lies in tatters, casting a long shadow over the history of deeply flawed Middle East peacemaking.</p></div></div></body></html>"

the 120-member assembly backed Kurti’s cabinet in a 66-49 vote on Wednesday, hours after parliament convened for the first time since his Vetevendosje party won a <a

the economy and increased investment in defence as key areas, with plans to invest one billion euros ($1.18bn) for military purposes, including the production of combat drones.</p><p>“During these years, as we have all witnessed, we have faced constant attacks and threats from Serbia,” said Kurti of tense relations with Kosovo’s northern neighbour, which has never recognised its independence since it was declared in 2008 after a war in the late 1990s.</p><p>However, the prime minister, a former political prisoner, promised to pursue “normalisation of relations” with Belgrade aimed at “a bilateral external relationship and not interference or meddling in internal affairs”.</p><p>Tensions remain high in Kosovo’s north, where most of the ethnic Serb minority live, but normalisation of

to confirm, after alleged inaccuracies in the tally triggered a full recount and a criminal investigation that has seen the arrests of more than 100 election staff.</p><p>Now confirmed as the

If the crime took place when the victim was a minor, then they have 10 years to sue from when they turn 18.<strong> </strong></p><p>In September 2022, Congress passed a law removing the statute of limitations for victims of child sex abuse, but that change did not apply to any crimes committed before that date.</p><p>Virginia’s Law calls for the 10-year statute of limitations for all federal civil cases relating to sexual abuse and trafficking – regardless of when abuses were committed – to be scrapped.</p><p>Introducing the law on Tuesday, Schumer told Congress: “When the truth of Jeffrey Epstein finally started to come out, when the world finally started to listen to their stories, oftentimes the laws in the books said, ‘Sorry, it’s too late. The deadline to bring your case has passed.</p><p>He said Virginia’s Law “will change that, because justice for victims of abuse should not have an expiration date”.</p><p>The bill will ultimately mean that many of Epstein’s alleged victims will now be able to lodge civil claims against Epstein’s estate.</p><p>“Virginia’s dream was to inspire and empower survivors to come forward in a world that too often turns away from abuse and pushes it into the shadows. She wanted to bring light,” Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, said during a news conference in the US Capitol.</p><p>Virginia’s Law also expands victims’ legal options in other respects, such as by covering relevant sex crimes committed outside the US where a US court has jurisdiction – for example, in cases where the abuser or victim is American or where there has been sex trafficking to or from the US.</p><p>Virginia’s Law would apply to federal cases only and will not change state statutes of limitations.</p><p>“The bill applies only to federal sex abuse crimes involving the mails or interstate commerce as stipulated in 18 USC 2421 et seq,” constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein told Al Jazeera.</p><p>This means the bill would cover federal sex‑abuse and trafficking crimes, which fall under the 1910 federal law, the Mann Act – cases in which the abuse involved crossing state lines or using the mails, the internet or other channels of interstate commerce.</p><p>“The federal bill would not supersede state laws that commonly create civil causes of action for sexual abuse, including assault. The state laws would complement the federal law,” Fein said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-bill-pass-into-law\">How does the bill pass into law?</h2><p>The bill will have to gain the approval of enough members of the Republican-dominated Senate and the House of Representatives before it can be signed into law.</p><p>The House includes 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats empty. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independent senators who caucus with the Democratic Party. So far, there is no scheduled date for a vote on Virginia’s Law in either chamber.</p><p>In both chambers, the law requires a simple majority of members present and voting, which means it needs 51 votes in the Senate and 217 votes in the House. The bill must pass both chambers before it goes to the Oval Office for the president to sign it into law.</p><p>However, a bipartisan push succeeded last year in forcing the Department of Justice to release all unclassified files from its Epstein investigation through the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-statute-of-limitations\">What is a statute of limitations?</h2><p>A statute of limitations is a time limit for bringing a case. In criminal law, it sets how long prosecutors have to file charges; in civil law, it sets how long a victim has to sue their abuser.</p><p>If this time limit elapses, a defendant cannot be prosecuted or sued, even if there is strong evidence that they committed a crime.</p><p id=\"according-to-an-article-published-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi\">Statutes of limitations exist to limit the deterioration of evidence, promote swift enforcement of the law and provide greater legal certainty, according to the FBI.</p><p>“Memories fade, witnesses die, and documents are commonly lost over time,” lawyer Fein said.</p><p>Crimes besides sexual abuse also have statutes of limitations.</p><p>In the US, statutes of limitations for nonfederal civil and criminal cases vary by state. In criminal cases, they can also vary depending on whether the sexual abuse was a “felony” or “misdemeanour”, and whether the victim was a minor or an adult.</p><p>Felonies are serious crimes punishable by a year or more in a state or federal prison, while misdemeanours are “less serious” crimes that are punishable by fines, probation, or less than one year in a local jail.</p><p>For example, in Alabama, there is no statute of limitations for criminal cases of rape, sexual abuse involving violence or threats of violence, or sexual offences against a victim below the age of 16.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Arkansas, the criminal statute of limitations is six years for rape and three years for certain sexual assault offences.</p><p>States usually have separate statutes of limitations for civil cases, and they can be very different from the criminal ones.</p><p>Many states are moving to increase or scrap statutes of limitations for sexual abuse cases. Iowa, Vermont, California, Texas and others have eliminated or greatly extended criminal statutes of limitations for many sex crimes for both criminal and civil cases.</p><p>Other states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Florida and Alabama, have expanded civil filing windows, often allowing victims to sue decades after the abuse or after it is discovered. Several have also lengthened or lifted criminal statutes of limitations for certain sex crimes, particularly where there is strong evidence, such as DNA.</p><p>Virginia’s Law will not supersede any state laws, as it will relate to federal cases only.</p><h2 id=\"what-can-we-expect-if-virginia-s-law-passes\">What can we expect if Virginia’s Law passes?</h2><p>The bill would scrap civil time limits so that many survivors whose cases are currently time‑barred would now be able to sue. Some lawyers expect a flurry of lawsuits, particularly from Epstein victims, if this happens.</p><p>In May 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law the New York State Adult Survivors Act (ASA), allowing adult survivors of sexual assault to file civil lawsuits, regardless of when the abuse occurred. In 2019, New York had opened a similar window for people abused as children under its Child Victims Act.</p><p>The ASA expired in late November 2023. While the Act was active, more than 3,000 civil suits were filed under it, including writer E Jean Carroll’s successful <a href=\"/news/2023/4/25/what-to-know-about-e-jean-carroll-civil-rape-trial-against-trump\">sexual abuse and defamation case</a> against President Donald Trump.</p><p>In June 2019, Carroll published an excerpt of her book in a New York Magazine article alleging that Trump had raped her in 1996. Trump denied these allegations. In November 2019, Carroll sued Trump for defamation. After the ASA took effect in 2022, she filed her lawsuit against Trump for defamation as well as sexual abuse.</p><p>“If the law passes, an indeterminate number of women may bring civil actions against men identified in the Epstein files, [for example] Prince Andrew, seeking damages,” Fein said.</p><p>“The number is unknown because victims commonly are reluctant to sue because of [the] social stigma attached to women perceived to be promiscuous.”</p><h2 id=\"have-some-victims-been-barred-from-suing-in-other-ways\">Have some victims been barred from suing in other ways?</h2><p>The Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program was a fund set up in June 2020 by Epstein’s estate, with court approval in the US Virgin Islands, to provide compensation to many women who say they were abused. However, they were required to waive their right to sue Epstein or his estate in exchange for the compensation.</p><p>Some 225 claims were submitted under this fund before it shut down in August 2021 at the end of its remit. It is unclear whether women who received payouts from the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program would be able to benefit from Virginia’s Law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
