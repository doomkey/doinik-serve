It has since suggested the drone was destroyed.</p><p>“The FAA and [the Department of Defense] acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote on <a href=\"https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/2021594420806639787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media</a> at 9:37 US Eastern time (14:37 GMT).</p><p>“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.”</p><p>But the Mexican government has not confirmed the drone incursion.</p><p>At her morning news conference, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters, “There is no information about drone use on the border,” but she added that the security cabinet would investigate the incident.</p><p>Anonymous US officials have told media outlets like CNN and CBS News that the sudden airspace closure may have been a false alarm, caused by the US military’s tests of its laser-based counter-drone system near El Paso.</p><p>CBS and Fox News also reported that, earlier this week, a party balloon was misidentified as a drone, prompting it to be shot down, according to official sources.</p><p>The El Paso airspace closure began abruptly late on Tuesday night and lasted until early Wednesday morning.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, the Trump administration framed the airspace closure as evidence of the threat from Mexican cartels.</p><p>Speaking to lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the alleged drone incident as she spoke of “striking crucial blows against terrorist organisations”.</p><p>“I think you’ve seen the news this morning,” Bondi told Congress members. “The news is reporting that cartel drones are being shot down by our military. That’s what we all should care about right now: protecting America.”</p><p>The Trump administration has frequently referred to criminal groups operating in Mexico as a threat to US national security.</p><p>Since taking office on January 20, 2025, Trump has started designating cartels across Latin America as “foreign terrorist organisations”, spurring fears that the US could launch aggressive, cross-border military actions.</p><p>Trump himself has threatened to strike drug trafficking groups in Mexican territory, despite criticism that such an attack would constitute a violation of Mexican sovereignty.</p><p>Already, Trump has authorised military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, on the pretext of disrupting international drug trafficking. He has alluded to land-based targets as an extension of that military campaign.</p><p>“We are going to start now hitting land. With regard to the cartels, the cartels are running Mexico. It’s very sad to watch,” Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview published on January 9.</p><p>“You see what’s happened to that country. But the cartels are running it.”</p><p>Some elected officials, however, have expressed scepticism about the Trump administration’s claims about a drone incursion on Wednesday. Democratic Congress member Veronica Escobar, who represents El Paso, was among those asking for more information.</p><p>“I believe the FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly,” Escobar said during a news conference.</p><p>“The information coming from the federal government does not add up.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

on comments made by his ministry last week that said Russia considered itself no longer bound by the treaty’s terms.</p><p>“We proceed from the fact that this moratorium, which was announced by our president, remains in effect, but only while the United States does not exceed the outlined limits,” said Lavrov.</p><p>“We have reason to believe that the United States is in no hurry to abandon these limits and that they will be observed for the foreseeable future,” he said, without explaining the basis for that assumption.</p><p>US President Donald Trump rejected an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin to voluntarily abide by the limits set out in New START for another year, saying he wanted a “new, improved and modernised” treaty rather than an extension of the old one.</p><p>Russia has also indicated it wants to strike a new arms control agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Washington is pushing for China to be included in the talks, pointing to its growing nuclear arsenal.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster than that of any other country by about 100 new warheads a year since 2023.</p><p>However, Beijing refuses to negotiate with the US and Russia because it says it has only a fraction of their warhead numbers – an estimated 600, compared with about 4,000 each for Russia and the US.</p><p>As the treaty expired, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China would not be joining the bilateral arms-reduction talks.</p><p>Moscow says if China is brought into a new deal, then so too should the US’s nuclear allies, the United Kingdom and France, which have 290 and 225 warheads, respectively.</p><p>New START, first signed in Prague in 2010 by the then-presidents of the US and Russia, Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limited each side’s nuclear arsenal to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads – a reduction of nearly 30 percent from the previous limit set in 2002.</p><p>Deployed weapons or warheads are those in active service and available for rapid use as opposed to those in storage or awaiting dismantlement.</p><p>It also allowed each side to conduct on-site inspections of the other’s nuclear arsenal, although these were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic and have not resumed since.</p><p>Russia in 2023 rejected inspections of its nuclear sites under the treaty, as tensions rose with the US over its nearly four-year war in Ukraine.</p><p>But it said it had remained committed to the quantitative limits set

This episode follows Karenzi, a former perpetrator who was allowed to return to his village through the Gacaca courts, Rwanda’s traditional community tribunals.

Relations between the two countries have long been marked by what many Lebanese describe as nearly 30 years of occupation and a tutelage rule by Syria over Lebanon, which ended when Syria withdrew its troops in 2005.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>About 2,400 Syrian prisoners are currently in Lebanese prisons. Some are held on “terrorism” charges while others are held for links to attacks against the Lebanese army. But most have never been tried despite having spent years in jail, largely due to a myriad of issues, including political gridlock, judicial strikes and general political indifference.</p><p>And while the deal reached on Friday may signal the beginning of a new relationship between Syria and Lebanon – one built on mutual respect rather than Syria’s direct or indirect control of the smaller state on its western border – it did not come about without any public controversy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Syrian eyes, many of the prisoners are being held for political rather than judicial reasons. The government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa believes they are in prison mostly due to the influence of the former al-Assad regime and its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon.</p><p>But for many Lebanese, anyone accused of attacks against the Lebanese armed forces should not be released.</p><p>“Lebanon has long insisted that anyone Syrian or otherwise accused of committing serious crimes against the Lebanese army should not be extradited,” David Wood, the senior Lebanon analyst at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera. “That has been one key obstacle to resolving this prisoner agreement up until now.”</p><h2 id=\"political-prisoners\">Political prisoners?</h2><p>Lebanese-Syrian relations have long been complex.

Lebanon and Syria signed a historic judicial agreement allowing convicted inmates to be transferred from the country where their sentence was issued to their country of nationality. This marks a significant step in judicial cooperation between the two neighbors. The agreement applies to hundreds of Syrian detainees currently held in Lebanese prisons, with the initial implementation set to transfer approximately 300 Syrian prisoners to Syria.

It spilled over into <a href=\"/news/2012/12/5/fatal-sectarian-clashes-in-lebanons-tripoli\">clashes in the northern city of Tripoli</a>; the <a href=\"/video/al-jazeera-world/2017/5/24/lebanon-the-battle-of-abra\">Battle of Abra</a>, which involved firebrand anti-Assad sheikh Ahmad al-Assir and Lebanese-Palestinian pop star Fadel Shaker; <a href=\"/news/2017/8/19/offensives-target-isil-on-lebanon-syria-border\">battles</a> with Hezbollah and the Lebanese army on one side and ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda-aligned groups on the other; and <a href=\"/news/2013/7/9/car-bomb-rocks-shia-suburb-in-beirut\">attacks</a> on Beirut’s southern suburbs.</p><p>In the intervening years, hundreds of Syrians were arrested by Lebanese authorities and held in Lebanon’s overcrowded prisons.</p><p>When the al-Assad regime fell, the new Syrian government quickly looked to reframe the relationship with Lebanon, expressing an interest in building ties based on mutual respect and interests.</p><p>Among Damascus’s priorities were delineating their shared border and economic and security cooperation. But it also prioritised the repatriation of Syrians in Lebanese prisons.</p><p>“The allegation from Damascus is that in many cases the reason for [imprisonment] is political and specifically due to perceived ties between the inmates and groups that were opposed to the former regime of Bashar al-Assad,” Wood said. In its view, “it was actually Assad’s Lebanese allies who conspired to make sure that these people were imprisoned in Lebanon.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>By that logic, the fall of al-Assad and the weakening of Hezbollah after <a href=\"/tag/israel-lebanon/\">Israel’s 2024 war on Lebanon</a> meant that these prisoners should be released.</p><p>Some Lebanese disagree and see the issue as more of a grey area. Even if the Syrian prisoners in question had fought Hezbollah, it had been at a time when the Shia group had been coordinating with the Lebanese army – and, for many Lebanese, fighting the army is a red line.</p><h2 id=\"an-important-step\">An important step</h2><p>On Friday, the agreement was signed with a number of Lebanese ministers present, including Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Mitri and the two countries’ justice ministers.</p><p>“This is a very important first step on the road of a comprehensive treatment regarding Syrian prisoners in Lebanese prisons,” Mitri said to reporters on Friday.</p><p>Syrian Justice Minister Mazhar al-Wais said: “This step will boost existing confidence, and we hope that relations will progress more.”</p><p>The agreement reportedly stipulates that over the next three months, about 300 prisoners will be repatriated to Syria and those serving time for serious crimes, such as rape or murder for example, must have served 10 or more years of their sentences in Lebanese prisons to be eligible for repatriation.</p><p>Lebanese prisoners, such as al-Assir, are not included in the deal.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But other issues remain. Among them are Lebanon’s backlogged judicial system and issues related to Lebanese inmates in Syrian prisons.</p><p>Only about 750 Syrian prisoners out of the 2,400 have been convicted. That means roughly 65 percent of prisoners are not eligible for repatriation yet.</p><p>Fadel Abdulghany of the Syrian Network for Human Rights described this as a “two-track” problem. On his personal website, Abdulghany noted that the transfer of prisoners convicted with final sentences can be carried out with a “swift step”.</p><p>However, for those who have yet to be convicted, the issue is not as straightforward. A mechanism for pretrial detention has not yet been agreed by the respective authorities.</p><p>“This is not merely a Syrian issue but one that touches the very structure of the Lebanese criminal justice system,” Abdulghany wrote. “Therefore, transferring convicts will not resolve the problem, because the root cause is the slow pace of procedures in Lebanon and the accumulation of detainees held without trial, along with the ensuing issues concerning the legality and continuation of their detention.”</p><p>He warned that such detainees could be used as political bargaining chips by Hezbollah. Some members or supporters of the group blame these prisoners for <a href=\"/news/2015/11/14/hezbollah-chief-vows-to-continue-fight-against-isil\">car bombings</a> or other such <a href=\"/news/2014/2/2/jabhat-al-nusra-claims-deadly-lebanon-bombing\">attacks on their villages</a>. While many of those attacks were on Shia Muslim areas where Hezbollah support is predominant, Christian villages, such as al-Qaa and Ras Baalbeck in the Bekaa Valley, were also subject to attacks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"there-are-no-names\">‘There are no names’</h2><p>Marcel Baloukji, a former brigadier general who oversaw the Lebanese army’s border committee with Syria, told Al Jazeera that the 300 or so prisoners who are to be transferred do not include many of the more hardened prisoners associated with ISIL or al-Qaeda whom Lebanese authorities have apprehended over the years.</p><p>But Baloukji also pointed out that the issue of Lebanese prisoners in Syrian jails is still important for the Lebanese side. Under the al-Assad regime, more than 100,000 people were forcibly disappeared, including hundreds or potentially thousands of Lebanese, going as far back as the Lebanese Civil War.</p><p><a href=\"/video/birds-eye-view/2025/2/3/patterns-of-mass-graves-in-syria\">Mass graves</a> have been found around Syria since the fall of the regime. However, much work needs to be done to identify all the bodies. Until now, the vast majority have still not been identified – neither Syrian nor Lebanese.</p><p>“There’s still a problem because there has to be an exchange between Lebanon and Syria,” Baloukji said. “There’s no one there. Most of them are not identified. There are no names.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the Justice Department’s handling of the release of the files – which advocacy groups and Epstein’s accusers said are far too heavily redacted – has come under fire.</p><p>So who are the six men named by Khanna?

It’s a little bit of a farce.”</p><p>The Justice Department began allowing members of Congress to view the unredacted files on Monday at its headquarters in Washington, DC. They may see the files on computers and may not bring any electronic devices with them. They are permitted only to take notes and may not make any electronic copies.</p><p>The Justice Department is believed to be in possession of nearly 6 million pages of documents related to Epstein. They are from about two decades of investigations into allegations that he had serially sexually abused girls. He died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting a sex-trafficking trial. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking two years later.</p><p>Although all of the files were supposed to have been released within 30 days of the Epstein Files Transparency Act being signed into law on November 19, so far 3.5 million have been.</p><p>The files referenced by Khanna and Massie do not appear to implicate the six men in any specific crimes.</p><p>However, Khanna said the redactions of their names was a failure of the Justice Department. The California lawmaker accused the government of shielding their names “for no apparent reason”.</p><p>Since Khanna’s speech to Congress, the Justice Department has partially unredacted some of the files he and Massie have pointed to.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-six-named-men\">What do we know about the six named men?</h2><p>Khanna identified one of the men in the files he reviewed as Wexner, the billionaire retail tycoon and former owner of Victoria’s Secret.</p><p>Wexner had a lengthy friendship with Epstein, whom he hired to handle his investments for many years.</p><p>While the relationship between Wexner and Epstein was already known, Khanna revealed that the FBI had also considered Wexner a coconspirator with Epstein at some point during its investigation. No criminal charges were ever brought against the billionaire in connection with Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>On Tuesday after Khanna’s speech, the Justice Department unredacted parts of an internal document dated August 15, 2019, from the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, which included a reference to Wexner as a coconspirator. That file can now be seen unredacted on the Justice Department’s website for the Epstein files.</p><p>Another of the men named by Khanna was Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, one of Dubai’s most powerful and well-connected people. The chairman and chief executive officer of the logistics giant DP World exchanged messages with Epstein for years before and after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p><p>The friendly exchanges between the two include discussions about deals and also mention bin Sulayem visiting Epstein’s private island while sharing contacts in business and politics.

ISIL (ISIS) in Sahel Province, or ISSP – a Niger-based outfit earlier known as the ISIL affiliate in the Greater Sahara or ISGS – has since <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/isil-claims-deadly-attack-on-air-base-near-niger\">claimed responsibility</a> and says it killed several soldiers, although the Nigerien army disputes this.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Analysts say the daring attack shows ISSP’s growing confidence at a time when the swarm of armed groups operating across the troubled Sahel region in Western Africa is expanding its areas of operation with advanced technology. Many of its fighters had breached military drone hangars using RPGs and mortars, and managed to damage several aircraft and one civilian aeroplane, according to videos from the group.</p><p>“This is unprecedented,” Heni Nsaibia, a senior analyst at the conflict monitoring think tank, ACLED, told Al Jazeera, noting that ISSP usually limits offences to rural areas and uses rudimentary weapons like AK-47s.</p><p>“They are refining their attacks and becoming more experienced in guerrilla warfare. To be able to infiltrate and penetrate the capital speaks to itself that they have tactical strength and boldness,” he said.</p><p>Although officially unconfirmed, conflict trackers suggest that ISSP may have deployed a drone in the assault, in what would mirror a region-wide trend that analysts say marks a dangerous escalation in the Sahel crisis. ISIL affiliates have used explosives-laden drones in rural attacks in Nigeria, but never in Niger.</p><p>“We have videos showing there was nocturnal gunfire from the Nigerien air defence,” Nsaibia added. “It’s possible they detected drones [from ISIL] used for surveillance, but it’s only a hypothesis.”</p><p>Military-ruled Niger has seen a rise in armed attacks since July 2023, when the army seized power and expelled hundreds of French and US troops that previously provided air and combat support.</p><p>Neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, which are also governed by the military, are also facing similar violence as several armed groups lay claim to swaths of territory across their porous borders. The groups aim to control territory without Western influence, and according to an extreme interpretation of Islamic law.</p><p>All three countries have pivoted from French troops to the Russian government-controlled <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/wagner-vs-africa-corps-the-future-of-russian-paramilitaries-in-mali\">Africa Corps</a>, a paramilitary group whose effectiveness has been mixed. In a statement following the Niamey attack, the Nigerien and Russian governments said Africa Corps fighters helped “repel” the assault and that 20 of the attackers were killed, with four soldiers wounded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4274984\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4274984\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4274984\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-29T201535Z_299532347_RC2WAJAGBNQQ_RTRMADP_3_NIGER-SECURITY-1769723703.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C431&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A satellite image shows Diori Hamani International Airport and military bases after gunfire and explosions, in Niamey, Niger\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4274984\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A satellite image shows Niamey international airport and military bases after gunfire and explosions in Niger, January 29, 2026 [Handout/Vantor via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"drone-use-surges-across-the-sahel\">Drone use surges across the Sahel</h2><p>Military drone attacks by the Nigerien forces and other parties to the conflict are common, but the armed groups themselves are increasingly repurposing easy-to-buy, easy-to-smuggle Chinese-made commercial drones for strikes by attaching improvised explosive devices (IEDs), grenades, or small mortar shells to them.</p><p>It is a “low-cost, high-impact” capability that provides the groups with real-time intelligence, minimises their need to risk fighters as suicide bombers, and makes it harder for militaries to detect and counter them, Rida Lyammouri, a senior fellow at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South (PCNS), said.</p><p>The most prolific drone user is the al Qaeda-linked Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), which is primarily based in Mali and Burkina Faso. The group has cells in Niger, Togo, and on the Benin-Nigeria border.</p><p>JNIM first used a drone in 2023, but without a significant impact. However, the group has since rapidly integrated the technology into battlefield operations, often pairing drone attacks with ground assaults in a two-pronged approach. Between 2023 and 2025, ACLED recorded JNIM using drones at least 89 times, with 69 incidents being for attacks. At least five other events saw JNIM drones crash or be intercepted.</p><p>“What’s alarming is how quickly they’ve developed this knowledge,” Lyammouri said.</p><p>The real risk, he added, lies beyond the group’s ability to use drones as a weapon.</p><p>“The drones used are very small, and they don’t carry an important amount of explosives, so the damages a lot of times are not as significant. But what is important is how they use drones to collect information and gather intelligence,” he said.</p><p>JNIM relies on the DJI M30T model, a high-end drone with an in-built camera ideal for night-time surveillance. The cheaper DJI Mavic, which costs between $500 and $700, is also part of the fleet.</p><p>Drones are likely helping the group monitor fuel trucks attempting to break its blockade on the Malian capital of Bamako, experts say. Since September, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/is-mali-about-to-fall-to-al-qaeda-affiliate-jnim\">JNIM has sealed off</a> highways used by fuel tankers importing oil from neighbouring Senegal and the Ivory Coast, causing periods of fuel shortages across Mali.</p><p>Similarly, the separatist Azawad Liberation Front (FLA), which is fighting for an independent state in northern Mali, released videos last February showing its fighters controlling a first-person view (FPV) drone – advanced models that help pilots have a “cockpit” viewing experience via special goggles. The FLA conducted 28 drone attacks between 2024 and 2025, according to ACLED. It used an FPV to down a Malian military helicopter in the northern Tessalit region in July 2024, according to the conflict reporting website, Military Africa.</p><p>ISIL affiliates are meanwhile using drones to a much lesser extent.</p><p>The Nigeria-based ISIL affiliate in West Africa Province (ISWAP) has deployed armed drones 10 times between 2024 and 2026, according to ACLED. In January, the group targeted Nigerian forces raiding one of its hideouts in northern Borno State with multiple armed drones.</p><p>The new shift is being accelerated by offline artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can help drones avoid traditional detection and jamming methods, Lyammouri said. They are also using these tools to generate training material, AI-generated images and press releases, he added. The open-source MISTRAL, a ChatGPT rival that is useful for everything from offline searches to content generation, is one such tool.</p><p>The shift to drone use by armed groups is global. ACLED in 2025 reported that 469 armed groups – including rebel groups, militias, gangs, and transnational cartels around the world – deployed a drone at least once in the past five years, up from only 10 groups using the technology in 2020.</p><h2 id=\"cooperation-at-a-time-of-tensions\">Cooperation at a time of tensions</h2><p>The likely next stage for drone use by armed groups could be AI-enabled “drone swarms” that could launch large-scale remote attacks on government positions featuring several drones at a time, analysts note.</p><p>For the groups, there is plenty of incentive to evolve quickly. Each group is willing to lay claim to its territory, and attacks like the one on Niamey not only aim to undermine the Nigerien government but also to signal to rival groups like JNIM not to intrude on that area, Nsaibia said.</p><p>Countries in the region will need to work together to jointly fight the groups’ new strategies, especially as they expand geographically and share technologies, Lyammouri warned.</p><p>Their “tactics are spreading and require a coordinated response”, he said, one that will necessitate bringing together drone warfare experts, AI researchers, and regional military planners to simulate the recorded drone warfare scenarios, like JNIM’s drone-assisted ground assaults and intelligence-gathering patterns.</p><p>That is tricky, however, amid regional tensions and a fragmented security response.</p><p>Following the 2023 coup in Niger, relations with neighbouring Nigeria became strained. Soon after, the two called off formal defence cooperation following threats by Abuja to lead the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) bloc into a military intervention to restore civilian rule.</p><p>Wider tensions between ECOWAS and the military governments in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso escalated last year and led to the three exiting to form their own union, the <a href=\"/features/2025/12/31/a-marriage-of-three-will-mali-niger-burkina-faso-bloc-reshape-the-sahel\">Alliance of Sahel States</a>.</p><p>However, this week, Nigerien and Nigerian security officials met in Abuja to discuss stronger border security to hamper smuggling routes that the armed groups use to transport weapons.</p><p>A collective regional solution is the only one that may succeed, experts agree.</p><p>Barring strong counters, important urban centres like Niamey, usually deemed safe, are going to be more “at risk in the medium to long term”, Nsaibia said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

In society, I hear the tired, hurtful refrain that we are taking jobs and houses, and that the government should pay for their people and not for us. They tell us we should go back where we came from. They also say that we are all the same – dangerous. Sometimes they use irony, saying, ‘Don’t take your knife out; I’ll give you everything you want.'”</p><p>He added, “This kind of stuff really hurts because, at least I can speak for myself, I am trying to begin a new life here where I feel safe. We experienced a lot of horrible things in the wars in our country and on the way here … [We’re] not really accepted by society, even though you try your best. This happens simply because your name is Ali or Mohammad and you are seen as a threat.”</p><p>Ahmed’s account echoes a broader shift across Europe, where hostile portrayals of migrants have been drawn upon by far-right figures, such as the British convicted criminal Tommy Robinson, who at a September 2025 rally in London said women in the UK were under threat because of “uncontrolled” migration.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305226\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305226\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305226\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-07T125517Z_1642120527_RC2Z6HAQ1PL6_RTRMADP_3_MIGRATION-GREECE-1770809038.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Migrants stand ashore Tsilia beach, after a group of migrants have been found safe ashore in the south of the island, while four bodies were recovered at sea during a SAR operation, a coastguard official said, on the island of Lesbos, Greece, October 7, 2025.

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_698c74e0-1770812640.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"309\" data-end=\"899\">A victim of Russia’s brutal aggression that’s generating a proper humanitarian catastrophe this winter, Ukraine is also stuck between two kinds of Western populism. One is that of Donald Trump and his European far-right equivalents, who don’t care much about either Ukraine or the rules-based order, only their private interests. The other one is that of the anti-Russian (and anti-Trump) hawks who tend to wrap the cynical interests of the military-industrial complex in phoney liberal rhetoric as they pretend to defend the values they don’t truly adhere to — not in Ukraine anyway.</p><p data-start=\"901\" data-end=\"1345\">With the Munich Security Conference, Europe’s most important event for foreign policy and military experts, approaching, its longtime chairman, Wolfgang Ischinger, set the agenda regarding the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, which is shifting into its fifth year this month. As long as Ukraine defends Europe, he told the Tagesspiegel, the Russian threat to Europe isn’t huge, but once the war is over, it will increase enormously.</p><p data-start=\"1347\" data-end=\"1641\">Even as he rushed to deny that he doesn’t want peace to be achieved any time soon, the message was clear: Ukraine is helping European countries to prepare for war with Russia (no matter how implausible this eventuality is looking now, given it presumes Kremlin rulers are essentially suicidal).</p><p data-start=\"1643\" data-end=\"1937\">At least this is how the Ukrainian ambassador in Berlin, Andrii Melnyk, read Ischinger’s stance. The argument that “Ukraine should bleed out just to buy Europe more time for its own defence” was cynical, he told Ischinger on X. Ukrainians urgently need a ceasefire, insisted the ambassador.</p><p data-start=\"1939\" data-end=\"2479\">Meanwhile, the idea that peace in Ukraine would be premature remains predominant in a few major European capitals, especially London, as well as inside hawkish American think tanks which have invested their reputation in defeating Russia — a goal that appears to be further away than ever before. Two prominent foreign policy scholars, Michael Kimmage and Hanna Notte, put it far more candidly than Ischinger in a Foreign Affairs piece. “Most important, the US and Europe shouldn’t rush any talks to end the conflict,” they wrote.</p><p data-start=\"2481\" data-end=\"2936\">This sentiment prevailed at the meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council at the end of January, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto suggested in an interview. Several European foreign ministers, he claimed, openly stated at the meeting that “the European Union is not prepared for peace”. This echoes Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s claim, made a year ago (according to Ukrainian media), that peace in Ukraine was riskier than war.</p><p data-start=\"2938\" data-end=\"3353\">The rationale behind these arguments is really hard to comprehend. Western powers have been steering Ukraine towards refusing any realistically attainable compromise for many years. The only result this policy has achieved is that realistic conditions for peace have considerably deteriorated compared to what Ukraine would have been getting by default during the talks in Istanbul in 2022 or Minsk in 2015.</p><p data-start=\"3355\" data-end=\"3867\">The threat of Russia attacking NATO countries is even harder to substantiate in a rational, unemotional conversation. Direct conflict between Russia and the West, which both sides made a point to avoid in the last four years, means nuclear war, which would end human civilisation as we know it. Economically and demographically, Russia is a dwarf compared with the EU alone, not to mention the combined force of the EU, the US and Britain. It can’t win a war against the West without resorting to nuclear weapons.</p><p data-start=\"3869\" data-end=\"4466\">An all-out conflict with the West is not a part of the mainstream political discourse in Russia or an ideological goal — unlike the USSR, modern Russia has no real ideology. There is no way Russia would attack NATO countries unless it senses a genuinely existential threat — through the blockade of its Baltic ports or Western-assisted missile strikes on Moscow from Ukraine’s territory. It’s indicative enough that for the last four years, Moscow hasn’t been directly responding to what people like former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson openly call the West’s proxy war against Russia.</p><p data-start=\"4468\" data-end=\"4775\">Wild claims grossly misinterpreting Russia’s motives and intentions are an integral part of jingoistic populism, which has been fuelling this conflict for years. So, it has turned out, was the false promise of defeating the world’s leading nuclear power by a combination of economic and military means.</p><p data-start=\"4777\" data-end=\"5198\">Speaking at the Munich conference in 2022, days before the start of Russia’s all-out invasion, the same Boris Johnson — then still in office — said that “Russia must fail and be seen to fail”. Just over a month later, Johnson would help derail the peace talks in Istanbul, which could have ended the armed conflict at the outset, according to top Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia and a plethora of other sources.</p><p data-start=\"5200\" data-end=\"5794\">Addressing a huge crowd in Warsaw in March 2022, then-US President Joe Biden effectively pledged to topple Vladimir Putin: “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power”. He also claimed that Western sanctions had “reduced the rouble to rubble” and that the dollar was trading at 200 roubles at the time of speaking. It was a direct lie. The real rate on that day was 95 roubles per dollar. It is less than 80 roubles per dollar today. Last year, the rouble emerged as one of the world’s best-performing currencies, surging by 44 percent against the dollar year on year.</p><p data-start=\"5796\" data-end=\"6222\">EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas kept saying that she believed in Ukraine’s ability to defeat Russia as late as October 2025 — an assessment that completely contradicted the reality on the ground since 2023 when, after the failed Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russia began its slow offensive, which continues today, while Ukraine’s crucial infrastructure is being turned into rubble and the country is rapidly depopulating.</p><p data-start=\"6224\" data-end=\"6706\">Coming from people who claim to be “liberals”, this unhinged populism creates a paradoxical situation in which certified far-right populists, such as Trump or Hungary’s Orban, as well as the leaders of Germany’s AfD, begin to come across as reasonable and conflict-averse people when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine. They’ve long figured out that they can exploit their opponents’ Russophobia by exposing their incessant lies, exaggerations and unfounded boasts.</p><p data-start=\"6708\" data-end=\"7255\">The West’s entire policy towards Russia and Ukraine for the last 30 years has been a catastrophic failure, which has created a great boon and an inexhaustible source of political fuel for anti-establishment actors. The never-ending postponement of peace in Ukraine derives from the fact that too many people have been too badly invested in unrealistic outcomes of the war, so they keep buying more and more time to mitigate the impact. But it comes at a huge cost that Ukrainians are paying with their lives and their country’s future.</p><p data-start=\"6708\" data-end=\"7255\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
