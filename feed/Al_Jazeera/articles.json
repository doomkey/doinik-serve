Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, disputed that characterisation.</p>\n<p>“There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in,” Cheung <a href=\"https://x.com/StevenCheung/status/1841242913302327506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media. “They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented.”</p>\n<p>The back-and-forth escalated when 60 Minutes aired two different cuts from its interview with Harris.</p>\n<p>One version, which aired on a sister programme, Face The Nation, featured more of Harris’s answer about her stance towards Israel. The other version, which aired on the 60 Minutes broadcast, was shorter.</p>\n<p>Trump called the different edits evidence of deceptive reporting tactics and filed a lawsuit against Paramount, CBS’s parent company.</p>\n<p>“CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” his court filing alleged.</p>\n<p>“That is false,” 60 Minutes responded in a statement on its website.</p>\n<p>“When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.”</p>\n<p>While many media experts expected Paramount to prevail on the merits of the case, the company instead sought to negotiate an end to the matter. Earlier this month, it agreed to pay $16m to Trump to go towards his future presidential library.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, another top CBS show, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, revealed it had been cancelled, allegedly for financial reasons.</p>\n<p>But the timing and unexpected nature of the cancellation drew speculation that it might have been an attempt to appease Trump and streamline the merger, given the fact that Colbert frequently lambasted the Republican president on his show.</p>\n<p>Trump himself <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114874422468516376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on Truth Social, “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.”</p>\n<p>The Late Show was consistently the top-rated late-night comedy show, and it had won a Peabody Award and multiple Emmy nods.</p>\n<p>Days later, on July 22, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114897600777919524\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> for more comedians to be ousted, writing, “It’s really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!”</p>\n<p>That same day, he confirmed he received the $16m for his 60 Minutes settlement, adding that he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114898229237459086\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expected</a> to be receive an additional $20m in free advertising and programming from the “new owners”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-park-tv-show-takes-aim\">South Park TV show takes aim</h2>\n<p>Within weeks of both the 60 Minutes lawsuit settlement and the cancellation of The Late Show, the FCC gave its blessing to the merger between Paramount and Skydance.</p>\n<p>Under the merger, Skydance founder David Ellison, the son of Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, is slated to helm operations.</p>\n<p>Upon the merger’s approval, Trump’s appointee to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, released a <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1948503402213671247/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> echoing some of the president’s criticisms of major news outlets.</p>\n<p>He also hinted that the merger would result in changes to CBS’s news output.</p>\n<p>“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” he wrote. “It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcasting network.”</p>\n<p>“In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.”</p>\n<p>To ensure compliance with that commitment, Carr said an ombudsman would be appointed to the media giant for a period of at least two years.</p>\n<p>Carr added that the merger between Skydance and Paramount would also bar the new mega-company from implementing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, which are designed to create an equal playing field for people regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion or ability.</p>\n<p>But the merger did not put an end to the scrutiny of Trump on Paramount platforms.</p>\n<p>Hours after the FCC granted its approval, the TV channel Comedy Central aired an episode of the animated series South Park that mocked President Trump and satirised its parent company’s $16m settlement.</p>\n<p>In one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI34iAvKyVQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scene</a>, an animated Jesus attempts to warn the show’s characters about Trump.</p>\n<p>“The guy can do whatever he wants now that someone backed down, OK?” the animated Jesus says. “You guys saw what happened to CBS? Yeah, well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert?”</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has since blasted the show as irrelevant.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Now at 1.6 percent, the monthly rate is among the lowest since April 2020.</p>\n<p>Back in 2023, high inflation put a great strain on Argentina’s population, with prices of basic goods – such as food, services and rent — escalating month on month while salaries stayed stagnant.</p>\n<p>Argentina has a history of high inflation going back to the 1940s, including several cycles of hyperinflation, the most recent in the late 1980s, pointed out Mariana Heredia, a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Conicet).</p>\n<p>“Inflation is a global phenomenon, but in Argentina, it has been such a constant that people tend to think that all their problems are related to inflation. For people here, stability is very important,” Heredia told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why the promise to tackle inflation helped Milei garner significant support on his way to the presidency. He now says achieving the lower rate is evidence of the success of his economic programme, which made radical cuts to public spending, including in healthcare, <a href=\"/news/2024/10/3/defying-protesters-argentinas-milei-shoots-down-university-funding-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">education</a>, social services and public infrastructure works, to achieve a fiscal surplus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857228\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857228\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-2.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468217.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857228\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-2.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468217.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857228\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Despite a drastic cut in inflation, Argentina continues to be one of the most expensive countries on the continent [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But his programme has also involved an early nominal devaluation, which then saw the Argentian peso appreciate, making the country more expensive in dollars. This, combined with a sharp fall in real wages, has delivered a significant blow to the purchasing power of large sections of the population.</p>\n<p>Argentina is now among the most expensive countries in Latin America, but it also has some of the lowest salaries.</p>\n<p>While tackling inflation was essential to start fixing Argentina’s ailing economy, it’s proving not to be enough, experts say.</p>\n<p>“Inflation isn’t everything,” Guido Zack, economy director at Fundar, a national think tank, told Al Jazeera. “Having a low inflation rate is important, but [in Argentina] the economic recovery has been very mixed among sectors of the economy and of the population. The majority of the population still has a low purchasing power, the rate of informal work has risen, and the poverty rate is still very high. There’s still a long way to go.”</p>\n<p>Other analysts have criticised aspects of the methodology used to calculate inflation in Argentina. They say the basket of goods and services used to measure it, developed in 2004 and updated in 2016, does not accurately reflect current consumption patterns. This includes the share of income that goes into paying for housing, which rose in the renter-dense greater Buenos Aires area by 4.5 percent in June alone. According to a September poll from Inquilinos Agrupados (Organised Renters), which surveys tenants twice a year, renters spend an average of 44.5 percent of their income on rent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"economic-stress\">‘Economic Stress’</h2>\n<p>The mismatch between some economic indicators and what people are experiencing in their daily lives is what the Observatory of Social Debt of the Catholic University of Argentina has called “economic stress” — the increased perception, or reality, that most salaries are not enough to cover basic living expenses.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857236\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857236\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-3.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468571.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857236\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-3.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468571.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Argentinians are taking loans to pay for food [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This is particularly evident in the country’s increasing rate of personal borrowing. According to a recent report by the Social and Economic Statistics and Tendencies Institute (Instituto de Estadísticas y Tendencias Sociales y Economicas – IETSE), 91 percent of homes in Argentina have some form of debt, and 58 percent of those loans were taken to buy food in 2024.</p>\n<p>“Sales have slowed right down in recent months,” Martinez, the butcher, said. “People are always looking for discounts, buy smaller quantities, maybe for the day, and tend to pay with credit card; it’s hard to find anyone paying in cash.”</p>\n<p>People’s frustration at the economy is also evident on the streets of Buenos Aires, where protests against inflation and cuts to public funding – mostly led by pensioners – have increased.</p>\n<p>Every Wednesday, pensioners gather in front of Congress in Buenos Aires to demand a rise in their state pensions. The current pension for five million people stands at $300 a month, below the minimum living wage. Milei has promised to veto a bill approved by Congress for a rise in pensions.</p>\n<p>Raul Maldonado, 68, retired in 2020 after working as a lathe operator in a factory for 35 years. He now makes just more than the minimum pension.</p>\n<p>“The money I earn lasts 15 days. If it wasn’t for the help of my family, I would not be able to survive,” he says.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857253\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857253\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pensioners-protesting-in-Argentina-Josefina-Salomon-1753468818.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857253\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pensioners-protesting-in-Argentina-Josefina-Salomon-1753468818.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C475&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pensioners protesting in Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pensioners protesting in Buenos Aires in Argentina [Josefina Salomon]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-long-game\">The long game</h2>\n<p>As Milei promises to continue pushing through with his current economic plan, the question is whether he can keep inflation down and adopt measures to improve other indicators.</p>\n<p>Heredia says that the type of anti-inflationary programme, focused on cuts to public spending and an appreciated currency, is similar to others implemented in Argentina in the past, but which failed to work in the long run.</p>\n<p>“At first, these kinds of programmes can bring people some initial relief – they generate some economic bounce back and, to a certain extent, an increased income to some high-earning sectors. But in the midterm, the costs start to show when it comes to the public spending cuts, the opening of the economy to imports that affect local production and its impact on the job market.”</p>\n<p>For Zack, the key to the long-term economic recovery is the adoption of measures aimed at improving some of the structural challenges Argentina faces, which have a negative impact on the economy.</p>\n<p>Among them, he lists the country’s complex tax system, high levels of bureaucracy, the current lack of investment in public infrastructure, such as roads to connect the country, as well as the low exchange rate and openness to imports.</p>\n<p>“Even if Argentina manages to sustain low inflation, that’s a complicated cocktail” to tackle, Zack said.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Some immigrants have said they faced floodwater, poor sanitation, clogged toilets and clouds of mosquitoes as they stayed in fenced-in units where the lights were never dimmed.</p>\n<p>Environmental groups and Indigenous members of the local Seminole and Miccosukee tribes have also criticised the facility for its location in the middle of the Everglades wetlands, a sensitive ecosystem prone to seasonal flooding.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"utilising-an-old-airfield\">Utilising an old airfield</h2>\n<p>Built across eight days in June, Alligator Alcatraz sits atop the site of the former Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida.</p>\n<p>That set-up has been a benefit for plans to also use the facility for deportation flights, DeSantis said on Friday. He described transferring immigrants from their detention cells to planes with relative ease.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons why this was a sensible spot is because you have this runway that’s right here,” DeSantis explained.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to drive them an hour to an airport. You go a couple thousand feet, and they can be on a plane and out of here.”</p>\n<p>He added that the site already has runway lighting and 18,927 litres — or 5,000 gallons — of jet fuel on site. That, he hopes, will help pave the way for the number of deportation flights to increase in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“ The cadence is increasing,” DeSantis said. “We’ve already had a number of flights in the last few days.”</p>\n<p>Alligator Alcatraz — named for a forbidding island prison in the San Francisco Bay that closed in the 1960s — has the capacity to hold up to 3,000 people, according to Florida officials.</p>\n<p>DeSantis has long positioned Florida as the “blueprint” for what Republican leadership in the US could look like, and in 2023, he launched a <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/ron-desantis-files-paperwork-for-us-presidential-campaign\">short-lived presidential campaign</a> to challenge Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"increasing-the-pace\">Increasing the pace</h2>\n<p>In his remarks on Friday, DeSantis briefly acknowledged the shortcomings in Trump’s mass-deportation plans, playing up the efficiency of the Alligator Alcatraz system.</p>\n<p>“ICE has been understaffed — you know, is not scratching the surface of what would need to be done to get to where you have the largest mass deportation in history,” he said.</p>\n<p>“So you’ve got to increase that tempo. You have a limited amount of time to do it. I think we’ve got to assume we’ve got these four years under the Trump administration to really get the job done.”</p>\n<p>DeSantis also brushed aside concerns that the isolated facility cuts immigrants off from their legal representation and their right to be heard before a court.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that he plans to have immigration judges on site. But he also questioned whether undocumented people should be allowed the same due process rights as US citizens and immigrants with legal status.</p>\n<p>“To me, it’s like, if you are subjected to a traditional criminal process, there’s a whole a bunch of due process that goes into that,” DeSantis said.</p>\n<p>By contrast, DeSantis argued that the immigration process “should be a pretty simple process. You either have a right to be here or you don’t.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population.”</p>\n<p>Macron’s announcement drew the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/25/us-israel-condemn-frances-move-to-recognise-palestinian-state\">ire of Israeli leaders</a>, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said the move “rewards terror”.</p>\n<p>But Netanyahu has faced widespread condemnation for Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 59,000 Palestinians since it began in October 2023.</p>\n<p>Israel’s blockade of the enclave has caused a deepening humanitarian crisis, with the United Nations and top human rights groups reporting that many Palestinian children are now suffering from severe malnutrition and at risk of death.</p>\n<p>In a statement on Friday, Starmer said “the appalling scenes in Gaza are unrelenting”.</p>\n<p>“The continued captivity of hostages, the starvation and denial of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people, the increasing violence from extremist settler groups, and Israel’s disproportionate military escalation in Gaza are all indefensible,” he said.</p>\n<p>But Starmer stopped short of announcing plans to recognise a Palestinian state, instead saying he was working “on a pathway to peace in the region”.</p>\n<p>“That pathway will set out the concrete steps needed to turn the ceasefire so desperately needed, into a lasting peace,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Recognition of a Palestinian state has to be one of those steps. I am unequivocal about that. But it must be part of a wider plan which ultimately results in a two-state solution and lasting security for Palestinians and Israelis.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Reporting from a protest outside Starmer’s residence in London on Friday afternoon, Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic said demonstrators expressed “outrage” at the British government’s stance amid the dire situation in Gaza.</p>\n<p>“Many of them feel powerless, so one of the only things they can do is gather here, make as much noise as they can, and hope that it will be noticed by the people in power,” she said.</p>\n<p>“They want Keir Starmer to do more with the power that he has, and with the influence that he has, to put an end to this.”</p>\n<p>In addition to recognising a Palestinian state, the British government has faced growing calls to sanction Israel and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/4/pro-palestine-protesters-in-uk-call-for-israel-arms-embargo-sanctions\">impose an arms embargo</a> against the country.</p>\n<p>Veselinovic said Starmer is in “a difficult diplomatic situation” as he prepares to meet United States President <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/us-doctors-veterans-urge-trump-to-end-israel-support-as-hunger-grips-gaza\">Donald Trump</a>, who was travelling to Scotland on Friday.</p>\n<p>She explained that Macron’s announcement added pressure on the UK, which is a close ally of both France and the US, to also recognise a Palestinian state, but noted that Trump has criticised the French president’s move.</p>\n<p>“It does seem like a gulf is emerging here over what the European stance is overall, which is much more aligned with what UN aid agencies are saying is going on on the ground in Gaza, and the American position, which seems to nearly 100 percent back whatever is the Israeli government’s version of events is,” she said.</p>\n<p>“And in the middle of that is Keir Starmer, who wants to maintain good relations with both sides.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Full-year sales, earlier seen up to 5 percent higher, are expected to be level with the previous year.</p>\n<p>Investors had largely anticipated a guidance cut after the company held off on assessing the damage from tariffs in the previous quarter and appeared calmed by assurances that the group’s luxury brands Audi and Porsche would recover next year after heavy losses in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>CEO Oliver Blume told investors the company must accelerate its cost-cutting efforts in response to the tariffs.</p>\n<p>“We need to shift our cost efforts into high gear and accelerate implementation. After all, we cannot assume that the tariff situation is only temporary,” Blume said.</p>\n<p>Global carmakers have booked billions of dollars in losses and some have issued profit warnings due to US tariffs. The European industry is also facing <a href=\"/video/counting-the-cost/2025/7/24/china-v-eu-the-fight-for-europes-electric-vehicle-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stiffening competition from China</a> and domestic regulations aimed at speeding up the electric vehicle transition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tariff-hit\">Tariff hit</h2>\n<p>Volkswagen is the third automaker this week to report a hit to their profits because of tariffs. Michigan-based <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/22/general-motors-reports-a-35-profit-drop-as-tariffs-weigh-on-car-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">General Motors reported that tariffs</a> cost it $1.1bn in the second quarter. Stellantis, the maker of brands including Jeep and Fiat, reported a $2.7bn loss for the first six months of 2025.</p>\n<p>VW and its competitors are pressing European trade negotiators to strike a deal to <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/27/trump-threatens-25-tariffs-on-eu-claims-bloc-was-formed-to-screw-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce a 25 percent</a> US tariff they have faced since April.</p>\n<p>EU diplomats have indicated that the bloc could be moving towards a broad 15 percent tariff as it seeks to avoid a threatened 30 percent levy from August 1. A deal struck between the US and Japan this week raised hopes for a similar agreement for Europe, boosting carmakers’ shares.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>VW finance chief Arno Antlitz said Volkswagen’s profit margin would land roughly in the middle of its guidance with a Japan-style deal, which had a 15 percent tariff rate.</p>\n<p>He warned, however, that the clock was ticking on finding a deal. “We are already in July, so the longer we go into the second half of the year, the more we tend to the lower end of the guidance,” he said.</p>\n<p>Antlitz declined to comment on price increases when pressed by investors on how the company planned to protect its margins against tariffs.</p>\n<p>Volkswagen reported an operating profit of $4.4bn (3.8 billion euros) in the quarter ended June 30, down 29 percent on the previous year. It cited tariffs and restructuring costs for the decline as well as higher sales of lower-margin all-electric models.</p>\n<p>While Volkswagen was able to boost deliveries globally by 1.5 percent in the first six months of 2025, the group saw a decline of almost 10 percent in deliveries to the US.</p>\n<p>North American sales revenue accounted for 18.5 percent of the carmaker’s global sales in the first half.</p>\n<p>Car sales data for June highlighted a broader slowdown in Europe’s struggling auto sector – and showed Volkswagen among the laggards as the company undergoes a major overhaul to cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>Porsche and Audi are particularly exposed to US tariffs given they have no production there and rely heavily on exports.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, Porsche’s operating result plunged by more than 90 percent to 154 million euros ($181m) and Audi’s by 64 percent to 550 million euros ($647m).</p>\n<p>“For both companies, Audi and Porsche, we are expecting that we will touch the bottom this year with positive momentum from 2026 onwards,” Blume said.</p>\n<p>Despite the losses, VW’s stock is on the upswing. As of noon in New York (16:00 GMT), it was up more than 3 percent since the market opened and up more than 12 percent over the last five days in trading.</p>\n<p>The stocks of other carmakers that also reported tariff hits are trending upwards. Stellantis is up 3.9 percent for the day. GM is about even – up by only about 0.2 percent.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
