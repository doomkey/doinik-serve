The total value of the assets is reportedly believed to be close to the cost of damages incurred in Tehran.</p><p>Popular former footballer Voria Ghafouri, who had been arrested in 2022 for <a href=\"/news/2022/11/25/iran-arrests-footballer-ghafouri-for-spreading-propaganda\">supporting previous nationwide protests</a>, also had his cafe confiscated.</p><h2 id=\"trump-threats-crossing-red-line\">Trump threats ‘crossing red line’</h2><p>At the height of the protests, Trump called on Iranians to “take over” government institutions, alleging “help is on the way”, before expressing “great respect” for the Iranian leadership based on a claim that planned hangings for more than 800 political prisoners were halted.</p><p>But then on Saturday, Trump said it is time for an end to the 37-year rule of Khamenei in Iran – prompting some of the highest authorities of the Islamic Republic to shoot back.</p><p>In a statement carried by state media, the Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member constitutional watchdog that has to approve legislation before it becomes law, said it condemns the “insult and baseless rhetoric of the criminal and foolish” US president.</p><p>The council stressed that any transgression against the supreme leader “is considered crossing the red line of the devout people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and will entail heavy costs and serious consequences”.</p><p>Ghalibaf, the parliament chief, told a public session of parliament on Monday that Trump “used all of his non-existent credibility to extend chaos, insecurity and killings in Iran”.</p><h2 id=\"internet-blackout-remains-in-place\">Internet blackout remains in place</h2><p>Meanwhile, Hossein Afshin, deputy for scientific affairs to the Iranian president, told reporters on Monday that internet restrictions will “gradually” be lifted from the end of the week, but did not divulge further information.</p><p>NetBlocks and other international monitors said the occasional internet reconnections signal that the establishment may be testing ways to more vigorously enforce its controlled digital blackout of the Iranian population.</p><p></p><p>State media announced on Monday that the chief executive of Irancell, one of the country’s top mobile and internet carriers, was replaced.</p><p>The move came after “some of Irancell’s operators refrained from the order to restrict communications” on January 8 for several hours, according to the Tasnim news agency, also affiliated with the IRGC. That was the night when the internet and all mobile communications were abruptly cut off at an unprecedented scale.</p><p>According to state media, the reformist Ham-Mihan daily newspaper was confiscated on Monday, with two reports written about the protests cited as the reason.</p><p>State television also confirmed on Monday that its satellite broadcast was “disrupted by an unidentified source for moments” the night before. The feed appeared to show moments from the nationwide protests at the time of hijacking.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His attendance comes amid strained US ties with its European allies over his threat to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.</p><p>Here is more about the WEF and what to expect at the meeting.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248969\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-What-is-the-World-Economic-Forum-1768737184.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - What is the World Economic Forum 2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-wef\">What is the WEF?</h2><p>The WEF is a think tank and event organiser based in the Swiss city of Geneva. The first summit held in Davos in 1971 was a gathering of business executives. However, over the years, it has expanded in scope, discussing issues as diverse as economic disparity, climate change, technology and global cooperation.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-the-wef-summit-in-2026\">Where is the WEF summit in 2026?</h2><p>The summit is at the conference centre in Davos, an Alpine town in Switzerland, famous for its ski resort and home to about 10,000 people.</p><p>Davos, at a height of about 1,500 metres (nearly 5,000 feet), is located in the Graubunden canton in the eastern Alps of Switzerland.</p><p>It has been the venue of the WEF summit every year in January since 1971.</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-summit-at-davos\">When is the summit at Davos?</h2><p>The main sessions began on Monday, January 19, and the annual meeting will wrap up on January 23.</p><p>Sessions begin at 9am (08:00 GMT) every day.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-expected-to-attend-and-who-isn-t\">Who is expected to attend, and who isn’t?</h2><p>Nearly 3,000 high-level participants from business, government and beyond, plus untold numbers of activists, journalists and outside observers are expected to attend.</p><p>Organisers say a record of nearly 400 top political leaders, including more than 60 heads of state and government, and about 850 chairpersons and chief executives of many of the world’s leading companies, are attending.</p><p>Headlining the lineup is Trump, who is set to deliver a speech on Wednesday, and several cabinet ministers and top advisers, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and special envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p>Trump also wants to hold a meeting of his ‘Board of Peace’ on Gaza at the annual gathering, according to a report by Bloomberg news.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are among the who’s who attending the WEF summit.</p><p>Organisers say 55 ministers for economy and finance, 33 ministers for foreign affairs, 34 ministers for trade, commerce and industry, and 11 central bank governors are also expected.</p><p>Tech titans scheduled to be on hand include Jensen Huang of Nvidia, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, and Arthur Mensch of France’s Mistral AI.</p><p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala are among several top officials from international institutions.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-not-attending\">Who is not attending?</h2><p>Iran’s foreign minister will not be attending the summit, the organisers said on Monday, stressing it would not be “right” after the recent deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran. <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/iran-in-limbo-whats-next-for-country-under-internet-blackout\">Abbas Araghchi</a> had been scheduled to speak on Tuesday.</p><p>“The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos,” the WEF said on X.</p><p>“Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” it added.</p><p>Israel, accused of committing genocide in Gaza, has also been invited. President Isaac Herzog will represent Israel at the event.</p><p>Mozambique President Daniel Chapo cancelled his trip to Davos and will not attend the meeting due to massive flooding in his country. He said on social media late on Sunday that “the absolute priority at this moment is to save lives”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-on-the-agenda\">What is on the agenda?</h2><p>The theme this year is “A Spirit of Dialogue”. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues ranging from geopolitics and artificial intelligence to climate change.</p><p>Trump is expected to meet global business leaders on Wednesday, the Reuters news agency reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.</p><p>Business leaders, including CEOs in financial services, crypto and consulting, are invited to a reception after Trump’s address to the WEF’s annual meeting, the sources told Reuters on Monday. The agenda was unclear.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-different-this-year\">What’s different this year?</h2><p>The geopolitical context has become incredibly complex this year: Trump’s pronouncements and policies on subjects as diverse as Venezuela, Greenland and Iran — not to mention his aggressive tariff policies — have upended the world order and raised questions about the US role in the world.</p><p>European Union leaders have dubbed Trump’s threat to slap new tariffs over his Greenland takeover bid a “blackmail”.</p><p>The advent of AI – its promise and perils – has also become a hot topic. Business executives will examine how to apply it to boost efficiency and profits; labour leaders and advocacy groups will warn of its threat to jobs and livelihoods, and policymakers will look to navigate the best way forward between regulation and the right to innovate.</p><p>Davos conference organisers always trot out buzzwords for the meeting, and this year, it is “A Spirit of Dialogue” – around five themes of cooperation, growth, investment in people, innovation and building prosperity.</p><p>Critics say Davos is too much talk and not enough action to rectify the gaping inequality in the world and address troubles like climate change.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Something in the way he said it – phase two – really made it sound like things might finally be turning the corner.</p><p>In less than 24 hours, another announcement followed. The White House named the members of a new <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/who-is-part-of-trumps-board-of-peace-for-gaza\">“Board of Peace”</a>, tasked with overseeing a technocratic committee that would manage the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza. The committee will be led by Dr Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian official, who is presented as part of a forward-looking plan for reconstruction and stability.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On paper, it appears to be a movement. Like structure. Like planning for a future beyond war.</p><p>But on the ground in Gaza, there isn’t a sense of confidence. There is doubt – and a lot of it.</p><p>Many Palestinians here struggle to understand how a board meant to rebuild Gaza can include people who have openly supported Israel, especially when the destruction is still everywhere you look, and no one has been held accountable.</p><p>Buildings are still in ruins. Families are still grieving. Entire neighbourhoods are gone. Against that backdrop, talk of governance and reconstruction feels disconnected from reality.</p><p>For families who have lost their homes, their loved ones, and their sense of safety, the contradiction is hard to ignore. It’s difficult to be asked to trust a future designed by people who seem untouched by the present pain and untouched by responsibility for it.</p><p>For those whose daily life is characterised by the constant buzz of drones and sudden Israeli air attacks, nothing’s really shifted.</p><p>Parents still think hard about where their kids will sleep tonight. Aid workers still map their routes, not by where help is most needed, but by which roads might actually get them through alive. Families still hush up at night, straining to hear if the quiet will hold or if the fighting will break out again.</p><p>All these official statements? They feel miles away from what’s actually happening. Phase two might exist in some news release, but for most people, life still feels stuck right where it started.</p><p>You don’t feel a ceasefire in speeches or headlines. You feel it in what’s missing, the sudden silence, the easing in your chest, the nights that don’t end with a jolt. That’s what people are waiting for. Not the label, not the milestone. Just the change itself.</p><p>After months of loss and exhaustion, it’s normal to want to believe things really are getting better. Diplomats cling to the idea of progress. Governments need to say momentum’s building. But the people actually living this? They just want something steady. They want to know tomorrow won’t be worse than today, that they can wake up and not flinch.</p><p>But right now, that feeling isn’t there. Promises are uneven, timelines keep slipping, and too many commitments just fade into the background. For people living through it, this doesn’t feel like peace on the move; it feels like everything’s hanging by a thread, ready to snap at any minute. Just calling it “phase two” doesn’t make it feel any safer.</p><p>And then there’s that quieter hurt that comes from hope getting stretched too thin. When official words don’t match real life, people learn to lower their expectations. Hope turns into something fragile – something you hold close but don’t trust too much, because getting let down again just stings. Announcing progress before anyone can feel it doesn’t build trust. It erodes it.</p><p>This isn’t about throwing out diplomacy. It’s just about honesty. If “phase two” is going to mean anything, people need to feel it in their daily lives: Fewer funerals, hospitals that actually work, roads that don’t feel like traps, days where fear isn’t always there.</p><p>Real peace grows in those small, ordinary moments, walking down the street without bracing yourself, sleeping through the night without planning how to run if things go wrong.</p><p>Until those moments show up, “phase two” is mostly just a symbol. And symbols, no matter how hopeful, can’t keep anyone safe. Only real change does that.</p><p>For people living day to day, peace isn’t about the next announcement. It starts when they can get through a night and believe the ceasefire will still hold in the morning.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For most of his adult life, Rafiul Alam did not believe that voting was worth the walk to the polling station. He is 27, grew up in a middle-class neighbourhood of Dhaka, and became eligible to vote nearly a decade ago. He never did – not in Bangladesh’s national elections in 2018, nor in the 2024 vote.</p><p>“My vote had no real value,” he said.</p><p>Like many Bangladeshis in his age group, Alam’s political consciousness formed under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s long period of government, when opposition parties and election watchdogs repeatedly questioned the credibility of polls.</p><p>Over time, he said, disengagement with politics became normal, even rational, for a generation. “You grow up knowing elections exist, but believing they actually don’t have the power to decide anything. So you put your energy elsewhere… studies, work, even trying to leave the country,” he said.</p><p>This calculation began to shift for him in July 2024, when student protests over a government job reservation system favouring certain groups spiralled into a nationwide uprising. Alam joined marches in Dhaka’s Mirpur area and helped coordinate logistics for protests, as Hasina’s security forces launched a brutal crackdown.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Office later estimated that up to 1,400 people – most of them young – may have been killed before Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, ending nearly 15 years in power.</p><p>When Hasina left, Alam said the moment felt like something that had appeared permanent had broken. “For the first time, it felt like ordinary people could push for a change,” he said. “Once you experience that, you feel responsible for what comes next.”</p><p>Bangladesh is now heading for a national election on February 12, the first since the uprising. European Union observers have described the upcoming vote as the “biggest democratic process in 2026, anywhere”. And Alam plans to vote for the first time.</p><p>“I’m thrilled to exercise my lost right as a citizen,” he said.</p><p>He is not alone. Bangladesh has about 127 million registered voters, nearly 56 million of them between the ages of 18 and 37, according to the Election Commission. They constitute about 44 percent of the electorate, and are a demographic widely seen as the driving force behind Hasina’s downfall.</p><p>“Practically speaking, anyone who turned 18 after the 2008 parliamentary election has never had the chance to vote in a competitive poll,” said Humayun Kabir, director general of the Election Commission’s national identity registration wing.</p><p>“That means people who have been unable to vote for the last 17 years are now in their mid-30s… and especially eager to cast their ballots.”</p><p>This eagerness comes after three post-2008 elections that “were not considered credible”, Ivars Ijabs, the EU’s chief observer, said.</p><p>The 2014 polls saw a mass opposition boycott, and dozens of seats where Hasina’s Awami League party faced no contest. The 2018 vote, though contested, became widely known as the “night’s vote”, after allegations that ballot boxes had been filled before polling day.</p><p>The 2024 election, meanwhile, again went ahead amid a major boycott by opposition parties, with critics arguing that conditions for a “fair contest did not exist”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253029\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253029\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253029\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24224305623258-1768878892.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE- Protesters shout slogans as they celebrate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024.

Haq described the upcoming election as a psychological release valve after years of repression, during which young people “could not hold their representatives accountable; rather, those representatives appeared to them as oppressors”.</p><p>Many young people still do not trust the existing system, Haq argued, and some remain sceptical of the democratic transition itself.</p><p>Umama Fatema, a Dhaka University student who emerged as a prominent leader during the 2024 protests, said the uprising generated powerful expectations among young people: promises of “no corruption, no manipulation, equality of opportunity and political reform”.</p><p>But translating these aspirations into institutions has proven far more difficult. As the transition unfolded, Fatema said the reform process, led by the interim administration of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, alongside manoeuvring by political parties – including those born out of 2024’s protests – became increasingly complex.</p><p>“Very few people and their aspirations have been meaningfully involved and incorporated,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253092\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253092\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253092\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25215551352377-1768885347.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Leader of National Citizen Party (NCP), Nahid Islam, addresses supporters during a political rally in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025.

A far-right Islamist party, the Jamaat’s opposition to Bangladesh’s independence during the 1971 war has long limited its mainstream appeal.</p><p>“Historically, those who rule us come to power with big promises,” Saha said. “But after a few years, power blinds them, and the same abuses repeat.”</p><p>The NCP, he said, initially felt different. “We thought of the NCP as a beacon of light. But seeing it align with a party that carries so much historical baggage made many of us lose hope.”</p><p>Fatema, who led the protests alongside several figures who later founded the NCP, said the party’s alignment with the Jamaat risks shrinking the significance of the July 2024 uprising. “Over time, it could seriously damage how this uprising is remembered in history,” she warned.</p><p>The NCP positioned itself at its launch as a generational alternative to Bangladesh’s traditional parties, promising what it called a “new political settlement” rooted in the 2024 July movement. But as talks advanced over the electoral alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, the party saw a wave of resignations, including from several senior figures and women leaders who had been expected to contest parliamentary seats. Many of them have since announced independent bids, saying the party was “drifting from its founding commitments”.</p><p>Nahid Islam, the NCP’s chief, has defended the alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, describing it as a “strategic electoral arrangement aimed at greater unity”, rather than an ideological alignment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253096\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253096\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253096\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25345467213828-1768885528.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C493&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People watch Bangladesh's Chief Election Commissioner A.M.M.

But I want to see whether the system can at least function properly. That alone would be a major change,” she said.</p><p>For others, like Sakibur Rahman, 23, a voter from the eastern Brahmanbaria district who studies philosophy at the University of Dhaka, the appeal of democracy remains conditional.</p><p>“You can talk about democracy all day, but if people don’t feel safe, can’t speak freely and can’t earn a living, democracy feels abstract, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Rahman said he would support whichever party could credibly guarantee public safety, freedom of expression, religious freedom, and minorities living without fear.</p><p>For many women voters, the calculation is sharper still. Women make up nearly half of Bangladesh’s electorate, but young women say questions of dignity and everyday security will shape their ballot.</p><p>“We hear promises of women’s rights, but the lived reality is far from ideal. That will shape how many of my female friends will vote,” Akter, the master’s student, said.</p><p>Yet the political field they are being asked to choose from remains overwhelmingly male. Election Commission data shows that only 109 of the 2,568 candidates contesting the election, or about 4.24 percent, are women.</p><p>Fatema said the political space for women has narrowed rather than expanded since the uprising. “After August 5, women who speak about their agency, their contributions, and their right to representation have been suppressed in many ways,” she said.</p><p>“Harassment, from online abuse to sexual threats, has become routine in political spaces.” These pressures are pushing women out of visible political roles, just as the country enters a critical political transition, she added.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, a political observer and adjunct researcher at Western Sydney University’s Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative, said the disconnect between women’s prominence in protest movements and their marginalisation in formal politics raises doubts about the depth of reform.</p><p>“No structural change is possible without women’s political representation, and participation at the highest levels… both in parliament and in policymaking,” he said. “Without that, promises of any new political order remain incomplete.”</p><p>Fahmidul Haq of Bard College said political parties would have to approach young voters differently than in the past, by addressing “their traumas, desires, and demands sincerely”, and by campaigning with honesty and transparency.</p><p>“Young people are deeply sceptical of absurd promises,” he said, adding that those may in fact alienate them.</p><p>Still, something fundamental has changed. For Alam, the first-time voter from Dhaka’s Mirpur, July 2024 permanently altered how his generation relates to power.</p><p>“We now dare to question everyone,” he said. “Whoever comes to power, that habit won’t disappear.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

protect minors online.</p><p>The government said on Monday it would examine <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/why-is-australia-banning-social-media-for-teenagers\">evidence from around the world</a> on a wide

Australia, which last month became the first country in the world to ban social media for young people ‌under 16 years old, hoping to learn firsthand from the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/snapchat-starts-age-checks-in-australia-ahead-of-teen-social-media-ban\">Australian approach</a>, the UK government said in a ‍statement.</p><p>“The consultation will look at options including raising the digital age of consent, implementing phone curfews to avoid excessive use, and restricting potentially addictive design features such as ‘streaks’ and ‘infinite scrolling’,” the government said.</p><p>The UK’s announcement comes as governments and regulators worldwide grapple with the rapid explosion of AI-generated content, which was highlighted this month by an international outcry over reports of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/mother-of-elon-musks-child-sues-his-ai-company-over-grok-deepfake-images\">Elon Musk’s Grok AI chatbot</a> generating non-consensual sexual images, including of children.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The UK has already set out plans for an outright ban on <a

view nude images on their devices, ⁠it said in Monday’s statement.</p><p>“We are determined to ensure technology enriches children’s lives, not harms them – and to give every child the childhood they deserve,” UK Secretary of State for Technology Liz Kendall said.</p><p>The UK’s announcement did not mention a particular age limit for social media use, but the statement said it was exploring a ban “for children under a certain age”, in addition to other measures, such as better age checks and looking into whether the current digital age of consent of 13 years was too low.</p><p>The leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, has already said her party would introduce a social media ban for under-16s if it were in power, the UK’s PA Media news agency reports.</p><p>Badenoch, PA reports, said the planned consultation by the Labour-led government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer amounted to more delay from his leadership, after earlier accusing him of lacking the “backbone” to enforce a social media ban.</p><p>“The prime minister is trying to copy an announcement that the Conservatives made a week ago, and still not getting it right,” Badenoch said.</p><p>“This is yet more dither and delay from Starmer and a Labour Party that have entirely run out of ideas.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Powell plans to attend the high court’s Wednesday session, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>It is a much more public show of support than the Fed chair has previously shown Cook. But it follows Powell’s announcement last week that the Trump administration has sent subpoenas to the Fed, <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">threatening an unprecedented criminal indictment</a> of the Fed chair. Powell — appointed to the position by Trump in 2018 — appears to be casting off last year’s more subdued response to Trump’s repeated attacks on the central bank in favour of a more public confrontation.</p><p>Powell issued a video statement on January 11 condemning the subpoenas as “pretexts” for Trump’s efforts to force him to sharply cut the Fed’s key interest rate. Powell oversaw three rate cuts late last year, lowering the rate to about 3.6 percent, but Trump has argued it should be as low as 1 percent, a position few economists support.</p><p>The Trump administration has accused Cook of mortgage fraud, an allegation that Cook has denied. No charges have been made against Cook. She sued to keep her job, and the Supreme Court on October 1 issued a brief order <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/1/supreme-court-temporarily-blocks-fed-governor-cook-firing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allowing her to stay on the board</a> while they consider her case.</p><p>If Trump succeeds in removing Cook, he could appoint another person to fill her slot, which would give his appointees a majority on the Fed’s board and greater influence over the central bank’s decisions on interest rates and bank regulation.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The former Air Force general has been a vocal opponent of the leader of the GERB party, Boyko Borissov.</p><p class=\"p1\">Radev has also opposed politician and oligarch Delyan Peevski – under sanctions from the United States and United Kingdom over alleged bribery, corruption and media manipulation – whose MRF New Beginning party has repeatedly backed the outgoing GERB-led coalition.</p><p>The former president has expressed doubt about Bulgaria’s decision to join the eurozone and is opposed to sending military aid to Ukraine, chastising European leaders for not doing enough to support the efforts of US President Donald Trump to facilitate a negotiated peace.</p><p class=\"p1\">Radev did not mention on Monday what his plans are. Asked recently about forming a new party, he said there was a need for a party that “unites all democrats – left and right – regardless of where they belong or whether they are politically active at all, because we all need fair elections and democratic, free development”.</p><p>A recent Market Links poll found that Radev has an approval rating of 44 percent.</p><p>“His goal is to be close to the majority so that he doesn’t have to negotiate,” Parvan Simeonov from the Myara polling agency told the news agency AFP, adding that a solid result for Radev could be “a way out” of the country’s political crisis.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He has won some of the world’s most coveted musical awards – including Oscars, Grammys and a Golden Globe. His song Jai Ho (May You Win), which won him an Oscar, became a celebrated anthem. The 59-year-old “Mozart of Madras” has also been honoured with Padma Vibhushan, India’s third highest civilian award, for his contribution to music.</p><p>But last week, when Rahman, a man of few words, shared in a TV interview that he potentially has lost work due to “communal” bias in Bollywood, India’s Hindi film industry, he was subjected to a massive online backlash from Hindu right-wing voices.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“People who are not creative have the power now to decide things, and this might have been a communal thing also but not in my face,” Rahman told the BBC Asian Network in the interview aired on Friday.</p><p>“It comes to me as Chinese whispers that they booked you, but the music company went ahead and hired their five composers. I said, ‘Oh, that’s great, rest for me. I can chill out with my family,’” he said in the 90-minute interview.</p><p>Right-wing commentators and activists questioned Rahman’s patriotism and talent, accusing him of playing the “victim card”.</p><p>Vinod Bansal from the far-right organisation Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) demanded an apology from Rahman for “defaming” the country.</p><p>“We are proud of him and whatever he has done for the country. But for someone who has earned his living from the Indian industry, the way he is trying to defame the country is highly objectionable,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Barring a few outspoken voices, industry insiders have closed ranks, offering no solidarity and distancing themselves from the remarks.</p><p>Within a day, the composer was forced to tender an explanation amid an unrelenting stream of social media trolling. In a video posted to his Instagram account, Rahman said: “I understand that intentions can sometimes be misunderstood, but my purpose has always been to uplift, honour and serve through music.”</p><p>He stressed that he remained grateful to the nation and noted that he had thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his support of India’s entertainment industry and young creatives and was working on the background score for the upcoming film Ramayana, based on the Hindu epic, with German composer Hans Zimmer.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252302\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252302\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252302\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2241632287-1-1768834135.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Khans\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan speak on stage during the ‘EAST TO WEST: The Global Rise of Bollywood’ panel at the 2025 Joy Forum at SEF Arena on October 17, 2025 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

No matter how many patriotic songs, movies or tweets. They’ll all live through the cruelty of it.”</p><p>Online trolling helps manufacture majoritarian consent, according to Debasish Roy Chowdhury, coauthor of To Kill a Democracy: India’s Passage to Despotism.</p><p>He argued that when enough noise is generated on social media, it seeps into mainstream coverage and starts to look like the dominant social mood.</p><p>“The loudest voices then drown out tolerance and reason until hate is all that is heard and can be falsely claimed as representative of society,” said Roy Chowdhury, who has written about Bollywood being used as a propaganda tool.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1755836\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1755836\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1755836\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/000_328E9BX.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protestors hold placards during a demonstration against anti-Muslim violence and hate crimes in New Delhi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1755836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">India has seen the rise of anti-Muslim violence under the rule of Prime Minister Modi [File: Sajjad Hussain/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hindu-right-s-influence-on-art-and-cinema\">Hindu right’s influence on art and cinema</h2><p>Rahman isn’t known for being outspoken about politics or talking about his Muslim identity. He has worked on a fair share of nationalist films, including Roja, released in 1992 and celebrated for its patriotic themes and portrayal of the armed rebellion in India-administered Kashmir in the 1990s.</p><p>Rahman’s 1997 song Maa Tujhe Salam (Salute to You, Mother) on his album Vande Mataram was seen as unifying the diverse nation of 1.4 billion people.</p><p class=\"p1\">The composer started his career in the southern Tamil film industry. He is based in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state.</p><p>The Oscar winner’s comments last week raised questions about the Hindu right’s influence on art and cinema in India, particularly in Bollywood.</p><p>The Hindi film industry has been called out for producing films that echo Hindu supremacist narratives, works that vilify Muslims and secular leaders, or even glorify Hindu extremists.</p><p>Some argued that this has happened because of a sustained culture war on Bollywood, pressuring it to abandon its pluralist, liberal ethos and pushing it towards Hindu majoritarian narratives, aligning cinema closely with the ruling party ideology.</p><p>The Kashmir Files (2022) triggered anti-Muslim hate across India while the Kerala Story (2023) was accused of spreading Islamophobia by portraying Muslims as potential “terrorists”.</p><p>More recently, Rahman composed music for the film Chhaava, which was accused of demonizing Muslims. The film portrayed Mughal ruler Aurangzeb as a brutal and violent ruler. Rahman, in his BBC interview, admitted the film was “divisive”.</p><h2 id=\"vilification-of-muslims\">‘Vilification of Muslims’</h2><p>Raja Sen, a screenwriter and film critic, said: “We’re seeing a kind of vilification of Muslims on our screens.”</p><p>“Earlier, it was just like an anti-Pakistan narrative. Now, there’s a different kind of narrative,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Hindi cinema has traditionally cast Pakistan as the enemy, focusing on topics of war, ‘”terror” and espionage, which are shaped by decades of hostility. The two neighbouring countries have fought several wars over the disputed Kashmir region. They were briefly engaged in a four-day war in May after gunmen killed 26 tourists in India-administered Kashmir.</p><p>Films that once centred on a foreign adversary now increasingly frame Indian Muslims as an internal threat.</p><p>Sen claimed that a major filmmaker changed an upcoming film’s Muslim protagonist’s name to a Hindu name, fearing controversy.</p><p>“They must have thought, why make the protagonist, a good, heroic guy, a Muslim. It’s perhaps similar to what used to happen in post-9/11 America in terms of how the stereotyping was being done,” Sen added.</p><p>Bollywood’s once largely secular ethos presented Muslim characters as positive, even if stereotypical. They were loyal friends, brothers or benevolent poets and singers in films like Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) and Coolie (1983).</p><p>In recent years, however, Muslims increasingly have appeared as debauched (Animal), regressive (Haq), “terrorist” (A Wednesday) or violent (Kalank), mirroring post-9/11 Hollywood films when Muslim identity became shorthand for danger or moral deficiency.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252315\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252315\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252315\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1998-12-08T000000Z_291479725_RP1DRIFRTIAG_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-FILM-1768834406.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C566&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dilip Kumar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dilip Kumar (real name Yusuf Khan – right) was India’s biggest star during the 1950s and 1960s [File: KK/FY/WS]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"muslim-stars-targeted\">Muslim stars targeted</h2><p>Muslim actors, filmmakers and other artists have played a central role in shaping Hindi cinema from its early days to the present.</p><p>The prominence of stars such as Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan and Saif Ali Khan has often been cited as evidence of Bollywood’s secular credentials and broad appeal.</p><p>Yet in recent years, the country’s biggest Muslim stars have increasingly found themselves targeted. This has not happened only over their films but also for their opinions expressed publicly on religious intolerance.</p><p>Aamir Khan’s films have repeatedly faced boycott calls from right-wing Hindu groups, including his 2014 film PK for critiquing organised religion, including Hinduism and Islam, and 2022’s Laal Singh Chaddha for his past remarks on intolerance.</p><p>Aamir Khan had to reassure people that he “really loved his country”. He has also been accused of promoting love jihad, a conspiracy theory accusing Muslim men of marrying Hindu women to convert them, a charge amplified by a televised interview with news anchor Rajat Sharma, who questioned him about marrying Hindu women.</p><p>Shah Rukh Khan has been targeted on multiple occasions for remarks and professional choices. In 2015, he was branded “anti-national” for mentioning intolerance. He was also subjected to campaigns questioning his patriotism when his son, Aryan Khan, was arrested in a drugs case in 2021 despite the charges later being dropped.</p><p>More recently, he was labelled a traitor by a ruling party member after his Indian Premier League cricket team signed a Bangladeshi player. The Kolkata Knight Riders, co-owned by Shah Rukh Khan, dropped the Bangladeshi player amid tensions between the two countries.</p><p>In recent years, rights organisations and independent monitors have documented what they described as a systematic campaign of hate and discrimination against Muslims in India, who make up about 14 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion people.</p><p>According to the India Hate Lab Report 2025, there has been a sharp rise in antiminority hate speech – from 668 reported incidents in 2023 to more than 1,300 in 2025 – much of it voiced at political rallies, processions and public events that is then amplified online into mainstream discourse.</p><p>Human rights groups like Amnesty International have also documented demolitions targeting Muslim-owned businesses and homes in several states.</p><p>Beyond studies, lived accounts and news coverage point to systematic exclusion in everyday life from difficulties finding rental housing to practising religion and being lynched over accusations of transporting cow, considered sacred by some Hindus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-chilling-effect\">‘A chilling effect’</h2><p>Such backlash has a chilling effect. Artists said creative freedom in Hindi cinema has narrowed markedly in recent years, mostly by the anticipation of a backlash. Silence and self-censorship, some feel, have become critical for survival in the film industry today.</p><p>“Since 2014, there has been a group within the film industry that works within the influence of government and benefits from it, that boldly and aggressively underlines and creates many of these controversies,” filmmaker Avinash Das said.</p><p>Das revealed how, on several occasions, producers refused to work with him after they found out about his criticism of the government.</p><p>He pointed out that a 1983 satirical film, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, which depicted a Hindu religious performance, cannot be made now.</p><p>According to him, cinema is not just an art form but a business shaped by risk, which makes filmmakers and producers wary of anything that could be seen as controversial. The same extends to those who speak out.</p><p>Indian celebrities seem to be bound by the same code of silence, which explains why so few, regardless of whether they are Hindu or Muslim, speak publicly about the country’s current direction.</p><p>Roy Chowdhury said Bollywood contrasts sharply with Hollywood, where open dissent by celebrities, even disparaging remarks about United States President Donald Trump, is fairly commonplace.</p><p>“But for Muslim celebrities in India, the constraints are even tighter because in new India, Muslims are not meant to be heard,” Roy Chowdhury told Al Jazeera. “They are expected to be voiceless and faceless. They are expected to lurk in the fringes and not take the spotlight.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Senegal’s Ismaila Sarr appeared to have scored, only for the goal to be disallowed by referee Jean-Jacques Ndala, who decided Abdoulaye Seck had fouled Morocco defender Achraf Hakimi. It was a decision that clearly incensed Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.</p><p>Then came the chaos. In the final minute of added time, Morocco’s Real Madrid star Brahim Diaz hit the ground and vehemently appealed for a penalty. After a video assistant referee (VAR) review, where Ndala was jostled by scuffling coaches and players, a highly controversial penalty was awarded, and a chance for Morocco to win it at the death.</p><p>It was then that the sparks of conflict turned into a fire. Thiaw felt Senegal had been cheated and had a case, but when he ushered his team off the field and down the tunnel in protest, he pivoted the final into dangerous territory. It took over 17 minutes for play to restart while objects were thrown from the crowd and some fans staged a pitch invasion. Thiaw later admitted he shouldn’t have taken this action, but the damage was done.</p><h2 id=\"diaz-s-panenka-mistake-costs-the-host-nation\">Diaz’s ‘Panenka’ mistake costs the host nation</h2><p>The tension inside the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium could have led to even uglier scenes before attention turned to the penalty spot, and the ball in the hands of Diaz, while Senegal’s players continued to complain bitterly. It was his moment, Morocco’s moment, after a painful 50-year wait to be champions of Africa.</p><p>What Diaz – who was the media darling of AFCON 2025 with a tournament-high five goals – did next encapsulated the craziness of the night.</p><p>Inexplicably, he attempted a “Panenka” chip, but embarrassingly, the Real Madrid winger clipped the ball straight into the arms of Senegal’s goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. The home crowd of over 66,000 at the stadium were struggling to comprehend what had just unfolded.</p><p>And when extra time started, there was another shock for the Moroccan fans, as Pape Gueye scored a brilliant winning goal for Senegal, one which would have been the memorable moment if the final hadn’t already descended into total disorder.</p><p>Senegal became champions of Africa for the second time. In football terms, they deserved it. But the inquests into the final will mean the celebrations will be overshadowed by recriminations.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250380\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250380\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250380\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_696d4ed7-1768771287.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soccer Football - CAF Africa Cup of Nations - Morocco 2025 - Final - Senegal v Morocco - Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, Rabat, Morocco - January 18, 2026 Morocco's Brahim Diaz misses a penalty REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4250380\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brahim Diaz misses a penalty that would have won the final for the host nation Morocco [Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"disciplinary-measures-likely-to-follow\">Disciplinary measures likely to follow</h2><p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who was in attendance at the final, took to Instagram to condemn the “ugly scenes”.</p><p>Infantino called it “unacceptable to leave the field of play in this manner,” and said that “violence cannot be tolerated in our sport,” adding, “the decisions taken by the match officials must always be respected”.</p><p>The final is likely to bring severe disciplinary measures from the tournament’s governing body, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which has seen its big showpiece marred.</p><p>Moroccan coach Walid Regragui called the scenes “shameful” and added that they “do not honour Africa”.</p><p>Strong measures are likely to be taken against Thiaw, whose media briefing had to be cancelled due to further unrest in the press room.  But he’s not the only one who will face scrutiny.</p><p>Before the final, the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) had voiced concerns over the security at the tournament, and said its players and staff were “at risk”. The FSF also raised concerns over the training pitch, hotel and ticket allocation for the final.</p><p>The officiating in the final drew plenty of criticism. While Congolese referee Ndala held his nerve under intense pressure when the Senegal players walked off, there is no escaping that his decision-making in stoppage time was puzzling. Did Seck really foul Hakimi? It felt a harsh call on the Senegal player. And why did the referee not consult VAR?</p><p>Did Morocco’s Diaz then go down too easily from innocuous-looking pressure by Senegal’s El Hadji Malick Diouf? Well, Ndala was initially disinterested, then appeared to cave in to the pressure from a pleading Diaz and the crowd. One such decision in favour of the hosts would be tough to take. Two was inflammatory.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252345\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252345\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252345\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256507736-1768834998.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C473&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gianni Infantino reacts.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252345\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">FIFA president Gianni Infantino, left, looks on during the AFCON final between Morocco and Senegal at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium [Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"claims-of-host-nation-bias\">Claims of host nation bias</h2><p>Morocco coach Regragui had felt the need to publicly reject claims of favouritism towards the host nation that have hung around this AFCON, fuelled by Cameroon having two penalties rejected in Morocco’s quarterfinal victory.</p><p>The conspiracy theories distracted from praise Morocco otherwise received as the host nation of the tournament, with Egypt and Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah thanking organisers and saying: “I have never participated in a competition in Africa with such a high level of organisation.”</p><p>This would have been the last thing on the mind of the tearful Moroccan fans leaving the stadium on Sunday night, and those who had gathered across the country ready to celebrate. None of this was their fault, and it was easy to feel sorry for them. The rain captured the moment. Hopes and dreams were doused. The wait to be champions would go on.</p><p>Right up until the carnage late in the final, it felt as though the prevailing narrative of AFCON 2025 would be about the improved standard of African football, and whether top-tier African teams, not least Senegal and Morocco, can go deep at the FIFA World Cup in June. Maybe even create history.</p><p>After reaching the semifinals in Qatar, and with years of youth football investment still bearing fruit, underestimating Morocco’s potential to defeat the biggest football nations would be careless. The same applies to Senegal, whose players also light up European leagues while coming together as a formidable force when representing the Lions of Teranga.</p><p>But in Rabat, the carelessness came from coaches, players and fans who dragged the ascending reputation of African football into the mud. Infantino has already made it clear that such scenes will not be tolerated in Africa or elsewhere.</p><p>The only man to have enhanced his reputation from the final fiasco is Senegal star Sadio Mane, who appeared reluctant to leave the pitch and seemingly urged his teammates to return. He also tried to calm the fury of Senegalese fans after the two controversial decisions.</p><p>Football fans everywhere should be celebrating the success of Senegal and the quality on display from both finalists. Instead, we’ll remember the dishonourable scenes in a country that co-hosts the World Cup in four years.</p><p>It’s over to CAF, and its disciplinary arm, to have the final word on AFCON 2025.

But the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/18/police-chief-steps-down-after-uk-fallout-from-ban-on-tel-aviv-football-fan\">departure</a> of Craig Guildford, chief constable of West Midlands Police, was the result of political pressure from pro-Israel lobby groups amid heightened sensitivities around the issues of Israel and Palestine, legal and political commentators say.</p><p>In November last year, West Midlands Police recommended that <a href=\"/sports/2025/10/17/israeli-maccabi-tel-aviv-football-fans-barred-from-europa-league-game-in-uk\">Maccabi Tel Aviv </a>football fans should be banned from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham on public order and security grounds.</p><p>West Midlands Police said it had classified the match as high risk based on “current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the <a href=\"/news/2024/11/12/unrest-in-amsterdam-as-further-arrests-made-over-maccabi-clashes\">2024 UEFA Europa League match</a> between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam”.</p><p>“Based on our professional judgement, we believe this measure will help mitigate risks to public safety,” the police force said at the time.</p><p>The decision was ultimately approved by Birmingham City Council’s Safety Advisory Group (SAG), a multi-agency body that brings together police, local authorities and emergency services to assess safety risks at major events.</p><p>There was a public outcry, and numerous media opinion pieces called the ban “anti-Semitic”.</p><p>That pressure has since intensified. Last week, UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/14/police-chief-behind-maccabi-tel-aviv-ban-clings-to-job-despite-home-secretary-wanting-him-to-quit\">publicly</a> stated that she had lost confidence in Guildford following criticism by a police watchdog of how the ban was handled. Guildford resigned on Friday.</p><p>But observers say Guildford’s departure is a sign that policing decisions which intersect with the issue of Israel and Palestine are no longer insulated from political consequences.</p><p>The reason for this, said Chris Nineham, vice-chair of the British group Stop the War Coalition, is that “most politicians are too scared to challenge the pro-Israel mainstream consensus”.</p><p>He believes the fallout from the ban will have lasting consequences for future policing decisions. “I think it will reinforce the tendency for police forces to go along with the establishment bias against Palestine supporters, which is a product of the British ruling class’s support for Israel and is reinforced by Israel’s impressive lobbying operation,” Nineham told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-very-dangerous-precedent\">‘A very dangerous precedent’</h2><p>Frances Webber, a retired barrister who writes on politics, human rights and the rule of law, said the significance of Guildford’s resignation extends far beyond football or crowd control.</p><p>In the UK, “police forces are operationally independent of government, and any case against Guildford should have been pursued judicially, not politically”, she explained.</p><p>The visible role of central government in the fallout from this policing decision, she argued, “sets a very dangerous precedent, not just for police and local authorities but for democracy”.</p><p>Supporters of the ban on Maccabi fans attending the match in Birmingham argue it was rooted in a risk assessment shaped by events abroad and local context.</p><p>In 2024, Dutch authorities reported <a href=\"/news/2024/11/10/israeli-football-fans-pro-palestinians-attacked-in-amsterdam-what-we-know\">serious disorder</a> involving Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters at a match in Amsterdam, with violence both before and after the fixture. In intelligence shared ahead of the Birmingham match, British police said their Dutch counterparts informed them that significant numbers of visiting fans had been involved in organised confrontations and disturbances.</p><p>Birmingham is one of the UK’s most diverse cities, with around <a href=\"https://muslimcensus.co.uk/early-insights-from-the-2021-census-for-muslims\">30 percent</a> of its residents Muslim and more than 40 percent identifying as Asian or from minority ethnic backgrounds, according to the 2021 Census.</p><p>Officers were therefore concerned that the arrival of large numbers of high-risk, visiting supporters could spark tensions and even retaliatory disorder.</p><p>Nineham argues, therefore, that while procedural mistakes have since been identified by a police watchdog, the underlying policing decision about the match in Birmingham was sound. “The undeniably violent element within the Maccabi fans would have been a risk to the local population,” he said.</p><p>Webber also points to <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2024/11/maccabi-hooligans-amsterdam-media-gaza\">reports</a> that visiting Maccabi fans in Amsterdam had openly celebrated the killing of children in Gaza, and officers would have had to consider this when assessing the risks surrounding the Birmingham football fixture.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4252299\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252299\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252299\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-11-08T090056Z_277518430_RC2N0BAVQO3P_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-NETHERLANDS-VIOLENCE-1768834084.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Maccabi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4252299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters are guarded by police after violence broke out in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on November 8, 2024.

According to a report in the UK newspaper The Guardian this week, Dutch police said key claims about the violence in Amsterdam relied on by West Midlands Police to reach its decision to ban Maccabi fans did not align with its own experience.</p><p>The report also criticised the police’s reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, erroneous AI-generated material such as a reference to a football match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham that never took place. Guildford later apologised after initially telling MPs that AI had not been used, before <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/51041/documents/282958/default/\">clarifying </a>that the error stemmed from an AI-assisted search tool.</p><p>Since Cooke’s interim report was published, much of the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/police-chief-apologises-for-erroneous-maccabi-tel-aviv-fan-ban-evidence-blaming-ai-13494040\">British media</a> has framed Guildford’s resignation as justified, citing the findings in the report.</p><p>However, the report found no evidence that the ban was motivated by anti-Semitism, despite repeated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/jan/02/jewish-groups-warned-ban-on-maccabi-tel-aviv-fans-attending-match-could-be-seen-as-antisemitic\">claims</a> to that effect.</p><p>Critics of the report, including Jewish Voice for Labour, however, have argued that there was an imbalance when it came to weighing concerns from different members of the community.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/in-support-of-banning-maccabi-tel-aviv-fans/\">letter</a> to the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, the group said the chief inspector of constabulary met with what his report described as “significant people” including representatives of the Israeli Embassy, members of Birmingham’s Jewish community, and Lord John Mann, the government’s independent adviser on anti-Semitism, but did not meet with any groups representing Birmingham’s Muslim community.</p><p>The group said that this disparity showed that Muslim safety concerns had been marginalised during the process.</p><h2 id=\"a-pro-israel-consensus\">‘A pro-Israel consensus’</h2><p>“It is worrying how the line that this ban was anti-Semitic and that only a tiny minority of Maccabi fans are a problem has been able to take hold, despite the clear evidence to the contrary,” Nineham said, adding that most politicians have appeared unwilling to challenge a pro-Israel consensus once it was formed.</p><p>The fallout that resulted in Guildford’s departure, he believes, was ultimately shaped less by the report’s findings than by concern within the political establishment about the precedent the ban might set.</p><p>“Guildford was forced out because the political establishment didn’t want the decision he made to become a precedent… The message to the police is: don’t make decisions based on a real risk assessment, toe the pro-Israel line,” Nineham noted.</p><p>He said he believes the episode will serve to reinforce a wider tendency within policing and other institutions to avoid decisions perceived as unfavourable to Israel, deepening what he describes as an establishment bias against Palestine supporters.</p><p>Indeed, the implications of Guildford’s departure extend far beyond this single case, warns Webber, with leaders in the police force being placed in an “impossible situation”, expected to weigh foreign-policy sensitivities alongside public safety – something she said is absolutely not their role.</p><p>Guildford’s exit may satisfy political demands for accountability. But it has also sent a clear message: when policing decisions intersect with Israel and Palestine, independence comes at a price, and careers can be the cost.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
