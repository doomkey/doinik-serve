It should also be focused on, together, advancing our mutual interests and new frontiers, unshackling our ingenuity, our creativity, and the dynamic spirit to build a new Western century.”</p><h3>Liberalism and mass migration</h3><p>Rubio argued that the “euphoria” of the Western victory in the Cold War had led to a “dangerous delusion that we had entered ‘the end of history’”, where every nation would be a liberal democracy and “live in a world without borders, where everyone became a citizen of the world”.</p><p>He used this as a plank to lash out against opening “doors to an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture, and the future of our people”.</p><p>“Mass migration is not, was not, isn’t some fringe concern of little consequence. It was and continues to be a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West,” he said.</p><p>Taking aim at liberalist policies, he added that, to “appease a climate cult, we have imposed energy policies on ourselves that are impoverishing our people”.</p><h3>New supply chains</h3><p>Rubio said the US and its allies should bring more industry and jobs back home, not just to build weapons but to lead in new, high‑tech fields.</p><p>He added that the West should control key minerals and supply chains, invest in space travel and artificial intelligence, and work together to win markets in the Global South.</p><p>In particular, he said, is the need for a “Western supply chain for critical minerals not vulnerable to extortion from other powers”.</p><p>Earlier this month, Trump hosted ministers from dozens of countries for a <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/4/trumps-critical-minerals-meet-whos-attending-whats-at-stake\">critical minerals conference</a> in Washington. The meeting was the first of a new Critical Minerals Ministerial, a US initiative to build alliances aimed at countering China’s control over critical mineral supply chains around the world.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-a-new-western-century-mean\">What does a ‘new Western century’ mean?</h2><p>While the overarching message of Rubio’s speech was that the US still seeks a partnership with Europe, said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of think tank Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, his remarks revealed, “The US will entirely set the parameters of that partnership and that it will be based on ideas Europe long has abandoned: An embrace of empire and colonisation.”</p><p>Rubio’s remarks at the conference suggest that the US under Trump wants Europe to accept “a civilisational divide of the world in which the ‘West’ must restore its dominance over other civilisations”, Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“In essence, Rubio listed the criteria for how Europe can become well-behaved vassals of the United States,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-european-leaders-react-to-rubio-s-speech\">How did European leaders react to Rubio’s speech?</h2><p>European leaders appeared to welcome Rubio’s speech at the conference; it was followed by a standing ovation. However, while lauding his call for stronger ties with the US, they notably did not address his comments about migration and liberal values.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference: “We know that in the [Trump] administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics. But the secretary of state was very clear. He said, ‘We want [a] strong Europe in the alliance’, and this is what we are working for intensively in the European Union.”</p><p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot responded to Rubio’s speech: “Referring to [our] common legacy can only be welcomed with applause in Europe.”</p><p>“We will deliver a strong and independent Europe,” he said. “Independent, of course, irrespective of the speeches that we hear at the Munich Security Conference, however right they may be.”</p><p>Calling Rubio a “true partner”, German Foreign Minister John Wadephul said: “[It was] a very clear message from Secretary Rubio that we have … to stay and stick to our international rules-based order, which is, of course, in [the] first line the United Nations. This is our Board of Peace. We have to make it more effective, as Rubio said this morning.”</p><p>Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said she was “very satisfied with the tone” and the content of Rubio’s speech.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-europe\">What does this mean for Europe?</h2><p>European leaders have been facing a dilemma – particularly over migration and defence – for some time, for a number of reasons. The mass migration crisis prompted by unrest in other parts of the world has already caused far-right parties to surge in popularity. Now, the Trump administration has voiced support for many of these parties and is also urging Europe to take stronger action on migration and defence.</p><p>Therefore, many European leaders have already started taking action in these areas.</p><p>For instance, most European countries are already working on boosting their defences and cracking down on migration.</p><p>Last year, the United Kingdom announced plans for a <a href=\"/news/2025/2/27/starmer-raises-uk-defence-budget-before-trump-meeting-is-it-enough\">big boost in defence spending</a> in advance of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s meeting with Trump early last year amid fears the US would withdraw support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Notably, Rubio skipped a meeting about Ukraine with European leaders at the Munich conference.</p><p>Many countries have also tightened controls over immigration. Denmark has led the way in implementing increasingly restrictive policies in its immigration and asylum system, with top leaders aiming for “zero asylum seekers” arriving in the country. Recently, the UK said it was studying the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/9/why-does-the-uk-want-to-copy-denmarks-stringent-immigration-policies\">Danish model</a> as well.</p><p>Europe is also working to make its energy and technology supply chains more sovereign, reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly in the face of Trump’s trade war, which has seen him impose reciprocal trade tariffs on many countries around the world.</p><p>Many European leaders have come under increasing pressure from the rise in popularity of far-right parties calling for greater restrictions on immigration, as well.</p><p>In recent years, far-right, anti-immigration sentiment has been increasing in countries like the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France. In 2023, the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, won the election in the Netherlands. France’s National Rally (RN), led by Marine Le Pen, won the snap election in 2024. The same year, Nigel Farage’s right-wing Reform UK party made significant inroads in the general elections and, last year, a YouGov poll placed Reform as the UK’s <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/could-far-right-reform-really-in-a-uks-general-election-now\">most popular political party</a>.</p><p>Besides this, ideas which were once far-right fringe notions, such as <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/what-is-remigration-the-far-right-fringe-idea-going-mainstream\">remigration</a> – the notion of forcibly expelling non-white European citizens – are gaining traction among far-right conservatives in Europe. The idea has been promoted by Herbert Kickl, the leader of Austria’s far-right anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO) and Alice Weidel, the leader of the AfD in Germany.</p><p>While some European leaders have geared up to resist the rise of far-right politics – partly by appeasing them with new, more restrictive migration policies – Trump has, however, embraced it.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-us-europe-relations\">What does this mean for US-Europe relations?</h2><p>All this ultimately means that “Europe has a choice to make”, said Trita Parsi, executive vice president at the think tank Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. “It can pursue strategic autonomy and seek to find a balance between the great powers, and within that seek a dignified partnership with America in which it is not subjugated into vassalage.”</p><p>“[Or] Europe can continue on its current path in which it subordinates itself slowly but surely fully to Washington’s interests, priorities, impulses, and ideas about civilisational empire,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Parsi pointed to the standing ovation at the conference that followed Rubio’s speech, simply for offering to remain partners with Europe.</p><p>“Whether they disregarded Rubio’s parameters, did not understand them, or simply found it unimportant because Europe desires to be a junior partner to the United States regardless of the parameters, remains to be seen,” he said.</p><p>For their part, European leaders appeared to place the greatest importance on repairing US-Europe relations above all else at the Munich Security Conference.</p><p>During his address at the conference on Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called on the US and Europe to “repair and revive transatlantic trust together”. “Let me begin with the uncomfortable truth: A rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States,” he said.</p><p>“Vice President JD Vance said this a year ago here in Munich. He was right in his description,” Merz said, as he called for a “new transatlantic partnership”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For a reliable naked-eye sighting, the moon must be 10-12 degrees away from the sun. If it is closer than 7 degrees, then the crescent may be physically too thin to reflect enough light for the human eye to see.</p><p><strong>Altitude:</strong> The higher the moon is at sunset, the less it has to compete with the thick, hazy atmosphere and the glow of the sky near the horizon. An altitude of 10 degrees is typically sufficient for clear naked-eye visibility, while lower altitudes of 3 to 5 degrees may be adequate with the help of optical aids.</p><p><strong>Lag time:</strong> This is the time between sunset and moonset. For reliable naked-eye viewing, there usually needs to be at least 45 minutes for the sky to darken enough to see the moon. Longer durations are even better.</p><h2 id=\"when-does-ramadan-begin-in-different-countries\">When does Ramadan begin in different countries?</h2><p>According to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/69721cff51bd707cb10ed8c3/Crescent_Moon_Visibility_summary_for_Feb_2026.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crescent Moon Watch</a>, a moon tracker run by the United Kingdom’s Nautical Almanac Office, Ramadan’s new moon will begin on February 17 at 3:01pm Mecca time (12:01 GMT).</p><p>On that night in Mecca, the sun will set at 6:19pm (15:19 GMT), and the moon will be visible for only three minutes, setting at 6:22pm (15:22 GMT). With the new moon only three hours and 18 minutes old, it is very unlikely that anyone across the globe will see the crescent moon that evening, meaning the first day of Ramadan will begin on February 19.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4315798\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4315798\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4315798\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Ramadan_Winter_2026-Recovered-02-1771164607.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Ramadan_2026_WHEN_IS_RAMADAN\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4315798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>On the evening of February 18, the new moon should be visible in most parts of the world. By that time, the moon will be nearly 26 hours old. It will be higher in the sky and remain visible for much longer after sunset, making it easily observable to the public.</p><h3>North America</h3><p>The Fiqh Council of North America (<a href=\"https://fiqhcouncil.org/ramadan-2026-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FCNA</a>) and the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), both of which follow astronomical calculations, have officially announced that Ramadan will begin on February 18, 2026. Their calculations state that, at sunset somewhere on the globe, the elongation of the moon should be at least 8 degrees, and the moon must be at least 5 degrees above the horizon for it to be visible.</p><h3>Europe</h3><p>The European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) has declared that Thursday, February 19, will be the first day of Ramadan. ECFR notes that while the astronomical birth of the moon occurs on Tuesday, it will be impossible to see that evening either with the naked eye or through telescopes and observational instruments. Turkiye has also declared February 19 as the first day of the holy month of Ramadan, for the same reasons.</p><h3>Middle East</h3><p>Most Middle Eastern nations, led by Saudi Arabia, will not make a final announcement until the evening of Tuesday, February 17. If the Saudi Supreme Court receives a testimony of a sighting on Tuesday night, it may declare Wednesday as the first day of Ramadan. But this is very unlikely for the reasons mentioned above.</p><h3>Asia</h3><p>Across Asia, the start of Ramadan 2026 will most likely be Thursday, February 19, as the moon will set before the sun in that part of the world on Tuesday night.</p><p>Singapore has officially confirmed the start of Ramadan to be on Thursday, while countries in South Asia including India and Pakistan have forecast Thursday, February 19 as the first day of fasting.</p><h3>Africa</h3><p>In Africa, the start of Ramadan follows a similar pattern to the rest of the world, with most countries anticipating it to begin on Thursday, February 19.</p><h3>Oceania</h3><p>The Australian National Imams Council have announced that Ramadan will commence on February 19.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4315800\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4315800\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4315800\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Ramadan_Winter_2026-Recovered-03-1771164609.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Ramadan_2026_Lunar_Calendar\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4315800\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-is-ramadan-holy-for-muslims-and-what-is-the-significance\">Why is Ramadan holy for Muslims, and what is the significance?</h2><p>Muslims believe that Ramadan is the month when the first verses of the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240306100933//news/longform/2022/4/27/visualising-the-quran\">Quran</a> were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad nearly 1,450 years ago.</p><p>Throughout the month, observing Muslims fast from just before the sunrise prayer, Fajr, to the sunset prayer, Maghrib.</p><p>The fast entails abstinence from eating, drinking, smoking, and sexual relations to achieve greater “taqwa”, or consciousness of God.</p><p>Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the Muslim declaration of faith, daily prayers, charity, and performing the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca if physically and financially capable.</p><p>In many Muslim-majority countries, working hours are reduced, and most restaurants are closed during the fasting hours.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4315802\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4315802\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4315802\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Ramadan_Winter_2026-Recovered-04-1771164611.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Ramadan_2026_Quran_Revealed\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4315802\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"ramadan-greetings-in-different-languages\">Ramadan greetings in different languages</h2><p>Various Muslim-majority nations have a personalised greeting in their native languages. “Ramadan Mubarak” and “Ramadan Kareem” are common greetings exchanged over the month, wishing the recipient a blessed and generous month, respectively.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4317085 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive-Ramadan-greetings-in-different-languages-feb15-2026-1771219168.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive - Ramadan greetings in different languages - feb15, 2026-1771219168\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"424\" data-end=\"1249\">President Prabowo Subianto’s government said on February 10 that Indonesia is preparing to deploy up to 8,000 troops to a proposed multinational Gaza stabilisation force under Donald Trump’s so-called Board of Peace (BoP). The troop proposal forms part of Jakarta’s broader decision to participate in the BoP framework, an initiative conceived and driven by Trump. Together, these steps signal a significant shift in Indonesia’s longstanding foreign policy posture. At a time of intensifying geopolitical volatility, Jakarta appears to be committing itself to a project shaped around a single, deeply polarising political figure. The decision raises a fundamental question: is Indonesia advancing its national interests and diplomatic credibility, or allowing its foreign policy direction to be shaped by an external agenda?</p><p data-start=\"1251\" data-end=\"1758\">Geopolitics is not a theatre for symbolic proximity to power but a disciplined calculation of national interest and sovereign credibility. Indonesia’s decision to engage with the BoP appears less like a carefully calibrated strategic choice and more like a reactive impulse that risks weakening the philosophical foundations of its diplomacy, built over decades. Indonesia’s international influence has historically rested on strategic equidistance rather than personal alignment with controversial leaders.</p><p data-start=\"1760\" data-end=\"2153\">There is a growing sense that Jakarta risks acting out of geopolitical urgency. Yet the initiative Indonesia has chosen to support is led by a figure known for transactional diplomacy and disregard for international consensus. The implications extend well beyond Middle East peace initiatives. What is at stake is Indonesia’s reputation as an independent stabilising actor in global diplomacy.</p><p data-start=\"2155\" data-end=\"2670\">If Indonesia proceeds with troop deployment under the BoP framework, the risks become even more acute. Gaza is not a conventional peacekeeping theatre. It is one of the most volatile and politically contested conflict environments in the world, where humanitarian imperatives and hard security objectives frequently collide. Deploying thousands of troops into such an arena without an inclusive multilateral mandate risks drawing Indonesia into a conflict environment where neutrality would be difficult to sustain.</p><h2 id=\"the-erosion-of-the-free-and-active-doctrine\" data-start=\"1208\" data-end=\"1878\">The erosion of the ‘Free and Active’ doctrine</h2><p data-start=\"2728\" data-end=\"3051\">The most serious concern is the gradual erosion of Indonesia’s “Free and Active” foreign policy doctrine, the intellectual backbone of its diplomacy since the Djuanda Declaration and the Bandung Conference. Indonesia has historically positioned itself as a mediator rather than a follower of personalised diplomatic agendas.</p><p data-start=\"3053\" data-end=\"3374\">By participating in an institution closely identified with Donald Trump, Jakarta risks legitimising unilateral approaches that often conflict with established international norms. “Free” diplomacy implies independence, and “active” diplomacy implies engagement driven by national priorities rather than external pressure.</p><p data-start=\"3376\" data-end=\"3811\">Indonesia also risks being reduced to a symbolic endorsement of a United States-centred foreign policy outlook. If Jakarta drifts too far into this orbit, its leverage with other major actors, including China, Russia and ASEAN partners, could weaken. Indonesia’s leadership in Southeast Asia has depended on its credibility as a neutral stabilising force. That credibility may erode if it is seen as participating in great-power security agendas.</p><p data-start=\"3813\" data-end=\"4205\">Indonesia’s respected record in United Nations peacekeeping has historically rested on internationally recognised neutrality under UN command structures. Participation in a BoP framework, which sits outside established multilateral systems, risks shifting Indonesia from neutral arbiter to participant in a political security architecture shaped beyond globally recognised peacekeeping norms.</p><p data-start=\"4207\" data-end=\"4532\">More troubling is the precedent this sets. If foreign policy principles become negotiable in exchange for economic or strategic promises, Indonesia risks undermining the coherence of its diplomatic identity. Its constitutional commitment to promoting global peace and social justice depends on preserving policy independence.</p><h2 id=\"the-palestine-paradox\" data-start=\"1208\" data-end=\"1878\">The Palestine paradox</h2><p data-start=\"4566\" data-end=\"4928\">Indonesia’s participation in the BoP also creates a visible moral and constitutional tension. The Indonesian constitution explicitly rejects all forms of colonialism and emphasises international justice. Participation in an initiative led by the architect of policies historically skewed in Israel’s favour creates a contradiction that is difficult to reconcile.</p><p data-start=\"4930\" data-end=\"5315\">Trump’s record in the region remains controversial. His decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem altered decades of diplomatic consensus and drew widespread criticism across the Muslim world. For Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation and a consistent supporter of Palestinian statehood, association with this framework carries significant political sensitivity.</p><p data-start=\"5317\" data-end=\"5677\">If the Board of Peace advances regional normalisation without firm guarantees of Palestinian sovereignty, Indonesia risks being linked to a process widely perceived as externally imposed. This would conflict with domestic public sentiment and weaken Indonesia’s moral leadership in forums such as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations.</p><p data-start=\"5679\" data-end=\"6081\">The troop deployment dimension deepens these concerns. The Gaza conflict landscape extends beyond Israeli and Palestinian actors to include broader regional power networks, including the so-called “Axis of Resistance”. Indonesian forces could be perceived by militant groups as extensions of Western-backed security arrangements, increasing the risk that peacekeeping troops become operational targets.</p><h2 id=\"strategic-and-economic-trade-offs\" data-start=\"1208\" data-end=\"1878\">Strategic and economic trade-offs</h2><p data-start=\"6127\" data-end=\"6538\">Deploying 8,000 personnel overseas is not a marginal decision. For Indonesia, it represents a full brigade likely composed of some of its most capable units. At a time of rising tensions in the North Natuna Sea and intensifying Indo-Pacific competition, diverting elite forces to the Middle East risks diluting focus on core national defence priorities and stretching military readiness across distant theatres.</p><p data-start=\"6540\" data-end=\"7059\">The financial dimension is equally significant. Sustaining thousands of troops in a devastated and heavily militarised enclave would require extensive logistical infrastructure. Even when operations receive international support, hidden costs often revert to national budgets. At a moment when Indonesia’s domestic economy requires stimulus and its defence sector seeks modernisation, allocating substantial resources to an expeditionary mission with uncertain strategic returns warrants serious parliamentary scrutiny.</p><p data-start=\"7061\" data-end=\"7489\">Diplomatic engagement must deliver tangible dividends to the public, not impose new burdens on an already stretched state budget. Without clearly defined security or economic benefits, troop deployment risks appear as an expensive geopolitical gamble. Indonesia could find itself dependent on security arrangements shaped by shifting US domestic political priorities, creating commitments that may prove unreliable over time.</p><p data-start=\"7491\" data-end=\"7758\">The absence of robust public debate surrounding this decision is equally concerning. Large-scale overseas military commitments require democratic oversight. Without transparency, foreign policy risks becoming an elite-driven exercise detached from national consensus.</p><h2 id=\"reputational-risk-and-strategic-myopia\" data-start=\"1208\" data-end=\"1878\">Reputational risk and strategic myopia</h2><p data-start=\"7809\" data-end=\"8118\">Indonesia’s close association with an initiative so strongly linked to Donald Trump introduces long-term reputational risk. US politics remains deeply polarised. If future administrations distance themselves from Trump-era initiatives, Indonesia could face diplomatic exposure through no necessity of its own.</p><p data-start=\"8120\" data-end=\"8431\">Foreign policy frameworks built around highly personalised leadership often prove unstable. Indonesia’s diplomatic partnerships have traditionally been grounded in multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and ASEAN, which provide durability precisely because they are not tied to individual leaders.</p><p data-start=\"8433\" data-end=\"8679\">If the Board of Peace becomes politically contested or evolves into a coercive security instrument, Indonesia may struggle to disengage without reputational damage. Participation, therefore, concentrates diplomatic risk rather than diversifying it.</p><p data-start=\"8681\" data-end=\"9072\">In a rapidly multipolar world, Indonesia does not require shortcuts to global influence. Its credibility has historically been built on independence, balance and principled diplomacy. The central question is whether Indonesia will preserve that tradition or compromise it in pursuit of geopolitical visibility and proximity to power. Indonesia deserves a far more independent role than that.</p><p data-start=\"9079\" data-end=\"9103\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They didn’t sack me; they shouldn’t be able to sack anyone else.</p><p>“And then, if we get enough people to do it, they can’t sell Israeli goods.”</p><p>“A genocide is still going on, they are slowly killing and starving people – we still need to be out, doing what we can.”</p><h2 id=\"from-shop-floors-to-state-policy\">From shop floors to state policy</h2><p>Across Europe, there is labour-led pressure to cease trade with Israel.</p><p>Unions in Ireland, the UK and Norway have passed motions stating that workers should not be compelled to handle Israeli goods.</p><p>Retail cooperatives, including Co-op UK and Italy’s Coop Alleanza 3.0, have removed some Israeli products in protest against the war in Gaza.</p><p>The campaigns raise questions about whether worker-led refusals can lead to state-level boycotts.</p><p>Activists say the strategy is rooted in history.</p><p>In 1984, workers at the Dunnes Stores retail chain in Ireland refused to handle goods from apartheid South Africa. The action lasted nearly three years and contributed to Ireland becoming the first country in Western Europe to ban trade with South Africa.</p><p>“The same can be done against the apartheid, genocidal state of Israel today,” said Damian Quinn, 33, of BDS Belfast.</p><p>The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is a Palestinian-led campaign launched in 2005 that calls for economic and cultural boycotts of Israel until it complies with international law, including ending its occupation of Palestine.</p><p>“Where the state has failed in its obligation to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, citizens and workers across the world must refuse Israel and apply pressure on their governments to introduce legislation,” said Quinn.</p><p>That pressure, he said, takes the form of boycotting “complicit Israeli sporting, academic and cultural institutions”, as well as Israeli and international companies “engaged in violations of Palestinian human rights”.</p><p>The movement also seeks to “apply pressure on banks, local councils, universities, churches, pension funds and governments to do the same through divestment and sanctions”, he added.</p><p>Supporters argue that such pressure is beginning to shape state policy across Europe.</p><p>Spain and Slovenia have moved to restrict trade with Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank following sustained public protests and mounting political pressure. In August 2025, Slovenia’s government banned imports of goods produced in Israeli-occupied territories, becoming one of the first European states to adopt such a measure.</p><p>Spain followed suit later that year, with a decree banning the import of products from illegal Israeli settlements. The measure was formally enforced at the start of 2026.</p><p>Both countries’ centre-left governments have been outspoken critics of Israel’s conduct during the war, helping create the political conditions for legislative action.</p><p>In the Netherlands, a wave of pro-Palestinian campus protests and public demonstrations in 2025 shifted political discourse. Student demands for academic and trade disengagement became part of broader calls for national policy change.</p><p>Later that year, members of the Dutch parliament urged the government to ban imports from illegal Israeli settlements.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ireland is attempting to advance its Occupied Territories Bill, first introduced in 2018, which would prohibit trade in goods and services from illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, including the West Bank.</p><p>Progress, however, has stalled despite unanimous backing in the lower house of Ireland’s parliament, the Dail.</p><p>Paul Murphy, an Irish pro-Palestine member of parliament who, in June, attempted to cross into Gaza, told Al Jazeera the delay amounts to “indirect pressure from Israel routed through the US”. He accused the government of “kicking the can down the road” as it seeks further legal advice.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Pro-Israel organisations are working to oppose initiatives that aim to pressure Israel economically.</p><p>B’nai B’rith International, a US-based group that says it strengthens “global Jewish life”, combats anti-Semitism and stands “unequivocally with the State of Israel”, decries the BDS movement. In July 2025, it submitted an 18-page memorandum to Irish lawmakers, warning the bill could pose risks for US companies operating in Ireland.</p><p>The memorandum argued that, if enacted, the bill could create conflicts with US federal anti-boycott laws, which prohibit US companies from participating in certain foreign-led boycotts – particularly those targeting Israel.</p><p>B’nai B’rith International also “vehemently condemns” the United Kingdom’s recognition of Palestinian statehood and has donated 200 softshell jackets to Israeli military personnel.</p><p>Critics say interventions of this kind go beyond advocacy and reflect coordinated efforts to influence European policymaking on Israel and Palestine from abroad.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>While lobby groups publicly press their case, leaked documents, based on material from whistleblower site Distributed Denial of Secrets, suggest the Israeli state has also been directly involved in countering BDS campaigns across Europe.</p><p>A covert programme, jointly funded by the Israeli Ministries of Justice and of Strategic Affairs, reportedly hired law firms for <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/investigations/israel-may-breach-foreign-interference-laws-anti-bds-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">130,000 euros</a> ($154,200) on assignments aimed at monitoring boycott-related movements.</p><p>Former Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson, who supports the BDS movement, previously accused Israeli advocacy organisations of attempting to silence critics of Israel through legal and political pressure.</p><p>According to the leaked documents cited by <a href=\"https://www.ontheditch.com/israeli-government-paid-law-firm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Ditch</a>, an Irish outlet, Israel hired a law firm to “investigate the steps open to Israel against Martina Anderson”.</p><p>She told Al Jazeera she stood by her criticism.</p><p>“As the chair of the Palestinian delegation in the European Parliament, I did my work diligently, as people who know me would expect me to do.</p><p>“I am proud to have been a thorn in the side of the Israeli state and its extensive lobbying machine, which works relentlessly to undermine Palestinian voices and to justify a brutal and oppressive rogue state.”</p><h2 id=\"pushback-across-europe\">Pushback across Europe</h2><p>In 2019, Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, adopted a non-binding resolution condemning the BDS movement as anti-Semitic, calling for the withdrawal of public funding from groups that support it.</p><p>Observers say the vote has since been used to conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.</p><p>The European Leadership Network (ELNET), a prominent pro-Israel advocacy organisation active across the continent, welcomed the move and said its German branch had urged further legislative steps.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the UK, ELNET has funded trips to Israel for Labour politicians and their staff.</p><p>Bridget Phillipson, now secretary of state for education, declared a <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/240415/phillipson_bridget.htm#:~:text=Estimate%20of%20the%20probable%20value,A%2DZ%20index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3,000-pound ($4,087)</a> visit funded by ELNET for a member of her team.</p><p>A coworker of Wes Streeting named Anna Wilson also accepted a trip <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmsecret/240216/sponsor-05.htm#:~:text=Overseas%20Visit:%2016%2D20%20March,)%20(registered%20July%202023).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funded by ELNET</a>.

As a consequence, about 70 percent of the West Bank is “completely unregistered”, Braier said, making it “very hard to determine who actually owns the land”.</p><p>The government’s decision set as an objective the settlement of 15 percent of unregistered West Bank land within four years. To this end, it specified competent authorities, established a dedicated administrative unit and allocated funds under the 2026 budgetary law, which has yet to be approved.</p><p>Even for those Palestinians whose land was registered, “the legal bar for proving land ownership is very, very high, in a way that most Palestinians won’t have the proper documents to prove it”, said Braier.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4055187\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/INTERACTIVE-Israels-parliament-advances-bill-to-annex-occupied-West-Bank-1761225148.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Israel’s parliament advances bill to annex occupied West Bank-1761225148\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"full-annexation\">‘Full annexation’</h2><p>In 1968, Israeli occupation authorities froze most land settlement procedures in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, making transfer of ownership down the family line hard to prove for Palestinians.</p><p>Additionally, legal documents could have been lost or stored in homes that are now out of reach to Palestinian refugees displaced by the Arab–Israeli war (1948-49) – when the newly-founded Israel <a href=\"/features/2017/5/23/the-nakba-did-not-start-or-end-in-1948\">seized control of 77 percent of Palestine</a> – and in the Six Day War of 1967, which ended with Israel capturing the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria, while occupying the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.</p><p>The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the newly reinstated process of land registration amounts to a “full annexation” of Palestinian land.</p><p>“This is a way for Israel to take control over the West Bank,” Hagit Ofran, a Peace Now member, told Al Jazeera. “The government is asking for papers that are dating back to the British mandate or to the Jordanian time 100 years ago.”</p><p>“This is something that, very rarely, Palestinians will be able to prove, and therefore, by default, the land will be registered under [Israel’s] name,” she added.</p><p>Israel’s Supreme Court last month rejected a petition opposing the resumption of the land registration process, filed by local human rights groups Bimkom, Yesh Din, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and HaMoked.

The attack was on the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal near the village of Volna in the Krasnodar region.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian forces also launched a drone attack on the Russian Black Sea port of Taman, which handles oil products, grain, coal and commodities, causing damage and triggering several fires, according to Veniamin Kondratyev, the governor of Russia’s Krasnodar region. He said more than 100 people were working to put out the fires.</li>\n<li>Kondratyev said there were more Ukrainian attacks on the Russian resort city of Sochi and the village of Yurovka, close to the seaside town of Anapa.

Omar, a high school student, was the youngest among his seven siblings.</p><p>“Every child is precious to his family, but my son is a part of me,” she adds, tears streaming down her cheeks as she walks toward the morgue.</p><p>The family contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and several human rights organisations to try to find out what happened to Omar and his cousin, but to no avail.</p><p>Hanaa says the wait has been heartbreaking.</p><p>“We do not know whether they are prisoners, or whether they [the Israelis] killed them and took their bodies or detained their bodies along with those bodies they release in batches.”</p><p>“We are running as if in a mirage and we do not know anything,” says Hanaa, falling silent as if trying to catch her breath.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4316220\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Death-toll-tracker-1771169520.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-Feb 15, 2026_Death toll tracker-1765554400\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"endless-search\"><strong><br>\n</strong>Endless search</h2><p>Since Israel began returning Palestinian bodies to Gaza through the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing, Hanaa has become one of hundreds of family members moving between hospitals and reception points seeking any clues to the fate of their loved ones.</p><p>The latest batch of bodies came on February 4. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 54 bodies and 66 boxes containing human remains, released by Israel via the ICRC, had been received.</p><p>The remains arrived at <a href=\"/opinions/2025/1/1/al-shifa-was-a-dream-and-a-nightmare\">al-Shifa Hospital</a> in Gaza City, where medical and technical teams began initial examinations and documentation before presenting them to families for possible identification.</p><p>Human rights organisations say handovers occur through the Red Cross in accordance with international rules, but these procedures do not always include detailed documentation or the circumstances of death, increasing the burden on Gaza authorities to classify bodies and attempt identification amid limited capacity to conduct DNA testing.</p><p>Since the latest handover, Hanaa has gone to the hospital several times to review lists and photographs of the bodies.</p><p>“I have not left any place without going to it. I even went to Khan Younis in the south of the Strip to check the photos,” she says.</p><p>The bodies were returned under the United States-brokered October 2025 truce agreement between Israel and Hamas, which stipulated that the remains of 15 Palestinians would be exchanged for the bodies of every Israeli held in Gaza.</p><p>As of last month, Israeli authorities continue to hold the bodies of more than 770 Palestinians in what is known as the “<a href=\"/features/2017/8/10/why-does-israel-keep-the-bodies-of-palestinians\">cemeteries of numbers and morgues</a>“, according to the National Campaign for the Recovery of Martyrs’ Bodies and Disclosing the Fate of the Missing.</p><p>Hanaa’s suffering does not stop at reviewing Palestinian bodies. She also checks the lists of prisoners released by Israel from time to time, contacting the ICRC to try to confirm if her son’s name appears.</p><p>“By God, the Red Cross has memorised me and my voice from how much I call and ask. They tell me: ‘Sister, aren’t you the one who called last time?’ I tell him: ‘Yes, my brother. Forgive me, it is not in my hands.’ He sympathises with me,” she says.</p><p>Despite the gruelling effort, there is still no decisive answer about her son’s fate.</p><p>“My heart as a mother wishes that my son is alive. But I prepare myself for the worst possibilities, and even this psychological preparation has brought no result,” Hanaa says.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-do-they-leave-us-lost\">‘Why do they leave us lost?’</h2><p>Hanaa says the hardest part is not only the loss, but the state of confusion and disorientation she lives through, along with hundreds of members of other families still searching for their relatives.</p><p>“Why do they leave us lost like this? We don’t know where they went or what their fate is,” she says.</p><p>Another grim aspect is witnessing the “pitiful condition” in which the bodies are returned by Israel’s military. “All the features are completely buried, and I cannot even distinguish my son’s features.”</p><p>Hanaa says she believes the mutilation is “deliberate” to increase the pain of Palestinian families. “It is as if they want to leave us in grief for a lifetime … to mourn our children without end,” she says, tears unceasing.</p><p>“My son was in the prime of his youth, like a flower, when he was lost. He was preparing to sit for his high school exams with his cousin. What did they do to disappear like this and for us not to know their fate until now?”</p><p>Since the war began in October 2023, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/families-inconsolable-in-gaza-as-israel-returns-more-unidentified-bodies\">the fate of bodies</a> held by Israel has emerged as a central humanitarian and legal issue in the conflict. Israel does not publish a unified list of named bodies it holds.</p><p>According to a statement by the Red Cross, it has “facilitated the transfer of 360 Palestinian bodies to Gaza since October 2023”, supported the handover of 195 Israeli captives, including 35 deceased, and the return of 3,472 Palestinian prisoners alive.</p><p>Only 99 returned Palestinian bodies have been definitively identified, according to the Health Ministry. The rest remain unidentified or are still undergoing identification procedures.</p><p>The ministry said some corpses show gunshot wounds to the head and chest, shrapnel injuries, fractures to the skull and limbs, in addition to advanced decomposition – greatly complicating forensic identification.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4315815\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4315815\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4315815\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A9714-1771164810.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='\"Every child is precious to his family, but my son is a piece of me,\" Hanaa Al-Mabhuh said' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4315815\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Every child is precious to his family, but my son is a part of me,’ says grieving mother Hanaa al-Mabhuh [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Appeal for international help</strong></h2><p>Hanaa called on international organisations to intervene to assist grieving families such as hers to determine the fate of their children.</p><p>“We cannot calm down or stabilise psychologically or socially. We are under enormous psychological pressure,” she says.</p><p>“They plowed the earth completely and exhumed graves searching for Israeli bodies with equipment and tests. But our children, no one asks about them. By what logic does this happen?”</p><p>At Gaza’s forensic department, a small team handles this heavy burden under conditions that exclude tools of “definitive confirmation”, leaving staff and families in a wide space of doubt.</p><p>Ahmed Abu Taha, head of the bodies and missing persons files at the Health Ministry, tells Al Jazeera that 120 corpses recently arrived in Gaza via the ICRC. S<span>ome came complete, while others were simply bone fragments and other human remains.</span></p><p>Out of the 120, only two bodies were identified, and even those were not scientifically conclusive.</p><p>“Confirmatory” tests such as DNA analysis, forensic anthropology, and forensic odontology are unavailable in Gaza’s destroyed healthcare system, meaning only “presumptive” testing can be conducted, which is less precise, says Abu Taha.</p><p>“The steps begin with presumptive testing – looking at distinguishing marks, clothes, whether male or female, estimating age, identifying distinguishing features such as amputations or tattoos… Then you move to confirmatory testing. But unfortunately, in Gaza we only have presumptive testing.”</p><p>This type of testing “is prone to many errors” including misidentification, he adds.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4285584\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-GAZA-HEALTHCARE-SYSTEM-FEB-3-2026-1770124823.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - GAZA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM - FEB 3 2026-1770124823\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2><strong>When error becomes tragedy</strong></h2><p>The most painful aspect, Abu Taha says, is the impact an “error” has on families waiting desperately to find the body of a missing child. Repeated misidentifications have been recorded, causing shock and reopening wounds for many Palestinians.</p><p>Abu Taha recounts one story that deeply affected him and illustrates the psychological and emotional damage inflicted on families amid the absence of accurate DNA tests.</p><p>“On one occasion, members of a family came and identified a body as their son. They presented evidence that closely matched the body. The forensic team examined it and found similarities, and indeed the body was handed over to that family.”</p><p>Grieving relatives completed the formal procedures for receiving the body, obtained a death certificate, then proceeded with funeral rites and burial. They announced a wake to receive mourners.</p><p>But a shock came when, only two days after the burial, another family presented more conclusive evidence that showed the deceased person belonged to them.</p><p>Abu Taha says the harrowing incident has been repeated inside Gaza’s beleaguered hospitals.</p><p>He is calling for international intervention to pressure Israel to allow the entry of identification equipment and DNA testing tools as an ethical and humanitarian matter to end the suffering of families struggling to identify loved ones and give them a proper burial.</p><p>“The file of the bodies is not merely a numerical issue,” Abu Taha says.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
