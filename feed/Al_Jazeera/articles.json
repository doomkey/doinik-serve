The trade balance officially flipped negative – which means imports outnumber exports – in 2022 and has remained so since then.</p>\n<p>But industry experts caution that US ice cream imports account for a minuscule fraction of all the US ice cream consumed in the US, and exports account for a tiny fraction of all US ice cream produced.</p>\n<p>The trade change was driven mostly by a jump in imports. Exports have remained largely unchanged since 2020.</p>\n<p>And the cherry on top? Disagreement over which products to classify as “ice cream” also affects data, experts say. For example, the data referenced by the office of the US Trade Representative also includes “edible ice”, which some experts (and dairy defenders) say doesn’t qualify as ice cream.</p>\n<p>Removing edible ice shows that “the US is a net exporter by a significant margin of ($193 million) or +85% larger by value,” International Dairy Foods Association Executive Vice President Matt Herrick told PolitiFact via email.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ice-cream-imports-increase-causes-us-trade-deficit\">Ice cream imports increase causes US trade deficit</h2>\n<p>From 1995 to 2020, the US had an ice cream trade surplus, ranging from about $20m to about $160m, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, an online economic data platform. Longtime customers include Mexico, followed by Saudi Arabia and Canada.</p>\n<p>In 2021, that surplus nearly vanished, and in 2022 and 2023, the US notched up an ice cream trade deficit of $92m and $33m, respectively.</p>\n<p>At first glance, importing frozen foods doesn’t seem practical.</p>\n<p>“Shipping refrigerated and frozen products overseas is expensive,” dairy economist Betty Berningat of HighGround Dairy said. “Mexico is the top destination for US dairy exports.”</p>\n<p>But many US and European companies have tapped into global markets.</p>\n<p>“Consumers may also want a specific treat that is styled after or known to be from another country,” Herrick said.</p>\n<p>Italy, the birthplace of gelato, is now the United States’ largest single source of imported ice cream. Italian ice cream imports more than quintupled from about $12m to almost $65m between 2020 and 2021 alone, before decreasing somewhat in 2023, the last year for which data is available.</p>\n<p>Some of this stems from increased consumer demand for specialty pints. A report by Mordor Intelligence, a global market research firm, said “product innovation and premiumisation” have become key in the US ice cream industry.</p>\n<p>“This trend is particularly evident in the growth of premium pint offerings and individually wrapped novelties that cater to both indulgence and portion control preferences,” the report said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-us-produces-far-more-ice-cream-than-it-imports-or-exports\">The US produces far more ice cream than it imports or exports</h2>\n<p>To get to the pint: The vast majority of ice cream consumed in the United States is made there, not overseas.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration is cherry-picking stats from a fraction of a sliver of the US ice cream industry.</p>\n<p>According to US Agriculture Department data, US ice cream makers churned out 1.31 billion gallons of ice cream in 2024. This includes regular ice cream, low-fat and nonfat ice cream, sherbet and frozen yoghurt.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the US imported 2.35 million gallons of traditional ice cream in 2024 – that’s 0.18 percent of the amount produced domestically, Herrick said.</p>\n<p>The US exported 16.4 million gallons of that domestic production, which is also a tiny fraction of 1.31 billion gallons of ice cream – a little more than 1 percent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"factoring-in-ice-cream-mixes-excluding-edible-ice-products\">Factoring in ice cream mixes, excluding ‘edible ice’ products</h2>\n<p>Another caveat about the international trade data: It does not include “mixes”, which skews the totals, said Herrick of the International Dairy Foods Association.</p>\n<p>Mixes are used to make ice cream shakes and soft-serve products, and they account for a significant portion of US ice cream exports. “Inclusion of such data points would change the picture quite significantly,” said Herrick. “While it is true that traditional ice cream and edible ice exports have seen decreased exports, the same cannot be said for exports of mixes.”</p>\n<p>US milk-based drink exports increased 621 percent over the past five years, he said. In 2024, the US exported nearly $35m in mixes to the European Union.</p>\n<h2 id=\"americans-and-dairy-based-ice-cream-a-centuries-old-love-affair-melting-away\">Americans and dairy-based ice cream: A centuries-old love affair melting away?</h2>\n<p>The White House has churned out plenty of ice cream devotees.</p>\n<p>George Washington stocked the capital with ice cream-making equipment. Thomas Jefferson is credited as being the first American to record an ice cream recipe. Ronald Reagan declared July National Ice Cream Month in 1984. Barack Obama even slung scoops back in the day.</p>\n<p>Biden, who was often sighted with a cone in hand, proclaimed while visiting Jeni’s Splendid Ice Cream headquarters in 2016: “My name is Joe Biden, and I love ice cream.”</p>\n<p>But consumption of regular dairy ice cream – a category that does not include frozen yoghurt, sherbet or nonfat and low-fat ice creams – has been trending down for years.</p>\n<p>In 1975, Americans ate an average of 18.2 pounds each of ice cream per year. That figure fell to 11.7 pounds by 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2>\n<p>The office of the US Trade Representative purported a summertime scoop: “America had a trade surplus in ice cream in 2020 under President Trump’s leadership, but that surplus turned into a trade deficit of $40.6 million under President Biden’s watch.”</p>\n<p>It’s accurate that the US ice cream trade balance had a surplus for a quarter of a century before turning negative while Biden was president.</p>\n<p>But the US Trade Representative’s statement makes the US ice cream deficit appear out of cone-trol.</p>\n<p>There are three scoops of context on this trade sundae:</p>\n<p>The change was driven mostly by a jump in imports. Exports have remained largely unchanged since 2020.</p>\n<p>US ice cream imports and exports are a negligible amount compared to domestic production.</p>\n<p>There’s also disagreement over which products should or shouldn’t be included in the data set, which can skew trend interpretations. Excluding edible ice products and factoring in ice cream mixes leaves the US with a surplus.</p>\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs a sprinkling of clarification and additional details, so we rate it <strong>Mostly True</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Louis Jacobson contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The US buys 16 percent of that, making it Brazil’s biggest coffee customer. Experts warn the tariff will hurt competitiveness, especially for family farmers who produce two-thirds of Brazil’s coffee and have fewer resources to weather downturns or shift to new markets.</p>\n<p data-start=\"926\" data-end=\"1199\">Last year’s climate change-driven drought already devastated crops. Now, falling arabica prices, down 33 percent since February, are compounding losses. “We struggle for years, and suddenly we might lose everything,” said da Silva, who grows 40,000 trees and other crops to survive.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1201\" data-end=\"1471\">Nearby in Varre-Sai, Paulo Menezes Freitas, another smallholder with 35,000 trees, fears he may be forced to abandon coffee farming. He says the tariff also affects essential imports like machinery and aluminium. “It feels like the ground is crumbling under us,” he said.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1473\" data-end=\"1720\">Despite the blow, Brazil’s coffee exporters remain cautiously optimistic. The Council of Coffee Exporters of Brazil (Cecafe)’s Marcio Ferreira believes US buyers can’t afford to stop importing Brazilian beans. But on the ground, small farmers fervently hope for a rollback before livelihoods vanish.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Social disconnection – when a person lacks sufficient social contact, feels unsupported in their existing relationships, or experiences negative or strained connections – is an increasingly serious but often overlooked danger to health and wellbeing. There are several forms of social disconnection, including loneliness and social isolation.</p>\n<p>Today nearly one in six people globally report feeling lonely. Among adolescents and young adults as well as people living in low-income countries, the rate is even higher. But loneliness and social isolation are not just emotional states – they can be lethal. According to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), from 2014 to 2019, loneliness was associated with more than 871,000 deaths annually – equivalent to 100 deaths per hour. We now have irrefutable evidence that social health – our ability to form and maintain meaningful human connections – is just as essential to our wellbeing as physical and mental health. Yet for too long, it has been ignored by health systems and policymakers alike.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/30-06-2025-social-connection-linked-to-improved-heath-and-reduced-risk-of-early-death\">report</a> by WHO’s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/groups/commission-on-social-connection\">Commission on Social Connection</a> comes a month after the World Health Assembly adopted the first ever <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA78/A78_R9-en.pdf\">resolution</a> on social connection. The report marks a turning point for this serious global health threat and highlights the need for decisive leadership and action. The commission’s report charts a clear path forward with evidence-based strategies to reverse this scourge and strengthen the bonds that allow individuals and societies to thrive.</p>\n<p>Humans are hardwired for connection. From our earliest years, relationships shape our brains, our emotions and our chances of living a healthy life. Conversely, disconnection, whether through loneliness, or social isolation, can have devastating impacts: It increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, anxiety, dementia and premature death. It can also result in poor school and work performance and costs economies and societies billions per year.</p>\n<p>But the good news is that solutions exist. The commission’s report outlines interventions that work – from national policies and community programmes to campaigns and individual support strategies. It highlights a range of successful examples: peer-to-peer support for low-income older people in South Africa; “social prescribing” of activities to older adults in South Korea, like music, storytelling, gardening and self-help groups; integrating social connection into broader development policy in Djibouti; embedding it as part of ageing policies in Albania and in mental health policy in Spain; establishing dedicated national strategies in countries such as Denmark, Germany, Japan, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden; and campaigns to encourage small acts of kindness in Australia, Great Britain and the United States.</p>\n<p>We call on all countries to prioritise social connection.</p>\n<p>This is not only about personal health and wellbeing. It is also a cornerstone of economic prosperity, national resilience and social cohesion. Societies that foster trust and connection are more innovative, more secure and better able to respond to crises. The COVID-19 pandemic brought this truth into stark relief. As lockdowns forced physical separation, the human need for connection became unmistakable – and so did the costs of its absence.</p>\n<p>The WHO commission proposes a global roadmap built around five key pillars – policy, research, interventions, measurement and engagement.</p>\n<p>The key actions it calls for are to develop national policies that integrate social connection into health, education and labour agendas; invest in research to better understand what works; scale up culturally relevant and cost-effective interventions; collect better data to track the problem and measure progress; and build a global movement to change attitudes and reduce stigma.</p>\n<p>It is critical that this movement includes the voices of those who have endured the pain of loneliness and social isolation as they understand what real solutions look like.</p>\n<p>As leaders, we cannot afford to remain passive. Every day we delay is another day of lost potential, unnecessary suffering and preventable death. But if we act boldly, collaboratively and compassionately and on a large scale, we can build healthier, more connected and more resilient societies.</p>\n<p>Social health is not a luxury. It is a human need. And now, more than ever, it must be a political priority.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Israel loudly beat the drums of war one day before its unprovoked surprise attack on Iran, a small but significant piece of news slipped by almost unnoticed: The announcement of a new research project on the website of a Washington, DC think tank. On June 12, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) announced the launch of the Balochistan Studies Project (BSP). Significantly, in addition to mentioning Balochistan’s abundance of natural resources “such as oil, gas, uranium, copper, coal, rare earth elements and the two deep seaports of Gwadar and Chabahar”, MEMRI’s statement justifies the project’s necessity by identifying the region as “the perfect outpost to counter and keep under control Iran, its nuclear ambitions, and its dangerous relations with Pakistan, which may provide Tehran with tactical nukes”.</p>\n<p>MEMRI is well known for its selective translation of snippets of Arabic, Persian and Turkish-language media, screenshots from which often end up being shared as memes on social media platforms. Originally founded in 1998, the think tank has consistently peddled a pro-Israel agenda, with its founder, Colonel Yigal Carmon, having served in the Israeli Military Intelligence Corps for more than 20 years. Additionally, MEMRI has been involved “unofficially” in intelligence gathering for the Israeli state since at least 2012.</p>\n<p>Given this context, MEMRI’s creation of the BSP can be seen as an indication of an Israeli attempt to co-opt the Baloch national struggle against both Iran and Pakistan for Israel’s geopolitical objectives. Given the strategic advantages that a successful co-optation of the Baloch cause would grant Israel, and the potential ramifications it would bear upon the resistance of stateless peoples within the region, including Palestinians as well as the Baloch, themselves, there is a need to examine the limitations of geopolitical thinking within national liberation movements.</p>\n<p>MEMRI’s announcement of the BSP is riddled with logical inconsistencies and misinformation regarding the reality of exploitation and resistance in Balochistan. For example, centring the fact that the states of both Iran and Pakistan are currently fighting counterinsurgency campaigns in Balochistan, MEMRI’s website calls for “the international community” to “understand that Balochistan is a natural ally of the West” – ignoring the fact that Western companies such as Barrick Gold and BHP Billiton have played key roles in enabling colonial resource extraction and ecological destruction in the region.</p>\n<p>Another example relates to the personnel involved in the project. One article on the BSP on MEMRI’s website welcomes a “renowned Baloch writer, scholar, and political scientist” called Mir Yar Baloch, whose X account “has been defined as one of the most influential in the Subcontinent”, as a “special adviser”. In May of this year, Baloch made headlines for unilaterally declaring the independence of Balochistan in a series of posts on X, where he also announced to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India had “the backing of 60 million Baloch patriots” after it launched Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.</p>\n<p>More than for his grand proclamations, Mir Yar Baloch is interesting for the amount of mystery that surrounds him, given his supposed status as an important and influential Baloch intellectual. Despite being profiled by a variety of news outlets – notably all Indian – none have deviated from regurgitating a biography for him as limited as that published in the MEMRI article. Significantly, however, more well-known Baloch activists have been quick to distance themselves from him. Niaz Baloch of the Baloch National Movement, for example, posted on X that there exists no consensus for a declaration of independence among Baloch leaders. Crucially, he also listed four “fake accounts”, including that of Mir Yar Baloch, that he stated “should be reported and unfollowed immediately”. Baloch activists therefore speculate that Mir Yar Baloch is a fake persona created by a state with interests in the region to support its objectives.</p>\n<p>Balochistan is a region that spans the border between Iran and Pakistan, where both states are engaged in counterinsurgency campaigns that often spur tensions between them. Each has accused the other of fostering instability by sheltering militant groups across the frontier. Crucially, many Baloch people on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border view themselves as marginalised and systematically oppressed by the states that govern them.</p>\n<p>In this context, an Israeli overture towards supporting the Baloch cause opens the door to new avenues of entrenching Israeli influence in the wider West Asia region. Beyond Israel’s infiltration of the Iranian state and security apparatus, demonstrated to devastating effect by the events of June 13, declaring overt support for the Baloch cause allows Israel to build relationships with secessionist groups in regions where Iranian and Pakistani political legitimacy is limited. Taking into account Israel’s objective of containing and crushing Palestinian resistance, support for such groups also creates conditions that enable Israel to actively undermine efforts at transnational solidarity-building between Palestinians and other stateless populations, such as the Baloch.</p>\n<p>Any Israeli gesture towards Balochistan would also be scaffolded by Israel’s strategic partnership with India, which has long positioned itself as a key supporter of the Baloch cause – a position that has notably undermined attempts at solidarity-building between the Baloch and stateless peoples forced to live under Indian rule, such as Kashmiris. In a substantive sense, it is notable that Mir Yar Baloch, who has tweeted in support of Israel and India, owes his public profile almost entirely to the Indian media. Furthermore, his messaging is overwhelmingly directed at Indian audiences. The BSP thus represents a case of India and Israel’s strategic partnership manifesting in a projection of both Israeli and Indian cross-regional influence.</p>\n<p>I do not deny the relevance of geopolitics in strategising and building capacity for resistance, but elevating it to top priority can be harmful. A “my enemy’s enemy is my friend” approach risks undermining principled long-term alliances. History offers a warning: The Palestine Liberation Organisation’s (PLO) alliance with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, a relationship described by Sadiq al-Azm as “unprincipled”, alienated Kurds and indirectly facilitated the development of relatively warm relations between Israel and the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq. More recently, Iran’s crackdown on Kurdish – and to a lesser extent Baloch – groups following its war with Israel cited fears of their possible collaboration with Israel as a pretext.</p>\n<p>A post-geopolitical approach to foreign policy formulation among stateless groups, therefore, would necessarily take into account the factory defect of nation-states: their necessary prioritisation of survival and the maintenance of a constellation of privileges and interests over a substantive struggle towards justice. In this context, a principled anticolonial inter- and transnationalism that looks beyond geopolitics does not represent a utopian ideal detached from the practicalities of struggle. Instead, it represents a form of long-term pragmatism in and of itself that pushes against the short-termist gains of privileging geopolitics above principles.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It enshrines the big powers’ prerogative to restore UN sanctions.</p>\n<p>Since then, the E3 have threatened to trigger the snapback mechanism, which would reinstate the sanctions on Iran by the end of August, under the moribund 2015 nuclear deal which US President Donald Trump unilaterally torpedoed in 2018 during his first term.</p>\n<p>The option to trigger the snapback expires in October, and Tehran has warned of consequences should the E3 opt to activate it.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi said on Friday that Iran has indicated it will be ready to restart technical-level discussions on its nuclear programme with the UN nuclear watchdog.</p>\n<p>Grossi said in Singapore that Iran must be transparent about its facilities and activities. He told reporters that the IAEA had proposed that Iran start discussions on “the modalities as to how to restart or begin (inspections) again”.</p>\n<p>“So this is what we are planning to do, perhaps starting on technical details and, later on, moving on to high-level consultations. So this will not include inspections yet.”</p>\n<p>In late June, with the wounds of the conflict still raw, Iran took an unequivocal stance against the IAEA, with the country’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi summarily dismissing Grossi’s request to visit nuclear facilities bombed by Israel and the US. “Grossi’s insistence on visiting the bombed sites under the pretext of safeguards is meaningless and possibly even malign in intent,” Araghchi said at the time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"warning-from-tehran\">Warning from Tehran</h2>\n<p>Iranian diplomats have previously warned that Tehran could withdraw from the global nuclear non-proliferation treaty if UN sanctions are reimposed.</p>\n<p>Restoring sanctions would deepen Iran’s international isolation and place further pressure on its already strained economy.</p>\n<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar has urged European powers to trigger the mechanism. Israel’s June 13 attack on Iran came two days before Tehran and Washington were scheduled to meet for a sixth round of nuclear negotiations.</p>\n<p>On June 22, the US struck Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz.</p>\n<p>Before the conflict, Washington and Tehran were divided over uranium enrichment, which Iran has described as a “non-negotiable” right for civilian purposes, while the US called it a “red line”.</p>\n<p>The IAEA says Iran is enriching uranium to 60 percent purity – far above the 3.67 percent cap under the 2015 deal, but well below the 90 percent needed for weapons-grade levels.</p>\n<p>Tehran has said it is open to discussing the rate and level of enrichment, but not the right to enrich uranium.</p>\n<p>A year after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Iran reportedly began rolling back its commitments, which had placed restrictions on its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>Israel and Western powers accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons – a charge Tehran has consistently denied. Both US intelligence and the IAEA said they had seen no evidence of Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon in the build-up to the June conflict.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enrichment-is-stopped\">Enrichment is ‘stopped’</h2>\n<p>Iran insists it will not abandon its nuclear programme, which <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/iran-reaffirms-right-to-enrich-uranium-ahead-of-key-talks-in-turkiye\">Araghchi</a> called a source of “national pride”.</p>\n<p>The full extent of the damage sustained in the US bombing remains unclear. Trump has claimed the sites were “completely destroyed”, but US media reports have cast doubt over the scale of destruction.</p>\n<p>Araghchi has noted that enrichment is currently “stopped” due to “serious and severe” damage to nuclear sites caused by US and Israeli attacks.</p>\n<p>In an interview with Al Jazeera that aired on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/iran-ready-for-war-with-israel-will-not-halt-nuclear-programme-pezeshkian\">said</a> Iran is prepared for another war and reiterated that its nuclear programme will continue within the framework of international law, adding the country had no intention of pursuing nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/could-israel-be-planning-a-second-war-on-iran\">warned</a> it may resume attacks if Iran rebuilds facilities or moves towards weapons capability. Iran has pledged a “harsh response” to any future attacks.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Despite being admitted at Mpilo Central Hospital, the biggest public health facility in Zimbabwe’s Matabeleland region, a shortage of supplies meant the doctors didn’t have enough for him.</p>\n<p>In desperation, Muzamba’s family turned to their only other option – a nearby private hospital that sold them the three pints of blood. But at a cost of $250 per pint, Muzamba – who earned a $270 monthly salary and had no savings – could not afford it.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div>\n<p>With time running out, the family had to make a plan. Eventually, Muzamba’s uncle sold a cow for $300 and asked other relatives to contribute the balance.</p>\n<p>Two years on, the now recovered Muzamba says the incident has left him psychologically wounded, as he worries about other emergencies when people may need lifesaving blood.</p>\n<p>“Three pints can be a small number; others might need more than that. But due to the costs involved, it becomes life-threatening,” said the 35-year-old, who works in a hardware store in Bulawayo.</p>\n<p>“I could not get the blood without paying or making a payment plan. It was a painful experience for an ordinary Zimbabwean like me.”</p>\n<p>Muzamba’s is not an isolated case.</p>\n<p>With ongoing currency woes, rising costs of living and high levels of poverty, desperate Zimbabweans in need of care face life-threatening delays due to financial barriers. This includes blood shortages – despite supplies being free in public health facilities.</p>\n<p>Tanaka Moyo, a mother of two in the capital Harare, also experienced the stress of needing to pay for emergency blood supplies during the delivery of her second child.</p>\n<p>After excessive postpartum haemorrhaging, the 38-year-old street vendor needed four pints of blood.</p>\n<p>Together with her husband, a security guard, she had struggled to raise money for the birth of their child. The sudden need for a blood transfusion was a shocking unplanned cost.</p>\n<p>“My husband ran around and borrowed money from a microfinance institution. The interests are steep and conditions stringent, but he had to act quickly,” said Moyo.</p>\n<p>“At the hospital, they insisted the blood was free – but it was not available.”</p>\n<p>Plaxedes Charuma, a gynaecologist in Bulawayo, says “postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality”. The prevalence of the condition means that hospitals should always have supplies on hand to deal with maternal blood loss emergencies that arise, health experts say.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3855252\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3855252\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3855252\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-09T172300Z_3996131_RC2YIFAGHUMT_RTRMADP_3_ZIMBABWE-HEALTH-1753370279.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C518&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zimbabwe hospital\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3855252\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A maternity ward at a hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe [Philimon Bulawayo/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>According to the Community Working Group on Health (CWGH), a network of civic health organisations in Zimbabwe, the country faces a high demand for blood transfusions, and those most affected are pregnant women.</p>\n<p>“About half a million pregnancies are expected in Zimbabwe, and in some of these, there is excessive blood loss, requiring transfusion of at least three pints of blood,” said Itai Rusike, CWGH’s executive director.</p>\n<p>“Maternal mortality in Zimbabwe remains unacceptably high,” Rusike told Al Jazeera. “Timely blood transfusion prevents maternal deaths, which in Zimbabwe stands at 212 women dying per every 100,000 live births.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"free-blood-for-all\">‘Free blood for all’</h2>\n<p>Generally, there are two major types of blood transfusions: allogeneic and autologous. Autologous transfusion refers to self-same blood donation by an individual for their own use later. Allogeneic transfusion, which is the most common in Zimbabwe, involves administering blood donated by one person to another who matches their blood type.</p>\n<p>The National Blood Service Zimbabwe (NBSZ) is the body that oversees blood donation and distribution in the country. It operates as an independent not-for-profit entity, but it is mandated by law to collect, process and distribute blood throughout Zimbabwe.</p>\n<p>While the Ministry of Health and Child Care is permanently represented on its board of directors, NBSZ functions independently of hospitals and government health institutions. It is not present in every facility, but maintains decentralised distribution from five regional centres: Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Masvingo and Mutare.</p>\n<p>Historically, patients in Zimbabwe paid for blood, but over the years the government worked on lowering costs – from $150 a pint in 2016 and prior to $50 by 2018.</p>\n<p>The government then went a step further in July that year, deciding that blood would be made free at all public health institutions.</p>\n<p>“The free blood for all move is going ahead as planned and mechanisms have already been put in place to finance the move, and come July 1 [2018], blood will be available for free,” said then-Minister of Health and Child Care Dr David Parirenyatwa during the June 2018 World Blood Donor Day celebrations.</p>\n<p>However, despite the policy, hospitals continue to face shortages.</p>\n<p>This May, there was a critical lack of blood in public hospitals, a situation that threatened the lives of thousands of people, the Ministry of Health and Child Care said in a statement. Al Jazeera contacted ministry spokesperson Donald Mujiri to ask about the shortage and the implementation of the free blood policy, but he did not respond to our requests for comment.</p>\n<p>NBSZ, meanwhile, said that May’s shortage was due to operational and systemic challenges that disrupted its ability to carry out routine blood collection activities.</p>\n<p>“Without timely financial support, we faced constraints in mobilising outreach teams, securing fuel, and procuring essential supplies,” Vickie Maponga, NBSZ communications officer, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“Additionally, the crisis was exacerbated by a seasonal dip in donations, particularly from youth, who make up over 70 percent of our donor base.”</p>\n<p>These shortages regularly result in patients on the front line needing to buy blood at private clinics. In most cases, the patient is physically transferred to the private facility for the transfusion, where they pay the costs. In some cases, the patient pays and the private hospital sends the blood to them in the public hospital.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3855246\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3855246\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3855246\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/World-blood-donor-day-awareness-street-march-Supplied-NBSZ-1753370079.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Blood drive\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3855246\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A World Blood Donor Day awareness street march in Zimbabwe [Courtesy of NBSZ]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"crucial-blood-donations\">Crucial blood donations</h2>\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to ensure that all countries practicing blood transfusions obtain their blood supplies from voluntary blood donors.</p>\n<p>The NBSZ told Al Jazeera that a sustainable blood supply in Zimbabwe depends on cultivating a culture of regular, voluntary donations, particularly among the youth and underserved communities.</p>\n<p>The service has a mobile outreach model, through which it brings blood donation drives directly to schools and communities. To further engage the youth, Maponga said they also started a club that “encourages young people to commit to donating blood at least 25 times in their lifetime”.</p>\n<p>“We also integrate blood donation awareness into school programmes and partner with tertiary institutions to maintain continuity post-high school,” she said.</p>\n<p>Ivy Khumalo, 32, is one of those who has been donating blood since she was in high school. But she says the lack of blood donation centres around her now limits her ability to give as an adult.</p>\n<p>“As a school child, it was [first started] as a result of peer pressure, but I found it fascinating,” Khumalo said. “It was only when I was an adult that I made a personal decision to continue donating out of love to save life and help those in need.”</p>\n<p>But since moving from Bulawayo to Hwange, she said, donating blood has become expensive as the nearest centre is in Victoria Falls, over 100km (62 miles) away.</p>\n<p>NBSZ says it routinely deploys mobile blood drives around the country. It also says it offers donors incentives.</p>\n<p>“Regular donors who meet specific criteria such as having made at least 10 donations, with the most recent within the past 12 months, qualify for free blood and blood products for themselves and their immediate family members … in times of medical need,” explained Maponga.</p>\n<p>However, for keen donors like Khumalo, the effort to reach a far-off donation site is a barrier to entry.</p>\n<p>“In such circumstances, it is no longer a free donation as I spent money going there. In the end, most of us decide to stay home despite the passion for blood donation,” she said.</p>\n<p>CWGH’s Rusike says the NBSZ and Ministry of Health and Child Care must urgently devise innovative and sustainable ways to increase the number of eligible blood donors.</p>\n<p>“The government should utilise the Health Levy Fund of 5 percent tax on airtime and mobile data as it was set up to specifically subsidise the cost of blood and assist public health institutions to replace obsolete equipment and address the perennial drug shortages in our public health institutions,” he said. “That money should be ring-fenced and used for its intended purpose in a more accountable and transparent manner.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3855240\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3855240\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3855240\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NBSZ-Lab-Supplied-NBSZ-1753370052.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C577&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Blood testing lab\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3855240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A woman works at a National Blood Service Zimbabwe (NBSZ) lab [Courtesy of NBSZ]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"promises-and-shortages\">Promises and shortages</h2>\n<p>Authorities say that as of mid-2025, Zimbabwe’s national blood supply is showing good progress, and NBSZ has already collected over 73 percent of its half-year target (the 2025 annual target is 97,500 units).</p>\n<p>The blood service also says the Ministry of Health and Child Care plays a central role in both subsidising and overseeing the cost of blood within the public health sector.</p>\n<p>“Since 2018, this [free blood policy] is made possible through a government-funded coupon system, which absorbs the full cost of $250 per unit, resulting in zero cost to the recipient [in public hospitals],” said Maponga.</p>\n<p>The NBSZ maintains that it operates on a cost recovery basis. It says the entire chain of collecting, processing and distributing a pint of blood costs $245. The agency charges $250, making a $5 profit per pint.</p>\n<p>However, prices at some private facilities can reach as much as $500 per pint, Zimbabweans say. This has sparked heated debate on social media, as the high cost remains far out of reach for many people.</p>\n<p>“NBSZ does not have regulatory authority over how those institutions price their services to patients,” said Maponga, explaining that while blood itself is donated freely, the journey from “vein to vein” involves a complex and resource-intensive process.</p>\n<p>Observers, however, say more can be done to lower the costs of blood transfusions.</p>\n<p>“At closer look, the whole chain of blood transfusion can cost less than $150 by strategically deploying available resources, use of financial donor stakeholders like corporates, and also holding the government accountable to fund the whole process,” said Carlton Ntini, a socioeconomic justice activist in Bulawayo.</p>\n<p>The issue of free blood in the public hospitals is noble, Ntini said, but without full implementation, it remains a false hope and only benefits the “lucky” few, as shortages are the order of the day.</p>\n<p>“In reality, any amount above $50 per pint of blood will still be high to Zimbabweans, and it’s a death sentence,” he said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, for patients, the cost of essentials only adds to an already stressful situation.</p>\n<p>Muzamba was fortunate in that his family did not claim back the money they gave him for his blood transfusion. But Moyo and her husband struggled to settle their $1,000 loan debt, which escalated to $1,400 after interest.</p>\n<p>“It psychologically drained me more than the physical pain as I wondered, ‘Where would I get such money in this economy?’” said Moyo. “The government must own up to its promises – it’s not only about being free, but must be accessible.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The Chinese Communist Party has turned Hong Kong into a surveillance state where freedom of expression, rule of law, and basic civil liberties are systematically dismantled,” Kearns wrote on X.</p>\n<p>“This move risks legitimizing a regime that imprisons critics, silences democracy activists, and uses extradition as a tool of persecution,” she said.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Ronny Tong, a Hong Kong barrister and member of the city’s executive council, told Al Jazeera that concerns about a potential extradition deal were overblown.</p>\n<p>“Extradition is in relation to non-political criminal cases, so any fear that it’d be used to transfer persons with political crimes, eg, national security cases, is totally unfounded and only shows ignorance of the procedure,” he said. “Furthermore, it is up to judges of the transferring state to ensure the procedure will not be abused.”</p>\n<p>He said the city was “more than ready to restart the arrangement, as we have full confidence our judges are totally independent and of highest integrity”.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong’s 2020 national security law criminalised secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference, and was supplemented in 2024 to include treason, sedition, theft of state secrets, espionage, sabotage, and external interference.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong’s government has said the laws are necessary to protect the city from political sabotage and foreign influence, following months of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019.</p>\n<p>Security Minister Chris Tang said in June that 326 people have been arrested under Hong Kong’s national security laws since 2020.</p>\n<p>The government has also used international bounties to expand its reach to Hong Kong activists abroad, or cancelled their passports while they were overseas.</p>\n<p>The moves have been seen as largely symbolic, but also chilling for a city that was once considered the freest place in Asia.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Hong Kong issued a new list of bounties for 19 activists involved with a pro-Hong Kong democracy NGO in Canada.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 as a “special administrative region” and was promised special rights and freedoms until 2047, under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Under Taiwan’s election laws, organisers must secure signatures from 10 percent of a district’s registered voters to hold a recall vote.</p>\n<p>For a recall vote to succeed, 25 percent of registered voters in each district must participate, and the recall must receive more votes in favour than against.</p>\n<p>If voters choose to recall a legislator, a by-election must be held within three months.</p>\n<p>The KMT’s traditional stronghold is in the north of the country and notably around the capital city of Taipei, but recall votes will be held across Taiwan this weekend.</p>\n<p>The KMT won 52 out of 113 seats in the legislature in 2024, and with the Taiwan People’s Party and two independent legislators, holds a 62-seat majority coalition.</p>\n<p>That coalition has been strong enough to block the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which holds 51 seats, and stall the agenda of the country’s DPP President Lai during his first year in office.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h3><strong>Can the recall succeed?</strong></h3>\n<p>Taiwan typically has high voter turnout during major elections, but recall votes are much more of a wildcard, said Lev Nachman, an expert in Taiwanese politics at National Taiwan University.</p>\n<p>“Our prior experience should tell us that these should not pass. However, we’ve never seen mobilisation work like this at recalls before,” he told Al Jazeera, citing the widespread involvement of common people. “We are in a bit of unprecedented times.”</p>\n<p>Ho Chih-yung, Deputy Director-General of the KMT’s Culture Communications Committee, told Al Jazeera the recall campaign had created a “national election-like atmosphere” that would test the mobilisation and engagement of Taiwan’s major political parties.</p>\n<p>The weather could also tip the scales, he said, as a tropical storm is passing north of Taiwan, and the bad weather may discourage the KMT’s older voter base from going out to vote.</p>\n<h3>Why is the recall vote international news?</h3>\n<p>The vote will determine if Lai will be a lame-duck president for the next three years, and whether he has the ability to carry out key defence and foreign policy initiatives, Nachman said.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, it’s a really big deal because every question that foreign policy people have is contingent upon whether these recalls are successful or not successful,” he said.</p>\n<p>The issue carries global significance due to Taiwan’s contested political status and the threat of a future conflict involving China in the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n<p>“The classic Taiwan problem is that it’s not just that society is split, it’s that society is split, and the clock is ticking about whether or not there’s going to be a war over this place,” he added.</p>\n<p>“Everything here is infinitely more existential.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3854260\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854260\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3854260\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-20T155733Z_1753368855_RC24PFANW9WO_RTRMADP_3_TAIWAN-POLITICS-1753343960.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Supporters of the recall movement gather in Taipei, Taiwan July 19, 2025.

Some voters believe that the party has been co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Beijing.</p>\n<p>The CCP has threatened to one day annex Taiwan by peace or by force, and Taiwan’s two main political parties offer different approaches for how to respond to Beijing’s threat.</p>\n<p>President Lai’s DPP has taken a more outspoken approach by advocating for Taiwan on the international stage and ramping up defence spending, while the KMT follows a more conciliatory approach that favours ongoing dialogue with China.</p>\n<p>Fears surrounding China have in the past unseated some of the KMT’s most prominent members, such as party whip Fu Kun-chi, who controversially led a delegation of lawmakers to Beijing last year at a time of significant political tension in the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h3><strong>What does the KMT say?</strong></h3>\n<p>Party member and former KMT spokesperson Ho said the recall supporters were abusing a system designed to remove individuals deemed unfit for holding their posts for serious reasons, such as corruption.</p>\n<p>“This ‘mass recall’ campaign is not driven by the individual performance of KMT legislators, but is instead a blanket attempt to unseat opposition lawmakers across the board,” Ho said.</p>\n<p>“To advance this effort, the DPP has deliberately framed the KMT as ‘pro-China’ and accused it of ‘selling out Taiwan’, a tactic designed to inflame ideological divisions and mobilise its base through fear and hostility, thereby increasing the likelihood that the recall votes will pass,” he said.</p>\n<p>A senior KMT party member also told Al Jazeera that voters may be looking for an outlet for their frustrations amid a rising cost of living and the economic stress resulting from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war and threat of tariffs on Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 32 percent on the island-nation’s export-driven economy. Over the past six months, the New Taiwan dollar has appreciated 11 percent, impacting the bottom line of thousands of small and medium domestic manufacturers who must compete with foreign goods becoming cheaper for Taiwan’s consumers as their dollars go further in terms of spending power.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3854265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3854265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-22T031229Z_1485271307_RC2TPFA2YSL1_RTRMADP_3_TAIWAN-POLITICS-1753344114.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: People against the recall movement gather in Taoyuan, Taiwan, July 20, 2025.

He added that Israel would not allow the establishment of a “Palestinian entity that would harm our security, endanger our existence”.</p>\n<p>While supporting a two-state solution remains the long-held official stance of the US, President Donald Trump has himself expressed doubts about its viability. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump suggested the US could “take over” Gaza, displace the territory’s more than two million Palestinian population, and transform it into the <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/trump-says-us-will-take-over-and-own-gaza-in-redevelopment-plan\">“Riviera of the Middle East”</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump’s plan has been condemned by rights groups, Arab states, Palestinians and the UN as tantamount to “ethnic cleansing”.</p>\n<p>In June, Washington’s ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, also said he did not think an independent Palestinian state remained a US foreign policy goal.</p>\n<p>His comments prompted Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce to say Huckabee “speaks for himself” and policy-making is a matter for Trump and the White House.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>On Thursday, State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said the US will not attend an upcoming conference set to be held at the UN on the two-state solution. The conference – co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, and scheduled to take place between July 28-30 – seeks to chart a roadmap to end the decades-long conflict and recognise a Palestinian state.</p>\n<p>Speaking to reporters, Pigott said there was “nothing further” to say about the issue other than that Washington “will not be in attendance”.</p>\n<p>There is mounting pressure on Israel to end its deadly war on Gaza, waged in the wake of the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks on southern Israel, which saw some 1,139 people killed and more than 200 captives taken to the Palestinian enclave.</p>\n<p>Israel’s subsequent 21-month assault on Gaza has resulted in almost 60,000 Palestinians being killed, with a further 144,000 wounded.</p>\n<p>Months-long ceasefire negotiations – brokered by the US, Egypt and Qatar – have so far failed to yield a breakthrough.</p>\n<p>On Monday, 28 countries – including the UK, Japan and numerous European nations – <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/28-countries-called-for-an-end-to-israels-war-on-gaza-what-did-they-say\">issued a joint statement</a> telling Israel the war on Gaza “must end now”.</p>\n<p>The joint statement also condemned “the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

SpaceX will remedy root cause to ensure it doesn’t happen again,” the SpaceX CEO and founder wrote on X, which he also owns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/news/2024/11/19/musk-launches-spacex-rocket-test-with-trump-at-his-side\">SpaceX</a> has launched more than 8,000 Starlink satellites since 2020, building a uniquely distributed network in low-Earth orbit that has attracted intense demand from militaries, transportation industries and consumers in rural areas with poor access to traditional, fibre-optic-based internet.</p>\n<p>Starlink has focused heavily in recent months on updating its network to accommodate demands for higher speed and bandwidth.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
