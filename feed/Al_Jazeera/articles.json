Moscow, he said, would never again seek confrontation with Washington. “Never. We are for cooperation. We are for coming to agreement on problems that might arise,” he said.</p><p>But Clinton acknowledged their differences over Chechnya, where Russian forces had launched a major war the previous year, after a series of apartment blasts in Russia killed more than 300 people.

He also posted an ICE recruitment video on Instagram with the Superman theme song playing in the background, and promoted the generous pay and benefits that come with being an ICE agent.</p><p data-start=\"666\" data-end=\"846\">Cain is not the only one. Some pro-Trump celebrities have also defended or praised ICE. And Dr Phil tagged along on ICE raids in Chicago and quizzed apprehended migrants on camera.</p><p data-start=\"849\" data-end=\"1028\">But setting aside the irony that the Man of Steel himself was in fact also an undocumented alien, why would Superman be so keen to join ICE’s draconian raids targeting immigrants?</p><p data-start=\"1031\" data-end=\"1103\">For one thing, we need to understand the allure of these ICE operations.</p><p data-start=\"1106\" data-end=\"1395\">The visuals of masked federal agents, hopping out of armoured vehicles, in military-style gear and swiftly descending on what ICE enthusiasts would claim are terrorists, rapists, paedophiles, murderers, drug traffickers and gang members, are deeply comforting for many in the US.</p><p data-start=\"1398\" data-end=\"1516\">This is a consequence of a long history where militarised policing gained a semblance of sacrosanctity in the country.</p><p data-start=\"1519\" data-end=\"1899\">It is well documented that contemporary policing in the US has its origins in slave patrols. This means that the development of the US criminal justice system has its roots not only in slavery, but also in the belief that slave revolts or any effort to upend the racial hierarchy in American society are an existential threat to the established social order.</p><p data-start=\"1902\" data-end=\"2390\">Over the years, the gradual militarisation of the police has drawn its rationale from periods of perceived existential crises in American society. Whether it was the rise of organised crime during the Prohibition era of the 1920s, uprisings during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, or when President Richard Nixon declared drug addiction “public enemy no 1” requiring an “all-out offensive”, these have served as the pretext for strong, military-style policing on American streets.</p><p data-start=\"2393\" data-end=\"2856\">This militarisation of the police has been supported by Section 1033 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, which President Bill Clinton signed into law, allowing local law enforcement agencies to access excess military equipment from the Department of Defense (DOD). The 1033 programme has allowed the DOD to “sell or transfer”, among other things, mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, grenade launchers, aeroplanes and helicopters.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"2859\" data-end=\"3353\">This love affair with ICE is also a cultural phenomenon. The hard-edged, violent and brash cop, willing to stray outside the bounds of the law to protect innocent civilians from evil (the Muslim terrorist, the Soviets, the Germans) is a popular Hollywood and American TV show staple. This has normalised the perception that to keep America safe from such existential threats, it is sometimes necessary to use deadly force or extrajudicial actions, no matter how cruel or excessive they may seem.</p><p data-start=\"3356\" data-end=\"3466\">Of course, in all of this, we cannot ignore the deep, anti-immigrant sentiments that drive the support for ICE.</p><p data-start=\"3469\" data-end=\"3524\">In my adult life, this xenophobia has taken many forms.</p><p data-start=\"3527\" data-end=\"3907\">As an 18-year-old college student in upstate New York in the early 2000s, I was the physical epitome of all things evil and anti-American as the country waged its “Global War on Terror”. At the time, I remember a fellow student justifying the extra security checks I had to suffer through at airports, saying, “You cannot ignore the fact that you look like the people who hate us.”</p><p data-start=\"3910\" data-end=\"4139\">In my late 20s as a PhD student in Copenhagen, I had to hear a senior colleague say, “You’re Indian. I guess your skill is raping women.” He was referring to the 2012 Delhi bus gang rape and murder that received global attention.</p><p data-start=\"4142\" data-end=\"4386\">Globally, we have also seen a proliferation of reality TV shows like Border Security: Australia’s Front Line and Nothing to Declare UK that claim to show the reality of the multiple threats that Western countries encounter at their borders.</p><p data-start=\"4389\" data-end=\"4500\">It is now all but commonplace to imagine the figure of the migrant as a vessel for all things we fear and hate.</p><p data-start=\"4503\" data-end=\"4654\">When Syrian refugees arrived in Europe in 2015, they were portrayed as a security threat, a burden on public services, and a threat to European values.</p><p data-start=\"4657\" data-end=\"4939\">Last year, the United Kingdom saw a wave of far-right anti-immigrant riots after a mass stabbing of girls in Southport. The riots followed false claims that the attacker was a Muslim migrant. Rioters attacked minority-owned businesses, the homes of immigrants and hotels housing asylum seekers.</p><p data-start=\"4942\" data-end=\"5192\">This year, Ireland has seen anti-immigrant attacks on South Asians, including a six-year-old girl who was punched in the face and hit in the genital area. Reportedly, these attacks have been fuelled by anger over the affordability and housing crisis.</p><p data-start=\"5195\" data-end=\"5265\">Such anti-immigrant sentiments have been endemic to American politics.</p><p data-start=\"5268\" data-end=\"5838\">While the discourse during the Obama years was not as antagonistic, the removal of undocumented migrants was still a political priority. President Obama was called “deporter-in-chief”, and in 2012, deportations peaked at 409,849. That said, in the same year, he also signed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, allowing undocumented migrants who were brought into the country as minors to apply for “renewable two-year periods of deferred action from deportation, allowing them to remain in the country”. DACA also made them eligible for work permits.</p><p data-start=\"5841\" data-end=\"6039\">Deportations were also a priority during the Biden years. In fiscal year 2023, US immigration authorities deported or returned 468,000 migrants, surpassing any single year during Trump’s first term.</p><p data-start=\"6042\" data-end=\"6328\">That said, during Trump’s tenure in the White House, the anti-immigrant rhetoric has been vicious, and the Republican leader does not shy away from portraying migrants as synonymous with criminality and an existential threat to the demographic, moral and cultural fabric of the United States.</p><p data-start=\"6331\" data-end=\"6644\">This framing of immigrants as a problematic presence in American society served as a pretext for Trump’s plan to build a wall across the US-Mexico border to stop the movement of undocumented migrants, the travel ban on citizens from several Muslim countries, and a suspension of the US Refugee Admissions Program.</p><p data-start=\"6647\" data-end=\"7025\">Trump’s second term has only been a continuation of such policies. With the genocide ongoing in Gaza and the concurrent visibility of the Palestine solidarity movement, the anti-immigration movement has merged with anti-Palestinian racism, with ICE also targeting pro-Palestine activists whom the Trump administration claims hold views that are antithetical to American values.</p><p data-start=\"7028\" data-end=\"7316\">With all of this in the background, it then makes sense that an actor who once played an undocumented alien on TV and who himself has Japanese heritage would join ICE. In the era of Trump, targeting the tired and poor huddled masses who yearn to breathe free seems to be the American way.</p><p data-start=\"7028\" data-end=\"7316\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Inside are oral polio vaccines packed in ice.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Joseph’s route takes her through dusty lanes, past tin-roofed homes, mosques and churches. By nightfall, she and her team of six women will have vaccinated hundreds of children. Their mission: To ensure no child is left unprotected from the disease that once crippled thousands across the country.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p dir=\"ltr\">In 2020, Nigeria was declared free of wild poliovirus by the World Health Organization (WHO) – a landmark achievement for a country once at the centre of global transmission. But the virus hasn’t vanished entirely.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">A related strain, known as circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), still threatens under-immunised communities. Unlike the wild virus, cVDPV emerges when the weakened virus from oral vaccines mutates and spreads via contaminated food or water, for instance, in areas where too few children are vaccinated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That threat remains. Despite steady progress, Nigeria still reports sporadic outbreaks of cVDPV. As of March this year, the country <a href=\"https://www.vax-before-travel.com/2025/03/29/nigeria-reports-10th-polio-case-2025\">had reported</a> 10 cases of the mutated strain. Last year, 98 cVDPV2 cases were reported.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With ongoing insecurity in northern Nigeria and pockets of resistance elsewhere, the job of eradicating polio now rests heavily on the shoulders of women like Joseph, who are often the only ones granted access to households due to a confluence of cultural, religious and safety reasons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s my gift,” Joseph said of her work, as she adjusted her headscarf under the sun. “I go to different localities. I talk to mothers. I sit with them. I know how to convince them. That’s what makes this work possible.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3885580\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3885580\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3885580\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A-polio-vaccination-drive-in-Mararba-town-in-Nigeria-1755066772.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3885580\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A polio vaccination drive in Mararaba town, Nigeria [Hanan Zaffar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"women-on-the-front-lines\" dir=\"ltr\">Women on the front lines</h2><p>Female health workers like Joseph are the backbone of Nigeria’s polio response.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In rural or conservative communities, male health workers are often not allowed to interact with women and children. While in conflict-affected areas, strange men moving between households may be viewed with suspicion, as many of these areas are battling rebels.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In Borno State – the epicentre of Nigeria’s long-running Boko Haram rebellion and one of the regions hardest hit by polio outbreaks – the stakes are especially high. Male health workers have sometimes been suspected by the community of working with government forces or intelligence services.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In some neighbourhoods, the mistrust and resistance extend to female vaccinators as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Most people in Maiduguri [the state capital] don’t always like the vaccine. They think it prevents them from giving birth,” said Aishatu, who chose not to reveal her last name. The community health worker leads immunisation rounds across several wards in the area.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Such rumours about the effects of vaccines have circulated for years, often fanned by misinformation circulating among community networks, some religious leaders, and occasionally by armed groups such as Boko Haram, which has attacked vaccinators and portrayed immunisation as part of a foreign agenda.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In some cases, religious teachings have been misrepresented, for example, claims that vaccines are forbidden during certain religious festivals or that immunisation interferes with divine will. There have also been conspiracy theories saying vaccines are a Western plot to sterilise children.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Combined with longstanding mistrust of government programmes in some areas, belief in these rumours has made vaccine acceptance a persistent challenge in parts of northern Nigeria, health workers say.</p><p>For front-liners like Aishatu, confronting the beliefs has become part of the job. Her strategy is persistence and patience.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We handle it by trying to increase sensitisation,” she said, referring to the repeated community visits, one-on-one conversations, and informal group talks that female health workers use to counter vaccine myths and build trust among hesitant parents. “We keep talking to the mothers, telling them the truth. Some accept it slowly, some after seeing others take it.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Aishatu has to balance this work with managing her household responsibilities. But she sees the job as something beyond a paycheck. “The work is a professional one,” she said. “But it also adds so much to life. I know I am helping people and I love it.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But she also believes more needs to be done to expand the programme’s reach. “More female vaccinators are needed,” she said. “That’s the best approach for the government to use for creating more awareness about [the need and effectiveness of] polio vaccines.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In areas or situations where male vaccinators face access constraints and restrictions, women doing the work have been more effective. And for some, their demeanour and approach to patients is what also makes a difference.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Women are very social,” said Esu Danlami Audu, village head of Kado who has seen his village stamp out new polio cases because of efforts by women vaccinators.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“They are able to talk to parents, gain trust, and explain the importance of vaccines in ways men cannot. That is why they have played such an important role in our progress against eradication of poliovirus.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This access has proven more critical in regions like Borno. According to the WHO, female vaccinators and community health promoters have been instrumental in reaching children in hard-to-access areas, sometimes even risking their lives to do so.</p><p>“All over Africa, despite facing life threats at many places, their [women vaccinators’] presence and persistence have helped overcome barriers of trust, cultural norms, and insecurity. This is especially true for conflict-affected areas of northern Nigeria where women are often the only ones allowed into households – especially those with young children – making their role irreplaceable,” said Dr Ndoutabe Modjirom, coordinator of WHO-led polio outbreaks rapid response team for the African region.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3885582\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3885582\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3885582\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A-neighbourhood-in-Kado-village-in-Abuja-1755066785.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3885582\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A neighbourhood in Kado village, Abuja [Hanan Zaffar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"to-further-counter-these-challenges-health-agencies-have-also-adopted-a-mix-of-innovation-and-local-knowledge\" dir=\"ltr\">Innovation, persistence and economic ripple effect</h2><p id=\"to-further-counter-these-challenges-health-agencies-have-also-adopted-a-mix-of-innovation-and-local-knowledge\" dir=\"ltr\">To further counter these challenges, health workers have also adopted a mix of innovation and local knowledge.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping now helps identify missed settlements. Community mobilisers, often local women, monitor newborns and report missed vaccinations. Mobile health units and door-to-door outreach campaigns are routine.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We go to schools, churches, mosques and markets,” said Aminat Oketi, a vaccinator in Nasarawa State and a mother of six. “Sometimes we vaccinate 150, even 300 children a day. The work is tough. But when I see a child protected, it is worth it.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Although Oketi earns some money from her work, the job is not well paid. Most vaccinators receive just 12,000 naira (about $8) from the government for a five-day campaign. Transport often eats into their earnings, forcing them to supplement this income with petty trade or hawking goods.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Aishatu supplements her income by<strong> </strong>running a small beans trading business in Maiduguri to earn an income. “I buy and sell beans,” she said. “I manage it by separating my time to work [as a health worker] and do business.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While the campaigns has improved public health outcomes, it has also unintentionally created a foundation for economic empowerment among women, many say. Empowered by training and purpose, many of these women have become micro-entrepreneurs and informal community leaders.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Vaccinators like Oketi, who joined the programme four years ago, are not only safeguarding children but also building personal livelihoods.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">She runs a small poultry business alongside her health work. “I have a shop where I sell chicken feed and I rear birds too,” she said. Her modest vaccine stipend barely covers transport, but the exposure to community networks and the sense of mission have translated into entrepreneurial confidence.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“When people trust you with their children, they also trust you to provide them with other services,” she said. “My customers come because they know me from the vaccination rounds. It is all connected.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is a common trajectory. While some female vaccinators have leveraged their community credibility to start small businesses, others, like Joseph, have set up informal health outreach networks, advising new mothers and coordinating care for sick children.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to Cristian Munduate, UNICEF’s country representative, this dual role of healthcare provider and entrepreneur reflects a deeper shift. “They are not just women with jobs; they are agents of change,” she said. “Vaccination campaigns have opened a pathway for leadership, agency, and financial independence.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Helen Bulus, a government health officer in charge of vaccinations in Mararaba town in Nasarawa, reflects on the sense of commitment female health workers share.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We are mothers too. Women take care of children, not just their own. That’s why they don’t give up [even when there is hardship],” she said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And as they persevere, their work creates other positive ripples, like contributing to higher school enrolment among girls in some regions, she added. “As mothers become more economically stable, they invest more in their daughters’ futures.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3885586\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3885586\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3885586\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A-vaccination-drive-in-a-school-in-Kado-village-1755066801.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3885586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A vaccination drive in a school in Kado village [Hanan Zaffar/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-global-model-with-challenges\" dir=\"ltr\">A global model  – with challenges</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">While wild polio now remains endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Nigeria’s experience offers vital lessons. Its fight against polio, led by women, supported by community trust, and bolstered by innovative strategies, has reshaped how public health can be delivered in fragile settings.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The next step, experts say, is sustaining this momentum.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Routine immunisation must be strengthened,” said Munduate. “And communities must be supported, not just during outbreaks but all year round.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The polio infrastructure has also transformed Nigeria’s broader healthcare system. Cold chains, data systems, and human networks developed for polio now support routine immunisations, maternal health, and even responses to outbreaks like cholera and COVID-19.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We have built a legacy platform. Female vaccinators trained for polio are now part of nutrition drives, health education, and emergency response. They have become health champions,” WHO’s Modjirom explained.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Still, hurdles persist. Insecurity continues to hinder access in parts of northern Nigeria. In conservative areas, misinformation remains rife, fed by rumours that vaccines cause infertility or are part of foreign agendas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite gains, health workers say there is little scope for complacency. Experts warn that until every child is reached, the virus remains a threat not just to Nigeria, but to global eradication efforts.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“For each paralytic case, thousands more may be infected,” said Munduate. “That’s why we can’t stop and efforts have to continue.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The reporting for this story was supported by UN Foundation Polio Press Fellowship</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The corridor could become a mammoth transport hub between Turkiye, Azerbaijan and Central Asia.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>It may increase the flow of Central Asian hydrocarbons to Turkiye and further to Europe, boost the regional economy – and upend Russia’s two centuries of domination in the region that also includes Georgia.</p><p>Armenia was reluctant to allow Azeri access to the corridor, fearing that the emboldened Turkish-Azeri tandem may jeopardise its security.</p><p>But Trump cut through the Gordian knot on Friday, and his role “essentially, cements a new reality in the region”, according to Emil Mustafayev, the Baku-based chief editor of the Minval Politika online magazine.</p><p>“This is a serious shift in the security architecture and transport logistics of the South Caucasus,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>While in the White House, Aliyev and Pashinyan lavished Trump with praise and nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>“What cracked me up is that [they] didn’t lose their way about how one has to communicate in Washington,” Andrey Kazantsev, an expert on the region, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>They also flattered Trump by naming the corridor the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP) and leasing it to Washington for up to 99 years with exclusive development rights.</p><p>What looks like one of Trump’s favourite real estate deals actually heralds a tectonic shift.</p><p>“Trump’s administration has indeed been quick to find its way towards the long-due geopolitical pivot,” Kazantsev said.</p><p>China, which has been promoting its Belt and Road Initiative in Asia and Eastern Europe, may remain “neutral” to it, and Russia, which has two military bases in Armenia, may “ignore it, at least, publicly”, he said. “But for Iran, it’s a real blow.”</p><h2 id=\"a-boost-of-washington-s-clout\">‘A boost of Washington’s clout’</h2><p>To guard the TRIPP, Washington may use a private military company – and eventually build a military base that nominally safeguards Armenia but actually keeps an eye on Iran, said Ukrainian political analyst Aleksey Kushch.</p><p>“It means more potential pressure on Iran and a boost of Washington’s clout in the resource-rich Caspian region where US oil companies made sizeable investments” in the 1990s, he said.</p><p>And Moscow is also about to lose a lot.</p><p>“No matter how paradoxical it sounds, it’s Moscow that has been and still is a decisive factor in the peace settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan and in solving the latter’s problem of accessing Nakhchivan,” said Alisher Ilkhamov, head of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London.</p><p>“One of the main motives for rapprochement of both sides is their push to get rid of Moscow’s influence, of the peacekeeper’s role it has imposed on them,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The new deal “only highlights how fictitious Moscow’s role as peacekeeper and middleman in peace settlement in the South Caucasus is”, Ilkhamov said.</p><p>However, the deal is not yet set in stone, and the Trump-hosted summit “sparked premature optimism”, said Kevork Oskanian of the University of Exeter, in the United Kingdom.</p><p>This optimism “should be tempered by realism and historical precedent [as] many peace processes have failed despite promising starts”, he told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"a-deal-not-yet-done\">A deal not yet done</h2><p>Baku, whose annual $5bn defence spending exceeds Yerevan’s entire debt-hobbled state budget, affirmed Armenia’s territorial integrity but did not withdraw from some 200sq km (77sq miles) of its land.</p><p>The TRIPP’s concept avoids Baku’s demand for the corridor’s extraterritoriality, balancing sovereignty with strategic access, Oskanian said.</p><p>But there are also questions as to whether Washington’s initiatives are “a principled intervention or opportunistic geopolitics”, he added.</p><p>Even without direct confrontation, Moscow and Tehran could try to undermine the deal.</p><p>“Their grudging acquiescence is essential – but far from guaranteed,” Oskanian said.</p><p>Iran <a href=\"/news/2025/8/9/iran-rejects-planned-transit-corridor-outlined-in-armenia-azerbaijan-pact\">threatened</a> on Saturday that the TRIPP “will not become a gateway for Trump’s mercenaries – it will become their graveyard”.</p><p>Armenia is a democracy “polarised” over the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh and Pashinyan’s <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/in-armenia-a-bitter-dispute-escalates-between-pm-pashinyan-and-the-church\">conflict</a> with the Armenian Apostolic Church, Oskanian said.</p><p>To finalise the peace deal, Pashinyan would need to hold a referendum amending Armenia’s constitution that mentions the “reunification” with Nagorno-Karabakh – and win the 2026 parliamentary vote.</p><p>Therefore, the success of Trump’s deal depends on many intricacies of South Caucasus politics – and the West “must engage with nuance – not just geopolitics”, Oskanian concluded.</p></div></div></body></html>"

You’ve got to end it.’”</p><p>The US president said Kyiv and Moscow would both have to cede land in a compromise. “There’ll be some land swapping going on,” he said. Trump has, in the past, discussed the possibility of land swaps. However, neither Russia nor Ukraine have been interested in ceding land to each other as part of a <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/zelenskyy-says-putin-readying-for-new-offensive-in-ukraine-not-ceasefire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">peace</a> agreement.</p><p>European leaders <a href=\"/news/2025/8/11/eu-holds-talks-amid-fear-that-trump-putin-meeting-will-sideline-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">worry</a> that major concessions to Russia could create security problems for the region in the future. On Wednesday, August 13, major European leaders are first convening among themselves and with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and are then scheduled to speak to Trump and US Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>Here’s what Europe and Ukraine request of Trump, as he prepares for the meeting with Putin;</p><h2 id=\"keep-ukraine-in-the-room\">Keep Ukraine in the room</h2><p>Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he would not be at the summit in Alaska, the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin with both in office since 2018.</p><p>But he said he hoped it would be followed by “a trilateral meeting” with Trump and Putin, though the Russian leader has so far said he is not willing to meet Zelenskyy.</p><p>The Ukrainian president added that, “I believe that Trump represents the United States of America. He is acting as a mediator – he is in the middle, not on Russia’s side. Let him not be on our side but in the middle.”</p><p>On August 9, heads of state from France, Italy, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom and the European Commission issued a statement in support of Ukraine. “We underline our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” they said, adding: “We continue to stand firmly alongside Ukraine.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The statement also insisted that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine”.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who is convening a video call on Wednesday involving Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Zelenskyy and several European leaders to discuss Ukraine, has since doubled down on that message.</p><p>“We cannot accept that territorial issues between Russia and America are discussed or even decided over the heads of Europeans, over the heads of Ukrainians,” Merz said in a television interview on Sunday.</p><p>“I assume that the American government sees it the same way. That is why there is this close coordination,” he added.</p><p>The EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on August 10 that “the US has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously”, but “any deal between the US and Russia must have Ukraine and the EU included, for it is a matter of Ukraine’s and the whole of Europe’s security.”</p><h2 id=\"ceasefire-first\">Ceasefire first</h2><p>Last week, Putin presented the Trump administration with a ceasefire proposal, demanding major territorial concessions from Kyiv in eastern Ukraine in exchange for an end to the fighting, according to European officials.</p><p>The offer, which Putin shared with US special envoy Steve Witkoff on August 6, set off a scramble to obtain further information. According to Zelenskyy, Putin has asked that Russia be handed over all of Ukraine’s eastern <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/ukraine-sends-reserves-to-stop-russian-advance-in-east-amid-diplomatic-push\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donetsk region</a>, a third of which Kyiv still holds.</p><p>But European leaders and Ukraine have responded with a counterproposal of their own, forwarded in a meeting with top US officials in Britain on Saturday. The European plan rejected Russia’s proposal to trade Donetsk for a ceasefire.</p><p>It also included demands that a ceasefire take place before any other steps are taken and insisted that territory can only be exchanged in a reciprocal manner.</p><p>Finally, the proposal stipulates that any territorial concessions made by Kyiv must be safeguarded by security guarantees, including potential NATO membership for Ukraine.</p><p>Ukraine, too, has long argued that a halt in fighting must precede any longer-term peace agreement. Russia on the other hand, has insisted on a larger peace settlement as a condition for a ceasefire.</p><h2 id=\"what-else-has-zelenskyy-said\">What else has Zelenskyy said?</h2><p>Last weekend, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done,” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier”.</p><p>Zelenskyy also pointed out that he doesn’t have the authority to sign off on land swaps. He said that changing Ukraine’s 1991 borders runs counter to the country’s constitution.</p><p>Elsewhere, Zelenskyy said in a video message posted to his social media account on Monday night that “he [Putin] is definitely not preparing for a ceasefire or an end to the war”.</p><p>“There is no indication whatsoever that the Russians have received signals to prepare for a post-war situation,” he said.</p><p>“On the contrary, they are redeploying their troops and forces in ways that suggest preparations for new offensive operations. If someone is preparing for peace, this is not what he does,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"what-else-has-trump-said\">What else has Trump said?</h2><p>On Monday, Trump criticised Zelenskyy over the Ukrainian leader’s resistance to ceding territory to Russia, saying he disagrees “very, very severely” with Zelenskyy.</p><p>“I get along with Zelenskyy, but, you know, I disagree with what he’s done. Very, very severely disagree. This is a war that should have never happened,” Trump told reporters at the White House.</p><p>Trump went on to say that “I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying, ‘Well, I have to get constitutional approval.’ I mean, he’s got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap – because there’ll be some land swapping going on,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that the land swap will be “for the good of Ukraine,” before adding that a possible deal will also involve “some bad stuff for both” Kyiv and Moscow.</p><p>“So, it’s good and there’s bad, but it’s very complex, because you have lines that are very uneven, and there’ll be some swapping. There’ll be some changes in land,” Trump said.</p><p>“We’re going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin, and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” he said.</p><p>“Ultimately, I’m going to put the two of them in a room. I’ll be there, or I won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved,” Trump added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And the next day, we would see upper body, chest, thoracic pattern, and then there were days we saw only head wounds, upper neck bullet wounds. And what it felt like… was that somebody behind the gun that day was going to choose the way they were either going to maim or decide to kill people,” he said.</p><p>“It was age indiscriminate.”</p><p>Yousaf’s comments are the latest by medical staff in Gaza accusing Israeli forces and US contractors of targeted and indiscriminate violence at the GHF sites.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said last week that the GHF-run food distributions in famine-stricken Gaza have become sites of “<a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/gaza-aid-distribution-declared-orchestrated-killing-by-msf\">orchestrated killing and dehumanisation</a>“, while Human Rights Watch said the shootings amount to serious violations of international law and war crimes.</p><p>On Tuesday alone, at least 19 aid seekers were killed at GHF sites in Gaza, while many more were wounded, according to medics and witnesses.</p><p>At least 1,838 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid, and another 13,409 have been wounded since the GHF began its operations in late May, official figures show.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Israel has in some instances acknowledged opening fire at the GHF sites, but denies deliberately targeting civilians.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"all-of-gaza-is-a-death-trap\">‘All of Gaza is a death trap’</h2><p>Yousaf, the US paediatrician, said the victims at the GHF sites were mainly boys and young men, as they are often the ones taking the risk to try to get food for their families, “given the dynamic of the risk associated with trying to carry a 5-pound [2.3kg] bag of flour, maybe kilometres, sometimes”.</p><p>“The people would tell us they were sometimes at the site, or around the area, or they were trying to leave… and they were shot indiscriminately; it was like they were being sprayed. It seemed quite obvious to them and to us, from a pattern-recognition perspective… that on a given day, whoever was making the decision behind the trigger was choosing a very specific pattern of fire,” he said.</p><p>The doctor went on to describe all of Gaza as a “death trap”.</p><p>“It is a cage in which people are being marked for death. It almost feels like there is a quota for the number of people that need to be killed on a given day,” Yousaf said.</p><p>On the days that Palestinians stayed away from the GHF sites, because Israel had allowed in more aid trucks, there would be more intense air attacks, he said.</p><p>“The last four days that we were there, when there was a bit more aid access via food trucks, the risk profile changed. And Palestinians going to the food distribution sites wasn’t nearly worth the risk because there was some food elsewhere. So we saw a significant uptick in bomb blasts on the streets, homes, vehicles. So the pattern of the MCIs – the mass casualty incidents – changed from bullet wounds, mostly boys and young men, to just indiscriminate bombings. We saw women and children, elderly, on the days the bombs come in,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The doctor described the Israeli atrocities in Gaza as a “genocide”.</p><p>One clear aspect of this, he said, was Israel’s refusal to let him and his colleagues take in medical supplies or baby formula in to the besieged Strip.</p><p>“When we were screened by the [Israeli military] at the border, the vast majority of us had things confiscated from our bags. Things like food and multivitamins and antibiotics and medical supplies, like stethoscopes, everything you can imagine, that we wished we could have to treat the people on the ground in Gaza,” he said.</p><p>“And this resulted in a situation in which, when those patients came in, in different stages of dying, screaming in pain for their mothers… we knew that in any other environment, we could have done something for them, but in the environment of Gaza, in the death trap that is Gaza completely, we were unable to give them the aid that they deserve, to provide the human dignity and humanity that they deserve.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The “Western ban on <a href=\"/economy/2022/4/11/can-india-keep-the-shine-on-russias-diamond-industry\">rough diamond imports from Russia</a> due to the Russia-Ukraine war and the G7 ban on Russia also affected our business”, he added.</p><p>Russia has historically been a major source of raw diamonds.</p><p>Zilriya claimed that 80 diamond workers have died by suicide over the past two years because of this economic crisis.</p><p>“The situation in the international market led to the wages of the workers getting halved to approximately 15,000-17,000 rupees ($194) per month, which made survival difficult in the face of rising inflation,” he said.</p><p>Once the Trump tariffs fully kick in, Zilriya fears that up to 200,000 people in Gujarat may lose their livelihoods.</p><p>Already, more than 120,000 former diamond sector workers have applied for benefits. A 13,500-rupee ($154) allowance per child, to support their families, was promised in May by the state government to those who have lost jobs due to the tumult in the sector in recent years.</p><p>But the tariffs, pandemic and war are not alone to blame for the crisis: <a href=\"/economy/2021/5/4/bb-ethical-bling-pandora-will-no-longer-used-mined-diamonds\">Lab-grown diamonds</a> are also slowly eating into the market of their natural counterparts.</p><p>“Unlike natural [diamonds], the lab-grown diamonds are not mined but manufactured in specialised laboratories and priced at just 10 percent of the natural ones. It is difficult even for a seasoned jeweller to identify the natural and lab-grown with a naked eye.

We hope to get a favourable reduction in tariffs; otherwise, it would be difficult to survive,” said Kirit Bhansali, the chairman of the GJEPC.</p><p>The tariffs could also hurt US jewellers, warned Rajesh Rokde, the chairman of the All India Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC), a national trade federation for the industry.</p><p>“The US has around 70,000 jewellers who would also face a crisis if the jewellery becomes expensive,” Rokde added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3885310\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3885310\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3885310\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25141495170131-1755049407.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A salesperson shows a diamond ring to a prospective buyer at a jewelry shop in Ahmedabad, India, on April 14, 2025.
