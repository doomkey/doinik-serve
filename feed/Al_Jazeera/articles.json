One troy ounce is equal to 31.1035 grammes.</p><p>At $5,000 per troy ounce, 1 gramme of gold is worth about $160, and a standard 400-troy-ounce (12.44kg) gold bar costs $2m.</p><p>Troy ounces are different from regular ounces, which weigh 28.35 grammes and are used to measure everyday items including foods.</p><h3>Purity (in karats)</h3><p>Karat or carat (abbreviated as “K” or “ct”) measures the purity of a gold item. Pure gold is 24 karats, while lower karats such as 22, 18, and 9 indicate that the gold is mixed with less expensive metals like silver, copper, or zinc.</p><p>To determine the purity of gold, jewellers are required to stamp a number onto the item, such as 24K or a numeric value like 999, which indicates it is 99.9 percent pure. For example, 18K gold will typically have a stamp of 750, signifying that it is 75 percent pure.</p><p>Some typical values include:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>24 karat – 99.9% purity</strong> – A deep orange colour, is very soft, never tarnishes and is most commonly used for investment coins or bars</li>\n<li><strong>22 karat  – 91.6% purity</strong> – A rich orange colour, moderate durability, resists tarnishing and most often used for luxury jewellery</li>\n<li><strong>18 karat – 75% purity</strong> – A warm yellow colour, high durability, will have some dulling over time and most often used in fine jewellery</li>\n<li><strong>9 karat – 37.5%</strong> <strong>purity</strong> – A pale yellow colour, has the highest durability, dulls over time, used in affordable jewellery</li>\n</ul><p>Other karat amounts such as 14k (58.3% purity) and 10k (41.7% purity) are often sold in different markets around the world.</p><p>When you buy jewellery, the price usually depends on the day’s gold spot price, how much it costs to make, and any taxes.</p><p>If you know the item’s exact weight in grammes and the gold’s purity in karats, you can calculate the craftsmanship cost on top of that.</p><p>You typically cannot negotiate the spot gold price, but you can often haggle over the craftsmanship costs.</p><h2 id=\"the-price-of-gold-has-quadrupled-over-the-past-10-years\">The price of gold has quadrupled over the past 10 years</h2><p>Gold has been valued for thousands of years, serving various functions, from currency to jewellery. The precious metal is widely regarded as a safe haven asset, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or market volatility.</p><p>Up until 1971, the United States dollar was physically defined by a specific weight of gold. Under the classical gold standard, for nearly a century, from 1834 until 1933, you could walk into a bank and exchange $20 for an ounce of gold.</p><p>In 1933, amid the Great Depression, the price was raised to $35 per ounce to stimulate the economy.</p><p>In 1971, under President Richard Nixon, gold was decoupled from the dollar, and its price began to be determined by market forces.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, the price of gold has quadrupled from $1,250 in 2016 to around $5,000 today.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4297179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4297179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4297179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Timeline-of-price-of-gold-1770547790.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Timeline of price of gold-1770547790\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4297179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-the-price-of-gold-determined-in-different-countries\">How is the price of gold determined in different countries?</h2><p data-start=\"99\" data-end=\"726\">Gold is priced globally based on the spot market, where one troy ounce is traded in US dollars on exchanges such as London and New York. Local prices vary as the dollar rate is converted into domestic currencies, and dealers add premiums for minting, distribution and demand.</p><p data-start=\"99\" data-end=\"726\">Taxes and import duties further influence the final cost: India adds 3 percent GST, while the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates impose none on gold investments.</p><p data-start=\"99\" data-end=\"726\">Different countries produce unique gold bullion coins and bars, each with its own distinct features and cultural significance.

A United Nations Development Programme report released in November painted a grim picture: The debris generated by the war creates an “unprecedented obstacle” that could take seven years to clear – and that is only under “ideal conditions”.</p><p>“Gaza stands as one of the most devastated places on earth,” the report said.</p><p>Faced with this reality, Palestinian experts rejected the top-down models for reconstruction proposed in Davos. Abdel Rahman Kitana, professor of architecture at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank, pointed to the <a href=\"https://gaza-city.org/media-center/war_details/59\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Phoenix Plan”</a>, a framework developed by the Union of Gaza Strip Municipalities, as a viable local alternative.</p><p>“Reconstruction is not just about restoring what was destroyed. It is about reshaping life,” Kitana told Al Jazeera Arabic as he warned against disconnected solutions for Gaza. He instead advocated for an “integrated approach” rooted in the Phoenix Plan, under which rubble is not treated as waste but as a resource that could be recycled for land reclamation.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"خبير هندسة معمارية يوضح للجزيرة سبل إعادة إعمار غزة والاستفادة من الركام\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uW2WYUrAbLg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><p>Kitana insisted that any successful plan for Gaza’s reconstruction must be bottom-up. “We cannot succeed without the people themselves. … They know their needs and their dreams,” he said, warning that ignoring local agencies will lead to a “fragile, alienating environment”.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-dual-use-rule\">Israel’s ‘dual use’ rule</h2><p>However, both the UN’s seven-year reconstruction timeline and the “Phoenix Plan” face a critical hurdle: Israel’s “<a href=\"/news/2025/2/3/gaza-authorities-plead-for-tents-accuse-israel-of-obstructing-aid\">dual use</a>” list.</p><p>Historically, Israel has banned items such as fertilisers and steel pipes under the pretext that they could be used for military purposes. Today, that list has expanded to include more essential items, including oxygen cylinders, cancer medicines and water filters.</p><p>Jabareen says the blockade is no longer a pretext for security but a “philosophy of governance”.</p><p>“Israel has turned the ‘dual use’ excuse into a mechanism of indefinite delay,” he said.</p><p>By requiring project-by-project approval for every sack of cement, Israel ensures that reconstruction remains a perpetual “project” that keeps donor countries and agencies exhausted and the Palestinian administration in “a state of constant begging”, Jabareen said.</p><h2 id=\"silent-demographic-engineering\">‘Silent demographic engineering’</h2><p>While Israel blocks key materials on the ground, the Trump administration is creating a “political fantasy” abroad, experts said. Gaza’s Board of Peace, pushed by Trump, promises a $10bn gross domestic product boost to Gaza and a “New Rafah” with 100,000 housing units.</p><p>Jabareen viewed the plans, which include “waterfront properties” and “industrial zones”, as a form of “silent demographic engineering”.</p><p>“They are trying to shift the Palestinian cause from a national rights issue to a real estate problem,” he said. The goal, he argues, is to design a Gaza that is “economically useful” to the region but “nationally hollowed out”.</p><p>By focusing on “investments” and “tourism” while ignoring the rubble and the mass graves, the plan seeks to “legitimise a political fantasy”, Jabareen said. “If you can’t displace the Palestinian by force, you displace his idea of home by re-engineering his space.”</p><p>So who will eventually build this “New Gaza”? Jabareen warned of a “privatisation of occupation” even if Israeli companies do not enter Gaza directly.</p><p>“Reconstruction is a chain of indirect profits,” he noted, adding that the logistics of inspection, the security firms managing the crossings and the insurance companies covering the risks will all generate revenue for Israeli or allied firms.</p><p>The contracts for reconstruction themselves become a political filter. “This creates an international ‘market of obedience’,” Jabareen said. “The donor who objects is excluded, and the contractor who asks questions on sovereignty is replaced.”</p><h2 id=\"silent-transfer\">‘Silent transfer’</h2><p>Jabareen said the most dangerous aspect of such a policy is the “weaponisation of time itself”.</p><p>With UN assessments indicating that removing debris alone could last until 2032 and a full reconstruction of Gaza stretching to 2040, the “wait” becomes a policy of displacement.</p><p>“Time decomposes societies,” Jabareen said.</p><p>He said Israel is betting on “rational emigration” – after living for years in tents, Palestinians will leave, not because they were forced by tanks, but because they were exhausted by fears over their future.</p><p>“The long wait is not condemned by the international community. Israel realises that bombing brings condemnation, but bureaucratic delay brings only silence,” Jabareen said. “If the fighter jets failed to displace them, the waiting might succeed.”</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Who pays to rebuild Gaza after Israel's devastating war? | Counting the Cost\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXYBb_7_Esk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p></div></div></body></html>"

We are not going to collapse.”</p><p>The government says it will prioritise available fuel for essential services – public health, food production and defence – and push the installation of solar-based renewable energy sector and incentives therein. It will prioritise shifting energy to selected food production regions and accelerate the use of renewable energy sources, while cutting down on culture and sport activities and diverting resources towards the country’s early warning systems.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296737\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296737\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296737\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-01-29T170435Z_1177184829_RC25BJAOAZ3Y_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1770541300.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"cuba oil\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio looks on as President Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, January 29, 2026 [Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-has-the-us-blocked-oil-to-cuba\">Why has the US blocked oil to Cuba?</h2><p>Decades of strict US economic sanctions against Cuba, the largest island nation in the Caribbean, have destroyed its economy and isolated it from international trade. Cuba relied on foreign allies for oil shipments, such as Mexico, Russia, and Venezuela.</p><p>However, after the US forces abducted Venezuelan President Maduro, Washington blocked any Venezuelan oil from going to Cuba. Trump now says the Cuban government is ready to fall.</p><p>Under Trump, Washington has pivoted to the Western Hemisphere, which it wants to dominate. The military actions in Venezuela, the pledge to take over Greenland and changing the government in Cuba are part of the new policy.</p><p>Last month, Trump signed an executive order – labelling Cuba a threat to national security – imposing tariffs on any country that sells or provides oil to the island nation. Further pressure on the Mexican government reportedly led to oil stocks reaching a record low in Cuba.</p><p>“It looks like it’s something that’s just not going to be able to survive,” Trump told reporters last month, when questioned about the Cuban economy. “It is a failed nation.”</p><p>Havana has rejected accusations that it poses a threat to US security. Last week, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling for dialogue.</p><p>“The Cuban people and the American people benefit from constructive engagement, lawful cooperation, and peaceful coexistence. Cuba reaffirms its willingness to maintain a respectful and reciprocal dialogue, oriented toward tangible results, with the United States government, based on mutual interest and international law,” <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/cuba-denies-security-threat-accusations-as-us-raises-pressure\">a statement from the ministry said</a> on February 2.</p><p>Trump’s goals in Cuba remain unclear; however, US officials have noted on multiple occasions that they would like to see the government change.</p><p>Responding to a question during a US Senate hearing on Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “We would like to see the regime there change. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to make a change, but we would love to see a change.”</p><p>Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, is one of the most powerful figures in Trump’s administration.</p><p>“The Cuban-American lobby, which Rubio represents, is one of the most powerful foreign policy lobbies in the United States today,” Ed Augustin, an independent journalist in Havana, told Al Jazeera’s <em>The Take</em>.</p><p>“In the new Trump administration, [with] an unprecedented number of Cuban Americans, the lobbyists have become the policymakers,” he said, adding that Rubio has built firm control over the lobby.</p><p>On January 31, Trump told reporters, “It doesn’t have to be a humanitarian crisis. I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal. So Cuba would be free again.”</p><p>He said Washington would make a deal with Cuba, but offered no clarity on what that means.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296764\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296764\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296764\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-28T185841Z_1827449538_RC2FKHAQKB6K_RTRMADP_3_STORM-MELISSA-CUBA-1770541565.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"castro\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A woman walks past a building with an image of former President Fidel Castro as people prepare for the arrival of Hurricane Melissa in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, October 27, 2025 [Norlys Perez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"history-of-us-cuba-relations\">History of US-Cuba relations</h2><p>Since Fidel Castro overthrew the pro-US regime in the Cuban revolution in 1959, the country has been under US embargo. Decades of sanctions have denied Cuba access to global markets, making even supply medicines difficult.</p><p>Castro nationalised US-owned properties, mainly the oil sector, and Washington responded with trade restrictions that soon became a full economic embargo that continues to this day, undermining Cuba’s economy.</p><p>The US also cut diplomatic ties with Havana, and three years later, a missile crisis almost brought Washington and the erstwhile USSR, an ally of Cuba, to the brink of nuclear war.</p><p>In 2014, Washington and Havana restored ties after 50 years. Two years later, US President Barack Obama travelled to Havana to meet Raul Castro.</p><p>However, during his first term as president, Trump reversed the historic move in 2017. Since then, the US has reimposed a raft of sanctions against Cuba, especially economic restrictions, leading to one of the worst economic crises in the island nation’s history. Within hours of his inauguration in January 2025, Trump reversed the previous administration’s policy of engagement with Havana.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296746\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296746\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296746\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-06T230555Z_1592351741_RC2GGJALUGP6_RTRMADP_3_CUBA-FUEL-1770541357.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"cuba\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People wait for transport at a bus stop as Cubans brace for fuel scarcity measures, Havana, Cuba, February 6, 2026 [Norlys Perez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-long-can-cuba-sustain\">How long can Cuba sustain?</h2><p>Until last month, Mexico reportedly remained Cuba’s major oil supplier, sending nearly 44 percent of total oil imports, followed by Venezuela at 33 percent, while nearly 10 percent was sourced from Russia and a smaller amount from Algeria.</p><p>According to Kpler, a data company, by January 30, Cuba was left with oil enough to last only 15 to 20 days at current levels of demand.</p><p>Cuba currently needs an estimated 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4296772\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4296772\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4296772\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260206__96FF9TZ__v1__MidRes__CubaTransportFeature-1770541652.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"cuba\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4296772\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man rides a bicycle in Havana, Cuba, on February 6, 2026 [Yamil Lage/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-has-the-un-said-about-the-cuban-crisis\">What has the UN said about the Cuban crisis?</h2><p>United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Wednesday that “the secretary-general is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet”.</p><p>Dujarric said, for more than three decades, the UN General Assembly has consistently called for an end to the embargo imposed by the US on Cuba, adding that the UN urges “all parties to pursue dialogue and respect for international law”.</p><p>Francisco Pichon, the senior-most UN official in Cuba, described “a combination of emotions” in the country – “a mix of resilience, but also grief, sorrow and indignation, and some concern about the regional developments”.</p><p>The UN team in Havana says the vast majority of Cubans are hit by rolling blackouts, with the number of people in vulnerable situations increasing significantly.</p><p>“The last two years have been quite tough,” Pichon said, adding that urgent changes are needed to sustain Cuba “in the midst of the severe economic, financial and trade sanctions”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This is a logical approach, and Hamas — through mediators Qatar, Turkiye and Egypt, and through indirect dialogues with the Americans via the mediators — has reached, or there has been, an understanding of Hamas’s vision on that.

The events have strained ties between the two regional powers.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The cabinet announcement has triggered mixed reactions and a war of words with some seeing a glimmer of hope and a step towards establishing government authority while others view it as a redistribution of power and wealth among the country’s rival elites.</p><p>The 35-member cabinet, which has 10 more members compared with the previous cabinet, has representations from diverse professional backgrounds, including administration, economics, law and academia.</p><p>Yaseen Al-Tamimi, a Yemeni political researcher, said the large size of the government represents a forced return to the era of what she called an “appeasement” policy, which attempts to placate different groups and regions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4243579\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4243579\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4243579\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_696997f8-1768527864.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Yemeni Foreign Minister Shaya Mohsin Zindani attends a news conference.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4243579\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prime Minister Shaya Mohsen al-Zindani says the new government’s focus will be on improving living conditions and services for citizens [File: Evgenia Novozhenina/Pool/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Although such a large number of ministries places a heavy burden on the budget, the current phase in the country necessitates this type of appeasement, Al-Tamimi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The different political groups in the country need to feel that they have been given a share of power to push them to act in line with the government’s agenda, according to Al-Tamimi.</p><p>“I see this formation of the new cabinet as satisfactory. It reflected the amount of effort that was made over the past weeks to appear with this composition of competent people with a certain amount of political and national responsibility.”</p><p>In a statement on his Facebook page, Prime Minister Shaya Mohsen al-Zindani said the new government’s focus will be on improving living conditions and services for citizens, combating corruption and developing institutional performance to contribute to ending Houthi control of large parts of the country, restoring state institutions and consolidating stability.</p><p>The PLC took control of southern Yemen with the backing of Saudi Arabia last month while northern Yemen, where most of the population is located, is under the control of the Iran-backed Houthi group.</p><p>The Houthis took over the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and toppled the UN-recognised government in February 2015. The PLC governs from the southern port of Aden.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-needed-for-the-new-cabinet-to-succeed\">What is needed for the new cabinet to succeed</h2><p>Mohammed Al-Samei, a Taiz-based political journalist, expressed hope after the new ministers were appointed. He described them as competent and deserving of their posts and said their success will depend on how united they are.</p><p>“The success of this government remains contingent on the existence of a firm political will from the prime minister, the Presidential Leadership Council and the various political forces. The new cabinet will not achieve true success unless these parties unite to serve the nation, away from side conflicts,” Al-Samei told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Beyond the cabinet’s domestic political will, Al-Samei indicated that continued Saudi financial support will be indispensable.</p><p>“Today, the new government faces serious challenges, including providing services and improving the livelihoods of citizens. Overcoming these challenges will be possible with the support of Yemen’s political process sponsors, particularly Saudi Arabia,” Al-Samei added.</p><p>A day before the announcement of the new cabinet, Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani noted that Saudi Arabia had expressed its readiness to pay all salaries in Yemen’s south, including the salaries of soldiers.</p><p>Al-Eryani said the move aims to restructure the military forces, make them subordinate to the state and receive their instructions from the supreme commander of the armed forces, Rashad Al-Alimi, who is the chairman of the PLC.</p><p>Vice Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman, who is in Doha to attend the Al Jazeera Forum, also pointed to the role Saudi Arabia is playing in providing financial help to the government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The Saudi government has taken the responsibility for one year. This is not going to be enough unless we have regular functioning of infrastructure operations and security,” Noman told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said the biggest challenge the government is going to face in the coming days is to restructure the security forces, which he added needed to be brought under the Ministries of Interior and Defence.</p><p>Without stability, the government cannot work smoothly, Noman said, adding that only after security is established can infrastructure and services work and government functions resume.</p><p>The diplomat said the government has to be resolute to do its job or it will face a great failure, which would create a vacuum. “And the vacuum will be filled by AQ [al-Qaeda] and ISIS [ISIL] and other nonstate actors operating in Yemen.”</p><p>The new government has to also address the mounting humanitarian challenges facing Yemen, where about 18 million Yemenis – about half the population – face acute food shortages while tens of thousands are facing famine-like conditions.</p><h2 id=\"women-s-representation\">Women’s representation</h2><p>Unlike the previous cabinets, the new cabinet includes three women, sparking positive reactions from activists and civil society members.</p><p>Afrah Al-Zuba has been named the minister of planning and international cooperation. Ishraq Al-Maqatri is the new minister of legal affairs, and Ahed Jaasous has been appointed minister of state for women’s affairs.</p><p>“Today is a significant political moment. The newly formed cabinet includes women in key and influential positions,” Najiba Al-Naggar, a Yemeni community and human rights activist, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is not a minor detail. It is a political indicator and a clear message about the direction of this phase. It signifies recognition of women’s competence and indicates that the state has begun to treat women’s participation as a constitutional right, not as temporary appeasement.”</p><p>Fatima Saleh, a university graduate in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that the war has marginalised women’s political role.</p><p>“I have not heard a woman minister for years. The announcement of three women ministers in this new cabinet is a proud moment for girls and women in Yemen,” Saleh said.</p><p>She acknowledged that she and millions of women in northern Yemen are unlikely to get a direct benefit, but the move is an indicator that the leadership of the UN-recognised government does not “underestimate women as other radical groups” do in Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-public-divide-in-the-south\">The public divide in the south</h2><p>In southern Yemen, where the public remains sharply divided over Saudi Arabia’s role, sentiments about the new cabinet have been mixed. Southern separatists, led by STC, have been seeking sovereignty for the south.</p><p>Ahmed Maher, a journalist from Aden, said it is too early to judge the government, indicating its performance will determine its credibility.</p><p>“The formation of the government is a new beginning, not the end,” he said. “Those who work for Yemen and its citizens will remain while those who persist in their racism and mistakes will depart.”</p><p>On Saturday, the Hadramout Tribal Confederation and the Inclusive Hadramout Conference – two tribal blocs in Hadramout governorate, which PLC forces retook from the STC in early January – expressed in a statement their disapproval of the formation of the new government, saying the cabinet formation mechanism has “failed to bring about any fundamental change to the existing reality, given the absence of a just and comprehensive political solution that addresses all pending issues”.</p><p>The two tribal groups reaffirm “their unwavering commitment to the Hadramout self-governance vision as the strategic option that establishes lasting stability and sustainable peace”.</p><p>This statement was issued after southern separatists protested on Friday in Seyoun, a city in Hadramout, calling for independence and pledging to continue their struggle against Yemen’s UN-recognised government and Saudi intervention in southern Yemen.</p><p>In December, southern separatists backed by the UAE took over the Hadramout and al-Mahra governorates, reaching the Saudi border. The kingdom considered such a move a threat to its national security. Saudi-backed fighters have ‌since largely retaken those areas.</p><p>Abdulkareem Nasser, a southern separatist in Seyoun, said the new cabinet does not represent the southern people, who have their own flag, vision and identity.</p><p>“We [southern separatists] will continue our struggle and will not accept the agenda of this government and its sponsor [Saudi Arabia],” he said.</p><p>“Our demand is clear: an independent state. We cannot abandon an independent state for water and electricity services. No government can persuade or force us to give up on our aspirations,” Nasser said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reviving-unity\">Reviving unity</h2><p>Although the members of the new cabinet belong to different regions and political groups, Al-Samei maintained that healing Yemen’s damaged unity remains a formidable challenge.</p><p>“The war has eroded the country’s unity. The status quo separation between the south and the north has been ongoing for years, and the southerners are not fully united. It is a massive mission for the new government to tackle these challenges,” Al-Samei said.</p><p>“If the new government is capable of stabilising the south and pushing into the north to recapture it from the Houthis, that could mean Yemen’s unity will be revived.”</p><p>Houthis have not recognised the authority of the PLC, saying they are the legitimate government in the country. In the Houthis’ eyes, the Saudi-backed government officials are “mercenaries”.</p><p>Abdullah Ali, a Houthi fighter in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that it is the people who grant the leaders legitimacy, not the UN or Saudi Arabia.</p><p>“Our leaders live among their people, lead from inside and bear all the hardships, so their leadership is legitimate. Any government imposed on the people by foreign players is illegitimate, and fighting it is a duty,” Ali said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_698832c3ac-1770533571.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"245\" data-end=\"680\">Global markets rarely reveal their vulnerabilities quietly. They do so when shipping lanes come under threat, energy prices surge, or supply chains fracture. Few regions illustrate this reality more starkly than the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which are now among the world’s most contested maritime corridors. What unfolds along these waters no longer remains local. It shapes economic security across the Arab world and far beyond.</p><p data-start=\"682\" data-end=\"793\">Yet, amid growing attention to this strategic corridor, one factor remains persistently underestimated: Somalia.</p><p data-start=\"795\" data-end=\"1287\">For decades, Somalia was viewed primarily through the lens of conflict and fragility. That narrative no longer reflects today’s reality. The country is undergoing a consequential transition, moving away from prolonged instability, rebuilding state institutions, and re-emerging as a sovereign actor with growing regional relevance. Situated at the intersection of the Arab world, Africa, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden, Somalia is not peripheral to regional stability; it is central to it.</p><p>Geography alone explains much of this significance. With the longest coastline in mainland Africa, Somalia lies adjacent to the Bab al-Mandeb passage connecting the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and the wider Indian Ocean. A substantial share of global maritime trade and energy shipments passes through this corridor. Disruptions along Somalia’s coast, therefore, have immediate implications for shipping reliability, energy markets, and food security — issues of direct concern to Gulf states and Arab economies.</p><p data-start=\"1800\" data-end=\"2188\">For the Arab world, Somalia should be understood not as distant terrain but as a front-line partner in regional security. Stability along Somalia’s coastline helps contain threats before they reach the Arabian Peninsula, whether in the form of violent extremism, illicit trafficking networks, piracy, or the entrenchment of hostile external military presences along Africa’s eastern flank.</p><p data-start=\"2190\" data-end=\"2814\">Somalia is not attempting to build stability from scratch. Despite persistent challenges, tangible progress has been made. Federal governance structures are functioning. National security forces are undergoing professionalisation. Public financial management has improved. Diplomatically, Somalia has reasserted itself within the Arab League, the African Union, and multilateral forums. These gains continue to be built on daily and reflect a clear commitment to sovereign statehood, territorial unity, and partnership rather than dependency. Somalia today seeks strategic alignment grounded in mutual interest, not charity.</p><p data-start=\"2816\" data-end=\"3174\">Somalia’s relevance also extends beyond security. Its membership in the East African Community integrates the country into one of the world’s fastest-growing population and consumer regions. East Africa’s rapid demographic expansion, urbanisation, and economic integration position Somalia as a natural bridge between Gulf capital and African growth markets.</p><p data-start=\"3176\" data-end=\"3570\">There is a clear opportunity for Somalia to emerge as a logistics and transshipment gateway linking the Gulf, the Red Sea, East Africa and the Indian Ocean. With targeted investments in ports, transport corridors, and maritime security, Somalia can become a critical node in regional supply chains supporting trade diversification, food security, and economic resilience across the Arab world.</p><p data-start=\"3572\" data-end=\"4083\">At the heart of Somalia’s potential is its dynamic population. More than 70 percent of Somalis are aged below 30. This generation is increasingly urban, digitally connected, and entrepreneurial. Somali traders and business networks already operate across Southern and Eastern Africa, spanning logistics, finance, retail, and services. A large and dynamic diaspora across the Gulf, Europe, North America, and Africa further amplifies this reach through remittances, investment, and transnational expertise.</p><p data-start=\"4085\" data-end=\"4297\">None of these momentums, however, can be sustained without security. A capable, nationally legitimate Somali security sector is the foundation for durable stability, investment confidence, and regional integration.</p><p data-start=\"4299\" data-end=\"4925\">For Gulf states and the wider Arab world, supporting Somalia’s security sector is therefore not an act of altruism. It is a strategic investment in a reliable stabilising partner. Effective Somali security institutions contribute directly to safeguarding Red Sea and Gulf of Aden maritime corridors, countering transnational terrorism before it reaches Arab shores, protecting emerging logistics infrastructure, and denying external actors opportunities to exploit governance vacuums. Such support must prioritise institution-building, Somali ownership, and long-term sustainability, not short-term fixes or proxy competition.</p><p data-start=\"4927\" data-end=\"5180\">The stakes are rising. The Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are entering a period of heightened strategic contestation. Fragmentation along their African coastline poses a direct risk to Arab collective security. Recent developments underscore this urgency.</p><p data-start=\"5182\" data-end=\"5517\">Israel’s unilateral recognition of the northern Somali region of Somaliland, pursued outside international legal frameworks and without Somali consent, is widely viewed as an attempt to secure a military foothold along these strategic waters, risking the introduction of the Arab-Israeli conflict into the Gulf’s security environment.</p><p data-start=\"5519\" data-end=\"5939\">Even more troubling are emerging narratives advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, with proposals to relocate them to Somaliland against their will. Such ideas, whether formally advanced or not, represent grave violations of international law and human dignity. Exporting the consequences of occupation and war onto African soil would not resolve conflict; it would multiply it.</p><p data-start=\"5941\" data-end=\"6320\">For the Arab world, this should serve as a wake-up call. Allowing external actors to fragment sovereign states or instrumentalise fragile regions for unresolved conflicts carries long-term consequences. Somalia’s unity and stability, therefore, align squarely with core Arab strategic interests and with longstanding Arab positions on sovereignty, justice and self-determination.</p><p data-start=\"6322\" data-end=\"6620\">Somalia is ready to be part of the solution. With calibrated strategic support, particularly in security sector development and logistics infrastructure, Somalia can emerge as a cornerstone of Red Sea and Gulf of Aden stability, a gateway to East Africa, and a long-term partner for the Arab world.</p><p data-start=\"6622\" data-end=\"6814\">The question is no longer whether Somalia matters in the regional and global Red Sea and Gulf of Aden discussions and plans. It is whether the region will act on that reality before others do.</p><p data-start=\"6622\" data-end=\"6814\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
