Now at 1.6 percent, the monthly rate is among the lowest since April 2020.</p>\n<p>Back in 2023, high inflation put a great strain on Argentina’s population, with prices of basic goods – such as food, services and rent — escalating month on month while salaries stayed stagnant.</p>\n<p>Argentina has a history of high inflation going back to the 1940s, including several cycles of hyperinflation, the most recent in the late 1980s, pointed out Mariana Heredia, a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Conicet).</p>\n<p>“Inflation is a global phenomenon, but in Argentina, it has been such a constant that people tend to think that all their problems are related to inflation. For people here, stability is very important,” Heredia told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why the promise to tackle inflation helped Milei garner significant support on his way to the presidency. He now says achieving the lower rate is evidence of the success of his economic programme, which made radical cuts to public spending, including in healthcare, <a href=\"/news/2024/10/3/defying-protesters-argentinas-milei-shoots-down-university-funding-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">education</a>, social services and public infrastructure works, to achieve a fiscal surplus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857228\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857228\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-2.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468217.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857228\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-2.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468217.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857228\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Despite a drastic cut in inflation, Argentina continues to be one of the most expensive countries on the continent [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But his programme has also involved an early nominal devaluation, which then saw the Argentian peso appreciate, making the country more expensive in dollars. This, combined with a sharp fall in real wages, has delivered a significant blow to the purchasing power of large sections of the population.</p>\n<p>Argentina is now among the most expensive countries in Latin America, but it also has some of the lowest salaries.</p>\n<p>While tackling inflation was essential to start fixing Argentina’s ailing economy, it’s proving not to be enough, experts say.</p>\n<p>“Inflation isn’t everything,” Guido Zack, economy director at Fundar, a national think tank, told Al Jazeera. “Having a low inflation rate is important, but [in Argentina] the economic recovery has been very mixed among sectors of the economy and of the population. The majority of the population still has a low purchasing power, the rate of informal work has risen, and the poverty rate is still very high. There’s still a long way to go.”</p>\n<p>Other analysts have criticised aspects of the methodology used to calculate inflation in Argentina. They say the basket of goods and services used to measure it, developed in 2004 and updated in 2016, does not accurately reflect current consumption patterns. This includes the share of income that goes into paying for housing, which rose in the renter-dense greater Buenos Aires area by 4.5 percent in June alone. According to a September poll from Inquilinos Agrupados (Organised Renters), which surveys tenants twice a year, renters spend an average of 44.5 percent of their income on rent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"economic-stress\">‘Economic Stress’</h2>\n<p>The mismatch between some economic indicators and what people are experiencing in their daily lives is what the Observatory of Social Debt of the Catholic University of Argentina has called “economic stress” — the increased perception, or reality, that most salaries are not enough to cover basic living expenses.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857236\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857236\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-3.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468571.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857236\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-3.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468571.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Argentinians are taking loans to pay for food [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This is particularly evident in the country’s increasing rate of personal borrowing. According to a recent report by the Social and Economic Statistics and Tendencies Institute (Instituto de Estadísticas y Tendencias Sociales y Economicas – IETSE), 91 percent of homes in Argentina have some form of debt, and 58 percent of those loans were taken to buy food in 2024.</p>\n<p>“Sales have slowed right down in recent months,” Martinez, the butcher, said. “People are always looking for discounts, buy smaller quantities, maybe for the day, and tend to pay with credit card; it’s hard to find anyone paying in cash.”</p>\n<p>People’s frustration at the economy is also evident on the streets of Buenos Aires, where protests against inflation and cuts to public funding – mostly led by pensioners – have increased.</p>\n<p>Every Wednesday, pensioners gather in front of Congress in Buenos Aires to demand a rise in their state pensions. The current pension for five million people stands at $300 a month, below the minimum living wage. Milei has promised to veto a bill approved by Congress for a rise in pensions.</p>\n<p>Raul Maldonado, 68, retired in 2020 after working as a lathe operator in a factory for 35 years. He now makes just more than the minimum pension.</p>\n<p>“The money I earn lasts 15 days. If it wasn’t for the help of my family, I would not be able to survive,” he says.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857253\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857253\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pensioners-protesting-in-Argentina-Josefina-Salomon-1753468818.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857253\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pensioners-protesting-in-Argentina-Josefina-Salomon-1753468818.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C475&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pensioners protesting in Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pensioners protesting in Buenos Aires in Argentina [Josefina Salomon]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-long-game\">The long game</h2>\n<p>As Milei promises to continue pushing through with his current economic plan, the question is whether he can keep inflation down and adopt measures to improve other indicators.</p>\n<p>Heredia says that the type of anti-inflationary programme, focused on cuts to public spending and an appreciated currency, is similar to others implemented in Argentina in the past, but which failed to work in the long run.</p>\n<p>“At first, these kinds of programmes can bring people some initial relief – they generate some economic bounce back and, to a certain extent, an increased income to some high-earning sectors. But in the midterm, the costs start to show when it comes to the public spending cuts, the opening of the economy to imports that affect local production and its impact on the job market.”</p>\n<p>For Zack, the key to the long-term economic recovery is the adoption of measures aimed at improving some of the structural challenges Argentina faces, which have a negative impact on the economy.</p>\n<p>Among them, he lists the country’s complex tax system, high levels of bureaucracy, the current lack of investment in public infrastructure, such as roads to connect the country, as well as the low exchange rate and openness to imports.</p>\n<p>“Even if Argentina manages to sustain low inflation, that’s a complicated cocktail” to tackle, Zack said.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Some immigrants have said they faced floodwater, poor sanitation, clogged toilets and clouds of mosquitoes as they stayed in fenced-in units where the lights were never dimmed.</p>\n<p>Environmental groups and Indigenous members of the local Seminole and Miccosukee tribes have also criticised the facility for its location in the middle of the Everglades wetlands, a sensitive ecosystem prone to seasonal flooding.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"utilising-an-old-airfield\">Utilising an old airfield</h2>\n<p>Built across eight days in June, Alligator Alcatraz sits atop the site of the former Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida.</p>\n<p>That set-up has been a benefit for plans to also use the facility for deportation flights, DeSantis said on Friday. He described transferring immigrants from their detention cells to planes with relative ease.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons why this was a sensible spot is because you have this runway that’s right here,” DeSantis explained.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to drive them an hour to an airport. You go a couple thousand feet, and they can be on a plane and out of here.”</p>\n<p>He added that the site already has runway lighting and 18,927 litres — or 5,000 gallons — of jet fuel on site. That, he hopes, will help pave the way for the number of deportation flights to increase in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“ The cadence is increasing,” DeSantis said. “We’ve already had a number of flights in the last few days.”</p>\n<p>Alligator Alcatraz — named for a forbidding island prison in the San Francisco Bay that closed in the 1960s — has the capacity to hold up to 3,000 people, according to Florida officials.</p>\n<p>DeSantis has long positioned Florida as the “blueprint” for what Republican leadership in the US could look like, and in 2023, he launched a <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/ron-desantis-files-paperwork-for-us-presidential-campaign\">short-lived presidential campaign</a> to challenge Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"increasing-the-pace\">Increasing the pace</h2>\n<p>In his remarks on Friday, DeSantis briefly acknowledged the shortcomings in Trump’s mass-deportation plans, playing up the efficiency of the Alligator Alcatraz system.</p>\n<p>“ICE has been understaffed — you know, is not scratching the surface of what would need to be done to get to where you have the largest mass deportation in history,” he said.</p>\n<p>“So you’ve got to increase that tempo. You have a limited amount of time to do it. I think we’ve got to assume we’ve got these four years under the Trump administration to really get the job done.”</p>\n<p>DeSantis also brushed aside concerns that the isolated facility cuts immigrants off from their legal representation and their right to be heard before a court.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that he plans to have immigration judges on site. But he also questioned whether undocumented people should be allowed the same due process rights as US citizens and immigrants with legal status.</p>\n<p>“To me, it’s like, if you are subjected to a traditional criminal process, there’s a whole a bunch of due process that goes into that,” DeSantis said.</p>\n<p>By contrast, DeSantis argued that the immigration process “should be a pretty simple process. You either have a right to be here or you don’t.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population.”</p>\n<p>Macron’s announcement drew the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/25/us-israel-condemn-frances-move-to-recognise-palestinian-state\">ire of Israeli leaders</a>, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said the move “rewards terror”.</p>\n<p>But Netanyahu has faced widespread condemnation for Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 59,000 Palestinians since it began in October 2023.</p>\n<p>Israel’s blockade of the enclave has caused a deepening humanitarian crisis, with the United Nations and top human rights groups reporting that many Palestinian children are now suffering from severe malnutrition and at risk of death.</p>\n<p>In a statement on Friday, Starmer said “the appalling scenes in Gaza are unrelenting”.</p>\n<p>“The continued captivity of hostages, the starvation and denial of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people, the increasing violence from extremist settler groups, and Israel’s disproportionate military escalation in Gaza are all indefensible,” he said.</p>\n<p>But Starmer stopped short of announcing plans to recognise a Palestinian state, instead saying he was working “on a pathway to peace in the region”.</p>\n<p>“That pathway will set out the concrete steps needed to turn the ceasefire so desperately needed, into a lasting peace,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Recognition of a Palestinian state has to be one of those steps. I am unequivocal about that. But it must be part of a wider plan which ultimately results in a two-state solution and lasting security for Palestinians and Israelis.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Reporting from a protest outside Starmer’s residence in London on Friday afternoon, Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic said demonstrators expressed “outrage” at the British government’s stance amid the dire situation in Gaza.</p>\n<p>“Many of them feel powerless, so one of the only things they can do is gather here, make as much noise as they can, and hope that it will be noticed by the people in power,” she said.</p>\n<p>“They want Keir Starmer to do more with the power that he has, and with the influence that he has, to put an end to this.”</p>\n<p>In addition to recognising a Palestinian state, the British government has faced growing calls to sanction Israel and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/4/pro-palestine-protesters-in-uk-call-for-israel-arms-embargo-sanctions\">impose an arms embargo</a> against the country.</p>\n<p>Veselinovic said Starmer is in “a difficult diplomatic situation” as he prepares to meet United States President <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/us-doctors-veterans-urge-trump-to-end-israel-support-as-hunger-grips-gaza\">Donald Trump</a>, who was travelling to Scotland on Friday.</p>\n<p>She explained that Macron’s announcement added pressure on the UK, which is a close ally of both France and the US, to also recognise a Palestinian state, but noted that Trump has criticised the French president’s move.</p>\n<p>“It does seem like a gulf is emerging here over what the European stance is overall, which is much more aligned with what UN aid agencies are saying is going on on the ground in Gaza, and the American position, which seems to nearly 100 percent back whatever is the Israeli government’s version of events is,” she said.</p>\n<p>“And in the middle of that is Keir Starmer, who wants to maintain good relations with both sides.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Full-year sales, earlier seen up to 5 percent higher, are expected to be level with the previous year.</p>\n<p>Investors had largely anticipated a guidance cut after the company held off on assessing the damage from tariffs in the previous quarter and appeared calmed by assurances that the group’s luxury brands Audi and Porsche would recover next year after heavy losses in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>CEO Oliver Blume told investors the company must accelerate its cost-cutting efforts in response to the tariffs.</p>\n<p>“We need to shift our cost efforts into high gear and accelerate implementation. After all, we cannot assume that the tariff situation is only temporary,” Blume said.</p>\n<p>Global carmakers have booked billions of dollars in losses and some have issued profit warnings due to US tariffs. The European industry is also facing <a href=\"/video/counting-the-cost/2025/7/24/china-v-eu-the-fight-for-europes-electric-vehicle-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stiffening competition from China</a> and domestic regulations aimed at speeding up the electric vehicle transition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tariff-hit\">Tariff hit</h2>\n<p>Volkswagen is the third automaker this week to report a hit to their profits because of tariffs. Michigan-based <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/22/general-motors-reports-a-35-profit-drop-as-tariffs-weigh-on-car-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">General Motors reported that tariffs</a> cost it $1.1bn in the second quarter. Stellantis, the maker of brands including Jeep and Fiat, reported a $2.7bn loss for the first six months of 2025.</p>\n<p>VW and its competitors are pressing European trade negotiators to strike a deal to <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/27/trump-threatens-25-tariffs-on-eu-claims-bloc-was-formed-to-screw-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce a 25 percent</a> US tariff they have faced since April.</p>\n<p>EU diplomats have indicated that the bloc could be moving towards a broad 15 percent tariff as it seeks to avoid a threatened 30 percent levy from August 1. A deal struck between the US and Japan this week raised hopes for a similar agreement for Europe, boosting carmakers’ shares.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>VW finance chief Arno Antlitz said Volkswagen’s profit margin would land roughly in the middle of its guidance with a Japan-style deal, which had a 15 percent tariff rate.</p>\n<p>He warned, however, that the clock was ticking on finding a deal. “We are already in July, so the longer we go into the second half of the year, the more we tend to the lower end of the guidance,” he said.</p>\n<p>Antlitz declined to comment on price increases when pressed by investors on how the company planned to protect its margins against tariffs.</p>\n<p>Volkswagen reported an operating profit of $4.4bn (3.8 billion euros) in the quarter ended June 30, down 29 percent on the previous year. It cited tariffs and restructuring costs for the decline as well as higher sales of lower-margin all-electric models.</p>\n<p>While Volkswagen was able to boost deliveries globally by 1.5 percent in the first six months of 2025, the group saw a decline of almost 10 percent in deliveries to the US.</p>\n<p>North American sales revenue accounted for 18.5 percent of the carmaker’s global sales in the first half.</p>\n<p>Car sales data for June highlighted a broader slowdown in Europe’s struggling auto sector – and showed Volkswagen among the laggards as the company undergoes a major overhaul to cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>Porsche and Audi are particularly exposed to US tariffs given they have no production there and rely heavily on exports.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, Porsche’s operating result plunged by more than 90 percent to 154 million euros ($181m) and Audi’s by 64 percent to 550 million euros ($647m).</p>\n<p>“For both companies, Audi and Porsche, we are expecting that we will touch the bottom this year with positive momentum from 2026 onwards,” Blume said.</p>\n<p>Despite the losses, VW’s stock is on the upswing. As of noon in New York (16:00 GMT), it was up more than 3 percent since the market opened and up more than 12 percent over the last five days in trading.</p>\n<p>The stocks of other carmakers that also reported tariff hits are trending upwards. Stellantis is up 3.9 percent for the day. GM is about even – up by only about 0.2 percent.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Figures show that prisons in Eswatini <a href=\"https://www.prisonstudies.org/country/eswatiniswaziland\">operate</a> at more than 170 percent of their capacity.</p>\n<p>Civil society groups – including the Southern Africa Litigation Centre, the Swaziland Rural Women’s Assembly and other regional NGOs – have threatened legal proceedings against the Eswatini government over its acceptance of the five convicted criminals.</p>\n<p>They argued that the detentions violate Eswatini’s own Correctional Services Act and other domestic laws and said there is no lawful basis for imprisoning foreign nationals who lack legal ties to the country.</p>\n<p>Chris Ogunmodede, a foreign affairs analyst familiar with African diplomatic circles, said there are several questions hovering over the agreement made with the Trump administration. These range from the legal justification used to authorise the deportees’ transfers, whether the men were informed and given consular access, the duration of their detentions and the terms of the arrangement with the US.</p>\n<p>He added that Eswatini and South Sudan are “smaller economies with no geopolitical weight” on which White House officials could easily “impose their will”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-the-eswatini-government-say\">What does the Eswatini government say?</h2>\n<p>In a public statement, Mdluli said the government assured the people of the kingdom that the arrival of five third-country deportees from the US “poses no security threat to the Nation”.</p>\n<p><span>It stated that the five prisoners would be housed in correctional facilities within isolated units “where similar offenders are kept”.</span></p>\n<p>Addressing the bilateral discussions with the White House, she said the “engagements considered every avenue, including rigorous risk assessments and careful consideration for the safety and security of citizens”.</p>\n<h2>Which other African nations does Trump hope to negotiate deportation deals with?</h2>\n<p>In addition to Eswatini and South Sudan, Trump has discussed third-country deportation deals with the leaders of Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon during a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/white-house-hosts-west-african-leaders-to-discuss-trade-and-development\">summit</a> at the White House this month.</p>\n<p>Trump reportedly discussed migration, including the need for countries to accept the return of their nationals who do not have the right to stay in the US and the possibility of accepting deported citizens of third countries.</p>\n<p>Tom Homan, Trump’s border tsar, said the Trump administration hoped to forge deals with “many countries” to accept deported migrants.</p>\n<p>“If there is a significant public threat or national security threat, there’s one thing for sure: They’re not walking the streets of this country. We’ll find a third, safe nation to send them to, and we’re doing it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rwanda has confirmed it is in talks with the Trump administration for a similar deal while Nigeria said it had rejected pressure to make an agreement.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3856959\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3856959\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3856959\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-09T171226Z_1209385826_RC25JFAKK13F_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1753454932.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"summit\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3856959\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump hosts a summit of African leaders from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal at the White House in Washington, DC, on July 9, 2025 [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"which-other-countries-have-considered-a-third-country-deportation-policy\">Which other countries have considered a third-country deportation policy?</h2>\n<h2 id=\"united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</h2>\n<p>The UK has explored third-country deportation policies as part of its efforts to manage irregular migration and asylum claims. Under the previous Conservative government, the UK partnered with Rwanda in 2022 and planned to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing with the UK committing 370 million pounds ($497m) in development funding over five years in exchange.</p>\n<p>The plan was first struck down by the UK Supreme Court in November 2023 for violating international human rights norms, given Rwanda’s inadequate asylum system and human rights concerns. In response, the government enacted the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024, which declared Rwanda a “safe country” and limited legal challenges to the policy.</p>\n<p>After the Labour Party’s victory in the July 2024 elections, Prime Minister Keir Starmer swiftly terminated the Rwanda scheme.</p>\n<p>However, in May, Starmer said he was talking to “a number of countries” about “return hubs”, where undocumented immigrants could be sent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"israel\">Israel</h2>\n<p>Similarly, Israel implemented a third-country deportation arrangement targeting African asylum seekers by sending them to countries like Rwanda and Uganda from 2013 to 2018.</p>\n<p>The government offered $3,500 per person to those agreeing to leave.</p>\n<p>In 2018, however, Israel’s Supreme Court in effect dismantled the policy, ruling it unlawful in part due to the receiving countries’ failure to guarantee protections and uphold international obligations under the Refugee Convention.</p>\n<p>Ogunmodede said the UK’s and Israel’s deals with African nations amounted to the “outsourcing of the migration problem”.</p>\n<p>He added that now, the US under the Trump administration is “using a carrot and stick approach to getting countries around the world to comply with the things that they want”.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

In it, they concluded that “there is no indication of a Russian threat to directly manipulate the actual vote count through cyber means.”</p>\n<p>Gabbard said in a statement that the Obama administration went ahead with investigating Russian interference after Trump won the 2016 elections, despite that initial conclusion and despite intelligence agencies like the CIA stating in advance of the vote that Russia could not affect the vote count. Those efforts were made to “subvert the will of the American people” and amounted to a “years-long coup” against Trump, she said.</p>\n<p>President Trump, on Tuesday, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/donald-trump-accuses-barack-obama-of-treason-over-2016-election-claims\">accused</a> Obama and top officials of his administration of treason. “It’s time to go after people,” he said.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3454657\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3454657\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3454657\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP25020643118619-1737398780.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 47th president\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3454657\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From left, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President George W Bush, former First Lady Laura Bush and former President Barack Obama, arrive before the 60th Presidential Inauguration in the Rotunda of the US Capitol in Washington, on Monday, January 20, 2025 [Chip Somodevilla/AP]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"are-tulsi-s-claims-correct\">Are Tulsi’s claims correct?</h2>\n<p>Analysts say the report that Gabbard released on Wednesday, as well as the documents declassified last week, do not appear to provide evidence that Russia did not interfere in the elections to favour Trump, or that Obama ordered the investigation to reach a pre-determined conclusion.</p>\n<p>Responding to Gabbard’s claims that the Obama White House ordered an investigation into the matter despite US intelligence agencies repeatedly assessing that foreign adversaries could not launch cyber attacks on the elections, Perry of the Miller Center said there was a valid reason for Obama’s delayed order.</p>\n<p>“There was suspicion on the part of the White House that Russia was interfering with the election, but the Obama administration did not take direct action to prove its suspicion until after the election for fear of being accused by Trump of interfering in it on Clinton’s behalf,” Perry said.</p>\n<p>At the time, during the 2016 election campaign, Trump had repeatedly predicted at rallies that he might lose the vote because Democrats wanted to “steal the election”. That atmosphere may have discouraged the Obama administration from doing anything until after the vote, Perry added.</p>\n<p>In addition, the documents Gabbard released from Obama officials do not appear to contradict the established conclusions of Russian interference, analysts say.</p>\n<p>Obama officials did not allege that vote counts had been manipulated, but rather that Russian hackers had launched covert digital operations aimed at sowing discord in the US during the vote, including by leaking emails of top Democrats, such as Clinton, and trying to influence opinion on social media using “bots”.</p>\n<p>The Senate Intelligence Committee report that Gabbard released, in which she hoped to undermine the Obama-era investigations into Russian interference, affirmed that position, although it blamed Obama administration officials for concluding that Russia interfered specifically to favour Trump.</p>\n<p>Overall, experts say, Gabbard’s claims are unlikely to get far.</p>\n<p>Heather Hurlburt, associate fellow on the Americas Programme at London-based think tank Chatham House, said: “A 2020 Senate investigation – when Republicans controlled the Senate – corroborated the intelligence agencies’ findings about tactics Russia used to try to sway the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>“Gabbard’s latest accusations don’t introduce any new information.

The matter is one of the most extensively scrutinised in US election history. Russia, for its part, has <a href=\"/news/2021/3/17/russia-calls-us-intel-report-on-election-meddling-baseless\">denied the allegations</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump and his allies frequently refer to the investigations as a “hoax” because they also attempted to examine links between Trump, his associates, and Russian operatives.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, two months after the election, US intelligence agencies initially concluded that Russia had been responsible for cyberattacks on the email accounts of top Democrats, and for sowing discord on social media, using bots and trolls. The CIA said that the Kremlin orchestrated and codenamed the operation Project Lakhta.</p>\n<p>FBI investigations also focused on individual Trump officials, such as George Papadoulous, who was <a href=\"/news/2018/9/7/ex-trump-campaign-aide-george-papadopoulos-jailed-for-14-days\">indicted</a> for providing false statements to the FBI regarding his relations with Russians.</p>\n<p>Papadoulous was found to have known about the Russian operation, but there was no evidence that he had shared that information with the Trump campaign.</p>\n<p>During Trump’s first presidency, the Justice Department probed the conduct of the intelligence agencies regarding the investigations and found that there had been no “political bias” involved.</p>\n<p>The most followed <a href=\"/news/2019/3/23/muellers-trump-russia-investigation-who-are-the-key-players\">report</a> was released by special counsel Robert Mueller in 2019. It concluded that the “Russian government interfered in the 2016 election in a sweeping and systematic fashion” through social media campaigns that favoured Trump, because Moscow assessed that it would benefit from a Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>The operations sought to damage Clinton’s image by hacking into email accounts of members of the Clinton campaign and leaking them to the public, the report stated.

The trade balance officially flipped negative – which means imports outnumber exports – in 2022 and has remained so since then.</p>\n<p>But industry experts caution that US ice cream imports account for a minuscule fraction of all the US ice cream consumed in the US, and exports account for a tiny fraction of all US ice cream produced.</p>\n<p>The trade change was driven mostly by a jump in imports. Exports have remained largely unchanged since 2020.</p>\n<p>And the cherry on top? Disagreement over which products to classify as “ice cream” also affects data, experts say. For example, the data referenced by the office of the US Trade Representative also includes “edible ice”, which some experts (and dairy defenders) say doesn’t qualify as ice cream.</p>\n<p>Removing edible ice shows that “the US is a net exporter by a significant margin of ($193 million) or +85% larger by value,” International Dairy Foods Association Executive Vice President Matt Herrick told PolitiFact via email.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ice-cream-imports-increase-causes-us-trade-deficit\">Ice cream imports increase causes US trade deficit</h2>\n<p>From 1995 to 2020, the US had an ice cream trade surplus, ranging from about $20m to about $160m, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, an online economic data platform. Longtime customers include Mexico, followed by Saudi Arabia and Canada.</p>\n<p>In 2021, that surplus nearly vanished, and in 2022 and 2023, the US notched up an ice cream trade deficit of $92m and $33m, respectively.</p>\n<p>At first glance, importing frozen foods doesn’t seem practical.</p>\n<p>“Shipping refrigerated and frozen products overseas is expensive,” dairy economist Betty Berningat of HighGround Dairy said. “Mexico is the top destination for US dairy exports.”</p>\n<p>But many US and European companies have tapped into global markets.</p>\n<p>“Consumers may also want a specific treat that is styled after or known to be from another country,” Herrick said.</p>\n<p>Italy, the birthplace of gelato, is now the United States’ largest single source of imported ice cream. Italian ice cream imports more than quintupled from about $12m to almost $65m between 2020 and 2021 alone, before decreasing somewhat in 2023, the last year for which data is available.</p>\n<p>Some of this stems from increased consumer demand for specialty pints. A report by Mordor Intelligence, a global market research firm, said “product innovation and premiumisation” have become key in the US ice cream industry.</p>\n<p>“This trend is particularly evident in the growth of premium pint offerings and individually wrapped novelties that cater to both indulgence and portion control preferences,” the report said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-us-produces-far-more-ice-cream-than-it-imports-or-exports\">The US produces far more ice cream than it imports or exports</h2>\n<p>To get to the pint: The vast majority of ice cream consumed in the United States is made there, not overseas.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration is cherry-picking stats from a fraction of a sliver of the US ice cream industry.</p>\n<p>According to US Agriculture Department data, US ice cream makers churned out 1.31 billion gallons of ice cream in 2024. This includes regular ice cream, low-fat and nonfat ice cream, sherbet and frozen yoghurt.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the US imported 2.35 million gallons of traditional ice cream in 2024 – that’s 0.18 percent of the amount produced domestically, Herrick said.</p>\n<p>The US exported 16.4 million gallons of that domestic production, which is also a tiny fraction of 1.31 billion gallons of ice cream – a little more than 1 percent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"factoring-in-ice-cream-mixes-excluding-edible-ice-products\">Factoring in ice cream mixes, excluding ‘edible ice’ products</h2>\n<p>Another caveat about the international trade data: It does not include “mixes”, which skews the totals, said Herrick of the International Dairy Foods Association.</p>\n<p>Mixes are used to make ice cream shakes and soft-serve products, and they account for a significant portion of US ice cream exports. “Inclusion of such data points would change the picture quite significantly,” said Herrick. “While it is true that traditional ice cream and edible ice exports have seen decreased exports, the same cannot be said for exports of mixes.”</p>\n<p>US milk-based drink exports increased 621 percent over the past five years, he said. In 2024, the US exported nearly $35m in mixes to the European Union.</p>\n<h2 id=\"americans-and-dairy-based-ice-cream-a-centuries-old-love-affair-melting-away\">Americans and dairy-based ice cream: A centuries-old love affair melting away?</h2>\n<p>The White House has churned out plenty of ice cream devotees.</p>\n<p>George Washington stocked the capital with ice cream-making equipment. Thomas Jefferson is credited as being the first American to record an ice cream recipe. Ronald Reagan declared July National Ice Cream Month in 1984. Barack Obama even slung scoops back in the day.</p>\n<p>Biden, who was often sighted with a cone in hand, proclaimed while visiting Jeni’s Splendid Ice Cream headquarters in 2016: “My name is Joe Biden, and I love ice cream.”</p>\n<p>But consumption of regular dairy ice cream – a category that does not include frozen yoghurt, sherbet or nonfat and low-fat ice creams – has been trending down for years.</p>\n<p>In 1975, Americans ate an average of 18.2 pounds each of ice cream per year. That figure fell to 11.7 pounds by 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2>\n<p>The office of the US Trade Representative purported a summertime scoop: “America had a trade surplus in ice cream in 2020 under President Trump’s leadership, but that surplus turned into a trade deficit of $40.6 million under President Biden’s watch.”</p>\n<p>It’s accurate that the US ice cream trade balance had a surplus for a quarter of a century before turning negative while Biden was president.</p>\n<p>But the US Trade Representative’s statement makes the US ice cream deficit appear out of cone-trol.</p>\n<p>There are three scoops of context on this trade sundae:</p>\n<p>The change was driven mostly by a jump in imports. Exports have remained largely unchanged since 2020.</p>\n<p>US ice cream imports and exports are a negligible amount compared to domestic production.</p>\n<p>There’s also disagreement over which products should or shouldn’t be included in the data set, which can skew trend interpretations. Excluding edible ice products and factoring in ice cream mixes leaves the US with a surplus.</p>\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs a sprinkling of clarification and additional details, so we rate it <strong>Mostly True</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Louis Jacobson contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The US buys 16 percent of that, making it Brazil’s biggest coffee customer. Experts warn the tariff will hurt competitiveness, especially for family farmers who produce two-thirds of Brazil’s coffee and have fewer resources to weather downturns or shift to new markets.</p>\n<p data-start=\"926\" data-end=\"1199\">Last year’s climate change-driven drought already devastated crops. Now, falling arabica prices, down 33 percent since February, are compounding losses. “We struggle for years, and suddenly we might lose everything,” said da Silva, who grows 40,000 trees and other crops to survive.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1201\" data-end=\"1471\">Nearby in Varre-Sai, Paulo Menezes Freitas, another smallholder with 35,000 trees, fears he may be forced to abandon coffee farming. He says the tariff also affects essential imports like machinery and aluminium. “It feels like the ground is crumbling under us,” he said.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1473\" data-end=\"1720\">Despite the blow, Brazil’s coffee exporters remain cautiously optimistic. The Council of Coffee Exporters of Brazil (Cecafe)’s Marcio Ferreira believes US buyers can’t afford to stop importing Brazilian beans.

In 2011, Cambodia again went to the ICJ in relation to the Preah Vihear Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\n<p data-start=\"902\" data-end=\"1091\">The ICJ ruled in Cambodia’s favour and handed it control of the immediate area around the temple in 2013.</p>\n<p data-start=\"902\" data-end=\"1091\">However, the court did not address any of the other disputed areas, especially those within the “Emerald Triangle”, a shared border region between Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, where troops also frequently clash.</p>\n<p data-start=\"902\" data-end=\"1091\">Thailand has refused to acknowledge the ICJ’s jurisdiction in this issue. Tensions have simmered until this year’s acute escalation.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
