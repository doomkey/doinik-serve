id=\"is-trump-specifically-targeting-african-countries-with-visa-bans\">Is Trump specifically targeting African countries with visa bans?</h2><p>Trump’s approach to Africa regarding visa entries in his second term as US president is similar to that of his first administration when he issued a “Muslim ban”, which included citizens of three African nations – Somalia, Sudan and Libya – as well as Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Iran.</p><p>In later updates to the ban, Sudan was removed while Chad was added.</p><p>Most countries under US entry restrictions since Trump took office on January 20 are in Africa. Of the 39 affected countries, 26 are African nations.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-us-africa-trade-relations-fared-under-trump\">How have US-Africa trade relations fared under Trump?</h2><p>Tradewise, the US has shifted away from its preferential African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade programme to a tariff-based regime that has also been applied to most other countries around the world under Trump’s tariffs policy.</p><p>From 2000, AGOA provided African nations with duty-free access to US markets, bolstering African exports to the US of a wide range of goods, from wine to cars.</p><p>AGOA created an estimated 300,000 jobs in African countries and indirectly sustained another 1.2 million jobs, according to the US-based Center for Strategic International Studies.</p><p>However, AGOA expired in September after the US Congress failed to renew it. Although the Trump administration said it supported a one-year extension, no steps have been announced to revive the programme.</p><p>Instead, African countries now face often steep tariffs as the US sometimes justifies them on political grounds.</p><p>South Africa, Africa’s richest country, for example, was <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/trumps-new-tariffs-who-is-hit-whats-next-how-is-the-world-responding-2\">slapped with a 30 percent tariff</a> after Trump made <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/fact-check-do-trumps-white-genocide-claims-to-ramaphosa-hold-up\">debunked allegations of a “genocide”</a> on the country’s white Afrikaner minority. The US government has since <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/trumps-7500-refugee-cap-echoing-restrictive-us-immigration-history\">prioritised resettling Afrikaners</a> as refugees in the US.</p><p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met with Trump at the White House in May and explained that crime in the country targets the population at large – not just its white citizens – but was unable to persuade Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump’s administration is also prioritising its access to critical rare earth minerals, used to develop high-tech devices, in a bid to remain competitive with China, which mines about 60 percent of the world’s rare earth metals and processes 90 percent of them.</p><p>Trump took up a mediator role in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighbouring Rwanda this year after the DRC government proposed a minerals deal with the US. The US and United Nations accuse Rwanda of backing a rebellion by the M23 armed group in the eastern DRC.</p><p>Trump did not commit to US military intervention in the DRC but successfully secured a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/trump-hails-great-day-for-the-world-as-drc-rwanda-finalise-peace-deal\">peace pact</a> between the two countries on December 4 after applying diplomatic pressure on Rwanda.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/over-400-civilians-killed-in-eastern-dr-congo-as-us-peace-deal-falters\">Attacks on civilians</a> by M23 have nonetheless continued despite the peace deal.</p><p>A clause in the pact granted US firms priority access to both the DRC’s and Rwanda’s mineral reserves, which include cobalt, copper, lithium and gold.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4103402\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4103402\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4103402\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25316661702293-1763011536.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"US-South Africa leaders\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4103402\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump, right, meets South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office of the White House on May 21, 2025 [Evan Vucci/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-about-aid-and-security-cooperation\">How about aid and security cooperation?</h2><p>In early 2025, the Trump administration shut down the <a href=\"/news/2025/2/3/what-is-usaid-and-how-central-is-it-to-us-foreign-policy\">US Agency for International Development</a> and <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/27/us-cutting-foreign-aid-budgets-by-more-than-90-trump-administration-says\">cut billions of dollars of US foreign aid</a>, affecting many African countries that greatly depended on the world’s largest funder of health and humanitarian aid.</p><p>Aid groups have since reported rising hunger in <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/malnutrition-in-nigeria-killed-652-children-in-past-six-months-msf-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">northern Nigeria</a>, Somalia and northeastern Kenya.</p><p>Health observers and analysts have also raised the alarm about the risk of undoing work to prevent and contain the spread of HIV in Lesotho and South Africa.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In northern Cameroon, officials have reported a spike in malaria deaths as drug supplies fall. This month, the US unilaterally pledged $400m in health funding to the country over the next five years on the condition that Cameroon raises its own annual health spending from $22m to $450m.</p><p>African nations were also most affected when Trump recalled 30 career diplomats appointed by former President Joe Biden from 29 countries last week.</p><p>Fifteen of them had been stationed in African nations: Algeria, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US has continued to intensify strikes against armed groups linked to ISIL and al-Qaeda, similar to those during Trump’s first term as president from 2017 to 2021.</p><p>In Somalia, the US launched strikes in September targeting al-Shabab and the ISIL affiliate in Somalia Province, according to the US-based New America Foundation think tank.</p><p>The US also targeted ISIL- and al-Qaeda-linked groups <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/us-bombs-target-isil-in-nigeria-whats-really-going-on\">in northwestern Nigeria</a> for the first time on Thursday.</p><p>While those strikes were carried out in collaboration with the Nigerian government, a war of narratives prevailed between the two countries.</p><p>The US claims to be “saving” Nigerian Christians, who it alleges are experiencing a genocide.</p><p>Nigerian authorities, on the other hand, deny claims of genocide and say people of all religions have been badly affected by armed groups operating in the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But, lying on a wet blanket in a tent with <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/israeli-strikes-on-gaza-are-relentless-as-displaced-endure-flooded-camps\">rain pouring down</a>, Sanaa doesn’t have a huge amount to be positive about.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“We didn’t know whether to blame the war, the cold, or the hunger. We’re moving from one crisis to another,” Sanaa told Al Jazeera, describing a harsh year she, and other displaced Palestinians like her, have faced in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Amid worsening humanitarian conditions, the once-ambitious hopes of Palestinians in Gaza, dreams of a better future, prosperity, and reconstruction, are gone. In their place are basic human needs: securing flour, food and water, obtaining tents to shield them from the cold, accessing medical care, and simply surviving bombardments.</p><p>For Palestinians like Sanaa, hope for the new year has been reduced to a daily struggle for survival.</p><p>Sanaa is a 41-year-old mother of seven, who has been solely responsible for raising her children after her husband was killed in an Israeli strike in November 2024, at the end of the first year of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>“Responsibility for the children, displacement, securing food and drink, making tough decisions here and there. Everything was required of me at once,” Sanaa, who fled with her family from al-Bureij to Deir el-Balah, both in central Gaza, said.</p><p>Sanaa’s biggest challenge in 2025 was securing “a loaf of bread” and getting her hands on even a kilogram of flour every day for her family.</p><p>“During the famine, I slept and woke up with one wish: to get enough bread for the day. I felt I was dying while my children were starving before me, and I could do nothing,” she said bitterly.</p><p>The search for flour eventually saw Sanaa decide to go to the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/us-backed-ghf-aid-mission-in-gaza-ends-a-timeline-of-violence\">US-backed GHF</a> aid distribution points that opened at the end of May across Gaza.</p><p>“At first, I was scared and hesitant, but the hunger we live through can force you to do things you never imagined,” Sanaa said, describing her weekly visits to the aid points.</p><p>Visiting the sites, which the US and Israel supported as alternatives to long-established aid organisations, was inherently dangerous. More than 2,000 Palestinians were killed in and around GHF sites, according to the United Nations, before the GHF officially ended its mission in late November.</p><p>But going to the sites wasn’t just a risk to Sanaa’s life, it was a path that “took away her dignity”, leaving lasting scars.</p><p>On one occasion, Sanaa was hit by shrapnel in her arm while waiting for aid at the Netzarim distribution point in central Gaza, and her 17-year-old daughter was injured in the chest at the Morag point east of Rafah.</p><p>But her injuries didn’t stop her from trying again, although she began to go alone, leaving her children behind in relative safety.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207132\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207132\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207132\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A1745-1767205773.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"During the famine, Sana’a’s greatest wish was to provide a loaf of bread for her seven children, amid a six-month-long blockade that prevented food and goods from entering [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4207132\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">During the famine in Gaza, Sana’a’s greatest wish was to provide a loaf of bread for her seven children, amid a six-month-long Israeli blockade that prevented food and goods from entering [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"desperation\">Desperation</h2><p>The war in Gaza led to severe interruptions in food and humanitarian aid, the last of which began in late March 2025, eventually leading to the declaration of a famine. It continued until October 2025, gradually easing after the ceasefire announcement.</p><p>During this period, the United Nations officially declared a state of famine, confirming that parts of Gaza had entered catastrophic hunger stages, with acute shortages in food, water, and medicine, and high rates of malnutrition among children and pregnant women.</p><p>Thousands of residents had to search for food using dangerous methods, including by waiting for long hours at the GHF sites.</p><p>“Hunger lasted a long time; it wasn’t a day or two, so I had to find a solution,” Sanaa said. “Each time, people crowded in their hundreds of thousands. Some would spend the night there, hundreds of thousands of displaced people – men, women, children, old and young.”</p><p>“The scenes were utterly humiliating. Bombing and heavy gunfire on everyone, not to mention the pushing and fighting among people over aid.”</p><p>The crowds meant that Sanaa often returned to her tent empty-handed, but the rare times she brought back a few kilos of flour felt like “a festival”, she recalled.</p><p>“One time, I got five kilos [11 pounds] of flour. I cried with joy returning to my children, who hadn’t tasted bread for days,” she added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207142\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207142\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207142\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A1784-1767206217.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sana’a sits with her children inside their tent, holding on to hope that living conditions will improve in the coming year [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/ Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4207142\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sanaa sits with her children inside their tent, holding on to the hope that living conditions will improve in the coming year [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Sanaa divided the five kilos over two weeks, sometimes mixing it with ground lentils or pasta dough. “We wanted to recite a spell over the flour so it would multiply,” she said with dark humour.</p><p>A heavy silence followed as Sanaa adjusted the plastic tarp over her tent against the strong wind, then said:</p><p>“We witnessed humiliation beyond measure? All this for what? For a loaf of bread!” she added with tearful eyes. “If we were animals, perhaps they would have felt more pity for us.”</p><p>Despite the hardships she has endured and continues to face, Sanaa has not lost hope or her prayers for Gaza’s future.</p><p>“Two years are enough. Each year has been harder than the previous one, and we are still in this spiral,” she added. “We want proper tents to shelter us in winter, a gas cylinder to cook instead of burning wood, we want life and reconstruction.”</p><p>“Our basic rights have become distant wishes at year’s end.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207148\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207148\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207148\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A1950-1767206334.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batoul Abu Shawish, 20, lost her entire family in an Israeli strike that targeted their home in Nuseirat during the ceasefire in November 2025 [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/ Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4207148\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Batoul Abu Shawish, 20, lost her entire family in an Israeli strike that targeted their home in Nuseirat during the ceasefire in November 2025 [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-only-survivor\">The only survivor</h2><p>Sanaa’s husband was one of the more than 71,250 Palestinians killed by Israel during the war.</p><p>Twenty-year-old Batoul Abu Shawish can count her father, mother, two brothers and two sisters – her whole immediate family – among that number.</p><p>Batoul comes into the new year wishing for only one thing: to be with her family.</p><p>Her heartbreaking loss came just a month before the end of the year, on November 22.</p><p>Despite the ceasefire, an Israeli bomb struck the home her family had fled to in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp.</p><p>“I was sitting with my two sisters. My brothers were in their room, my father had just returned from outside, and my mother was preparing food in the kitchen,” she recalled, eyes vacant, describing the day.</p><p>“In an instant, everything turned to darkness and thick dust. I didn’t realise what was happening around me, not even that it was bombing, due to the shock,” Batoul added, as she stood next to the ruins of her destroyed home.</p><p>She was trapped under the debris of the destroyed home for about an hour, unable to move, calling for help from anyone nearby.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe what was happening. I wished I were dead, unaware, trying to escape the thought of what had happened to my family,” Batoul said.</p><p>“I called for them one by one, and there was no sound. My mother, father, siblings, no one.”</p><p>After being rescued, she was found to have severe injuries to her hand and was immediately transferred to hospital.</p><p>“I was placed on a stretcher above extracted bodies, covered in sheets. I panicked and asked my uncle who was with me: ‘Who are these people?’ He said they were from the house next to ours,” she recalled.</p><p>As soon as Batoul arrived at the hospital, she was rushed into emergency surgery on her hand before she could learn about what had happened to her family.</p><p>“I kept asking everyone, ‘Where is my mom? Where is my dad?’ They told me they were fine, just injured in other departments.”</p><p>“I didn’t believe them,” Batoul added, “but I was also afraid to call them liars.”</p><p>The following day, her uncles broke the news to Batoul that she had lost her mother and siblings. Her father, they told her, was still in critical condition in the intensive care unit.</p><p>“They gathered around me, and they were all crying. I understood on my own,” she said.</p><p>“I broke down, crying in disbelief, then said goodbye to them one by one before the funeral.”</p><p>Batoul’s father later succumbed to his injuries three days after the incident, leaving her alone to face her grief.</p><p>“I used to go to the ICU every day and whisper in my father’s ear, asking him to wake up again, for me and for himself, but he was completely unconscious,” Batoul said as she scrolled through photos of her father on her mobile phone.</p><p>“When he died, it felt as if the world had gone completely dark before my eyes.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207152\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207152\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207152\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A2057-1767206534.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batoul holds a photo on her phone showing her with her family, including her father, mother, and siblings Muhammad, Youssef, Tayma, and Habiba [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4207152\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Batoul al-Shawish holds a photo on her phone showing her with her family, including her father, mother, and siblings Muhammad, Youssef, Tayma, and Habiba [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"where-is-the-ceasefire\">‘Where is the ceasefire?’</h2><p>Israel said that it conducted the strikes in Nuseirat in response to an alleged gunman crossing into Israel-held territory in Gaza, although it is unclear why civilian homes in Nuseirat were therefore targeted.</p><p>According to Gaza’s Government Media Office and the Ministry of Health, around 2,613 Palestinian families were completely wiped out during the war on the Gaza Strip up until the announcement of the ceasefire in October 2025.</p><p>Those families had all of their members killed, and their names erased from the civil registry.</p><p>The same figures indicate that approximately 5,943 families were left with only a single surviving member after the rest were killed, an agonising reflection of the scale of social and human loss caused by the war.</p><p>These figures may change as documentation continues and bodies are recovered from beneath the rubble.</p><p>For Batoul, her family was anything but ordinary; they were known for their deep bond and love for one another.</p><p>“My father was deeply attached to my mother and never hid his love for her in front of anyone, and that reflected on all of us.”</p><p>“My mother was my closest friend, and my siblings loved each other beyond words. Our home was full of pleasant surprises and warmth,” she added.</p><p>“Even during the war, we used to sit together, hold family gatherings, and help one another endure so much of what we were going through.”</p><p>The understandable grief that has overtaken Batoul leaves no room for wishes for a new year or talk of a near future, at least for now.</p><p>One question, however, weighs heavily on her: why was her peaceful family targeted, especially during a ceasefire?</p><p>“Where is the ceasefire they talk about? It’s just a lie,” she said.</p><p>“My family and I survived bombardment, two years of war. An apartment next to our home in eastern Nuseirat was hit, and we fled together to here. We lived through hunger, food shortages, and fear together. Then we thought we had survived, that the war was over.”</p><p>“But sadly, they’re gone, and they left me alone.”</p><p>Batoul holds onto one wish from the depths of her heart: to join her family as soon as possible.</p><p>At the same time, she carries an inner resignation that perhaps it is her fate to live this way, like so many others in Gaza who have lost their families.</p><p>“If life is written for me, I will try to fulfil my mother’s dream that I be outstanding in my field and generous to others,” said Batoul, a second-year university student studying multimedia, who is currently living with her uncle and his family.</p><p>“Life without family,” she said, “is living with an amputated heart, in darkness for the rest of your life, and there are so many like that now in Gaza.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207156\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207156\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207156\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A1970-1767206634.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batoul stands in front of the rubble of her destroyed home, where she was trapped for about an hour before being rescued when it was hit [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/ Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4207156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Batoul al-Shawish stands in front of the rubble of her destroyed home, where she was trapped for about an hour before being rescued [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

The vast majority of those killed were men, but the list included 10 women.</p><p>“128 journalists killed in a single year is not just a statistic; it is a global crisis. These deaths are a brutal reminder that journalists are being targeted with impunity, simply for doing their job,” IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger said.</p><p>Palestinian journalists were the biggest cohort of victims: 56 Palestinian media professionals were killed in 2025. Yemen followed, with 13 deaths, Ukraine, with eight, and Sudan, with six, according to the IFJ.</p><p>The Paris-based media union cited Israel’s killing of Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif as the most “emblematic” of the 56 journalists murdered in Palestine last year covering Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Al-Sharif, 28, was killed on August 10 alongside several colleagues when Israeli forces struck a media tent outside Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital.</p><p>The attack also killed Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, Al Jazeera camera operators Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal, freelance camera operator Momen Aliwa and freelance journalist Mohammed al-Khalidi.</p><p>IFJ also cited an Israeli strike in early September on a Yemeni newspaper office as “one of the worst-ever attacks on a media office”. Thirteen journalists and media workers at the Houthi-affiliated “26 September” newspaper were killed, along with more than 20 other people.</p><p>Another nine deaths were ruled as accidents, while others – including two journalists in Syria and two in Iran – were “targeted and killed” because of their work, IFJ said.</p><p>While the Middle East was the deadliest region for the third year in a row in 2025, the Asia Pacific accounted for the largest number of journalists and media workers behind bars. Most cases in 2025 were in China and Hong Kong, which together accounted for 143 journalists, followed by 49 in Myanmar and 37 in Vietnam.</p><p>Europe was another detention hotspot last year, accounting for 149 imprisoned journalists.

The edition is neither signed nor dated, but its “minute naskh script and its binding, featuring a gilt-stamped medallion filled with a floral composition, suggest it was produced in Ottoman Syria in the 19th century”, the library added.</p><p>“The significance of this Quran extends far beyond the beauty of its pages,” said Hiba Abid, curator of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. “It is a Quran close to the people, not only because of its simple craftsmanship, but also because it is part of the collections of the nation’s largest public library system.”</p><p>Anthony W Marx, the library’s president and CEO, said the choice of Quran and its association with Schomburg “symbolises a greater story of inclusion, representation, and civic-mindedness”.</p><p>Mamdani is one of only a handful of US politicians to be sworn in with the Quran. New York does not require mayors to take the oath of office with their hand on a religious text, but many past mayors have used a copy of the Bible.</p><p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg used a 100-year-old family Bible during one ceremony, while Mayor Bill de Blasio used a Bible that once belonged to US President Franklin D Roosevelt.

The Jamaat coalition includes the National Citizen Party, launched by many of the youth leaders who drove the July 2024 mass movement that forced Hasina out of power and into exile in India.</p><p>“This will not be easy for BNP,” Ahmed said. “Post-July [2024] politics has changed the equation. New polarisation is emerging, and the dominance of two parties no longer holds,” he added.</p><p>Analysts also point to key uncertainties that linger: whether the election will be held on time, whether it will be peaceful, and whether major parties can ensure public confidence in the process.</p><p>Dilara Choudhury, a political scientist who observed both Khaleda and her husband closely, said Khaleda Zia functioned as a “guardian figure” for not just her party, but also the country, and that her death represents the loss of a senior stabilising presence in Bangladesh politics.</p><p>Tarique, Khaleda’s son, was in exile in the United Kingdom from 2008 until December 25, 2025, when he returned after a series of cases against him that were initiated by a military-backed government in power between 2006 and 2009, or by the subsequent Hasina government, were closed.</p><p>She argued that Tarique’s return to the country has reduced fears of internal division within the party and that his recent speeches – reaffirming Bangladeshi nationalism, rejecting authoritarianism and honouring victims of the 2024 July uprising violence – have reassured party supporters about ideological continuity.</p><p>“BNP and Awami League have both been personality-centred parties,” she said. “After Khaleda Zia, it is natural that Tarique Rahman occupies that space within the BNP.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4207524\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4207524\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4207524\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25365351679198-1767235683.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Thousands of people gather to attend funeral prayers for former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia outside the national Parliament building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025.

That could be a challenge in decision-making. But I believe he will be able to manage.”</p><p>Kamal Uddin travelled with three other BNP activists from Cox’s Bazar, a coastal city on the Bay of Bengal about 350km (217 miles) south of Dhaka, to attend Khaleda Zia’s funeral on Wednesday.</p><p>Senior BNP leaders, however, dismiss doubts over Tarique’s authority.</p><p>Standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, who served as commerce minister in Khaleda Zia’s cabinet from 2001 to 2004, said Tarique’s leadership credentials were already established.</p><p>“His leadership has been proven,” Chowdhury told Al Jazeera earlier this month. “He is capable of leading the party effectively.”</p><p>As BNP prepares for the polls, analysts say the party’s ability to ensure discipline, project reform and contribute to a peaceful election will itself be a test of Tarique’s leadership.</p><p>A separate discussion has emerged on social media and among political rivals.</p><p>On November 29, ahead of his eventual return, Tarique wrote on his verified Facebook page that the decision to come home was not “entirely within his control” and not “under his sole control”. Critics interpreted this as raising questions about possible external influence – particularly India – on whether and when he would return.</p><p>BNP leaders rejected these claims, insisting his return was a political and legal matter tied to domestic realities rather than foreign negotiation, and that national interest would guide the party’s policy if it comes to power.</p><p>For many supporters, however, politics remains deeply personal.</p><p>Fifty-seven-year-old Dulal Mia, who travelled from the northeastern district of Kishoreganj to attend Tarique’s reception rally in Dhaka on December 25, still recalls the moment that made him a lifelong BNP supporter.</p><p>When he was a sixth-grader in 1979, he said, then-President Ziaur Rahman visited the paddy field where he was working and shook his hand. Ziaur Rahman is remembered for addressing drought by digging canals across the country and visiting remote areas barefoot, often without formal protocol.</p><p>“Tarique Rahman will have to carry the legacy of his parents,” Mia said. “If he doesn’t, people will turn away. The BNP’s politics is people’s politics – it began with Ziaur Rahman and was carried by Khaleda Zia for so long. I believe Tarique Rahman will do the same. Otherwise, it is the people who will reject him.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As China carried out <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/china-kicks-off-second-day-of-military-drills-around-taiwan\">live-fire drills and rehearsed a military blockade</a> in the waters surrounding Taiwan this week, 70-year-old Liao said she wasn’t worried about war. She was enjoying life as a retiree, playing mahjong with her friends and keeping an eye on the stock market.</p><p>“Everyday life hasn’t been impacted,” Liao told Al Jazeera as she was having her hair shampooed and cut in time for the new year at a salon in New Taipei City. “I’ve lived in Taiwan for 70 years. I’m used to it. We all still have to wash our hair.”</p><p>“We’re not scared,” Liao’s hairstylist agreed. In fact, she hadn’t even noticed that the drills were happening. “Working people don’t have time to pay attention to these things. All they can do is work,” Liao said.</p><p>It’s not that the Taiwanese don’t care about threats from China. While life, for the most part, remained undisturbed this week during what China called “Justice Mission 2025”, information about them circulated rapidly on social media and was broadcast across Taiwan’s 24-hour news channels.</p><p>Disinformation – a regular component of such exercises – also circulated widely, including a propaganda video showing an aircraft flying close to the Taipei 101 skyscraper that Taiwan’s government <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202512300030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dismissed</a> as fake.</p><p>Threats from China, though, have become a regular part of life for the Taiwanese people. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, since the communists won the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and established the People’s Republic of China (PRC). China says it will unify Taiwan with the PRC by force if necessary and has become increasingly assertive in its behaviour around Taiwan as its confidence in its military capabilities and prowess grows.</p><p>State news outlet The China Daily said in an editorial on Monday that the drills were “part of a series of Beijing’s responses” to an $11bn arms package from the United States to Taiwan, “as well as a warning to [Taiwanese President William] Lai Ching-te authorities in Taiwan”.</p><p>Washington does not officially recognise Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China, but it has pledged to help Taipei defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances.</p><p>Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian also told reporters on Monday that the exercises were “a punitive and deterrent action against separatist forces who seek Taiwan independence through military build-up and a necessary move to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p><p>But Liao is confident that China won’t launch an attack thanks to the strength of Taiwan’s economy and the “sacred mountain” – a local term for the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), or what foreigners might refer to as the “silicon shield” – which many believe will protect Taiwan from invasion. China relies on advanced semiconductors from TSMC for its own high-tech industries. “Look, the stock market is up 200 points today. If fighting were to break out today, everyone would be selling off their stocks, right?” Liao said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206634\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206634\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206634\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_73981-1767182917.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Taiwan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The hair salon where Liao, 70, had her hair washed and cut this week, despite Chinese military drills going on close by [Jordyn Haime/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"we-feel-a-bit-numb\">‘We feel a bit numb’</h2><p>For many interviewees, this week’s exercises brought reminders of Chinese drills in 2022, which were carried out after then-United States House of Representatives Speaker <a href=\"/news/2022/8/2/nancy-pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-amid-heightened-us-china-tensions\">Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan</a>, the highest-ranking American official to do so in decades.</p><p>Those exercises included live-fire drills, naval deployments, air sorties and ballistic missile launches and went on for four days in August that year.</p><p>They ushered in an era in which violations of Taiwan’s Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) reached unprecedented levels. In November 2021, there were only 41 documented violations. By November this year, that number had soared to 266, according to data from Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defence. And since the Pelosi visit in 2022, China has launched six large-scale military drills around Taiwan.</p><p>Polling from the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, DC, suggested that this increased activity has taken a toll on the Taiwanese people. In 2023, it found that just under 65 percent of people were worried about a cross-strait war, a moderate increase from just over 57 percent in 2021. Nearly 58 percent of respondents said they believed Chinese President Xi Jinping was more likely to use force against Taiwan compared with 46 percent five years ago in 2021.</p><p>“We’ve become used to it, I think, a bit numb,” said Ms Yeh, who runs a flower shop in New Taipei City. During the two days of Chinese war games this week, customers drifted in and out as usual. No one discussed the drills occurring just offshore.</p><p>But she added that the atmosphere felt <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/how-are-chinas-new-war-games-around-taiwan-different-from-earlier-drills\">different this time</a> and the drills seemed more serious, even if people weren’t showing it on their faces. “I think Taiwanese people are resigned to their fate,” she said. “For ordinary citizens, there’s nothing we can do. Taiwan’s democracy has voting rights, but besides voting, what else can we do?”</p><p>Yeh said escalating cross-strait tensions and the warmth that Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT), shows towards China have eroded her trust in the KMT to protect Taiwan.</p><p>In 2016, she voted for Tsai Ing-wen, the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP’s) candidate for president, and again for current DPP President Lai in 2024 after being a lifelong KMT voter.</p><p>The Chinese Communist Party has refused to engage with the DPP, which champions Taiwan’s unique identity and sovereignty, while the Kuomintang has repeatedly blocked the DPP’s proposed special defence budget. The KMT’s new chairperson, Cheng Li-wun, has accused Lai of pushing Taiwan towards the brink of war and has prioritised a meeting with Xi in 2026.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"i-can-only-watch\">‘I can only watch’</h2><p>Wang, a 19-year-old university student, expressed similar feelings to Yeh. “I’m a little worried, even to the point of wanting to write a will,” she said as she studied with a friend at a cafe on Wednesday. “This time feels more serious. It feels more realistic, but I feel powerless because I can only watch.”</p><p>The atmosphere in Taiwan had already been feeling tense, Wang said. On December 19, a 27-year-old named Chang Wen set off smoke grenades and stabbed several people in the centre of Taipei, killing <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/three-killed-in-taipei-stabbing-smoke-bomb-attack\">three people</a> and injuring 11. Such violence is rarely seen in the city. Chang, who died during a police chase, acted alone, and the motive for his attack is not known.</p><p>Then on Saturday, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake off the northeastern coast of Yilan <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/taiwan-rocked-by-7-0-magnitude-quake-but-no-major-damage-reported\">shook the island</a>, although it caused no major damage.</p><p>“There are many troops stationed in Zhongshan [station] and Taipei [Main Station], and the recent earthquakes have made us even more nervous. I think it’s necessary that we should be vigilant, but I think the panic online is excessive,” Wang said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump had not invoked the<a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/insurrection-act-what-is-it-and-does-us-president-have-plenary-authority\"> Insurrection Act</a> of 1807, which allows presidents to deploy troops domestically when “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion” against the federal government make it “impracticable to enforce” US law “by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings”.</p><p>Because of that, troops deployed in or around Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago had been largely tasked with guarding federal buildings and offering support services to immigration enforcement.</p><p>About 300 National Guard members remained under federal control in both Los Angeles and Chicago at the time of Trump’s announcement, with 200 more in Portland.</p><p>Since first deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles to respond to protests against mass immigration enforcement sweeps, Trump has repeatedly claimed major cities across the US have been plagued by overlapping crime and immigration crises.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Critics have accused Trump of taking part in dangerous political theatre to target opponents.</p><p id=\"trump-s-announcement-did-not-reference-the-ongoing-national-guard-deployment-in-washington-dc-a-federal-territory-or-in-new-orleans-louisiana-which-had-been-specifically-requested-by-the-state-s-republican-governor\">Trump’s announcement did not reference the ongoing National Guard deployment in Washington, DC, a federal territory, or in New Orleans, Louisiana, which had been specifically requested by the state’s Republican governor.</p><h2 id=\"legal-setbacks\">Legal setbacks</h2><p>The president’s move comes amid a series of legal setbacks, topped last week by a Supreme Court order keeping in place a lower court’s ruling barring the president from deploying the National Guard to Chicago.</p><p>While members of the federal military, National Guard troops are typically deployed at the request of state governors. Presidents can unilaterally deploy the National Guard, but only in instances when other federal agents can no longer execute the law.</p><p>The majority of Supreme Court justices ruled Trump has not yet met that threshold, dealing a major blow to the administration’s justification for similar deployments across the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, Department of Justice lawyers in California withdrew a request to keep troops in the state under federal control as they appealed a lower court’s ruling.

sanctions aimed at isolating Venezuela’s oil industry, as part of President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/us-venezuela-tensions-your-questions-answered\">pressure campaign</a> against the South American country.</p><p>The sanctions announced on Wednesday target four companies and their associated oil tankers, which are allegedly involved in transporting Venezuelan oil.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trump has claimed that Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro leads a so-called “narco-terrorist” government that seeks to destabilise the US, a charge repeated in the latest sanctions announcements.</p><p>“Maduro’s regime increasingly depends on a shadow fleet of worldwide vessels to facilitate sanctionable activity, including sanctions evasion, and to generate revenue for its destabilizing operations,” the Treasury said on Wednesday.</p><p>Petroleum is Venezuela’s primary export, but the Trump administration has sought to cut the country off from its international markets.</p><p>Wednesday’s notice accuses four tankers – the Nord Star, the Rosalind, the Valiant and the Della – of helping Venezuela’s oil sector to circumvent existing sanctions, thereby providing the “financial resources that fuel Maduro’s illegitimate narco-terrorist regime”.</p><p>“President Trump has been clear: We will not allow the illegitimate Maduro regime to profit from exporting oil while it floods the United States with deadly drugs,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.</p><p>“The Treasury Department will continue to implement President Trump’s campaign of pressure on Maduro’s regime.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><h2 id=\"claims-on-venezuelan-oil\">Claims on Venezuelan oil</h2><p>The sanctions come a day after Washington imposed <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/us-issues-iran-venezuela-sanctions-over-alleged-drone-trade\">sanctions</a> on a separate Venezuelan company it says assembled drones designed by Iran.</p><p>In recent months, the Trump administration has cited several motives for ratcheting up pressure against Venezuela, ranging from immigration to Maduro’s contested election in 2024.</p><p>Trump, for instance, has framed the pressure campaign as a means of stemming the trade of illegal drugs, despite Venezuela exporting virtually none of the administration’s main target, fentanyl.</p><p>Critics have also accused Washington of seeking to topple Maduro’s government to take control of the country’s vast oil reserves.</p><p>Trump officials have fuelled those suspicions with remarks seeming to assert ownership over Venezuela’s oil.</p><p>On December 17, a day after Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115731908387416458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> a “total and complete blockade” of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, his top adviser, Stephen Miller, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/does-the-us-have-any-real-claim-on-venezuelan-oil-as-stephen-miller-says\">claimed</a> that the US “created the oil industry in Venezuela”.</p><p>He suggested that the oil was stolen from the US when Venezuela nationalised its petroleum industry, starting in 1976.</p><p>That process accelerated after the 1998 election of socialist President Hugo Chavez, who reasserted state control over Venezuela’s oil sector, ultimately leading to the seizure of foreign assets in 2007.</p><p>That “tyrannical expropriation” scheme, Miller <a href=\"https://x.com/StephenM/status/2001287800847474981?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleged</a>, “was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property”.</p><p>Still, one major US oil company, Chevron, continues to operate in the country.</p><p>Trump has echoed Miller’s claims, writing online that the US “will not allow a Hostile Regime to take our Oil, Land, or any other Assets”.</p><p>He added that all of those assets “must be returned to the United States, IMMEDIATELY”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"military-build-up-in-the-caribbean\">Military build-up in the Caribbean</h2><p>In recent months, the Trump administration has tightened its focus on Venezuela’s oil industry, taking a series of military actions against tankers.</p><p>On December 10, the administration seized its first tanker, the Skipper, followed by a second seizure 10 days later.</p><p>The US military has reportedly been pursuing a third tanker as it crosses the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>The attacks on the oil tankers come several months after the US began surging aircraft, warships and other military assets to the Caribbean region along Venezuela’s coast.</p><p>Since September 2, the US military has conducted dozens of bombing campaigns against alleged drug-smuggling boats in international waters in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, in what rights groups call extrajudicial killings.</p><p>More than 100 people have been killed, and the administration has offered scant legal justification for the attacks.</p><p>On Monday, Trump told reporters that the US had struck a “dock area” in Venezuela he claimed was used to load the alleged drug boats.</p><p>The dock bombing is believed to be the first of its kind on Venezuelan soil, though Trump has long threatened to begin attacking land-based targets.</p><p>While the administration has not officially revealed which agency was behind the dock strike, US media has widely reported it was conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p></div></div></body></html>"

While on the campaign trail, in 2015, he claimed that Mexico was sending “rapists” and criminals across the southern border into the US, spurring outrage.</p><p>Later, during his presidential run in 2024, he repeated baseless claims against Haitians living in Illinois, including that they were killing and eating pets.</p><p>In recent weeks, Trump has focused on Somali Americans, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ilhan-omar-denounces-donald-trump-for-calling-somali-immigrants-garbage\">comparing</a> them to “garbage” and criticising the legal pathways that allowed them into the country. He further claimed they were “destroying America”.</p><p>Lawmakers, community groups, and political organisations <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-plans-crackdown-on-somali-communities-in-minnesota-what-we-know\">decried</a> Trump’s statements as blatantly racist.</p><p>But Trump has accompanied his rhetoric with action. Over the past month, his administration has surged immigration enforcement agents to Minnesota, conducted a wide-scale audit of legal Somali immigrants, and prioritised investigations of fraud claims in the state.</p><p>His efforts have seized upon a scandal that has rattled the midwestern state in recent years.</p><p>Prosecutors have alleged that criminals have defrauded the state of approximately $9bn in misused social assistance funding and nearly $300m in misused COVID funding.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said the Justice Department has charged 98 individuals in Minnesota as part of its wide-ranging fraud investigation, adding that 85 of those charged were of “Somali descent”.</p><p>However, many of those charges pre-date Trump’s second term.</p><p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has also shot back that local and federal authorities have spent years combatting fraud in the state, which he called a “serious issue”.</p><p>In a post on the social media platform X on Wednesday, Walz said Trump is “using an issue he doesn’t give a damn about as an excuse to hurt working Minnesotans”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Some of the Trump administration’s actions have come in the wake of a viral video uploaded by conservative YouTube Nick Shirley, who claimed Somali American-run daycare centres in Minneapolis had committed up to $100m in fraud.</p><p>Shirley’s video has received 127 million views on X, and administration officials, including Bondi, have repeatedly cited his claims.</p><p>For instance, on Tuesday, FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post that his organisation “is aware of recent social media reports in Minnesota”.</p><p>He added that the bureau had “surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programmes”.</p><p>Still, questions have arisen over the accuracy of Shirley’s video.</p><p>An investigation by CBS News this week found that “all but two” of the daycares featured in the video had active licences and “were visited by state regulators within the last six months”.</p><p>Those regulators issued several citations, according to the report, but “there was no recorded evidence of fraud”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
