Has he just appeared, or was he there all along? Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id=\"who-is-ghassan-al-duhaini\">Who is Ghassan al-Duhaini?</h2><p>Palestinian media sources say al-Duhaini, 39, has long been the group’s de facto leader, despite being officially the second-in-command.</p><p>They argue that his experience and age made him the operational head, while Abu Shabab, the figure publicly recruited by Israel, served as the face of the militia.</p><p>Al-Duhaini was born on October 3, 1987, in Rafah, southern Gaza. He belongs to the Tarabin Bedouin tribe, one of the largest Palestinian tribes that extends regionally and to which Abu Shabab belonged.</p><p>He was a former officer in the Palestinian Authority security forces, where he held the rank of first lieutenant.</p><p>Then he later joined Jaysh al-Islam, a Gaza-based armed faction with ideological ties to ISIL (ISIS).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"did-he-really-take-over-after-abu-shabab\">Did he really take over after Abu Shabab?</h2><p>The militia announced al-Duhaini as its new commander on its official Facebook page on Friday.</p><p>Al-Duhaini pledged to continue the group’s operations against Hamas.</p><p>In an interview with Israel’s Channel 12, comments later reported by The Times of Israel on Saturday, al-Duhaini insisted he had no fear of Hamas.</p><p>“Why would I fear Hamas when I am fighting Hamas? I fight them, arrest their people, seize their equipment … in the name of the people and the free,” he said.</p><p>On Friday, the militia published a promotional video on an affiliated Facebook page showing al-Duhaini inspecting a formation of armed fighters.</p><p>He told Channel 12 that the footage was intended to demonstrate that the group “remains operational” despite the death of its leader.</p><p>“His absence is painful, but it will not stop the war on terrorism,” he declared.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-he-always-been-against-hamas\">Has he always been against Hamas?</h2><p>Hamas lists al-Duhaini among its most wanted figures, accusing him of collaborating with Israel, looting aid, and gathering intelligence on tunnel routes and military sites.</p><p>Little information is available on why he left the security forces.</p><p>Al-Duhaini has been increasingly active on social media, recently appearing prominently in a video showing the militia capturing and interrogating several Hamas members from a tunnel in Rafah.</p><p>Abu Shabab’s group claimed the detentions were conducted “in accordance with the applicable security directive and in coordination with the international coalition”.</p><p>He also appeared in a social media post beside what appeared to be several bodies, the caption saying they were Hamas men who had been “eliminated” as part of the group’s “counterterrorism” operations.</p><p>Hamas has attempted to assassinate al-Duhaini twice, killing his brother in one operation and narrowly missing al-Duhaini in another, when a booby-trapped house east of Rafah was detonated.</p><p>A Hamas source said al-Duhaini survived the blast “by sheer luck”, while four members of the attacking unit were killed and others wounded.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-popular-forces-militia\">What is the Popular Forces militia?</h2><p>The Popular Forces militia first came to prominence in 2024 under the leadership of Abu Shabab. It has an estimated 100 to 300 fighters who operate only metres from Israeli military sites, moving with their weapons under direct Israeli oversight.</p><p>The militia is primarily based in eastern Rafah, near the Karem Abu Salem crossing, the only entry point through which Israel currently permits humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p><p>A second unit is in western Rafah, near the notorious US-Israeli GHF aid distribution point, where hundreds of Palestinians have been shot as they sought aid.</p><p>Security sources told Al Jazeera Arabic that the Israeli army oversaw the arming of Abu Shabab and that he leads “criminal gangs specialising in intercepting aid convoys coming from the [Karem Abu Salem] crossing in southern Gaza and firing on civilians”.</p><p>Israeli newspaper Maariv reported in June that Israel’s intelligence agency, Shin Bet, was behind the recruitment of Abu Shabab’s gang, its chief Ronen Bar advising Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to enlist and arm the group.</p><p>The so-called “pilot project” involved supplying the militia a limited and monitored number of rifles and handguns, the paper said.</p><p>Shin Bet’s idea, Maariv continued, was to use the gang to test whether it could impose a form of “alternative governance” to Hamas in a small, contained area of Rafah.</p><p>Still, some Israeli security officials, it added, do not view the group as a credible replacement for Hamas.</p><p>Abu Shabab’s name later appeared in an internal United Nations memo in late 2024 that identified him as a central figure behind the systematic and large-scale looting of humanitarian aid entering Gaza.</p><p>Reports about the group’s finances and operations suggest a pattern of systematic profiteering from Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 12 million, according to the United Nations. It has also left some 30 million in need of humanitarian aid.</p><p>The RSF took the city of el-Fasher, the capital of the state of North Darfur, in October after an 18-month campaign of siege and starvation. The city was the Sudanese army’s last stronghold in the region.</p><p>Survivors who fled the city in the subsequent days recounted mass killings, rape, pillaging and other atrocities, prompting an international outcry.</p><p>Amnesty International has accused the RSF of “war crimes”, while the UN Human Rights Council has ordered an investigation into the abuses in el-Fasher. Officials who visited Darfur and spoke to survivors described the region as an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/sudans-el-fasher-a-crime-scene-after-rsf-takeover-un-aid-chief\">“absolute horror show”</a> and a “crime scene”.</p><h2 id=\"widespread-sexual-assault\" data-start=\"1037\" data-end=\"1353\">Widespread sexual assault</h2><p>Mohammed Elsheikh, a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that he was “100 percent sure” that sexual violence committed by RSF fighters is far more widespread than reported.</p><p>“Because most of the communities look at it as a stigma, most of the raped women tend not to disclose this information,” he said.</p><p>Elsheikh said the network had also documented 23 cases of rape among women who fled el-Fasher for the nearby town of Tawila.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the age of these raped victims varies from 15 years to 23 years old,” he said.</p><p>In its statement, the Sudan Doctors Network urged the international community to take urgent action to protect Sudanese women and girls.</p><p>It also called for “serious pressure on RSF leaders to immediately stop these assaults, respect international humanitarian law, and secure safe corridors for women and children”.</p><p>The latest accusations came amid a growing outcry over another RSF attack on a pre-school in the state of South Kordofan that local officials said killed at least 116 people. Some 46 of the victims were children, according to the officials.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Sunday, Justice Minister Abdullah Dirife said Khartoum was willing to pursue political talks aimed at ending the conflict, but insisted that any settlement must “ensure there is no presence for ‘terrorist’ militias in both the political and military arenas”.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera on the sidelines of the Doha Forum, he said the rebels “need to agree to give their weapons in specific areas and leave all these cities, and the police should take over”.</p><p>Dirife also called for putting a stop to the “transfer of weapons and the infiltration of mercenaries into Sudan” and claimed that fighters and arms were entering from regions including South America, Chad and the UAE.</p><p>The RSF currently holds all five states of Darfur, while the Sudanese army retains control of most of the remaining 13 states, including Khartoum.</p><p>Dirife also accused the RSF of repeatedly breaking past commitments to adhere to regional and global mediation initiatives.</p><p>“The last initiative we signed was the Jeddah Declaration. However, this militia didn’t commit to what we agreed on,” he said in Doha.</p><p>The Jeddah Declaration – brokered by the United States and Saudi Arabia in May 2023 – was meant to protect civilians and lay the groundwork for humanitarian access. Several ceasefires followed, but both sides were accused of violating them, prompting the mediators to suspend talks.</p><p>The UN has meanwhile formally declared famine in el-Fasher and Kaduguli in South Kordofan and warned of the risk of a hunger crisis in 20 additional areas across the Greater Darfur and Greater Kordofan regions.</p><p>The World Food Programme’s Deputy Executive Director Carl Skau told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the agency was providing aid to five million people, including two million in areas that are difficult to reach, but warned that assistance has fallen far short of needs.</p><p>“World attention needs to be on Sudan now, and diplomatic efforts need to be stepped up in order to prevent the same disaster we saw in el-Fasher,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I’d like to reiterate that Thailand has never initiated a fight or an invasion, but will never tolerate a violation of its sovereignty,” he said in a televised address.</p><p>For its part, Cambodia said it did not want to be drawn back into direct conflict either.</p><p>“Standing on the spirit of respecting all previous agreements and resolving conflicts peacefully according to international law, Cambodia did not retaliate at all during the two assaults and continues to monitor the situation vigilantly and with utmost caution,” the Cambodian military said.</p><p>Cambodia’s former Prime Minister Hun Sen, father of current premier Hun Manet, also called for front-line Cambodian forces to be patient, accusing Thai forces of trying to “draw us into a fight to destroy the ceasefire and the Cambodia-Thailand peace declaration”.</p><p>He also urged athletes participating in the Southeast Asia Games, which are due to begin in Thailand on Tuesday, to “participate in the competition as normal”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"thousands-displaced\">Thousands displaced</h2><p>The clashes have resulted in renewed displacement in both countries.</p><p>Thailand’s Second Army Region said in a statement that about 35,000 people have been evacuated from areas along the border, while a spokesman for Cambodia’s Oddar Meanchey provincial administration said a “number of villagers who live near the border are fleeing to safety”.</p><p>The Cambodian province also suspended school on Monday over the fighting.</p><p>Anwar, the Malaysian prime minister, expressed deep concern.</p><p>“We urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint, maintain open channels of communication and make full use of the mechanisms in place,” he said in a post on X.</p><p>“Malaysia stands ready to support steps that can help restore calm and avert further incidents. Our region cannot afford to see longstanding disputes slip into cycles of confrontation,” he added.</p><p>Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817km (508-mile) land border, first mapped in 1907 by France when it ruled Cambodia as a colony.</p><p>Simmering tension has occasionally exploded into skirmishes, such as a weeklong artillery exchange in 2011, despite attempts to peacefully resolve overlapping claims.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The focus of the meeting, he said, would be on ending Hamas governance in Gaza and ensuring it fulfilled its “commitment” to the plan, which calls for demilitarisation of the enclave.</p><p>“We have a second phase, no less daunting, and that is to achieve the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarisation of Gaza,” Netanyahu said during a news conference with visiting German Chancellor <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/germanys-merz-meets-netanyahu-under-shadow-of-israels-war-on-gaza\">Friedrich Merz</a>.</p><p>It was not clear whether Naim’s comments on the group freezing or storing arms would satisfy Israel’s demands for full disarmament. The Hamas official said the group retained its “right to resist”, adding that laying down arms could happen as part of a process leading to a Palestinian state, with a potential long-term truce lasting five to 10 years.</p><p>The US-drafted plan for Gaza leaves the door open to Palestinian independence, but Netanyahu has long rejected this, asserting that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"vague-plan\">Vague plan</h2><p>Trump’s 20-point plan offers a general way forward on such plans as the establishment of the stabilisation force and the formation of a technocratic Palestinian government operating under an international “board of peace”, but does not offer concrete details or timelines.</p><p>US officials have said they expect “boots on the ground” early next year, but while countries like Indonesia have agreed to contribute troops, there is no roadmap for setting up the force, and its exact makeup, command structure and responsibilities have not been defined.</p><p>Netanyahu appeared to recognise the plan’s vagueness. “What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,” he said on Sunday.</p><p>The Israeli prime minister said that phase two of the plan, which will be set in motion once Hamas returns the last Israeli captive, a policeman killed in the October 7 attack on southern Israel, would be “more difficult”.</p><p>Stage one of the plan has already proven challenging, with Israel continuing to bomb Gaza throughout the ceasefire, killing more than 370 Palestinians, according to health officials. Meanwhile, it has accused Hamas of dragging out captive returns.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-army-says-yellow-line-new-border\">Israeli army says yellow line ‘new border’</h2><p>The plan’s initial steps saw Israeli forces withdraw to positions behind a so-called yellow line in Gaza, though the Israeli military remains in control of 53 percent of the territory. The Israeli military said on Sunday that the line of demarcation was a “new border”.</p><p>“We have operational control over extensive parts of the Gaza Strip, and we will remain on those defence lines,” said Israeli military chief Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir. “The yellow line is a new border line, serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”</p><p>Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani warned at the Doha Forum on Saturday that the truce was at a “critical moment” and could unravel without rapid movement towards a permanent deal.</p><p>He said a true ceasefire “cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal” of Israeli forces, alongside restored stability and freedom of movement for Palestinians, which has so far not transpired under phase one of the plan. He did not allude to the yellow line in his comments.</p><p>Amid growing momentum for a move to phase two of the peace plan, Israeli and Qatari officials met with US counterparts in an effort to rebuild relations after Israel’s air strike on Doha in September, Axios reported, citing unnamed sources.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
