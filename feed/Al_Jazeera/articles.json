It’s a big mistake to my mind,” he said. And Ukraine, he said, “keeps returning to one simple point”.</p><p>“Peace can only be built on clear security guarantees. Where there is no clear security system, war always returns,” Zelenskyy said.</p><p>Among the most contentious issues in the negotiations is Russia’s demand for a <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/ukraine-sends-reserves-to-stop-russian-advance-in-east-amid-diplomatic-push\">full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops</a> from the remaining parts of Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk that it still controls. Ukraine has rejected a unilateral pullback, while also demanding Western security guarantees to deter Russia from relaunching its invasion if a ceasefire is reached.</p><p>Zelenskyy, in remarks to reporters, said the US had proposed a security guarantee lasting for 15 years after the war, but Ukraine wanted a deal for 20 years or longer. He added that Putin opposes the deployment of <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/russia-says-it-will-not-discuss-foreign-troops-in-ukraine-in-any-format\">foreign troops in Ukraine</a>, as it would deter any future aggression by Russia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Zelenskyy said Russia had to accept a ceasefire monitoring ‌mission ‌and an exchange of prisoners of war. He estimated that Russia currently has about 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers, while Kyiv has more than 4,000 Russian personnel.</p><p>He also acknowledged feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Trump, who on Friday urged him not to miss the “opportunity” to make peace and told him “to get moving”. Zelenskyy also called for greater action from Ukraine’s allies to press Russia into making peace, both in the form of tougher sanctions and more weapons supplies.</p><p>Trump has the power to force Putin to declare a ceasefire and ‌needs to do so, Zelenskyy said. Ukrainian officials have said a ceasefire is required to hold a referendum on any peace deal, which would be organised alongside national elections.</p><p>Zelenskyy also expressed surprise at Russia’s decision to change its delegation to the Geneva talks and said it suggested to ⁠him that Russia wanted to delay any decisions from being agreed.</p><p>The Kremlin had said the Russian delegation would be led by Putin’s adviser Vladimir Medinsky, a change from negotiations in Abu Dhabi, where military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov was in the lead. Ukrainian officials have criticised Medinsky’s handling of previous talks, accusing him of delivering history ⁠lessons to the Ukrainian team instead of engaging in constructive negotiations.</p><p>In his main speech at the Munich event, Zelenskyy also denounced Putin as a “slave to war”.</p><p>He drew parallels between the current talks and the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler take part of the erstwhile Czechoslovakia, only for World War II to break out the following year.</p><p>“It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine, just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a great war,” he warned.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He said he also wanted to hear what compromises Moscow would be ready to accept.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he was feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Trump, who recently said the Ukrainian should not miss the “opportunity” to make peace with Russia soon, and urged him “to get moving”.</li>\n<li>He also accused Moscow of seeking to delay decisions by changing its lead negotiator – from the military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov during Abu Dhabi talks to President Vladimir Putin’s adviser, Vladimir Medinsky, in the Geneva round.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said that US negotiators had told Ukraine the Russians had promised a swift end to the war if Ukrainian forces immediately withdrew from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that it still controls. Ukraine had rejected that idea and instead expressed a readiness to discuss a US plan for a free trade zone in the region, while freezing the rest of the 1,200km (745-mile) front line.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said the only two options Kyiv is willing to accept are sticking to the current lines of control or the establishment of a free trade zone.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he hoped the US would stay involved in the negotiations and that there would be an opportunity for Europe to play a bigger role. “Europe is practically not present at the table,” he said.</li>\n<li>Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi told his audience in Munich that he agrees with Zelenskyy’s assessment that Europe should be more involved in efforts to end the war in Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy added that Russia had to accept a ceasefire monitoring mission and an exchange of prisoners of war. He estimated that Russia currently had about 7,000 Ukrainian troops, while Kyiv had more than 4,000 Russians.</li>\n<li>He also suggested that Moscow was opposed to the deployment of French and UK troops in Ukraine after the war, which Paris and London have said they are willing to do, because Russia’s Putin “wants to have the opportunity to come back”.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>French Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Noel Barrot said some G7 countries had expressed a willingness to move ahead with a maritime services ban on Russian oil, and France is “reasonably optimistic a deal can be reached”. He said the EU is currently preparing its 20th sanctions package against Moscow.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine and the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/which-countries-owe-the-imf-the-most-money-in-2025\">International Monetary Fund</a> agreed to ease some conditions, including sensitive tax increases, for a new $8.2bn lending programme, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">The European Union should “bring to life” a mutual defence pact anchored in its founding treaty, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Munich, as the regional bloc faces new threats from Russia.</li>\n</ul><h3>Olympics</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Zelenskyy awarded a top state honour to Olympic skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was disqualified from the Winter Olympic Games in Italy for wearing a helmet commemorating athletes killed in the war with Russia.

The Brazilian dusted himself off to score from the spot in the 25th minute.</p><p class=\"p1\">Madrid captain Fede Valverde gratefully scored the third in the 31st after being left too much space at the edge of the penalty box. It was Valverde’s first goal of the season.</p><p class=\"p1\">Garcia should have scored again before the break, when Valverde set him up for what looked like a simple tap-in, but Vinicius made it 4-1 with his second spot kick after the break, awarded after Aramburu was again penalised for bringing him down.</p><p class=\"p1\">Dani Carvajal made his long-awaited return around the hour mark, when he replaced Alexander-Arnold for his first league appearance since Madrid’s 2-1 loss to Barcelona in October.</p><p>Vinicius thought he had scored a hat-trick when he headed in a free kick in the 90th minute, only for it to be ruled out for offside.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Elsewhere in La Liga on Saturday, Borja Iglesias scored in stoppage time, after having another seemingly good goal ruled out through VAR, to salvage a 2-2 draw for Celta Vigo at Espanyol.</p><p class=\"p1\">A rueful Iglesias shook his head and smiled after having a 77th-minute goal disallowed when a long check determined there had been an offside infringement.</p><p class=\"p1\">His frustrations grew when Ramon Terrats pulled the ball back for fellow substitute Tyrhys Dolan to score what he thought was the winner for Espanyol in the 86th minute.</p><p class=\"p1\">But Iglesias equalised in the third minute of stoppage time when Pablo Duran set him up with his heel after a good run from Sergio Carreira.</p><p class=\"p1\">Espanyol remained sixth, and Celta a point behind in seventh.</p><p class=\"p1\">Also on Saturday, Getafe held on to upset visiting Villarreal 2-1, and the 10-man Sevilla drew with Alaves 1-1 in a duel between two strugglers.</p></div></div></body></html>"

what looks will be heated parliamentary elections.</p><p>Delivering his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Saturday, Orban pledged to push out “the foreign influence that limits our sovereignty together with its agents” as the opposition Tisza Party maintains an 8 to 12 percentage point lead over Orban’s ruling Fidesz party eight weeks from the April 12 elections.</p><section

who compared the EU to the repressive Soviet regime that dominated Hungary for decades last century.</p><p>Since returning to power for a second time in 2010, Orban has waged a campaign against “pseudo-civil organisations”, “bought journalists”, judges and politicians in his drive to build what he calls an “illiberal state”.</p><p>His crackdown on immigration has provided a blueprint for right-wing leaders, such as United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"ar-or-peace\">‘War or peace’?</h2><p>In Saturday’s speech, Orban signalled his work of clearing liberal forces from the country is only “half-done”, noting that Trump, who is backing him to win the upcoming vote, “rebelled against the liberals’ global-scale business, media and political network, thereby improving our chances as well”.</p><p>On Friday, Trump posted a new <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/trump-endorses-prime-minister-viktor-orban-for-hungarys-april-election\">endorsement</a> of Orban on his Truth Social platform, saying he’s a “truly strong and powerful leader with a proven track record of delivering phenomenal results”.</p><p>The US president’s comments came as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio prepares to visit Hungary on Sunday. Rubio will fly in from the Munich Security Conference in Germany with a stopover in Slovakia for talks with nationalist Prime Minister Robert Fico.</p><p>Orban, who has cultivated <a href=\"/news/2024/7/5/peace-mission-hungarys-orban-meets-putin-in-russia-defying-eu-leaders\">warm relations</a> with Putin during his current stretch in power, this week cast the April elections as a stark choice between “war or peace”, warning in a Facebook post that Peter Magyar’s Tisza Party would drag the country into the conflict raging next door in <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/in-ukraines-west-hungarian-minority-rights-collide-with-wartime-politics\">Ukraine</a>.</p><p>The prime minister has doubled down on his strategy of portraying Magyar as a “Brussels puppet” with billboards depicting him saying “yes” to a demand for “Money for Ukraine!” from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

We do not need a custodian,” Pezeshkian said, warning that a war would <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">impact the entire </a>Middle East.</p><p>Switzerland’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iran and the US would hold the next round of talks in Geneva next week. Oman, which hosted the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/iran-us-hold-talks-in-oman-as-fears-of-war-hang-over-region\">first round</a> in Muscat last week, will mediate.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"major-rallies-in-us-europe\" class=\"s3\">Major rallies in US, Europe</h2><p class=\"s5\">A large number of Iranians abroad who are opposed to the theocratic establishment governing Iran since a 1979 revolution participated in rallies across the world on Saturday to demand an end to religious rule.</p><p class=\"s5\">Reza Pahlavi, son of Iran’s US-backed shah who was deposed in the revolution, called on Iranians living abroad to be part of a “global day of action” aimed at “taking Iran back” from the Islamic Republic. He also addressed the <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/2/14/live-world-leaders-gather-in-munich-for-2nd-day-of-security-conference\">Munich Security Conference</a> in Germany and met with leaders such as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and senior US Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p class=\"s5\">The three main cities designated for the protests were Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto. Iranians also marched in cities in Australia, including Sydney and Melbourne.</p><p class=\"s5\">A similar rally last month in Toronto saw more than150,000 people in attendance and no adverse incidents, according to city police. About 100,000 people registered early to attend the Munich rally on Saturday.</p><p class=\"s5\">The rallies are some of the largest ever held by the Iranian diaspora and the biggest since demonstrations in solidarity with the deadly 2022-2023 nationwide protests in Iran, triggered by the death in police custody of <a href=\"/news/2023/10/19/mahsa-amini-honoured-with-eus-top-human-rights-prize\">Mahsa Amini</a>, 22, for allegedly wearing the mandatory hijab for women improperly.</p><p class=\"s5\">The latest protests were held days after the Iranian establishment organised demonstrations and burned the flags of Israel and the US to mark the 47th anniversary of the 1979 revolution.</p><p class=\"s5\">“They killed my innocent girl for a few strands of hair and nobody was held accountable, but now they record women with bare heads and so-called unconventional attire in their official ceremonies and nobody yells that Islam is in danger,” Amini’s father wrote in an Instagram story after state television interviewed a pro-establishment woman without a hijab.</p><p class=\"s5\">Since the killing of thousands of protesters last month, mostly carried out on the nights of January 8-9, similar rallies have been held to raise awareness in dozens of cities across the globe, including The Hague, Zurich, Rome, Budapest and Tokyo.</p><p class=\"s5\">The United Nations and international human rights organisations said they documented widespread use of lethal force by state forces against peaceful protesters. But the Iranian government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/iran-rejects-un-rights-resolution-condemning-protest-killings\">rejected all their allegations</a>, claiming “terrorists” and “rioters” armed and funded by the US and Israel were behind the killings across Iran.</p><h2 id=\"families-united-in-grief-strength\">Families united in grief, strength</h2><p class=\"s5\">From Kuhchenar county in southern Iran’s Fars province to central Arak and Mashhad in the northeast, families continue to release footage online to commemorate their loved ones killed during the demonstrations.</p><p class=\"s5\">Behesht-e Zahra, a cemetery in Tehran, was crowded on Friday as people gathered in solidarity with multiple families holding mourning ceremonies to mark <a href=\"/news/2022/10/26/clashes-thousands-attend-mahsa-amini-memorial-iran-saqqez\">“chehelom”</a>, or 40 days since the killing of their loved ones.</p><p class=\"s5\">Bereaved relatives somberly clapped, played music and showed the “victory” sign in an attempt to express pride, strength and defiance despite their losses.</p><p class=\"s5\">Among those remembered were Ayda Heydari, 21, a medical student, and Zahra “Raha” Behloulipour, who attended Tehran University. Both were shot and killed with multiple live rounds in separate incidents.</p><p class=\"s5\">The state-run Mehr news agency reported Heydari was “a victim of Mossad agents in recent riots” and released a short clip of an interview with her family. Heydari’s mother said her daughter was not a <a href=\"/news/2023/6/21/why-was-this-iran-dissident-group-raided-in-europe\">“munafiq”</a>, a term the Islamic Republic uses to describe dissidents.</p><p class=\"s5\">Mohammad-Hossein Omid, head of Tehran University, last week told the semiofficial ISNA news agency that “most” of the people taking part in the nationwide demonstrations were “protesters not terrorists”.</p><h2 id=\"concerns-for-prisoners\" class=\"s3\">Concerns for prisoners</h2><p class=\"s5\">The Iranian judiciary confirmed on Saturday that a number of senior <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/iran-arrests-prominent-reformists-over-deadly-january-unrest\">reformist politicians arrested</a> last week for criticising the establishment were released on bail while others remained behind bars to face previous charges.</p><p class=\"s5\">Vahid Shalchi, a deputy science minister, cited judiciary officials as saying “a considerable” number of arrested students will be released soon but did not say how many are being held.</p><p class=\"s5\">Tens of thousands of people have been arrested during and after the protests, and human rights organisations said some are in immediate danger of being executed – allegations the Iranian judiciary has rejected.</p><p class=\"s5\">Amnesty International said 18-year-old wrestling champion Saleh Mohammadi has been sentenced to public execution in Qom after being forced to make confessions about being involved in the death of a security agent.</p><p></p><p class=\"s5\">Mai Sato – UN special rapporteur on Iran, who previously said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed during the demonstrations – said three other people face execution and “What is happening now is not new.”</p><p class=\"s5\">“The same patterns documented in those individual cases are being replicated on a mass scale after the nationwide protests,” she said.</p><p>A specific casualty toll from the demonstrations is unknown as information remains extremely limited because of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/irans-economy-falters-as-internet-shutdown-hits-people-businesses-hard\">ongoing heavy internet filtering</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"
