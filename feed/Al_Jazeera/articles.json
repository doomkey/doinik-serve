He had been under house arrest since Sunday, reports said.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p data-start=\"1395\" data-end=\"1735\">The Attorney General’s Office, controlled by the Ortega government, announced Wednesday it had launched a corruption probe against Arce, accusing him of “illegal transactions and negotiations” related to properties and businesses allegedly tied to state interests. Prosecutors claim Arce refused to cooperate or present documentation when questioned.</p><p data-start=\"1737\" data-end=\"1857\">His aide, Ricardo Bonilla, was arrested a day earlier for allegedly refusing to “render accounts”, officials added.</p><p data-start=\"1859\" data-end=\"2210\">The Nicaraguan news outlet Confidencial reported that Arce’s detention is part of a broader purge being directed by Vice President Rosario Murillo, Ortega’s wife and co-ruler, with the president’s full support. Sources close to the exiled opposition believe Murillo is consolidating power in preparation for succession, as Ortega’s health visibly deteriorates.</p><p data-start=\"2212\" data-end=\"2404\">In recent public appearances, Ortega, now 79, has appeared frail and unsteady. He is reported to suffer from lupus and kidney failure, raising speculation about who may eventually replace him.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2406\" data-end=\"2691\">Arce is the third prominent Sandinista veteran to be placed under house arrest this year. Henry Ruiz, another historic commander, was confined in March. Humberto Ortega, the president’s brother and a former army chief, was under similar restrictions before his death in September 2024.</p><p data-start=\"2693\" data-end=\"2990\">Arce and Daniel Ortega were close comrades during the 1979 Sandinista revolution that toppled United States-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza. After decades in and out of power, Ortega returned to the presidency in 2007 and has remained in office through successive elections that many have criticised as undemocratic.</p><p data-start=\"3261\" data-end=\"3465\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The arrests have sent a chilling message across Nicaragua’s political landscape, particularly among veteran revolutionaries who once stood alongside Ortega and are now facing marginalisation or detention.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But within the Democratic caucus, the tally was 27-17. The bill aimed to block the transfer of assault rifles to Israel.</p><p>Another bill that targeted bomb shipments also failed, in a 24-73 vote, with three senators who backed the first bill defecting.</p><p>The vote came amid domestic and international anger at Israel’s atrocities in Gaza, where leading rights groups have accused the Israeli military of carrying out a genocide <a href=\"/news/2025/4/29/israel-carrying-out-live-streamed-genocide-in-gaza-amnesty-says\">against Palestinians</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-just-need-to-continue-to-fight\">‘We just need to continue to fight’</h2><p>Taeb said Palestinian rights advocates are making progress on the issue, noting that only 15 Senators backed Sanders’ measure to block weapons to Israel in April.</p><p>“It’s frustrating, but we just need to continue to fight,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“We need to continue to do everything we possibly can to pressure our leaders in the House and Senate to stop funding these atrocities. We’re absolutely seeing a shift, and these bills show that. So, it shows that the pressure is working.”</p><p>Israel, which receives billions of dollars in US military aid annually, largely relies on US weaponry to carry out its wars on Palestinians and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/lebanon-president-aoun-reiterates-calls-for-hezbollah-to-disarm\">neighbouring countries</a>.</p><p>For decades, support for Israel on Capitol Hill seemed unshakable. But restricting the flow of US weapons is steadily becoming a mainstream proposal, especially among Democrats.</p><p>The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) expressed gratitude for the senators who backed the bills, calling the vote a “historic sign of progress”.</p><p>“Although last night’s Senate vote should have been 100–0 in favor of these resolutions, the fact that a majority of Senate Democrats voted yes is a historic moment and a sign that sentiments in Congress are gradually catching up to the American people,” CAIR government affairs director Robert McCaw said in a statement.</p><p>Some key Democrats supported Sanders’s bill – well beyond the small group of progressive lawmakers who have been vocally supportive of Palestinian rights for years.</p><p>They included Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee; Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee; and <a href=\"/news/2020/3/2/amy-klobuchar-who-is-she-where-does-she-stand-on-key-issues\">Amy Klobuchar</a>, a prominent centrist.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"enough-is-enough\">‘Enough is enough’</h2><p>Senator Tammy Duckworth, who has been a strong Israel supporter throughout most of her career, also voted in favour of the measure.</p><p>“Enough is enough,” Duckworth said in a statement.</p><p>She highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Israeli-imposed starvation has killed more than 150 people.</p><p>“Israel’s unacceptable choice to restrict humanitarian and food aid from entering Gaza – for months – is now causing innocent civilians, including young children, to <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/7/31/live-israel-kills-over-90-in-gaza-in-one-day-as-starvation-deaths-mount\">starve to death</a>,” Duckworth said.</p><p>“Ending this famine is not only a moral imperative, it is also in the best interests of both Israel’s and our own country’s long-term national security.”</p><p>Four out of the six new Democratic senators, elected last year, voted in favour of blocking arms to Israel, highlighting the generational shift on the issue. The other two freshman senators were not present for the vote.</p><p>Public <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/new-poll-shows-plunging-us-public-support-for-israels-war-on-gaza\">opinion polls</a> show that young Americans, especially Democrats, are increasingly opposing Israel’s abuses against Palestinians.</p><p>Only 9 percent of respondents under the age of 35 in a recent Gallup survey said they approve of Israel’s military action in Gaza and 6 percent said they had a favourable opinion of Israeli Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/netanyahu-trump-discuss-forced-transfer-of-palestinians-out-of-gaza\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>.</p><p>Sanders said after Wednesday’s vote that the increased support from Democratic lawmakers for restricting arms to Israel shows that the “tide is turning”.</p><p>“The American people do not want to spend billions to starve children in Gaza,” the senator said in a statement.</p><p>“The Democrats are moving forward on this issue, and I look forward to Republican support in the near future.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"aipac-responds\">AIPAC responds</h2><p>IfNotNow, a youth-led progressive Jewish group, also lauded the vote as a “historic moment”.</p><p>“As <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/us-doctors-veterans-urge-trump-to-end-israel-support-as-hunger-grips-gaza\">Israel’s blockade</a> forces virtually all Palestinians in Gaza to the brink of starvation, we must use every tool at our disposal to end the blockade and push for a ceasefire and hostage exchange,” the group’s executive director, Morriah Kaplan, said in a statement.</p><p>“It is shameful that a shrinking minority of the Democratic caucus, 17 senators, sided with Republicans to continue the flow of deadly weapons to the Israeli military.”</p><p>Some senior Democrats, including the party’s top senator, Chuck Schumer, voted against the resolutions.</p><p>Taeb said Schumer’s vote shows that he is “simply out of touch with the vast majority of Democratic voters and, incredibly, his own caucus”.</p><p>She added that Republicans will soon start to pay an electoral price for their unflinching support for Israel as Americans’ opinions continue to turn against the US ally.</p><p>The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which has spent <a href=\"/news/2024/8/5/why-is-a-pro-israel-lobby-targeting-us-congress-member-cori-bush\">millions of dollars</a> to help defeat Israel’s critics in Congress, welcomed the defeat of Sanders’ bills, but it said that the vote “highlights the growing attempts to advance anti-Israel policies in Congress”.</p><p>“We know our detractors are working to take the battle from the floor of the Senate and the House to the ballot box next year, seeking to elect more candidates who want to undermine the US-Israel alliance,” the group said in an email to supporters.</p><p>“With the midterm elections rapidly approaching, we must ensure we have the political strength and resources to help our friends win and help defeat our detractors.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He said IEEPA authorises tariffs because it allows a president to “regulate” imports in a crisis.</p><p>The states and businesses challenging the tariffs argued they are not permissible under IEEPA and the US Constitution grants Congress, and not the president, authority over tariffs and other taxes.</p><p>Neal Katyal, a lawyer for the businesses, said the government’s argument that the word “regulate” includes the power to tax would be a vast expansion of presidential power.</p><p>Tariffs are starting to build into a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/fact-check-could-trumps-trade-tariffs-pay-off-the-us-deficit\">significant revenue source</a> for the federal government as customs duties in June quadrupled to about $27bn, a record, and through June have topped $100bn for the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30. That income could be crucial to offset lost revenue from extended tax cuts in a Trump-supported bill that passed and became law this month.</p><p>“Tariffs are making America GREAT &amp; RICH Again,” Trump wrote in a social media post on Thursday. “To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America’s big case today.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But economists said the duties threaten to raise prices for US consumers and reduce corporate profits.

Companies across multiple industries, including Procter and Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods brand, announced this week that it would need to raise prices on a quarter of its goods.</p><p>The president has made tariffs a central instrument of his foreign policy, wielding them aggressively in his second term as leverage in trade negotiations and to push back against what he has called unfair practices.</p><h2 id=\"pressure-outside-trade\">Pressure outside trade</h2><p>Trump has said the April tariffs, which he placed on most countries, are a response to persistent US trade imbalances and declining US manufacturing power. However, in recent weeks, he’s used them to increase pressure on nontrade issues.</p><p>He hit Brazil with 50 percent tariffs over the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a key Trump ally who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt after he lost the 2022 presidential election.</p><p>Trump also threatened Canada over its move to recognise a Palestinian state, saying a trade deal will now be “very hard”.</p><p>He said tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were appropriate because those countries were not doing enough to stop fentanyl from crossing US  borders. The countries have denied that claim.</p><p>On May 28, a three-judge panel of the US Court of International Trade sided with the Democratic states and small businesses that are challenging Trump.</p><p>It said IEEPA, a law intended to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during national emergencies, did not authorise tariffs related to longstanding trade deficits. The appeals court has allowed the tariffs to remain in place while it considers the administration’s appeal. The timing of the court’s decision is uncertain, and the losing side will likely appeal quickly to the US Supreme Court.</p><p>The case will have no impact on tariffs levied under more traditional legal authorities, such as duties on steel and aluminium. The president recently announced trade deals that set tariff rates on goods from the European Union and Japan after smaller trade agreements with Britain, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p><p>Trump’s Department of Justice has argued that limiting the president’s tariff authority could undermine ongoing trade negotiations while other Trump officials have said negotiations have continued with little change after the initial setback in court. Trump has set a deadline of Friday for higher tariffs on countries that don’t negotiate new trade deals.</p><p>There are at least seven other lawsuits challenging Trump’s invocation of IEEPA, including cases brought by other small businesses and California.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Bondi, who took office in 2011, was also buoyed by the endorsement of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</p><p>As attorney general, Bondi led crusades against so-called “pill mills”, clinics that loosely prescribe pain medications, while leading some Republican pet causes, including a multi-state effort to overturn former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>She also led efforts to uphold Florida’s ban on same sex marriage, before its nationwide legalisation by Supreme Court order in 2015, as well as the ability for same sex couples to adopt.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During that period, Bondi sought to establish herself as a champion against sex trafficking and child sex abuse, launching the state’s council on human trafficking and an investigation into past abuse by Catholic priests.</p><p>As Florida’s top cop, she also had her first brush with Epstein, with critics accusing her of remaining willfully silent on a controversial non-prosecution agreement Epstein and his co-conspirators had struck with her predecessor.</p><p>They have said Bondi could have intervened as victims launched lawsuits challenging the deal, which saw Epstein plead guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution but serve only months in prison.</p><p>“But Bondi kept her distance from the state’s most prominent sex-trafficking case, even as Epstein’s victims pleaded with the courts to invalidate provisions of his non-prosecution agreement and filed lawsuits alleging he abused them when he was on work release from jail,” wrote Mary Ellen Klas, a Bloomberg opinion writer and former Miami Herald Bureau Chief.</p><p>“Her inaction helped to perpetuate what victims describe as a government cover-up that, along with Epstein’s death, has robbed those victims of their chance to get answers and hold their abusers to account,” she wrote.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3866407\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3866407\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3866407\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP280664461412-1753905099.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, right, speaks as Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov.

At question was whether Bondi had solicited contributions from Trump in 2013, as her office was weighing joining a lawsuit against Trump University.</p><p>Her office denied any wrongdoing, and the investigation was later dropped.</p><p>Despite those early contacts, Bondi was not an early adherent to Trump’s presidential ambitions or his nascent “Make America Great Again” movement.</p><p>Instead, she initially supported former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican primary. When Jeb dropped out of the race, she threw her lot in with Trump. From there, things accelerated quickly.</p><p>While still Florida’s attorney general, Bondi served on Trump’s first White House transition team. She left her post in Florida in 2019 and soon joined the Ballard Lobbyist group, representing the interests of Amazon, General Motors, and Uber, among others.</p><p>From there, she joined the White House legal team, defending the president during his first <a href=\"/news/2019/12/4/trump-committed-impeachable-crimes-over-ukraine-legal-scholars\">impeachment trial</a> in the US Senate, in which Trump was accused of conditioning weapons to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on then political opponent Biden.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>After Trump’s election loss, Bondi was among those spearheading unfounded claims that the vote was marred by widespread fraud. She helped coordinate former New York City Mayor <a href=\"/news/2021/6/24/giulianis-law-licence-suspended-over-trump-election-falsehoods\">Rudy Giuliani’</a>s infamous news conference at the Four Seasons Landscaping in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she flatly and falsely claimed that Trump had “won Pennsylvania”.</p><p>She went on to chair the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), a pro-Trump think tank that oversaw “a series of concerning lawsuits in recent years, particularly in the voting rights and elections arena”, as <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/pam-bondis-recent-history-troubling-doj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">described</a> by the Brennan Center for Justice. Publicly, she also floated prosecuting career federal law enforcement officials who investigated Trump.</p><p>In criticising her appointment, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee in January <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/dem/releases/loyalty-above-all-else-pam-bondi-passed-donald-trumps-loyalty-test-to-weaponize-the-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that Bondi had “the ultimate qualification” to be Trump’s attorney general: “loyalty”.</p><h2 id=\"bondi-s-tenure-at-the-justice-department\">Bondi’s tenure at the Justice Department</h2><p>That loyalty has generated much consternation since Bondi took office, with opponents accusing her of shaping the country’s top law enforcement agency in Trump’s likeness.</p><p>That has included hundreds of layoffs at the department, including investigators and prosecutors in the two federal criminal cases lodged against Trump before his November election victory last year.</p><p>She has also launched a task force to probe those investigations, while publicly decrying what she has framed as a conspiracy against Trump amid the career staff, saying the staff of the FBI and Justice Department were rife with employees “who despise Donald Trump, despise us”, as she told Fox News.</p><p>More recently, she launched a strike force to investigate how the intelligence community, under former President Obama, handled information related to Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election, in what some have seen as an attempt to distract from the Epstein imbroglio.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3866421\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3866421\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3866421\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25196705175056-1753905414.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks at a news conference at the Drug Enforcement Administration, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, in Arlington, Va.

In February, she brazenly told Fox News that she had Epstein’s long-sought “client list” – thought to contain the names of the powerful figures the billionaire blackmailed via his sex scheme – “sitting on my desk right now”.</p><p>Months later, the White House would say Bondi was referring to the entirety of Epstein’s case files, and not specifically the list long sought by MAGA’s most influential voices.</p><p>That came shortly after the Justice Department in July released a memo, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/7/epstein-no-client-list-died-suicide-justice-department-says\">stating flatly</a>: “This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list'”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
