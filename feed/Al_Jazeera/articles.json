We have representatives from the younger generation, and we hope they will do something good,” she said, referring to the six NCP winners.</p><p>Many young Bangladeshis felt the NCP failed to build up a big enough support base in time for ‌the vote.</p><p>“They did not live up to the hopes and dreams people had after the 2024 uprising,” 23-year-old university student Sohanur Rahman said. “The NCP’s alignment with Jamaat felt like a betrayal, and many young voters like us chose not to support them.”</p><p>NCP spokesperson Asif Mahmud said the ⁠party would rebuild itself in opposition and focus on local government elections due in a year.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-beginning\">‘A new beginning’</h2><p>The South Asian country of 173 million people has one of the world’s youngest populations, with approximately 44 percent of its vote bank – 56 million – between the ages of 18 and 37.</p><p>The election outcome is widely seen as a chance to restore stability after months of upheaval that followed the 2024 uprising, which toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Security forces at the time, acting on her orders, killed more than 1,400 people, according to the United Nations. Hasina has since been handed a death sentence in absentia for the crackdown.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hasina, currently living in exile in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, have for decades towered over the country’s political landscape. Rahman’s father, Ziaur Rahman, a key figure in Bangladesh’s independence struggle, also led the nation from 1977 until his assassination in 1981.</p><p>Rahman, who is likely to be sworn in on Tuesday, has pledged that his administration will prioritise the rule of law.</p><p>“Our position is clear. Peace and order must be maintained at any cost. No wrongdoing or unlawful activity will be tolerated,” he said at a news conference on Saturday. “Regardless of party, religion, race, or differing opinions, under no circumstances will attacks by the strong against the weak be accepted. Justice will be our guiding principle.”</p><p>Shakil Ahmed, a government and politics professor at Jahangirnagar University, said ⁠the Jamaat-NCP alliance pushed away young voters who had wanted a new political class after the fall of Hasina.</p><p>“Many saw it as a retreat into old politics rather than a break from it,” Ahmed said. “This decision divided the youth vote and strengthened support for the BNP under Tarique Rahman, which appeared more organised and capable of governing.”</p><p>However, for student Farhan Ullash, the vote felt like a long-awaited break with the past.</p><p>“After all, the election was a kind of dream for us, a new beginning for Bangladesh,” he said. “I know already BNP is going to make the government. I hope they will listen to us.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "time": "2026-02-15T08:33:35",
            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_699171d84a-1771139544.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"170\" data-end=\"513\">For decades, the Palestinian cause has found its most receptive audiences on the political left. Progressive movements, human rights organisations and anticolonial traditions have offered language, solidarity and moral clarity. That alignment made sense. It still does. But in today’s political landscape, it cannot on its own shift policy.</p><p data-start=\"515\" data-end=\"646\">If policy is shaped in spaces dominated by security thinking and conservative power, then advocacy must reach those spaces too.</p><p data-start=\"648\" data-end=\"1116\">Across much of the West, decisions on military aid, diplomatic positioning and protest law are shaped less by activist pressure and more by security-driven political calculations. The language that dominates these arenas is not primarily moral or historical. It is strategic, legal and institutional. In that context, a strategy that confines engagement largely to sympathetic spaces may preserve solidarity, but it does little to alter the centres of decision-making.</p><p data-start=\"263\" data-end=\"480\">The Palestinian movement has achieved unprecedented visibility, particularly since the start of Israel’s latest genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians and reduced much of the Strip to rubble. Public awareness has grown. Legal scrutiny has intensified. International institutions have been drawn into the debate. Yet visibility has not translated into leverage. Arms continue to flow. Diplomatic cover persists. Restrictions on pro-Palestinian protests have expanded in several Western states. Moral clarity alone has not been enough.</p><p data-start=\"1603\" data-end=\"1704\">Recent developments across Western capitals illustrate this gap between visibility and influence.</p><p data-start=\"1706\" data-end=\"2304\">In Germany, local authorities have outright banned or heavily restricted pro-Palestinian demonstrations on security grounds. In parts of the United States, student encampments have been cleared by police, and state legislatures have penalised institutions seen as tolerating boycott campaigns. In the United Kingdom, large demonstrations have been framed primarily through the language of extremism and public order. In each case, the debate has centred less on international law or occupation and more on domestic security and counter-extremism, the terrain on which governments feel most confident.</p><p data-start=\"2306\" data-end=\"2769\">Part of the challenge lies in how engagement has been structured. The Palestinian cause is not marginal, extremist or morally ambiguous. It is rooted in international law, the principle of self-determination and the right of a civilian population to live free from occupation and collective punishment. Those principles are not inherently left-wing. They speak to law, sovereignty and the limits of state power, concepts that resonate across political traditions.</p><p data-start=\"2771\" data-end=\"3139\">And yet, Palestinian advocacy in Western capitals has often been framed primarily through anticolonial and human rights language, registers that resonate strongly on the left but less so within conservative political cultures. As a result, the cause is frequently perceived as ideologically aligned rather than universally grounded. That perception narrows its reach.</p><p data-start=\"3141\" data-end=\"3605\">When Palestinian claims are not articulated in the security and legal vocabulary that underpins much of right-leaning political discourse, others define them instead. The dominant framing becomes one of terrorism, instability or civilisational conflict. Occupation is recast as security management. Collective punishment is rebranded as deterrence. In such an environment, silence or limited engagement does not preserve principle. It leaves the field uncontested.</p><p data-start=\"3607\" data-end=\"4102\">Engaging the right does not mean diluting demands or moderating language about occupation, apartheid or civilian harm. It does not mean legitimising racism or Islamophobia. It carries risks of misrepresentation, hostility or bad-faith engagement, but disengagement carries the greater risk of irrelevance. It means recognising that political persuasion requires translation as well as conviction. Arguments must be made in terms that intersect with the priorities of those who hold power.</p><p data-start=\"4104\" data-end=\"4313\">That may mean briefing conservative legislators, publishing in right-leaning policy forums, or framing arguments in parliamentary and security committee settings rather than exclusively in activist spaces.</p><p data-start=\"4315\" data-end=\"4778\">This might mean arguing that indefinite occupation undermines Israel’s own long-term security by entrenching permanent instability. It might mean demonstrating that selective enforcement of international law weakens Western governments’ credibility in Ukraine, Taiwan or elsewhere. It might mean showing that impunity for one ally erodes deterrence globally. These are not left-wing talking points. They are questions of consistency, order and state interest.</p><p data-start=\"4780\" data-end=\"5294\">History suggests that political change often requires engagement beyond one’s natural allies. The African National Congress did not limit its outreach to sympathetic audiences; it engaged governments that had long branded it radical or subversive. Irish republican leaders eventually negotiated with conservative administrations deeply opposed to their aims. In each case, engagement did not signal endorsement. It reflected an understanding that political change requires dialogue beyond one’s natural allies.</p><p data-start=\"5296\" data-end=\"5840\">There is also a generational dimension. The contemporary right is not monolithic. It includes nationalists concerned with sovereignty, libertarians sceptical of foreign entanglements and conservatives wary of unchecked executive power. None of these constituencies is an automatic partner. But none is inherently unreachable. Some may remain unmoved, particularly where ideological or religious commitments are deeply entrenched. Treating them as permanently hostile ensures that the most extreme narratives dominate their internal debates.</p><p data-start=\"5842\" data-end=\"6264\">The discomfort surrounding such engagement is understandable. Many supporters of Palestinian rights fear that speaking in conservative forums risks normalising hostile frameworks or compromising moral clarity. But politics is not a test of moral insulation. It is a contest over outcomes. If policies are shaped within security institutions and conservative-led governments, then arguments must reach those spaces as well.</p><p data-start=\"6266\" data-end=\"6660\">The alternative is a form of self-containment: a movement that grows louder within its own echo chambers while policy remains unchanged. The experience of the past year makes this risk visible. The devastation in Gaza prompted global outrage and unprecedented protest mobilisation. Yet key Western governments did not fundamentally alter their positions. Sympathy without access proved limited.</p><p data-start=\"6662\" data-end=\"7017\">None of these diminishes the importance of solidarity on the left. That solidarity remains essential. But it cannot be the outer boundary of engagement. If the Palestinian cause rests on universal principles of law and justice, then it should be argued as such everywhere those principles are debated, including in rooms that feel politically inhospitable.</p><p data-start=\"7019\" data-end=\"7366\">The Palestinian struggle does not suffer from a lack of moral grounding. It suffers from restricted political reach. Expanding that reach does not require concession. It requires confidence, confidence that a just cause can withstand scrutiny in any ideological setting, and that justice need not be confined to one side of the political spectrum.</p><p data-start=\"7368\" data-end=\"7662\">In the end, refusing to enter difficult conversations does not protect principles. It protects existing power structures. If Palestinian rights are to move from protest slogan to policy consideration, the movement must be willing to speak not only where it is welcomed but where it is resisted.</p><p data-start=\"7664\" data-end=\"7832\">Justice should not depend on ideological comfort. It should depend on the willingness to argue, clearly, consistently and without fear, wherever power is exercised.</p><p data-start=\"7664\" data-end=\"7832\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Russian authorities said the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-the-european-countries-say-about-navalny-s-poisoning\">What did the European countries say about Navalny’s poisoning?</h2><p>In a joint statement, the five countries said analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively” confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.</p><p>The UK said on Saturday the poisoning demonstrated “an alarming pattern of behaviour”.</p><p>It held a public inquiry into the poisoning in the UK of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. It concluded last year that Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack.</p><p>“Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death,” the joint statement said.</p><p>The joint statement added that the latest findings underlined the need for Russia to be held accountable for “its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention”.</p><p>It is unclear how the European allies obtained samples from Navalny’s body.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-poison-dart-frogs\">What are poison dart frogs?</h2><p>The statement said analysis of samples from Navalny’s body confirmed the presence of epibatidine.</p><p>Epibatidine is a neurotoxin secreted by dart frogs in the wild in South America. These small and brightly coloured frogs are typically found in rainforests.</p><p>It can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-russia-respond\">How did Russia respond?</h2><p>The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny’s death, dismissed the latest allegations as “a Western propaganda hoax”, according to the state news agency TASS, while the Russian embassy in London said: “One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog.”</p><p>“When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted as saying by the agency.</p><p>“Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues,” TASS quoted her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger “officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia”.</p><h2 id=\"who-was-alexey-navalny-and-when-did-he-die\">Who was Alexey Navalny and when did he die?</h2><p>Navalny was a Russian opposition leader.</p><p>In 2008, he became notorious by alleging corruption in state-run corporations, such as gas giant Gazprom and oil behemoth Rosneft, through his blogs and other posts.</p><p>Two years later, he founded RosPil, an anticorruption project run by a team of lawyers that analyses spending of state agencies and companies, exposing violations and contesting them in court. In 2011, he established the Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which became his team’s main platform for exposing alleged corruption among Russia’s top political ranks.</p><p>Navalny was the target of an <a href=\"/news/2021/4/19/jailed-kremlin-critic-navalny-transferred-to-hospital\">earlier poisoning</a> in 2020, with a nerve agent in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him <a href=\"/news/2021/4/17/russia-navalny-could-die-at-any-moment-says-doctor\">flown to Germany</a> for treatment and recovery.</p><p>Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life. He died on February 16, 2024.</p><p>His death was announced minutes before the opening of the Munich Security Conference in 2024. In response, the conference made a rare schedule adjustment to allow his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, to address the conference, and she called for Putin to be held accountable.</p><p>“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof … I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,” she said on social media while attending this year’s Munich conference on Saturday.</p><p>Navalny was born in 1976 in the western part of the Moscow region. He graduated from Russia’s RUDN University, where he majored in law. He also earned a degree in economics in 2001 while working as a lawyer.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Clashes between the SDF and government forces this month over the former's integration with state institutions has seen large swaths of Kurdish-controlled territory ceded. Under a ceasefire agreement, camps and prisons housing ISIS detainees previously held by the US-backed Kurdish forces are to be transferred to the government.

It’s a big mistake to my mind,” he said. And Ukraine, he said, “keeps returning to one simple point”.</p><p>“Peace can only be built on clear security guarantees. Where there is no clear security system, war always returns,” Zelenskyy said.</p><p>Among the most contentious issues in the negotiations is Russia’s demand for a <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/ukraine-sends-reserves-to-stop-russian-advance-in-east-amid-diplomatic-push\">full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops</a> from the remaining parts of Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk that it still controls. Ukraine has rejected a unilateral pullback, while also demanding Western security guarantees to deter Russia from relaunching its invasion if a ceasefire is reached.</p><p>Zelenskyy, in remarks to reporters, said the US had proposed a security guarantee lasting for 15 years after the war, but Ukraine wanted a deal for 20 years or longer. He added that Putin opposes the deployment of <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/russia-says-it-will-not-discuss-foreign-troops-in-ukraine-in-any-format\">foreign troops in Ukraine</a>, as it would deter any future aggression by Russia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Zelenskyy said Russia had to accept a ceasefire monitoring ‌mission ‌and an exchange of prisoners of war. He estimated that Russia currently has about 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers, while Kyiv has more than 4,000 Russian personnel.</p><p>He also acknowledged feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Trump, who on Friday urged him not to miss the “opportunity” to make peace and told him “to get moving”. Zelenskyy also called for greater action from Ukraine’s allies to press Russia into making peace, both in the form of tougher sanctions and more weapons supplies.</p><p>Trump has the power to force Putin to declare a ceasefire and ‌needs to do so, Zelenskyy said. Ukrainian officials have said a ceasefire is required to hold a referendum on any peace deal, which would be organised alongside national elections.</p><p>Zelenskyy also expressed surprise at Russia’s decision to change its delegation to the Geneva talks and said it suggested to ⁠him that Russia wanted to delay any decisions from being agreed.</p><p>The Kremlin had said the Russian delegation would be led by Putin’s adviser Vladimir Medinsky, a change from negotiations in Abu Dhabi, where military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov was in the lead. Ukrainian officials have criticised Medinsky’s handling of previous talks, accusing him of delivering history ⁠lessons to the Ukrainian team instead of engaging in constructive negotiations.</p><p>In his main speech at the Munich event, Zelenskyy also denounced Putin as a “slave to war”.</p><p>He drew parallels between the current talks and the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler take part of the erstwhile Czechoslovakia, only for World War II to break out the following year.</p><p>“It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine, just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a great war,” he warned.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He said he also wanted to hear what compromises Moscow would be ready to accept.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he was feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Trump, who recently said the Ukrainian should not miss the “opportunity” to make peace with Russia soon, and urged him “to get moving”.</li>\n<li>He also accused Moscow of seeking to delay decisions by changing its lead negotiator – from the military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov during Abu Dhabi talks to President Vladimir Putin’s adviser, Vladimir Medinsky, in the Geneva round.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said that US negotiators had told Ukraine the Russians had promised a swift end to the war if Ukrainian forces immediately withdrew from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that it still controls. Ukraine had rejected that idea and instead expressed a readiness to discuss a US plan for a free trade zone in the region, while freezing the rest of the 1,200km (745-mile) front line.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said the only two options Kyiv is willing to accept are sticking to the current lines of control or the establishment of a free trade zone.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he hoped the US would stay involved in the negotiations and that there would be an opportunity for Europe to play a bigger role. “Europe is practically not present at the table,” he said.</li>\n<li>Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi told his audience in Munich that he agrees with Zelenskyy’s assessment that Europe should be more involved in efforts to end the war in Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy added that Russia had to accept a ceasefire monitoring mission and an exchange of prisoners of war. He estimated that Russia currently had about 7,000 Ukrainian troops, while Kyiv had more than 4,000 Russians.</li>\n<li>He also suggested that Moscow was opposed to the deployment of French and UK troops in Ukraine after the war, which Paris and London have said they are willing to do, because Russia’s Putin “wants to have the opportunity to come back”.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>French Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Noel Barrot said some G7 countries had expressed a willingness to move ahead with a maritime services ban on Russian oil, and France is “reasonably optimistic a deal can be reached”. He said the EU is currently preparing its 20th sanctions package against Moscow.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine and the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/which-countries-owe-the-imf-the-most-money-in-2025\">International Monetary Fund</a> agreed to ease some conditions, including sensitive tax increases, for a new $8.2bn lending programme, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">The European Union should “bring to life” a mutual defence pact anchored in its founding treaty, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Munich, as the regional bloc faces new threats from Russia.</li>\n</ul><h3>Olympics</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Zelenskyy awarded a top state honour to Olympic skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was disqualified from the Winter Olympic Games in Italy for wearing a helmet commemorating athletes killed in the war with Russia. Speaking in Munich, Zelenskyy said he had great respect for “all the Olympians who supported you and your position”.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

The Brazilian dusted himself off to score from the spot in the 25th minute.</p><p class=\"p1\">Madrid captain Fede Valverde gratefully scored the third in the 31st after being left too much space at the edge of the penalty box. It was Valverde’s first goal of the season.</p><p class=\"p1\">Garcia should have scored again before the break, when Valverde set him up for what looked like a simple tap-in, but Vinicius made it 4-1 with his second spot kick after the break, awarded after Aramburu was again penalised for bringing him down.</p><p class=\"p1\">Dani Carvajal made his long-awaited return around the hour mark, when he replaced Alexander-Arnold for his first league appearance since Madrid’s 2-1 loss to Barcelona in October.</p><p>Vinicius thought he had scored a hat-trick when he headed in a free kick in the 90th minute, only for it to be ruled out for offside.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Elsewhere in La Liga on Saturday, Borja Iglesias scored in stoppage time, after having another seemingly good goal ruled out through VAR, to salvage a 2-2 draw for Celta Vigo at Espanyol.</p><p class=\"p1\">A rueful Iglesias shook his head and smiled after having a 77th-minute goal disallowed when a long check determined there had been an offside infringement.</p><p class=\"p1\">His frustrations grew when Ramon Terrats pulled the ball back for fellow substitute Tyrhys Dolan to score what he thought was the winner for Espanyol in the 86th minute.</p><p class=\"p1\">But Iglesias equalised in the third minute of stoppage time when Pablo Duran set him up with his heel after a good run from Sergio Carreira.</p><p class=\"p1\">Espanyol remained sixth, and Celta a point behind in seventh.</p><p class=\"p1\">Also on Saturday, Getafe held on to upset visiting Villarreal 2-1, and the 10-man Sevilla drew with Alaves 1-1 in a duel between two strugglers.</p></div></div></body></html>"

what looks will be heated parliamentary elections.</p><p>Delivering his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Saturday, Orban pledged to push out “the foreign influence that limits our sovereignty together with its agents” as the opposition Tisza Party maintains an 8 to 12 percentage point lead over Orban’s ruling Fidesz party eight weeks from the April 12 elections.</p><section

href=\"/opinions/2025/6/6/to-survive-orban-is-plotting-a-far-right-takeover-of-brussels\">Brussels</a>, however, is a palpable reality and a source of imminent danger,” said the 62-year-old leader, who compared the EU to the repressive Soviet regime that dominated Hungary for decades last century.</p><p>Since returning to power for a second time in 2010, Orban has waged a campaign against “pseudo-civil organisations”, “bought journalists”, judges and politicians in his drive to build what he calls an “illiberal state”.</p><p>His crackdown on immigration has provided a blueprint for right-wing leaders, such as United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"ar-or-peace\">‘War or peace’?</h2><p>In Saturday’s speech, Orban signalled his work of clearing liberal forces from the country is only “half-done”, noting that Trump, who is backing him to win the upcoming vote, “rebelled against the liberals’ global-scale business, media and political network, thereby improving our chances as well”.</p><p>On Friday, Trump posted a new <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/trump-endorses-prime-minister-viktor-orban-for-hungarys-april-election\">endorsement</a> of Orban on his Truth Social platform, saying he’s a “truly strong and powerful leader with a proven track record of delivering phenomenal results”.</p><p>The US president’s comments came as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio prepares to visit Hungary on Sunday. Rubio will fly in from the Munich Security Conference in Germany with a stopover in Slovakia for talks with nationalist Prime Minister Robert Fico.</p><p>Orban, who has cultivated <a href=\"/news/2024/7/5/peace-mission-hungarys-orban-meets-putin-in-russia-defying-eu-leaders\">warm relations</a> with Putin during his current stretch in power, this week cast the April elections as a stark choice between “war or peace”, warning in a Facebook post that Peter Magyar’s Tisza Party would drag the country into the conflict raging next door in <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/in-ukraines-west-hungarian-minority-rights-collide-with-wartime-politics\">Ukraine</a>.</p><p>The prime minister has doubled down on his strategy of portraying Magyar as a “Brussels puppet” with billboards depicting him saying “yes” to a demand for “Money for Ukraine!” from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
