I think we’re going to override the local authorities,” Trump told the EPA chief from the stage.</p><p>But that push has reignited tensions with state and local Democrats in California, who accuse Trump of seeking to shift attention away from the lack of federal aid for recovery efforts.</p><p>The southern California fires were the first major natural disaster to confront Trump’s second term. Erupting in early January 2025, they tore through more than 38,000 acres (15,378 hectares), whipped by the dry, gusting Santa Ana winds.</p><p>At least 16,000 buildings were destroyed. The official death toll placed the number of people killed at around 31, but academics at the University of Helsinki put the number of indirect deaths closer to 440, with people succumbing to conditions related to poor air quality, delayed medical care and mental health causes.</p><p>The cost of the damage has been estimated at $65bn, with some figures putting the economic losses even higher.</p><p>Critics have argued that the rebuilding process has been frustrating and slow.

He also added that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would be investigating whether federal funds “were awarded arbitrarily, capriciously, or contrary to law”.</p><p>Trump used his public appearance on Wednesday — organised to boost his child savings account programme — to double down on his attacks.</p><p>“I went there a couple of days after the fire, met so many people on the streets. In many cases, they were fairly wealthy people, some very rich people. Some of the best houses in California burned down,” Trump told his audience.</p><p>The Republican president, whose fortune derives from his family’s real estate empire, proceeded to bemoan the slow pace of construction permitting, as well as California’s tendency to lean Democratic.</p><p>“It’s a national emergency,” Trump said. “What they’ve done to these people is horrible. It’s just horrible. And they’ll still vote Democrat. Can you believe it? After all, it’s just they get used to it.”</p><p>But Democratic leaders have fired back, questioning Trump’s motives and authority.</p><p>Previously, the two sides have clashed over Trump’s decision to send National Guard troops to southern California without Governor Newsom’s permission, with Democrats arguing that Trump’s efforts also represented an unconstitutional overreach of presidential authority.</p><p>In a statement to local media this week, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass emphasised her view that Trump had once again overstepped his bounds.</p><p>“The President has no authority over the local permitting process, but where he could actually be helpful is by providing the critical FEMA funding we have been asking for, by speeding up FEMA reimbursements, and by regulating the industries that he alone can impact,” the statement said.</p><p>Bass added that Trump could also be helpful by pushing insurance companies to compensate homeowners for their losses, as well as by encouraging banks to offer mortgage forgiveness and no-interest loans to survivors.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4272348\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4272348\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4272348\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26020477246343-1769630741.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gavin Newsom surrounded by cellphone cameras at Davos\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4272348\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">California Governor Gavin Newsom attends the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 20 [Markus Schreiber/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>Under Bass’s leadership, in January 2025, the city of Los Angeles suspended requirements under the California Coastal Act and California Environmental Quality Act to help speed up reconstruction efforts.</p><p>The city also ordered an expedited permit review process that required qualifying reviews to be completed within 30 days of a submitted application.</p><p>Still, as of Wednesday, a <a href=\"https://www.ca.gov/lafires/track-progress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">state website</a> monitoring reconstruction efforts showed that just 2,981 permits had been approved between Los Angeles County, the city of Los Angeles and the nearby municipalities of Malibu and Pasadena. A total of 6,811 applications had been received, according to the site.</p><p>But residents have also complained about delays in federal assistance, particularly as Trump takes efforts to dismantle FEMA and limit its payouts to disaster survivors.</p><p>Some California wildfire survivors have reported that their FEMA payments only covered a small fraction of the damage the agency estimated for their properties.</p><p>Governor Newsom, a frequent target of Trump’s, seized upon those accusations this week to issue a missive on social media that both mocked the president and criticised his lack of support.</p><p>“The Feds need to release funding not take over local permit approval speed — the main obstacle is COMMUNITIES NOT HAVING THE MONEY TO REBUILD,” Newsom’s press office <a href=\"https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/2016191022574010597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>“Mr. President, please actually help us.

Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,” the central bank said in its release announcing the decision.</p><p>Wednesday’s decision was widely expected. CME FedWatch, a tool that tracks expectations for monetary policy, forecast a more than 97 percent chance that the central bank would hold rates steady.</p><p>The tracker also expects two rate cuts in 2026, with the highest probability for the first cut occurring in June at the earliest.</p><p>“Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained low, and the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization,” the central bank said.</p><p>The decision comes amid signs of stabilisation in the US labour market. The US economy added 584,000 jobs in 2025, marking the lowest annual job growth since 2003. Payrolls rose by 64,000 jobs in October and 50,000 in December. While job growth remains weak, December’s figure represents a modest rebound from October, when the economy lost 105,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>There are indications that the labour market may cool further in the months ahead. This week, both Amazon and UPS announced tens of thousands of job cuts, some of which were driven by a push towards increasing the use of artificial intelligence in the workplace.</p><p>Another threat to the US economy and the job market comes in the form of a looming government shutdown. That can happen as early as Saturday, and depending on its duration, it could slow spending as federal workers are temporarily left without paycheques.</p><h2 id=\"political-tensions\">Political tensions</h2><p>The decision to hold interest rates steady comes despite Trump’s increased pressure on the central bank to cut rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has long stressed the Federal Reserve’s independence, and Wednesday’s decision is the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first since</a> Powell’s rebuke of a criminal Department of Justice investigation into him. The central bank chair, whose term expires in May, called the inquiry a “pretext” to pressure him.</p><p>“The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” Powell said in remarks in early January in response to a subpoena.</p><p>On Wednesday, in the news conference that followed the rate decision, Powell, in response to a question on what advice he would give to his successor, said, “Stay out of elected politics.”</p><p>Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case examining whether Trump has the legal <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/us-supreme-court-appears-reluctant-to-let-trump-fire-feds-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">authority to remove</a> Fed Governor Lisa Cook amid allegations of mortgage fraud, a hearing that Powell attended in a more public show of support for Cook than he previously had. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had criticised Powell’s plans ahead of the hearing, calling it “political”.</p><p>In response to another question during the news conference on why he attended the court hearing, Powell said he thought it through and came to the conclusion that “that case is perhaps the most important legal case in Fed’s 113-year history, and I thought about it and went”. He added that Paul Volcker had gone to a Supreme Court hearing when Volcker was the Fed chair in the mid-1980s, “so it’s precedented, and I did it”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fed Governor Stephan Miran’s term is set to expire this week. Trump picked Miran to temporarily <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/7/trump-to-nominate-loyalist-stephen-miran-to-the-federal-reserve-board\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fill the seat</a> vacated by Adriana Kugler in August while seeking a more permanent replacement.</p><p>Miran was one of two central bank governors who voted to lower interest rates alongside Christopher Waller.</p><p>The developments come as Trump searches for a new Fed chair. He has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/trump-says-anyone-who-disagrees-with-him-will-never-head-federal-reserve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explicitly called</a> for further interest rate cuts and for a chairman who shares his views.</p><p>“Anybody that disagrees with me will never be the Fed Chairman!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social in December.</p><p>The political pressure has caught the attention of global central banks as well.</p><p>“The Federal Reserve is the biggest, most important central bank in the world, and we all need it to work well. A loss of independence of the Fed would affect us all,” Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said on Wednesday. Canada’s central bank held rates steady ahead of the US central bank’s decision.</p><p>Macklem was one of the central bank heads who earlier this month issued a joint statement backing Powell. Last September, Macklem said Trump’s attempts to pressure the Fed were starting to hit markets.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat, as is the Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.1 in midday trading.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israeli forces retrieved the body of Ran Gvili, an Israeli man, who died on October 7, 2023, from a Palestinian graveyard in northern Gaza. Israeli TV showed Israeli soldiers singing a Hebrew song at the site. Western media spoke about the importance of the operation and this “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-retrieves-remains-last-gaza-hostage-military-says-2026-01-26/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moment of national healing</a>”.</p><p>Here in Gaza, the Israeli operation to retrieve the body spread fear, pain and death. Israeli soldiers killed four Palestinians near the graveyard and desecrated hundreds of Palestinian graves. Hundreds of Palestinian families now have to search for and gather the remains of their loved ones, and four families have had to dig new graves.</p><p>What was presented to the rest of the world as a “standard military operation”, was in reality, a serious crime under international law. Grave desecration constitutes a violation of a key provision of the Geneva Convention, which stipulates that dead bodies and graves must be respected.</p><p>In the Palestinian context, the attack on cemeteries is yet another form of collective punishment. It sends a clear message: that the Palestinian people will be denied dignity even in death.</p><p>This is, of course, not the first time Israel has committed crimes against the Palestinian dead.</p><p>Throughout the war, Israel has been attacking, bulldozing and digging up graveyards across the Gaza Strip. By January 2024, CNN reported that at least 16 Palestinian cemeteries in Gaza had been desecrated. Israel justified its actions by claiming that Hamas was using the cemeteries for “military purposes”. Satellite imagery and footage revealed that entire cemeteries were levelled, with Israeli troops converting some into military positions.</p><p>The excuse that Palestinian graveyards are desecrated only out of military necessity does not hold, however. Palestinian burial sites in the occupied West Bank are also regularly attacked. Just earlier this month, Israeli civilians <a href=\"https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/165890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stormed</a> a Muslim cemetery in Jerusalem and destroyed graves. In January 2023, a <a href=\"/news/2023/1/4/archbishop-says-desecration-of-jerusalem-cemetery-a-hate\">Christian cemetery</a>, where a lot of senior Christian leaders were buried, was also defaced in Jerusalem.</p><p>And it is not just resting places for the dead that Israel is ravaging. Even Palestinian dead bodies themselves are a target. Last year, the Israeli army sent <a href=\"/gallery/2025/10/23/gaza-funerals-held-for-unidentified-palestinians-bodies-returned-by-israel\">hundreds of bodies</a> of Palestinians to Gaza. Many of them had clear signs of torture; others were so mutilated that they could not be recognised, forcing the local authorities to bury them in mass graves.</p><p>In other cases, the Israeli authorities have <a href=\"/features/2017/8/10/why-does-israel-keep-the-bodies-of-palestinians\">withheld</a> Palestinian dead bodies from their families as yet another form of collective punishment. Currently, Israel holds the bodies of Palestinians who died as far back as the 1967 war. In 2019, the Israeli Supreme Court officially allowed the Israeli state to hold bodies for the purpose of “<a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/routine_founded_on_violence/20191022_hcj_greenlights_holding_palestinian_bodies_as_bargaining_chips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negotiations</a>”.</p><p>All of this – the desecration, the exhumation, the mutilation, the withholding of dead Palestinians and its legalisation – is meant to wipe out the memory of the deceased and prevent their loved ones from mourning them and having closure. It is meant to punish; it is meant to humiliate. Even in death, Palestinians cannot have safety and peace.</p><p>All of these crimes against the Palestinian dead have not received even a fraction of the media attention that the burial of the dead Israeli captives released from Gaza did. The humanising stories, the extensive photoshoots, the reports on official ceremonies were not afforded to Palestinian victims, whose bodies Israel has dug out and desecrated.</p><p>There were no reports on the Palestinian families who went to the graveyard and experienced the horror of seeing the remains of the graves of their loved ones scattered. There was no global sympathy for their suffering and pain.</p><p>By now, we have seen and experienced all kinds of unimaginable crimes committed by Israel. What has made them that much worse has been the global silence about them.</p><p>It is tragic that we should have to remind the world that graves are sacred and protected spaces under international law, including Palestinian ones.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

You can see that in the currency rate too.”</p><p>Iran’s rial <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/irans-currency-drops-to-record-low-against-dollar-as-tensions\">has been in freefall</a> after markets partially reopened this week, degrading trust in the national currency.</p><p>The rial hit a new all-time low of about 1.6 million per US dollar on Wednesday. Each greenback had changed hands for about 700,000 rials a year ago and about 900,000 in mid-2025.</p><p>However, Central Bank of Iran chief Abdolnasser Hemmati said at the meeting with the governors in Tehran that the currency market was “following its natural course”.</p><p>He said $2.25bn worth of foreign currency deals have in recent weeks been registered in a state-run market set up to manage imports and exports, which he described as an “acceptable and considerable figure”.</p><p>The comments from Hemmati – who was also the Central Bank chief from 2018 to 2021 and was impeached as economy minister in March – immediately drew fire from the ultraconservative Keyhan newspaper, whose editor-in-chief is directly appointed by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.</p><p>The newspaper said his comments run counter to the reality in the tumultuous currency market as well as Hemmati’s promises of price stability for essential goods when he re-emerged as the Central Bank governor last month.</p><p>While dealing with foreign pressure, Pezeshkian’s government has also been hounded by hardliners at home who have demanded immediate changes to his relatively moderate cabinet.</p><p>The infighting became so serious that the supreme leader publicly intervened, telling lawmakers in parliament and other officials during a speech last week that they are “forbidden” from “insulting” the president at a time when the country must focus on providing essential goods to the people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"subsidy-scheme\">Subsidy scheme</h2><p>For his part, Pezeshkian has kept his rhetoric focused solely on “combating corruption” through an initiative that has eliminated a subsidised currency rate used for imports of certain goods, including food.</p><p>Pezeshkian’s government argued the subsidised allocated currency was being misused by state-linked organisations. The scheme was supposed to deliver cheaper imported food, but that has not been the case.</p><p>The money freed up by the initiative has been distributed as electronic coupons among Iranians to buy food from select stores at prices set by the government.</p><p>But each citizen will get only 10 million rials per month for four months. That figure amounted to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/iran-warns-protesters-foreign-foes-as-unrest-persists\">just over $7</a> when it was announced during the protests early this month, but it is now worth closer to $6 as the fall of the national currency further erodes purchasing power.</p><p>To add insult to injury, the announcement of the subsidy scheme contributed to an abrupt tripling or quadrupling of prices for some essential goods, including cooking oil and eggs. Iran’s annual inflation rate remains untamed at nearly 50 percent and has been on a rising trajectory in recent months.</p><p>The top two state-run carmakers, which hold a large monopoly in Iran’s auto industry, have also been positioning themselves for yet another price hike as the end of the Iranian calendar year approaches in March.</p><p>One of the firms, Iran Khodro, said on Tuesday that it would increase prices by up to 60 percent while local media reported that the other, Saipa, was expected to follow suit. The government has reportedly intervened to delay or slow the price hikes.</p><p>TEDPIX, the main index of the Tehran Stock Exchange, continued its recent decline on Wednesday, losing 30,000 points to stand at 3,980,000. The index was at an all-time high of 4,500,000 last week, having made gains in early January.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Amazon acquired the Austin, Texas–based grocery chain in 2017, and it has since grown by 40 percent.</p><p>The cuts come alongside increased investment in AI. In June, CEO Andy Jassy touted investment in generative AI and floated the possibility of redundancies.</p><p>“We expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” Jassy said in a blog post at the time.</p><p>According to the AFL-CIO CEO PayWatch tracker, Jassy made 43 times more than the median employee at the company.</p><p>Amazon’s stock tumbled in midday trading and was down 0.7 percent. Overall, however, the stock is up 7 percent year to date.</p><h2 id=\"wave-of-cuts\">Wave of cuts</h2><p>Amazon is the latest company in a wave of redundancies hitting the tech sector at the start of the year. Earlier this week, Pinterest announced it would cut 780 jobs as the social media company reallocated resources amid increased investment in AI. Last week, Autodesk said it would cut about 1,000 jobs, also tied to AI.</p><p> </p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks redundancies in the tech sector, shows that more than 123,000 tech workers lost their jobs in 2025 as companies, including Salesforce and Duolingo, doubled down on AI investments.</p><p>But it is not just the tech sector facing redundancies. On Tuesday, <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/28/ups-says-it-will-shed-30000-jobs-in-major-cost-cutting-drive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UPS also announced</a> job cuts.

He listed Venezuela’s alleged ties to Iran, Russia and Cuba.</p><p>“[Having Maduro in power] was an enormous strategic risk for the United States, not halfway around the world, not in another continent, but in the hemisphere in which we all live, and it was having dramatic impacts on us, but also on Colombia and on the Caribbean Basin and all sorts of other places,” he told lawmakers.</p><p>“It was an untenable situation, and it had to be addressed, and now the question becomes what happens moving forward,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rubio said the US had three objectives in the South American country, the culmination being “a phase of transition where we are left with a friendly, stable, prosperous Venezuela – and democratic”.</p><p>In that, Rubio defended the decision of US President Donald Trump to continue working with the government surrounding Maduro, including interim President Delcy Rodriguez, while not initially supporting an opposition takeover.</p><p>Rubio said the first objective was avoiding civil war in Venezuela and aiming to “establish direct, honest, respectful, but very direct and honest conversations with the people who today control the elements of that nation”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He said the second objection aims for “period of recovery … and that is the phase in which you want to see a normalised oil industry”.</p><p>Speaking before Rubio, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate, focused little on the wider international law implications of the Trump administration’s approach to Venezuela.</p><p>Instead, she emphasised the cost, noting that the military operation and ongoing naval blockade have been estimated by some outside analysts to cost $1bn.</p><p>“So it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?”</p><p>Senator Rand Paul, a Republican, was more direct, asking Rubio is the operation against Maduro constituted an act of war.</p><p>“We just don’t believe that this operation comes anywhere close to the constitutional definition of war,” Rubio responded, arguing that Maduro’s election in 2024 had been contested and that he had been indicted on US drug trafficking charges.</p><p>Paul, who has been a vocal advocate of passing legislation asserting congressional oversight over future actions in Venezuela, described the arguments as “empty”.</p><h2 id=\"emphasis-on-oil\">Emphasis on oil</h2><p>During his testimony, Rubio appeared to downplay the prospect of future attacks on Venezuela, even as a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers remains in effect and US military assets remain surged to the region.</p><p>“We are not postured and do not expect to take military action,” Rubio said. Still, he declined to rule out future strikes to protect US interests.</p><p>The secretary of state also laid out plans for Venezuela’s oil industry, which has been a key emphasis of the Trump administration.</p><p>He said Washington and Caracas reached an agreement that “on the oil that is sanctioned and quarantined, we will allow you to move it to market … In return, the funds from that will be deposited into an account that we will have oversight over, and you will spend that money for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.”</p><p>He called the plan a “short-term mechanism”.</p><p>“And so we have created that, we hope to do is transition to a mechanism that allows that to be sold in a normal way, a normal oil industry, not one dominated by cronies, not one dominated by graft and corruption,” Rubio added.</p><p>He further hailed a law passed by Venezuela’s legislature that allows for more international access to the country’s oil industry.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly appealed for more access for US companies in the wake of Maduro’s abduction.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They are stationed at the Khmeimim airbase and the Tartous naval base in Syria’s Mediterranean coastal region.</p><p>Earlier this week, Russia reportedly withdrew its forces from the Qamishli airport in Kurdish-held northeastern Syria, leaving it with only its two Mediterranean bases – now its only military outposts outside the former Soviet Union.</p><p>Amberin Zaman, a correspondent with the Middle East news outlet Al-Monitor, published footage that she said was from the abandoned base in Qamishli on Monday.</p><p>Syria had historically been one of Moscow’s closest allies in the Middle East. Their ties go back to the Cold War when the Soviet Union provided extensive military and other types of support to the Baathist regime in Damascus, led first by Hafez al-Assad and then his son Bashar.</p><p>Moscow had been worried about the possibility of a “populist anti-Russia” government emerging in Damascus when Bashar al-Assad was overthrown, Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the London-based RUSI think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They feared he [al-Sharaa] would squeeze them out, but the Russians have been pleasantly surprised, even if they’ve had to downgrade their ties from before,” Ramani added.</p><h2 id=\"pragmatic-approach\">Pragmatic approach</h2><p>Al-Sharaa has taken a pragmatic approach, Ramani said, seeking to build his own relations with extra-regional powers as a hedge against possible political swings in the United States.</p><p>“The Republicans are lenient towards Syria engaging Russia as long as they keep Iran out,” Ramani said, “whereas the Democrats have been more sceptical overall and have wanted to move slower on the removal of sanctions and other issues.”</p><p>“Al-Sharaa also needs Russia, and that is why he is engaging,” he said.</p><p>Al-Sharaa played down Russia’s role in Syria’s war and sought to strike a friendlier tone during his <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/syria-seeks-to-redefine-russia-ties-al-sharaa-tells-putin-in-moscow\">first visit</a> to Moscow in October despite Russia providing refuge to Bashar al-Assad and his wife, who fled the country in December 2024 as al-Sharaa-led opposition fighters <a href=\"/news/2024/12/8/syrias-bashar-al-assad-the-president-who-lost-his-homeland\">advanced towards Damascus</a>.</p><p>Al-Sharaa has requested al-Assad’s extradition and said at an event last month that there would be justice for Syrians who were victims of the former president’s repression.</p><p>Putin will be especially eager to maintain Russia’s presence in Syria, having lost another ally this month when the US sent special forces to <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abduct</a> Venezuelan President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/remote-coercion-what-has-us-approach-been-since-abduction-of-maduro\">Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>On Tuesday, Russian Defence Minister Andrey Removich Belousov said after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart that Moscow was closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela and with Iran, which has close ties with Russia and has been facing threats of attack from the US in recent weeks.</p><p>Syria’s new leaders have reoriented the country’s foreign policy away from Russia and have said they’re seeking to build a strategic relationship with the US, which has been reciprocated by the Trump administration.</p><p>The US appeared not to follow through with warnings to the Syrian government against engaging the Kurdish-led, US-supported Syrian Democratic Forces this month but later helped broker a truce to end the <a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/syrian-army-offensive-overjoys-some-leaves-others-with-existential-fear\">fighting</a>.</p><p>A fragile ceasefire is now in place and has been largely holding.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
