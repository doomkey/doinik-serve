But the legislation failed to attract enough Republicans and fell short of the chamber’s 60-vote threshold to advance.</p><p>All Democrats voted for the bill alongside four Republicans: Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, as well as Susan Collins of Maine and Josh Hawley of Missouri.</p><p>Without the subsidies, premiums could more than double in cost on average, according to KFF, a health policy organisation.</p><p>For some, like Nicole Sheaff, a mother of four in New Hampshire, her prices would quintuple.</p><p>“I’m terrified we won’t be able to keep up with our mortgage. At the same time, going without health insurance is not an option. My husband has a chronic condition that he needs medication to manage, and he wouldn’t be able to afford it without health coverage. He’s lost family members to the same condition, and we simply can’t take that risk,” Sheaff said in testimony in front of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee earlier this month.</p><h2 id=\"republican-bill-fails-as-well\">Republican bill fails as well</h2><p>A Republican-led proposal earlier in the day also failed to pass. The measure would have sent up to $1,500 to those making less than 700 percent of the federal poverty line, which would be $110,000 for a single person and $225,000 for a family of four.</p><p>The payments are intended to help cover out-of-pocket costs for “Bronze” or “Catastrophic” plans on the healthcare marketplace to help meet the threshold they need to pay before their insurance kicks in.</p><p>The funds come with limitations that Democrats have long objected to, including verification of citizenship status and that the funds could not be used for abortion or gender transition treatment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>All Democrats voted against the measure and were joined by Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.</p><p>The proposed funds are far below the plans’ deductibles, meaning that even after that payment, a patient would be on the hook for up to $7,500 in out-of-pocket medical expenses before their insurance would start to pay for part of their care.</p><p>Those costs can rack up quickly for people with lower-cost plans, with a visit to a US emergency room costing between $1,000 and $3,000, while an ambulance ride can cost anywhere from $500 to more than $3,500.</p><p>Underscored by higher costs in food and housing, Felicia Burnett, national director for health care for MomsRising, a family advocacy organisation, said the families around the country are running out of ways to cut costs and higher healthcare bills only further the strain.</p><p>“The thing that I’m hearing, honestly, is fear. Families have reached the end of what they’re able to cut, and they’re fearful about their future. They don’t know what to expect when they’re not able to afford to go to the doctor or get the care that they need,” Burnett told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Families are going to be having to make really difficult choices between receiving treatment for their ongoing health issues or buying prescriptions and affording their other basic needs like food and housing.”</p><h2 id=\"americans-back-subsidy-continuation\">Americans back subsidy continuation</h2><p>Approximately 2.2 million Americans could lose their health insurance premium subsidies if they are not extended, according to the Congressional Budget Office, leaving low- and middle-income families struggling to maintain coverage.</p><p>A new Reuters/Ipsos poll found Americans back a healthcare subsidy continuation. Some 51 percent of respondents — including three-quarters of Democrats and a third of Republicans — said they support extending the subsidies. Only 21 percent said they were opposed.</p><p>Insurance companies have warned customers of the rising premiums in the new year, and Democrats argue there is not enough time to do anything but a clean extension of the tax credits. Congress is set to leave Washington at the end of this week and will not return until January 5.</p><p>With more people forgoing insurance altogether because of the cost, experts like Dr Bruce Y Lee, professor of public health at CUNY Graduate School of Public Health, says there will be additional strains on emergency rooms, which have an obligation to treat people with or without a way to pay for care.</p><p>“Flooding the emergency room with patients at different stages of conditions delays care for those who truly need it. Emergency rooms already have long waits, and this only clogs them further, affecting everyone, even those with insurance, because instead of seeing 10 people, the staff might be handling 50.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the country has a long history of killing journalists without accountability.</p><p>The October 13, 2023, strike, which wounded Al Jazeera’s Carmen Joukhadar and Elie Brakhia and left <a href=\"/news/2024/7/21/lebanese-journalist-wounded-in-israeli-strike-carries-olympic-torch\">AFP’s Christina Assi</a> with life-altering injuries, was well-documented in part because the journalists were livestreaming their reporting.</p><p>The correspondents, who had set up their equipment on a hilltop near the Lebanese-Israeli border to cover the escalation on the front, were in clearly marked press gear and vehicles.</p><p>Israeli drones had also circled above the journalists before the attack.</p><p>“We thought the fact that we could be seen was a good thing, that it would protect us. But after a little less than an hour at the site, we were hit twice by tank fire, two shells on the same target, 37 seconds apart,” Collins said at a news conference on Thursday.</p><p>“The first strike killed Issam instantly and nearly blew Christina’s legs off her body. As I rushed to put a tourniquet on her, we were hit the second time, and I sustained multiple shrapnel wounds.”</p><p>The AFP journalist added that the attack seemed “unfathomable in its brutality” at that time, but “we have since seen the same type of attack repeated dozens of times.”</p><p>Israel has been regularly employing such <a href=\"/news/2025/8/25/israel-bombs-hospital-kills-journalists-medics-dozens-more-across-gaza\">double-tap attacks</a>, including in other strikes on journalists in Gaza.</p><p>“This is not an incident in the fog of war. It was a war crime carried out in broad daylight and broadcast on live television,” Collins said.</p><p>Earlier this year, UN rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz called the 2023 strike “a premeditated, targeted and double-tapped attack from the Israeli forces, a clear violation, in my opinion, of IHL (international humanitarian law), a war crime”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-response\">US response</h2><p>Despite the wounding of a US citizen in the strike, the administration of then-President Joe Biden – which claimed to champion freedom of the press and the “rules-based order” – did next to nothing to hold Israel to account.</p><p>Biden’s successor, Donald Trump, also pushed on with unconditional US support for Israel.</p><p>On Thursday, Collins decried the lack of action from the US government, saying that he reached out to officials in Washington, DC, and showed them footage of the strike.</p><p>“I thought that when an American citizen is wounded in an attack carried out by the US’s greatest ally in the Middle East that we would be able to get some answers. But for two years, I’ve been met by deafening silence,” he told reporters.</p><p>“In fact, neither the Biden nor the Trump administrations have ever publicly acknowledged that a US citizen was wounded in this attack.”</p><p>Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed at least <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/another-us-citizen-killed-by-israeli-settler-attack-in-west-bank-family\">10 US citizens</a>, including Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh, over the past decade.</p><p>Senator Van Hollen said accountability in the October 13, 2023, attack is important for journalists and US citizens across the world.</p><p>“We have not seen accountability or justice in this case, and the State Department – our own government – has not done much of anything really to pursue justice in this case,” Van Hollen told reporters.</p><p>“It is part of a broader pattern of impunity for attacks on Americans and on journalists by the government of Israel.”</p><p>He called the US approach a “dereliction of duty” by the Trump and Biden administrations.</p><h2 id=\"israeli-investigation\">Israeli ‘investigation’</h2><p>Amelia Evans, advocacy director at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said Senator Welch’s description of the Israeli probe shows that the country’s “purported investigative bodies are not functioning to deliver justice but to shield Israeli forces from accountability”.</p><p>Evans urged the Trump administration to “take action” and demand the completion of probes into the killing of Abu Akleh in 2022 and the 2023 attack on journalists in Lebanon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It must demand Israel name all the military officials throughout the command chain who were involved in both cases,” she said.</p><p>“But as Israel’s key strategic ally, the United States must do much more than that. It must publicly recognise Israel’s failure to properly investigate the war crimes committed by its military.”</p><p>Israel often uses claims of investigation in response to abuses.</p><p>Former State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, who spent almost two years defending Israeli war crimes and justifying Washington’s unflinching support for its Middle East ally, acknowledged that tactic recently.</p><p>“We do know that Israel has opened investigations,” Miller, who incessantly invoked alleged Israeli probes from the State Department podium, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/3/former-us-official-without-a-doubt-over-israels-gaza-war-crimes\">said in June</a>.</p><p>“But, look, we are many months into those investigations. And we’re not seeing Israeli soldiers held accountable.”</p><h2 id=\"chilling-effect\">‘Chilling effect’</h2><p>Amid the push for justice, Collins paid tribute to his colleague Abdallah, who was killed in the 2023 Israeli attack.</p><p>“Losing Issam was tough on everyone,” he told Al Jazeera. “He was like the dynamo of the press scene in Lebanon. He knew everyone. He was always the first person to help you out if you’re in a jam. He had a larger-than-life personality.”</p><p>The killing of Abdullah, Collins added, had a “chilling effect” on the coverage of that conflict, which escalated into a full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah in September 2024.</p><p>The violence saw Israel all but wipe out nearly all <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/few-lebanese-families-return-to-villages-in-south-destroyed-by-israel-war\">the border towns</a> in Lebanon.</p><p>Even after a ceasefire was reached in November of last year, the Israeli military continues to prevent reconstruction in the devastated villages as it carries out <span><a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/israel-hits-multiple-towns-in-southern-lebanon-as-strikes-intensify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">near-daily</a></span><a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/israel-hits-multiple-towns-in-southern-lebanon-as-strikes-intensify\"> attacks</a> across the country.</p><p>“If the intention was to stop people from covering the war, then it has worked to some degree,” said Collins.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On October 14, the Swedish government announced it was nominating the CEO of IKEA, Jesper Brodin, as its candidate for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Less than a month later, as the current high commissioner, Filippo Grandi, approached the end of his mandate, Brodin resigned from his position at the Swedish furniture giant, which he had led for eight years. In January 2026, the office of the UN secretary-general is expected to present a preferred candidate to the General Assembly for what former UNHCR head of research Jeff Crisp has called a “pro forma election”. Can the former chief of an iconic multinational company become the world’s highest authority on refugees — and what will it mean if he does?</p><p>In interviews, Jesper Brodin often refers to a small pamphlet by IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, titled The Testament of a Furniture Dealer, as outlining the values that inspire his way of doing business: innovation, sustainability and collective effort over individualism. Does the UNHCR need to learn lessons from a “furniture dealer”? The question matters because Brodin’s appeal is often framed in terms of corporate values, yet it remains unclear how — or whether — these translate into the protection of refugees. Whether Brodin has any chance of making it to the Geneva post or not, the question is worth asking, for the role of IKEA as a donor and operational partner of the UNHCR is significant and is likely to grow.</p><p>While humanitarianism and business have historically been companions, particularly since the end of the Cold War, this is the first time a business leader has been proposed to head the UN refugee agency. The nomination comes at a time when the UNHCR faces a dramatic cash crunch, and when political pressures and anti-refugee sentiment are increasing globally. Many scholars and practitioners believe the future of the global refugee regime itself may be at stake. Understanding the implications of Sweden’s choice, then, requires examining how corporate humanitarianism now shapes refugee protection.</p><p>Many were taken aback by the nomination. Yet the move by Sweden is anything but surprising. Over the past three decades, corporations have taken on increased responsibility for responding to humanitarian crises, while traditional organisations compete for a rapidly diminishing pool of resources. Research on the <a href=\"https://www.commodifyingcompassion.com/publications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commodification of compassion</a> has shown how, increasingly, “doing good” and “doing well” have become one and the same. This kind of “brand aid” involved both promoting commercial brands (from Toms shoes to Starbucks) through their involvement in humanitarian causes, and turning aid itself into a branded activity — something most effectively done through corporate partnerships. It began around two decades ago but has now become the dominant model of humanitarian engagement. As one major humanitarian donor in Kinshasa told us, “It’s now all about collaborations between the private sector, businesses and philanthropists.” Indeed, when the desire to help becomes something you can sell, corporations such as IKEA can profit from involvement in global helping that builds their ethical branding. But can the UNHCR profit from being led by IKEA’s CEO? The question goes to the heart of a growing unease about the direction of the refugee regime.</p><p>We see three main problems here. First, UNHCR is caught between contradictory demands from donor states in the Global North and hosting states in the South. Brodin and IKEA’s brand of feel-good capitalism cannot reconcile these fundamental tensions over sovereignty. Jesper Brodin has been lauded as a businessman and touts his credibility as a leader and negotiator. “Trump likes people in the business world,” we are told. However, the challenges to the agency’s protection mandate require a vision that goes well beyond the smiling face of compassionate capitalism. While formally remaining the guardian of the 1951 Refugee Convention, UNHCR has been operating in what scholars such as Bhupinder Chimni have described as an “erosion” of the international refugee regime — a long-term weakening of asylum norms and burden-sharing commitments. Donor governments in the Global North have used their limited support for UNHCR’s humanitarian activities in the Global South as a way to deflect attention from the disregard for refugee rights within their own borders. How will Brodin fare in navigating these competing pressures — from containment agendas in the Global North to protection obligations that lie at the heart of UNHCR’s mandate?</p><p>Second, Brodin often mentions his experience as a supply chain manager in a company that has put logistical innovation at the core of its business strategy as an important asset for the job. Indeed, this aligns with UNHCR’s current focus on renewing its own supply chain strategy. He also talks about “bringing the values and the assets of refugees to the business community,” a phrase he uses to refer to refugees’ skills and labour potential. However, this endeavour has proved far more complex than he makes it sound. Almost 10 years after IKEA’s first attempt to integrate refugees into its own supply chains in Jordan, the number of people the programme involves remains small, and refugees in the country still face significant barriers to work and social security.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2100036X\">A study we published in 2021</a> highlighted that a focus on refugee logistics actually meant working towards integrating displaced people into global supply chains rather than providing them with material support or infrastructure. Whether for business or for disaster relief, logistics depend on networks of infrastructure and rules that only function through ongoing negotiation with governments.</p><p>Finally, the contradictions of IKEA’s corporate and foundation ownership structure — what makes it work well as a business — embody the paradox of mixing public needs for refugee protection with private objectives for profit. The IKEA Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm, has been working with UNHCR since 2010, supporting its operations in 16 countries. The UN agency defines the collaboration as “transformative”, highlighting how it has become a model for all its partnerships with the private sector. Moreover, the nomination comes at a time when major donor states, including the US, the United Kingdom and Germany, are slashing their budgets. In this geopolitical context, Sweden, while facing its own economic challenges, may well be seeking to stake its position as one of the last remaining humanitarian powers in the Western world. Brodin’s bid draws on Sweden’s perceived reputation for frugality and sustainability.</p><p>However, there is an unspoken yet fundamental contradiction between Brodin’s promise to address UNHCR’s crisis by “holding the purse strings” and the position of IKEA within global economic structures that have contributed to the humanitarian funding crisis in the first place. In 2017, following calls from EU parliamentary groups, the European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the Netherlands — where the company is headquartered — for its tax treatment of Inter IKEA, one of the two groups operating the IKEA business. The company’s ownership structure, which benefits its commercial operations, may also reduce its tax burden, thereby reducing contributions to public finances. Here, as in many other cases, big business promises to fix global inequality it has helped create.</p><p>In the present global climate of hostility to migrants and refugees, Brodin and IKEA’s brand of feel-good capitalism risks further hollowing out UNHCR’s protection mandate, reducing humanitarianism to a matter of well-managed supply chains. The stakes are high: when humanitarian priorities are shaped by corporate logic, core protections — from asylum access to basic assistance — risk being eroded. What benefits a business organisation does not necessarily serve the rights or needs of refugees.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It is unusual in international waters”.</p><p>“Russia has hundreds of sanctioned tankers sailing today, but they have not been boarded,” he pointed out.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">Experts say it is unclear whether the seizure was legal, partly because many details about it have not been made public.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">“In legal terms, there are really two layers here: what the United States can justify to its own courts, and what is defensible under the law of the sea,” Salvador Santino Regilme, a political scientist who leads the international relations programme at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">“Domestically, Washington has constructed a broad basis for seizing tankers linked to sanctions evasion … On that level, it is very likely that this operation will be treated as ‘legal’ in US law,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">The legality is far less certain under international law, however, Santino Regilme added.</p><p data-start=\"485\" data-end=\"933\">The US may argue that the boat was stateless. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), <a href=\"https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm#article110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ships are required to have “a nationality”</a>.</p><p data-start=\"296\" data-end=\"777\">The government of Guyana, Venezuela’s neighbour, said the Skipper was “falsely flying the Guyana flag”, adding that it is not registered in the country.</p><p data-start=\"296\" data-end=\"777\">If a vessel flies a flag it is not registered under, or refuses to show any flag at all, states have the “right of visit”, allowing their officials to stop and inspect the ship on the high seas – essentially meaning international waters.</p><p data-start=\"296\" data-end=\"777\">If doubts about a ship’s nationality remain after checking its documents, a more extensive search can follow.</p><p data-start=\"1699\" data-end=\"1973\">“Statelessness clearly opens the door to boarding and identification, but it does not automatically create a general licence to enforce any unilateral regulatory regime,” said Santino Regilme. “That step from ‘right of visit’ to full seizure of ship and cargo sits in a grey zone that recent scholarship explicitly describes as a ‘jurisdictional lacuna’ [a gap in the law] rather than a settled rule.”</p><p data-start=\"1699\" data-end=\"1973\">“If the tanker was indeed fraudulently flying a Guyanese flag, the US has a stronger argument that it could lawfully board to verify nationality. Whether it could then lawfully seize the vessel and its cargo to enforce purely US sanctions against foreign actors is much more contestable in orthodox law-of-the-sea terms,” Santino Regilme added.</p><p data-start=\"1699\" data-end=\"1973\">In previous enforcement actions against sanctioned ships, the US has seized not the ship itself but the oil on board. In 2020, it confiscated fuel from four tankers allegedly carrying Iranian oil to Venezuela.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"1975\" data-end=\"2289\">US law also allows the Coast Guard, which carried out this operation, to conduct searches and seizures on the high seas in order to enforce US laws, <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title14/pdf/USCODE-2024-title14-subtitleI-chap5-subchapII-sec522.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stating that</a> it “may make inquiries, examinations, inspections, searches, seizures, and arrests upon the high seas” to prevent violations.</p><p data-start=\"1975\" data-end=\"2289\">But as Santino Regilme explained, what US law permits and what international law recognises are two different areas. “Analytically, this is why reasonable experts can disagree,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"2510\" data-end=\"2946\">“Legal categories such as ‘stateless vessel’, ‘narco-trafficker’, or ‘terrorist-linked shipping network’ are often used as political technologies that normalise coercive measures aimed at reshaping another country’s political economy around US strategic interests,” Santo Regilme said.</p><p data-start=\"2510\" data-end=\"2946\">“From that perspective, this operation looks less like the straightforward application of a clear legal rule, and more like another move in a broader sanctions and interdiction strategy whose legality under international law remains highly contested, especially among states in the Global South.”</p><p data-start=\"2510\" data-end=\"2946\">If the US continues such actions, it could raise the cost of doing business with Venezuela, said Francisco Rodriguez, a senior research fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR).</p><p data-start=\"2948\" data-end=\"3091\">“It could significantly increase the cost of doing business with Venezuela and precipitate a deepening of the country’s economic recession,” he warned <a href=\"https://cepr.net/publications/americas-live-updates/#dec10242pm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a CEPR article</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-has-venezuela-responded-to-the-seizure\">How has Venezuela responded to the seizure?</h2><p data-start=\"247\" data-end=\"408\">Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry stated that “the true reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been exposed”.</p><p data-start=\"410\" data-end=\"654\">“It is not migration, it is not drug trafficking, it is not democracy, it is not human rights – it was always about our natural resources, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people,” the statement said.</p><p data-start=\"656\" data-end=\"1034\">The ministry described the incident as an “act of piracy.”</p><p data-start=\"1317\" data-end=\"1520\">The government added that it will appeal to “all” international bodies to denounce the incident and vowed to defend its sovereignty, natural resources, and national dignity with “absolute determination”.</p><p data-start=\"1522\" data-end=\"1682\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">“Venezuela will not allow any foreign power to attempt to take from the Venezuelan people what belongs to them by historical and constitutional right,” it

id=\"what-are-the-potential-consequences-for-venezuela-s-oil-exports\">What are the potential consequences for Venezuela’s oil exports?</h2><p data-start=\"80\" data-end=\"543\">Experts say the seizure could produce short-term uncertainty for Venezuelan oil exports, largely because “this has been the first time [the United States has]… seized a shipment of Venezuelan oil”, Carlos Eduardo Pina, a Venezuelan political scientist, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"80\" data-end=\"543\">That may make shippers hesitate, though the broader impact is limited, Pina said, since “the US allows the Chevron company to continue extracting Venezuelan oil”, and US group Chevron holds a special waiver permitting it to produce and export crude despite wider sanctions.</p><p data-start=\"406\" data-end=\"536\">Chevron, which operates joint ventures with PDVSA, said its operations in Venezuela remain normal and continue without disruption.</p><p data-start=\"538\" data-end=\"727\">The US oil major, which is currently responsible for all Venezuelan crude exports to the US, increased shipments last month to 150,000 barrels per day (bopd), up from 128,000 bpd in October.</p><p data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"1090\">Inside Venezuela, Pina warned the move could spark financial panic, however: “It could instil fear, trigger a currency run… and worsen the humanitarian crisis.”</p><h2 id=\"how-will-this-affect-us-venezuela-relations\" data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"1090\">How will this affect US-Venezuela relations?</h2><p data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"1090\">Diplomatically, Pina said he views the action as a political message to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, noting its timing – “the same day that [opposition leader] Maria Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Prize” – and calling it “a gesture of strength… to remind that [the US is present in the Latin American region].”</p><p data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"1090\">Maduro has long argued that the Trump administration’s strikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific are not, in fact, aimed at preventing drug running, but are part of a plan to <a href=\"/news/2025/10/28/is-trump-pushing-for-regime-change-in-venezuela-where-else-is-he-meddling\">effect regime change in Venezuela</a>. Trump has authorised CIA operations in Venezuela and has given conflicting messages about whether he would consider a land invasion.</p><p data-start=\"1110\" data-end=\"1618\">Analysts see this latest action as part of a broader strategy to pressure the Maduro government.</p><p data-start=\"1110\" data-end=\"1618\">“This is certainly an escalation designed to put additional pressure on the Maduro regime, causing it to fracture internally or convincing Maduro to leave,” said Cancian.</p><p data-start=\"1110\" data-end=\"1618\">“It is part of a series of US actions such as sending the Ford to the Caribbean, authorising the CIA to move against the Maduro regime, and conducting flybys with bombers and, recently, F-18s.”</p><p data-start=\"1620\" data-end=\"1936\">Cancian added that the broader meaning of the operation depends on what comes next.</p><p data-start=\"1620\" data-end=\"1936\">“The purpose also depends on whether the US seizes additional tankers,” he said. “In that case, this looks like a blockade of Venezuela. Because Venezuela depends so heavily on oil revenue, it could not withstand such a blockade for long.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "time": "2025-12-11T13:29:31",
            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap_693ac6cbe4288-1765459659.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"177\" data-end=\"973\">On September 2, United States President Donald Trump released grainy footage of a missile obliterating a fishing boat off Venezuela’s coast. Eleven people died instantly. The administration called them narcoterrorists. Venezuelan sources identified them as fishermen. Since then, the US military has conducted at least 22 strikes, killing 87 people, with investigations revealing that the first attack included a second strike to kill two survivors clinging to wreckage — a potential war crime under international law. On Wednesday, the US went on to seize an oil tanker in Venezuelan waters, an escalation the Venezuelan government described as “blatant theft” and an “act of international piracy,” underscoring Washington’s shift towards economic coercion alongside military force.</p><p data-start=\"975\" data-end=\"1225\">The Trump administration frames all this as “counter-narcotics”. Critics call it regime change. But the most dangerous dimension of this crisis has nothing to do with Venezuela at all. It is about the consolidation of executive power at home.</p><h2 id=\"the-oil-narrative-does-not-add-up\">The oil narrative does not add up</h2><p data-start=\"493\" data-end=\"1253\">If this were about oil, nothing about the current approach makes sense. The US produces more oil than any country in history, exporting millions of barrels daily. Neither America nor Europe faces an oil shortage that would require military intervention. Venezuela, meanwhile, sits atop the world’s largest proven reserves — 303 billion barrels — but its oil infrastructure is severely deteriorated. Production has collapsed from 3.2 million barrels per day in 2000 to roughly 900,000 today. The country’s pipelines have not been updated in 50 years, and restoring peak production capacity would require an estimated $58bn in investment, underscoring how far the sector is from posing any strategic threat that might justify military force.</p><p data-start=\"1255\" data-end=\"1948\">More tellingly, legal pathways to Venezuelan oil already exist. The US could lift sanctions, expand Chevron’s operations, or reopen the energy corridor — measures that require neither warships nor circumventing Congress. In fact, Chevron’s operations in Venezuela represent 25 percent of the country’s total production, demonstrating that commercial access is entirely possible within existing frameworks. This contradiction exposes how little the current strategy has to do with securing resources. Trump’s own Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the complexity, describing sanctions policy as a balancing act between displacing China and providing foreign currency to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p data-start=\"1950\" data-end=\"2356\">The fundamental shift in Washington’s Venezuela calculus has less to do with oil companies and more to do with private equity firms and defence contractors — interests focused not on barrels but on reconstruction contracts, mineral rights and territorial leverage in a post-Maduro scenario. Together, these dynamics make clear that the logic driving US policy lies outside the economics of oil itself.</p><h2><span>What emergency powers actually enable</span></h2><p data-start=\"255\" data-end=\"800\">The Venezuela narrative serves a different function: it provides the pretext for expanded executive authority through emergency declarations. Since 2015, the US has maintained a continuous “national emergency with respect to Venezuela” under the National Emergencies Act. This declaration unlocks access to more than 120 specific statutory powers, including asset seizures, commerce regulation and military deployment — authorities that bypass normal congressional authorisation and operate with minimal legislative oversight.</p><p data-start=\"802\" data-end=\"1455\">Trump has systematically layered additional emergency measures. In March, he designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organisation, expanded the legal definition of Venezuela’s government to encompass virtually any affiliated entity — from ministries to state-owned firms — and imposed 25 percent tariffs on countries importing Venezuelan oil. In August, he signed a secret directive authorising military force against Latin American drug cartels — a decision taken without coastguard involvement and relying solely on Navy assets, breaking with decades of maritime interdiction precedent and further consolidating executive discretion.</p><p data-start=\"1457\" data-end=\"2070\">Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth framed the scope clearly when he declared that alleged drug operations “will not be controlled by cartels” and promised to “map your networks, track your people, hunt you down and kill you” — language more consistent with warfare than law enforcement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio went further, stating that the Maduro regime is “not a legitimate government” but rather “a transshipment organisation” that facilitates drug trafficking — a characterisation that redefines diplomatic relations as a criminal enterprise and justifies treating state actors as targets.</p><h2 id=\"congress-abdicates-oversight\">Congress abdicates oversight</h2><p data-start=\"1828\" data-end=\"2422\">What makes this deployment unprecedented is not its size — though assembling carrier strike groups, B-52 bombers, F-35 fighters, submarines and more than 15,000 personnel represents the most significant US military presence in Latin America since the Cold War — but the absence of congressional authorisation. Lawmakers from both parties have complained they were not provided with legal justification, target lists or evidence about those killed. The Senate has twice rejected resolutions to limit Trump’s military authority on Venezuela, leaving executive power in effect, unchecked.</p><p data-start=\"2424\" data-end=\"2925\">Senator Lindsey Graham made the administration’s objective explicit, telling CBS that regime change is the goal and Trump “has all the authority in the world” to conduct strikes. Legal experts broadly characterise the maritime attacks as illegal under both US and international law. Yet classified briefings to congressional leadership — including recent sessions in which Hegseth refused to commit to releasing unedited strike footage — have produced no meaningful constraint on executive action.</p><p data-start=\"2927\" data-end=\"3291\">The pattern emerging is one of expanding presidential discretion: once invoked, emergency powers become self-perpetuating tools that normalise unilateral military action. Rather than being used for targeted interdiction, they are increasingly employed to engineer confrontation and accelerate regime change — all without a congressional declaration of war.</p><h2 id=\"the-real-cost\">The real cost</h2><p data-start=\"306\" data-end=\"681\">The most insidious aspect of this crisis is that it manufactures a threat precisely calibrated to validate expanded executive power. Oil does not provide that pretext — a foreign emergency large enough to activate military force — and label as terrorism does. This permits the exercise of authority without Congress, without oversight and, increasingly, without resistance.</p><p data-start=\"683\" data-end=\"1099\">Venezuela becomes useful not for its resources but for its role as a political prop in a constitutional drama. While Trump has openly threatened land strikes and stated that the airspace above Venezuela should be considered closed, the administration is quietly drafting day-after plans for what happens if Maduro is ousted — planning that proceeds regardless of congressional authorisation or international law.</p><p data-start=\"1101\" data-end=\"1494\">The Venezuelan people, already suffering under economic collapse and political repression, now face the prospect of becoming collateral damage in someone else’s power consolidation project. More than seven million Venezuelans have fled abroad, and those who remain endure the escalating danger of a manufactured crisis designed not to liberate them but to serve distant political calculations.</p><p data-start=\"1496\" data-end=\"1962\">This is not an oil grab. It is a power grab — one that uses Venezuela as a pawn while setting precedents that will outlast any single administration. The question is not whether Maduro’s regime deserves international condemnation; it does. The question is whether democracies should abandon their own constitutional principles to achieve regime change abroad. On the current trajectory, the answer appears to be yes — and that is the most dangerous precedent of all.</p><p data-start=\"1496\" data-end=\"1962\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
