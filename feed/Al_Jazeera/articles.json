Hungarian is taught as a subject and, in some cases, used for a limited number of classes or subjects.</p><p>Kornelia said that using more Ukrainian at school had made it her dominant language, but only by a small margin – something she said she could easily address with practice.</p><p>Sofia, a 15-year-old student from Uzhhorod of Ukrainian heritage who knows only a few Hungarian phrases, said political tensions are not reflected on the ground.</p><p>“I have friends who speak with each other all the time in Hungarian – the idea that we would have a problem with it simply is not true,” she said.</p><p>Yulia, a 20-year-old assistant in a bookshop, described life in Uzhhorod – the region’s largest city and capital, which is shielded by the Carpathian mountains and close to several NATO states – as “multicultural and warm, where everyone lives in peace”.</p><p>She said since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, locals, rather than squabbling over small differences, have focused on dealing with the influx of people now visiting the area due to its relative safety, compared with the rest of Ukraine.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298784\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298784\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4298784 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/A-child-aboard-a-train-headed-for-Poland-1770576553.jpg?resize=770%2C530&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4298784\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A child looks out of a train headed to western Ukraine during the first weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine [File: Nils Adler/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Lajosi-Moore said <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/ukraines-zelenskyy-calls-on-hungarys-orban-to-stop-blocking-eu-bid\">Budapest</a> has “increasingly chosen escalation” over mediation – a strategy she argued does not serve the interests of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine.</p><p>She added that this approach aligns with Orban’s support for nationalist and far-right politicians elsewhere in the region, including George Simion in Romania and Robert Fico in Slovakia, both of whom are associated with contentious debates over nationalism, minority rights and democratic standards.</p><p>If Budapest genuinely cared about minority rights,” Lajosi-Moore said, it would rely on European Union minority-protection mechanisms, preserve stable relations with neighbouring states, and consistently foreground human and minority rights – rather than allowing the issue to become entangled in wartime geopolitics.</p><p>Budapest could soften its stance, she said, if it were able to show domestic audiences concrete progress – framing it as: “We secured safeguards, now we support the next step.”</p><p>She added that in this scenario, Kyiv would be required to deliver “tangible, measurable results” on minority protections.</p></div></div></body></html>"

24km (15 miles) north of the US-Mexico border.</p><p>Authorities had already said they believed the victim, who is described as mentally sound but with little mobility, was taken against her will,

was still alive.</p><p>Until now, authorities have left it unclear whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic.</p><p>Connor Hagan, a spokesperson for the FBI, which has posted digital billboards about the case in major cities from Texas to California, said Monday that the agency was not aware of ongoing communication between Guthrie’s family and any suspected kidnappers.</p><p>Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said repeatedly that Nancy Guthrie takes several medications, prompting concerns from the start that she could die without them.</p><p>Former FBI agent Katherine Schweit told The Associated Press news agency that the released footage would “get the phone ringing for lots of potential leads” even if the individual’s face

becoming the seventh batch of returnees to make the journey since the partial reopening of the key transit point earlier this month, a painfully slow process riven by Israeli military control.</p><p>The group of returnees arrived on Tuesday evening in World Health Organization buses, and were taken to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, an Al Jazeera team on the ground reported.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Like those who have previously made the journey, the returnees described being subjected to <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/palestinian-women-recount-journey-of-horror-at-gazas-rafah-crossing\">humiliating searches and interrogations</a> by the Israeli military, which controls the Palestinian side of the key crossing point.</p><p>The Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt – the only way in or out of the enclave for nearly all of Gaza’s more than two million residents – was kept shut by Israeli authorities for most of its genocidal war and only partially reopened on February 2.</p><p>With its reopening, a key condition of the United States-brokered “ceasefire” deal intended to end the war, Israel is allowing a limited number of pre-approved and heavily vetted people to travel, allowing Palestinians who had left during the war and been <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/gaza-patients-head-to-rafah-crossing-as-people-return-amid-israeli-attacks\">stranded outside</a> to return, and enabling the transfer of patients desperately needing medical treatment in other countries.</p><p>With the latest arrivals, 172 Palestinians have returned to the Gaza Strip since the crossing’s reopening, while a mere 250 people – patients requiring medical treatment abroad, and their companions – have left, Gaza’s Government Media Office says.</p><p>The pace of medical evacuations since the crossing’s partial reopening has been slower than the numbers promised – the “ceasefire” agreement mentioned 50 patients leaving the Strip each day, each accompanied by two family members – far short of what was required to meet the needs of the approximately 20,000 patients in need of medical treatment in other countries.</p><p>Gaza’s healthcare system <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/how-israel-destroyed-gazas-health-system-deliberately-and-methodically\">has been decimated</a> by Israel’s genocidal war on the enclave, with 22 hospitals put out of service and 1,700 medical workers killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.</p><h2 id=\"israeli-attacks-continue\">Israeli attacks continue</h2><p>Meanwhile, despite the supposed “ceasefire” agreement implemented in October,  Israeli attacks have continued to target the Strip on a near-daily basis.</p><p>On Wednesday, Israeli air strikes and artillery shelling targeted areas under Israeli military control east of Khan Younis in the south of the Strip, an Al Jazeera team on the ground reported.</p><p>The latest violations of the “ceasefire” came after at least seven Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza on Tuesday.</p><p>Among the victims were at least three people killed by Israeli shelling and gunfire in central Gaza, and another killed by Israeli army fire north of Khan Younis.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-approves-forced-expulsions\">Israel approves forced expulsions</h2><p>The attacks came as Israel announced it had approved the forced expulsion of two Palestinians convicted of crimes in Israel to Gaza, in an unprecedented move that has been condemned by rights groups.</p><p>The move is the first implementation of a law passed in February 2023 that allows for the revocation of citizenship and the deportation of those convicted of “terrorism”.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on X that he signed the revocation of citizenship and deportation orders for two Palestinian citizens of Israel who allegedly carried out stabbing and shooting attacks.</p><p>“I thank the coalition leader [Ofir Katz] for leading the law that will expel them from the State of Israel, and many more like them are on the way,” Netanyahu wrote.</p><p>The two men to be deported were identified in a statement from Katz as Mahmoud Ahmad, sentenced to 23 years in prison for shooting Israeli soldiers and civilians, and Mohammed Ahmad Hussein al-Halsi, sentenced in 2016 to 18 years for stabbing elderly women in Armon HaNatziv.</p><p>Israeli media reported that the two will be sent to Gaza once their sentences are complete.</p><h2 id=\"move-destroys-protection-of-citizenship\">Move ‘destroys protection of citizenship’</h2><p>Adalah, a legal centre for Palestinian rights in Israel, has condemned the move.</p><p>“These deportation orders allow Palestinian citizens of Israel to be physically exiled from their homeland,” Adalah said in a statement.</p><p>“The government has transformed the most fundamental human right into a conditional permit that can be revoked at will,” the group said.</p><p>Describing the move as “unprecedented”, Adalah said Israel’s action “violates the absolute international prohibition against statelessness and destroys the most foundational basic protection of citizenship”.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh said that while Palestinians have previously been deported to Gaza under prisoner exchange deals, this situation was different.</p><p>That was because the move would strip the men of their only form of identification, the Jerusalem IDs given to Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem by Israeli authorities.</p><p>“If that citizenship is revoked, they are essentially people without any form of identification. They would not be able to go to a hospital, to register their kids in school … they won’t exist,” Odeh said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The NCP was that very alternative: A centrist force with the promise of a “new political settlement”.</p><p>For Bangladeshis weary of the country’s two dynastic poles – Hasina’s Awami League, now <a href=\"/features/2026/1/30/can-bangladeshs-awami-league-survive-election-ban-ex-pm-hasinas-exile\">barred from upcoming polls</a> for its role in the bloody crackdown on protesters that killed an estimated 1,400 people in 2024; and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – Islam and his colleagues briefly appeared as a plausible break from the same old gravitational pull.</p><p>That hope, however, began to fade for some when the party opted to enter into an alliance anchored by Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamic party whose opposition to the nation’s independence in 1971 sticks in people’s memories, and whose social positions are a cause for concern among social activists and minorities.</p><p>The alliance has caused a rift inside the party. As it took shape, the NCP shed many from its liberal wing, including several senior figures and women leaders, who said the party was “drifting from its founding commitments”.</p><p>But Islam defends his decision to team up with Jamaat. “It’s an electoral alliance, not ideological,” he tells Al Jazeera. “We do have some common issues: Reform, combating corruption, good governance, sovereignty protection, and opposing hegemony.”</p><p>NCP candidates are standing in 30 seats as part of a seat-sharing deal within the alliance, out of 300 constituencies being contested in the election, which, observers say, is poised to be one of the country’s most consequential votes in years. By contrast, Jamaat gets 222 candidates, with the remaining seats divided among nine other partners.</p><p>As well as voting for the next parliament, Bangladeshis will cast votes in a national referendum on a package of reforms drawn up by a consensus process launched under Yunus’s interim government after the uprising.</p><p>Polling suggests a close contest between <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/bangladesh-election-who-are-the-key-players-and-parties\">two main blocs</a>: The BNP and a Jamaat-led alliance.</p><p>A survey released by the United States-based International Republican Institute (IRI) in early December last year put the BNP at 33 percent, with Jamaat close behind at 29 percent, and projected 6 percent support for the NCP. Another large <a href=\"https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/cks7ensdlc\">survey</a> – jointly conducted by Projection BD, NarratiV, the International Institute of Law and Diplomacy (IILD) and the Jagoron Foundation – positioned the BNP at 34.7 percent and Jamaat at 33.6 percent, calling it, statistically, “a very close contest”.</p><p>In a tight race, analysts say one small party could be strategically decisive – not necessarily by winning a large share of the national vote, but by helping make a baggage-heavy partner more palatable to voters, particularly swing and liberal ones, and by shaping post-election bargaining over reforms.</p><p>That is where Islam and the NCP come in: Too new to dominate on their own, but potentially large enough to nudge both the result and the terms of what comes next.</p><p>Or, as Islam’s critics argue, to help someone else claim July 2024’s full brand.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-02-28T131726Z_1366842436_RC2O3DAYRL2H_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-POLITICS-1770712876.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nahid Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nahid Islam speaks to a crowd during the inauguration of his party, the National Citizen Party (NCP), in front of the National Parliament building, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on February 28, 2025 [Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"win-win\">‘Win-win’</h2><p>When Islam joins a video call with Al Jazeera late one night last week, he looks spent. He has been walking the streets all day, he says, going door-to-door and crisscrossing the neighbourhoods he hopes to represent in parliament. The fatigue is visible in his eyes as he talks about what voters have told him they want.</p><p>“People wanted change then; they want change now,” he says. “They don’t want Bangladesh to be run the way it was before.”</p><p>They want “solutions to their day-to-day problems”, he adds, and they want “their true representatives”.</p><p>He, himself, is running for member of parliament in Dhaka-11 – a constituency which was previously an Awami League stronghold and includes Badda, Vatara and Rampura. He was born and raised there, but he faces a heavyweight BNP candidate, MA Quayum, a longtime party leader and former local commissioner with a strong base in the area.</p><p>Despite that, Islam says, he has enjoyed a warm reception during his canvassing. “The people’s response is visible… They trust me as one of their own. They seem proud of me… There is immense love.”</p><p>He is betting on his popularity and the alliance’s political machinery to carry his side across the line. “I am hopeful our alliance will secure the required seats to form the government, and the ‘waterlily bud’ symbol will win in this constituency,” he says.</p><p>Asif Shahan, a political analyst and Dhaka University professor, says Islam’s path is not straightforward against a BNP rival, but he argues Islam has two advantages that could give him an edge on election day.</p><p>“Nahid is the face of the July uprising,” Shahan says, adding that Badda and adjacent neighbourhoods were among the hotspots of the 2024 protests.</p><p>And, he points out, Islam will benefit from Jamaat’s ground operation: “In his area, Jamaat’s apparatus has been working long-term, he has their workforce, and a full vote bank.”</p><p>But his campaign is not just about him, supporters say. It is about whether a party built around the spirit of uprising can survive its first encounter with electoral reality and whether its strategic alliance will save it or swallow it.</p><p>Islam says the Jamaat partnership is, above all, therefore, a practical bridge over the NCP’s organisational weakness.</p><p>“This coming together is primarily for the election, involving seat-based adjustments,” he says. The NCP, he argues, “in a short time … was not ready for electoral politics”, and an alliance with an “experienced political party” was the price of competing at all.</p><p>“If it could be done alone, that would have been the best,” he says. “Since that wasn’t possible, we think an alliance is a win-win situation for everyone.”</p><p>In return, Islam says, the NCP gains election experience, organisational support and access to Jamaat’s vote bank, while Jamaat benefits from the NCP’s popular appeal. “Jamaat has a vote bank that is being shared with NCP, and NCP’s vote share will also be received by Jamaat,” he says.</p><p>He also insists the 11-party alliance changes the coalition’s public character, broadening what was once a more overtly Islamist bloc.</p><p>“Before, this alliance was completely an Islamic alliance,” Islam says. “But now it’s not a total Islamic bloc. It’s Islamic plus youth and other patriotic forces [which] have come together on some common grounds.”</p><p>For critics, however, that is precisely the point – and precisely the danger.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301858\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301858\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301858\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2260071500-1770712925.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nahid Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301858\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters gather during an election campaign by the National Citizen Party (NCP) and Dhaka-11 constituency candidate Nahid Islam in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on February 8, 2026 [Syed Mahamudur Rahman/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"they-re-the-trophies\">‘They’re the trophies’</h2><p>Samina Luthfa, a Dhaka University sociology professor and social activist, says she does not view the Jamaat-NCP arrangement as mutually beneficial.</p><p>“It gives Jamaat an edge, but not too much to NCP,” she says. “Jamaat is claiming the credit for the uprising fully by tagging the front faces of the movement with them, which helps Jamaat, not NCP as a political party.</p><p>“It’s an attempt to sell the idea that only they own July [movement],” she said. “It wasn’t Jamaat or Nahid Islam. It was thousands of ordinary people who came to the streets and gave their blood.”</p><p>Luthfa argues that when Islam sits beside Jamaat’s amir [leader], <a href=\"/features/2026/2/9/bangladeshs-jamaat-leader-shafiqur-rahman-the-man-everyone-wants-to-meet\">Shafiqur Rahman</a>, it lends Jamaat credibility. “But”, she adds, “it won’t be good for NCP as a party or for Bangladesh.</p><p>“They’re the trophies.”</p><p>Luthfa adds that the NCP’s identity has remained largely “reactive”, shaped more by “hasty responses to events and power moves” than by a coherent programme. “People don’t understand any more what their ‘new settlement’ meant,” she says.</p><p>Shahan, the Dhaka University professor, makes a similar argument, but grounds it in electoral maths.</p><p>“From different surveys, my sense is NCP’s vote nationwide is around 2 to 4 percent, highest maybe 5 percent,” he says, adding that for a party born less than a year ago, that is “not nothing”.</p><p>But he also argues that Jamaat’s motives for the alliance with NCP are clear: To soften its image and claim the uprising’s “full brand value”, given that many Jamaat activists also prominently participated in the protest, but “all the leading figures are in NCP.”</p><p>Jamaat, he says, “needed some faces” that would help it signal a shift: “‘We’re not that extreme; we are moving toward the centre.’”</p><p>Aligning with July’s young leaders, then, gives Jamaat a public-facing argument that “it is more flexible than its reputation,” especially after months when parts of its broader membership “argued for Sharia-based governance, even pointing to Afghanistan as a model”.</p><p>While Jamaat and NCP present themselves as the “pro-reform force that owns July”, they portray their main rival, the BNP, as “anti-reform”, Shahan says.</p><p>It is true that the BNP was sceptical about the July National Charter referendum for months during the transitional government, at times signalling a “no”, until party chief Tarique Rahman publicly endorsed a “yes” vote on January 30.</p><p>Islam tells Al Jazeera that his party had also explored a coalition with the BNP but failed to reach an understanding. “In the reform issue, we did not find BNP that sincere, and there is the issue of seat sharing,” he says.</p><p>Ultimately, he says, “BNP was not interested in doing an alliance. If you want an alliance, you have to agree on at least some political programmes. It seemed to us they wanted to remain standalone.”</p><p>The BNP is contesting the election with its own candidates in 292 of 300 constituencies, leaving just eight seats for allies the party described as partners in past “democratic movements”. At the same time, as many as 92 party “rebels”, overlooked or un-nominated parliamentary aspirants and former BNP figures the party could not accommodate, are also contesting the election independently.</p><p>Analysts say the numbers underline why the NCP was unlikely to secure anything like a 30-seat arrangement with the BNP, but some question whether the NCP needed to pay court to an established party at all.</p><p>“I totally see the benefit of NCP-Jamaat alliance going to Jamaat,” Shahan says. “Whether they succeed in image-cleaning is another issue, but that’s what they’re trying to do.”</p><p>The issue, however, is more complex. It is not simply that “NCP is not just allied with Jamaat,” but that “it is dependent on it.</p><p>“NCP has no organisational basis, except in a few places,” he says. “Jamaat is running their campaign, doing meetings, and going door-to-door. In most places, their votes are basically Jamaat’s except for one or two seats.”</p><p>Shahan argues that NCP, buoyed by “youth support and voters weary of dynastic politics”, could have used this election as a test to build an apparatus: Volunteers, polling agents, and constituency machinery. “But they didn’t,” he says. “They handed their entire system to Jamaat and completely depended on Jamaat.”</p><p>That creates a trap, Shahan says. “If the NCP wins using Jamaat’s machinery and later tries to leave, Jamaat can paint it as betrayal. If it stays, it risks being co-opted.</p><p>“Movement parties have two futures,” he adds. “Either they expand and survive, or they get co-opted by a bigger party. So far, NCP’s future looks like co-optation.”</p><p>Sabbir Ahmed, a political science professor at Dhaka University, says he initially had high expectations of the NCP emerging as an independent force that could promise a new political order, but he now wonders what kind of party it will become in this process.</p><p>“They should have fielded candidates in all 300 seats, not that they had to win, but to stand the party up and reach people. They missed that opportunity.”</p><p>And, he says, “by going into an alliance with Jamaat, they got themselves into more controversy and weakened their position.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301860\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301860\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301860\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257934764-1770712989.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nihad Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nahid Islam of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) and a candidate for the national election, waves as he canvasses in the Rampura area, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on January 27, 2026 [Kazi Salahuddin Razu/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"jamaat-s-social-stance-and-dilemmas\">Jamaat’s social stance and dilemmas</h2><p>The Jamaat-NCP partnership collides most directly with anxieties about women’s rights and minority rights, areas in which Jamaat’s record and rhetoric have provoked alarm among secular activists.</p><p>Jamaat was a junior partner in an alliance with the BNP when the late <a href=\"/features/2025/12/30/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-woman-pm-a-life-of-power-and-resistance\">Khaleda Zia</a> returned to power for a third term, and has worked with women leaders in the past</p><p>But in a recent interview with Al Jazeera, its leader, Shafiqur Rahman, was asked whether a woman could lead the party.</p><p>“Allah has made everyone with a distinct nature. A man cannot bear a child or breastfeed,” Rahman said. “There are physical limitations that cannot be denied. When a mother gives birth, how will she carry out these responsibilities? It is not possible.</p><p>“That is Jamaat’s party position, not the position of our alliance,” Islam tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>He has also tried to turn the critique outward, arguing that the NCP is structurally more open to women’s leadership than the traditional, mainstream parties.</p><p>“In NCP, the priority or opportunity for a woman to come to the topmost party position is the greatest,” he says, arguing that in older parties, women have historically reached leadership through dynastic family lineage, a reference that inevitably points to Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the BNP’s Khaleda Zia, wife of Ziaur Rahman.</p><p>Luthfa, the social activist, disputes the claim that the NCP has demonstrated a markedly stronger commitment to women’s rights or minority rights, however.</p><p>“And I don’t think NCP is any better on women’s rights or minority rights; they’ve shown what they’re going to do,” she says. “They nominated only two women; we expected better.”</p><p>Those two nominations, however, put the NCP just above the July Charter’s 5 percent bar – about 6 percent of its 30 candidates – while the BNP nominated 10 women, roughly 3.4 percent, and Jamaat fielded none, Shahan says.</p><p>The NCP is doing some things on its own terms, then.</p><p>It also announced a 36-point election manifesto this week, separate from Jamaat-e-Islami. And many supporters since have framed the party’s alliance with Jamaat as a “blessing in disguise”: If the NCP leaders enter parliament or cabinet, they argue, the manifesto could act as a restraining force against any attempt by Jamaat to advance more hardline interpretations of Islamic law in governance.</p><p>Nevertheless, Luthfa doubts the NCP can “keep Jamaat in check”. “They don’t have the numbers.”</p><p>Shahan points to nominations as proof of NCP’s limited leverage. “Jamaat nominated zero women,” he says. “If you can’t pressure Jamaat now, if you win later with their help, how will you keep them in line?”</p><p>Sabbir Ahmed is more optimistic about the NCP’s potential to restrain Jamaat. “If NCP gets even five seats out of 30, then they could make a difference in parliament,” he says. Restraining Jamaat, in his view, becomes possible only if the NCP has a real bloc.</p><p>“They will,” he said. “If Jamaat crosses the limit, then I see them resisting or walking out of that bloc.”</p><p>Five seats may not be enough, but Jamaat’s Rahman said on Sunday at a Dhaka rally that Islam would “definitely” be made a minister if their alliance forms a government.</p><p>And Islam says there are boundaries the NCP will not cross. “If our core positions, especially on women and minorities, are compromised,” he tells Al Jazeera, “the alliance will not continue.”</p><p>“If an alliance government is formed, policies will not be controlled by the ideology of any one party. Rather, work will be done based on the unity of the parties,” Islam says.</p><p>Ahmed argues that Jamaat has “shifted significantly” from its earlier positions and has publicly stated that it will not govern based on its old core ideology, which is to establish the Islamic way in all aspects of life based on Sharia, instead “speaking of inclusivity and even a national government”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301865\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301865\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301865\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257938055-1770713047.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nihad Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301865\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">National Citizen Party (NCP) Convener and Dhaka-11 candidate Nahid Islam greets voters before the upcoming national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on January 27, 2026 [Rehman Asad/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-good-boy-but-a-powerful-leader\">‘A good boy’ but a powerful leader?</h2><p>Islam says his brief time inside the Yunus caretaker government stripped away any illusions about how power works.</p><p>He credits the interim government under Muhammad Yunus with initiating the reform referendum process, but criticises its failures: It “tried to stabilise the economy but failed in law and order and managing public expectations”.</p><p>He describes the obstacles he faced while inside government, not only on sweeping changes, but in the everyday resistance of institutions.</p><p>“We wanted to change the president, change the constitution … big big things, and also in small things such as bureaucratic reform and many such things, we faced a lot of obstacles,” he says now.</p><p>Such was his apparent disillusion with the apparatus of government, Islam has previously suggested that it would be more effective to remain on the streets than to be in power. Now, he says that was said in a different context and insists that governing is where “parties gain the capacity to deliver for the nation meaningfully.</p><p>“Of course, being in power makes it more possible to work,” he says. “With the state, a lot can be done … in five years.”</p><p>Islam’s sharpest language is reserved for two issues: India and the Awami League.</p><p>Sheikh Hasina remains holed up in India while facing a death sentence for her order to kill protesters in Bangladesh, and, so far, India shows no sign of willingness to extradite her. But Islam argues that Bangladesh needs a relationship with its mighty neighbour based on “national dignity and national interest”. He lists grievances, though: “border killings, water disputes, political interference”.</p><p>“India has to change its policy,” he says, warning that a relationship shaped as warmly as during the Hasina era will not be accepted by “this generation”.</p><p>On the Awami League – Hasina’s former party, which is barred from the upcoming vote – he is uncompromising.</p><p>“We think the Awami League has no right to do politics,” he says. He says he wants “reconciliation and civic rights” for <a href=\"/features/2026/1/30/can-bangladeshs-awami-league-survive-election-ban-ex-pm-hasinas-exile\">supporters of the party</a>, but “not under the Awami League banner”.</p><p>There have been times when his party members have hailed the soft-spoken Islam as the “imam of democracy”. And some public figures, including veteran journalist and Yunus’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam, have floated Islam as someone who could be “the prime minister of this country [Bangladesh] … one day”.</p><p>Analysts say this election will test whether that aura can survive electoral reality.</p><p>Shahan warns that Islam is currently reaping the benefits of his role in the uprising, but a weak election result could trigger internal blowback and deepen what he refers to as an identity crisis.</p><p>“If NCP wins not even five seats, or only five, Nahid will face an internal challenge,” he predicts. “A towering figure needs a distinct party identity… If at the end of the day, Nahid equals Jamaat, Nahid’s value as a towering figure is gone.”</p><p>Ahmed is also sceptical about Islam’s leadership credentials. “He lacks political foresight and control over the party.</p><p>“He is a good boy, a polite boy,” he adds, “but good people don’t necessarily become good leaders; you need certain charismatic qualities, which I don’t see in Nahid.”</p><p>Islam himself has set a 10-year horizon: If the NCP cannot develop the capacity to form government within a decade, he said he would leave politics, during an interview with Dhaka Stream, a local news outlet, on November 5, 2025.</p><p>Talking to Al Jazeera now, he reaffirms this, but describes it as “a target and a challenge” for what he says should be enough for his party, the NCP, to bring a new political order.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the first time postal voting has been facilitated, <a href=\"/features/2025/10/28/bangladesh-expats-win-means-to-vote-could-they-sway-the-next-election\">benefitting about 15 million overseas workers</a> whose remittances form a vital part of the Bangladeshi economy.</p><p>Bangladesh has a “unicameral” legislature – a single legislative chamber which makes laws – the Jatiyo Shangsad or the House of the Nation, with 350 constituencies. Each constituency has a single-member seat.</p><p>Voting through the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system is used to elect 300 members, while the remaining 50 seats are reserved for women and are allocated to parties proportionally after the election results. So, for example, if a party wins 60 seats, it receives 10 reserved seats to be allocated to female politicians.</p><p>Bangladesh operates a plurality voting system under which voters make one choice from a list of candidates and, after the votes are counted, the candidate with the most votes wins the seat.</p><p>This means that if a party wins a large number of seats by only small margins, this will be reflected through an imbalance between overall vote share and overall seats won.</p><p>Theoretically, one party could win 51 percent of the vote in every seat, while another could win 49 percent in every seat. The first party would receive 100 percent of the seats, however.</p><p>The party which wins 151 seats forms a government without the need for a coalition with other parties, regardless of how well other parties perform. The party with the second-highest number of seats forms the official opposition.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299718\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_INTERACTIVE-1770627466.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Government_structure\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-s-at-stake\">What’s at stake?</h2><p>This is the first election since January 2024, when <a href=\"/news/2024/1/8/sheikh-hasina-wins-fifth-term-in-bangladesh-amid-turnout-controversy\">Hasina returned to office</a> for a fifth term. That vote, boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) amid a crackdown on opposition figures, was widely described by international observers and rights groups as not free or fair.</p><p>In July 2024, <a href=\"/news/longform/2024/8/7/how-bangladeshs-gen-z-protests-brought-down-pm-sheikh-hasina\">students in Bangladesh</a> began protesting against a conventional job quota system, which reserved a significant share of prized government jobs for descendants of Bangladesh’s freedom fighters of 1971, now widely regarded as the political elite.</p><p>Hasina ordered a brutal crackdown as the protests escalated. Nearly 1,400 people were killed, and more than 20,000 were wounded, according to the country’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT).</p><p>Hasina was eventually ousted, and she fled to India, where she remains in exile. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took over as the country’s interim leader in August 2024.</p><p>Last year, Al Jazeera’s Investigative Unit obtained recorded evidence that the former Bangladeshi leader had ordered police to use “lethal weapons” against the protesters.</p><p>In November, she was convicted, in absentia, of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/sheikh-hasina-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity-what-we-know\">crimes against humanity</a> and sentenced to death by the ICT in Dhaka. India has so far not agreed to send her back to Bangladesh to face justice.</p><p>After Hasina went into exile, her Awami League party was also <a href=\"/news/2025/5/11/bangladesh-bans-activities-of-awami-league-the-party-of-ousted-pm-hasina\">banned</a> from all political activities.</p><p>Besides the vote for parliamentary seats, Bangladesh will hold a referendum on the July National Charter 2025, which was drafted by the caretaker government following the student protests and outlines a roadmap for constitutional amendments, legal changes and the enactment of new laws.</p><p>This election will serve as a litmus test for change in the country, experts say.</p><p>“Regardless of its outcome, this election will carry profound implications for the political trajectory of Bangladesh,” Khandakar Tahmid Rejwan, a lecturer in global studies and governance at the Independent University, Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The result of the referendum will serve as a critical indicator of whether the political spirit of July remains resilient or is gradually dissipating.”</p><p>Rejwan added that whoever wins the election will also have to grapple with the “Awami League question”, referring to Hasina’s party, which has been barred from politics.</p><p>“Under these circumstances, determining the future of the [Awami League], how long a substantial segment of the electorate aligned with the party can remain politically excluded, and under what conditions the party might be rehabilitated and reintegrated into democratic politics, will constitute a central challenge for the next government.”</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-key-parties-and-candidates\">Who are the key parties and candidates?</h2><p>The biggest groups vying for parliamentary seats are the two main coalitions.</p><h3>Bangladesh Nationalist Party</h3><p>The centre-right BNP is leading a coalition of 10 parties.</p><p>It is led by <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/bangladesh-opposition-leader-tarique-rahman-returns-after-17-years-in-exile\">Tarique Rahman</a>, the son of the late former Prime Minister <a href=\"/features/2025/12/30/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-woman-pm-a-life-of-power-and-resistance\">Khaleda Zia</a>. In December, Rahman, 60, returned to Bangladesh after nearly 17 years of exile in London. He had escaped the country in 2008 amid what he deemed a politically motivated persecution.</p><p>The BNP was founded by <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/8/can-a-dynastic-heir-lead-a-post-dynasty-bangladesh\">Rahman’s father</a>, Ziaur Rahman, a prominent military figure in the country’s independence war against Pakistan in 1971, in 1978.</p><p>The party states that it was built on the principles of Bangladeshi nationalism. According to the BNP website, this is an “ideology that recognises the right of Bangladeshis from all walks of life, irrespective of their ethnicity, gender or race”.</p><p>The BNP has traditionally swapped positions as governing and opposition party with the Awami League since independence.</p><p>After Ziaur Rahman’s assassination in 1981, his wife Khaleda Zia led the BNP, serving twice as prime minister, from 1991 to 1996 and from 2001 to 2006.</p><p>During this time, the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JIB) was a key ally of the BNP against the Awami League.</p><p>After Hasina returned to power in 2009, the BNP came under intense pressure; Khaleda was placed under house arrest following a conviction in 2018 on corruption charges, but was acquitted and freed after Hasina was ousted in 2024.</p><p>Since Hasina’s departure, the BNP has re-emerged as a leading political force.</p><h3>Jamaat-e-Islami</h3><p>The JIB, commonly known as Jamaat, spearheads an 11-party alliance, including the National Citizen Party (NCP), a group formed by students who led the protests against Hasina in 2024. The party is led by 67-year-old <a href=\"/features/2026/2/9/bangladeshs-jamaat-leader-shafiqur-rahman-the-man-everyone-wants-to-meet\">Shafiqur Rahman</a>.</p><p>Jamaat was founded in 1941 by Abul Ala Maududi when India was still under British colonial rule.</p><p>In 1971, Jamaat opposed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan and was banned after the liberation. However, the BNP government lifted the ban in 1979.</p><p>Jamaat burgeoned into a significant political force over the next two decades, backing BNP-led coalitions in 1991 and 2001.</p><p>While Hasina was in power from 2009 to 2024, five senior JIB figures were executed, and others jailed for 1971 war crimes, and the party was barred from elections in 2013.</p><p>In June 2025, the Supreme Court restored its registration, allowing it to contest again. Jamaat is no longer allied with the BNP and is, instead, facing off against it as its biggest rival in the upcoming election.</p><p>In a bid to win support from non-Muslim voters, Jamaat is fielding one Hindu candidate, Krishna Nandi, from Khulna <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/what-is-bangladeshs-jamaat-e-islami-party-could-it-lead-the-country-next\">for the first time</a> in its history.</p><p>JIB ally NCP was formed in February 2025 by students who led the mass protests in July 2024. It is led by 27-year-old Nahid Islam.</p><p>Independent University’s Rejwan said the election will serve as a test of how strong the Jamaat really is, and will determine Bangladesh’s path on the global stage.</p><p>“A victory by the BNP would likely signal a move towards detente with India amid existing diplomatic strains, alongside a more balanced and diversified engagement with external partners that avoids rigid alignments or geopolitical binaries,” Rejwan said.</p><p>“In contrast, a JIB-led government may pursue a markedly different approach. It could seek to counter India’s apprehensions by cultivating closer ties with Pakistan and Turkiye, as well as with either China or the United States, or both.”</p><h3>Non-allied parties</h3><p>A JIB-alliance breakaway party, the Islami Andolan Bangladesh, and the Jatiya Party, a longtime ally of Hasina’s Awami League, are contesting the elections independently.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4299721\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4299721\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299721\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Political-barometer-1770627533.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Political barometer\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4299721\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-do-opinion-polls-suggest-so-far\">What do opinion polls suggest so far?</h2><p>A survey by the United States-based International Republican Institute, published in December 2025, put the BNP’s support at 33 percent.</p><p>The survey placed Jamaat closely behind the BNP, with 29 percent.</p><h2 id=\"when-will-the-results-be-known\">When will the results be known?</h2><p>In <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/timeline-of-past-bangladesh-elections-and-the-countrys-leaders\">previous elections</a>, unofficial results have typically begun to emerge early the following morning.</p><p>ECB officials have told local media, however, that the vote count may take longer this time as it will involve both the white parliamentary voting ballot and the pink ballots for the referendum on the July National Charter.</p><p>There is also a higher number of parties and candidates this time.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299725\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Past-elections-1770627595.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Past_Elections\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-election-so-significant\">Why is this election so significant?</h2><p>“After nearly 17 years, the electorate anticipates the opportunity to participate in a genuinely competitive and meaningful electoral process in which individual votes carry real weight,” Rejwan said.</p><p>Since Hasina rose to power in 2009, the fairness of each election in Bangladesh has been questioned by opposition parties.</p><p>Additionally, the election is significant because “young voters constitute a substantial proportion of the electorate, many of whom will be casting their votes for the first time”.</p><p>He said, “This generation was also at the forefront of the popular movement that challenged and ultimately deposed the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.”</p><p>The rapid rise of Islamist parties in both domestic politics and the public sphere, as well as the absence of the Awami League, one of Bangladesh’s largest and most influential political parties, from the electoral contest, are also highly significant, he said.</p><p>“This altered political configuration has transformed traditional alliances into arenas of competition. Former allies, such as the BNP and the JIB, now find themselves as rivals despite their earlier cooperation in opposing the Hasina regime.”</p><p>“Taken together, the longstanding public demand for a free and fair election, the unprecedented possibility of constitutional and structural transformation of the state, the decisive presence of a large Gen-Z electorate, and the growing popularity of Islamist parties such as the JIB render this election one of the most consequential in Bangladesh’s political history,” Rejwan concluded.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The majority of Palestinians in the enclave live like Nibal and her family: displaced and forced to survive in temporary shelters barely fit for habitation.</p><p>But Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, has gone on for more than two years, and the necessary reconstruction is unlikely to happen any time soon.</p><p>The majority of school buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel, along with the majority of other structures in Gaza. Many of the school structures that remain are now used as shelters for displaced families.</p><p>And students – both children at schools and young adults at universities – have largely missed any form of regular education since the war began in October 2023.</p><p>“My children used to have a routine before the war: wake up early, go to school, get back home, have lunch, play, write homework, and sleep early,” Nibal told Al Jazeera. “There was a sense of discipline.”</p><p>Now, she said, her children’s days are structured around their basic needs: sourcing water, getting meals from a charity kitchen, and finding something to burn on the fire for cooking and warmth. After all of that, there is little time left in the day to study.</p><p>Nibal, originally from the Bureij camp but now living in central Gaza’s Nuseirat, said her children struggled, especially at the start of the war, when all forms of education stopped for months.</p><p>And now, even though circumstances are getting better, it is hard to catch up. Many older children, who have missed out on education at a vital period of their lives, are unwilling to resume their studies.</p><p>“My eldest son, Hamza, is 16 years old, and he entirely rejects the idea of going back to school,” Nibal said. “He has been cut off from learning for so long and lived in displacement that he lost interest in education. He has new responsibilities. He works with his dad as a porter, helping people carry their aid boxes. He focuses on working to get money to buy food for us and buy himself clothes.”</p><p>“He grew up before his time; he bears the responsibilities and thinks like a parent would for his youngest siblings,” she said.</p><p>Nibal’s second son, 15-year-old Huzaifa, is eager to keep learning, but uncertain of his future, as he thinks it will take him years to make up for the time he has lost being unable to study properly.</p><p>For now, he is studying, but he is forced to attend classes in a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/gaza-children-risk-snipers-to-attend-tent-schools\">makeshift tent classroom</a>.</p><p>“I feel tired sitting on the ground, and my back and neck ache while writing and looking at the teachers,” Huzaifa said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"attacks-on-education\">Attacks on education</h2><p>Since Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, 745,000 students have been out of formal schooling, including 88,000 higher education students who have been forced to put their studies on hold.</p><p>Even with a “ceasefire” being in place since October, which Israel continues to violate, more than 95 percent of the significantly damaged school buildings require rehabilitation or reconstruction, according to UNESCO satellite damage assessments. At least 79 percent of higher education campuses and 60 percent of vocational training centres are also damaged or destroyed.</p><p>Ahmad al-Turk, the dean of public relations and assistant to the president of the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/islamic-university-of-gaza-resumes-classes-on-site-amid-israeli-destruction\">Islamic University of Gaza</a>, said that Israel has been deliberately attacking education.</p><p>“Targeting professors affects future generations, especially given the experience and skills these professors possess in their fields of specialisation,” al-Turk said. “There is no doubt that the absence of competent professors negatively affects students’ achievement, as well as the research process in the future.”</p><p>This is particularly worrying for Raed Salha, a professor at the Islamic University and an expert on regional and urban planning.</p><p>“University expertise is not something that can be replaced quickly,” he said. “It is cumulative knowledge built through years of teaching and research. Losing it – whether through death, forced displacement, or prolonged disruption – is a devastating loss for students, academic institutions, and society as a whole.”</p><p>Most families and university students also struggle with the online education system, as it is difficult to afford to buy electronic devices and mobile phones, even before taking into account the weak internet connection in Gaza.</p><p>“Teachers are trying to teach; students are trying to follow, but the tools are almost nonexistent,” Salha said.</p><p>“We cannot recreate the experience of students leaving home in the morning, meeting friends, sitting in university courtyards, libraries, laboratories, or participating in activities and events,” he said. “This experience shaped generations of students’ identities and sense of belonging.

In addition to allowing Jews to buy property in the West Bank – a Palestinian territory that Israel has occupied since 1967 in defiance of international law – the Israeli government has also ordered that land registries in the West Bank be opened up to the public.</p><p>That means that it will be easier for Israelis looking to take territory in the West Bank to find out who the owner of the land is, opening them up to harassment and pressure.</p><p>The cabinet also decreed that authority over building permits for illegal Jewish settlements in Hebron, and the Ibrahimi Mosque compound, would pass to Israel from the Palestinian Hebron municipality.</p><p>Moataz Abu Sneina has seen Israel’s efforts to seize Palestinian land first hand. He is the director of the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, a Palestinian national symbol and an important Islamic holy site due to its connection to the Prophet Ibrahim, also known as Abraham.</p><p>Abu Sneina said that the latest Israeli decisions reflect a clear intention to increase Israeli control over Hebron’s Old City, and the <a href=\"/news/2021/8/13/israeli-forces-attack-palestinian-worshippers-ibrahimi-mosque-hebron\">Ibrahimi Mosque</a> compound.</p><p>“What is happening today is the most serious development since 1967,” Abu Sneina said. “We view it with grave concern for the Old City and the Ibrahimi Mosque, which is the symbol and beating heart of Hebron, and the shrine of the patriarchs and prophets.”</p><p>The Ibrahimi Mosque site is also revered by Jews, who refer to it as the Tomb of the Patriarchs.</p><p>An Israeli Jewish settler killed 29 Palestinians after opening fire on Muslims praying at the mosque in 1994. Shortly afterwards, Israeli authorities divided the site into Jewish and Muslim prayer areas, and far-right Israeli settlers continue to strengthen their control over areas of Hebron.</p><p>Despite only numbering a few hundred, the settlers have taken over large areas of the city centre, protected by the Israeli military.</p><p>Abu Sneina explained that Israel has repeatedly attempted to strengthen its foothold inside Hebron and the mosque, and that the latest government moves are a continuation of Israeli policy that has only increased since the October 2023 start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>“This has taken the form of increased settler incursions, restrictions on worshippers, control over entry and exit, and bans on the call to prayer – all part of a systematic policy aimed at complete control over the holy site,” Abu Sneina said.</p><p>“[Israel] continues to violate all agreements, foremost the Hebron Protocol, closing most entrances to the mosque and leaving only one fully controlled access point,” he added. “This paves the way for a new division or an even harsher reality than the temporal and spatial division imposed since the 1994 massacre.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"taking-over-hebron\">Taking over Hebron</h2><p>Mohannad al-Jaabari, the director of the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee, a Palestinian organisation focused on the restoration of Hebron’s Old City, said that the Israeli government was already increasing its presence on the ground, in an effort to take control of the city.</p><p>He pointed to the confiscation of shops belonging to the Hebron Municipality in the Old City, the construction of dozens of illegal settlement units, and the reconfiguration of water pipes by connecting them to an Israeli water company’s network, creating what he described as “a massive apartheid system”.</p><p>Al-Jaabari warned that the ultimate goal is to establish a Jewish quarter linking settlements to the Ibrahimi Mosque by emptying Palestinian neighbourhoods of their residents.</p><p>“All Hebron institutions are preparing for a difficult phase,” he said. “We are bracing for a fierce attack on Palestinian institutions, foremost the Rehabilitation Committee.”</p><p>The Israeli government’s latest decisions open the door for what has happened in Hebron to happen elsewhere, with Israeli settlers establishing a presence in other Palestinian cities, forcing locals out, experts say.</p><p>Nabil Faraj, a Palestinian journalist and political analyst, called the Israeli government’s moves “dangerous” and added that they “have driven the final nail into the coffin of the peace process”.</p><p>He explained that Israel is reengineering the geographic landscape of the West Bank, expanding infrastructure to serve settlements, and seeking to strip the Palestinian Authority of administrative and security control.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-hebron-model\">The Hebron model</h2><p>Palestinians in Bethlehem are now worried that they will get a taste of what Hebron has already experienced.</p><p>One of the Israeli cabinet’s decisions on Sunday stipulated that the Bilal bin Rabah Mosque in the city, known to Jews as Rachel’s Tomb, would be placed under Israeli administration for cleaning and maintenance, after previously being under the jurisdiction of the Bethlehem municipality. The mosque’s cemetery has also been affected.</p><p>“It will affect the living and the dead,” said Bassam Abu Srour, who lives in Bethlehem’s Aida refugee camp. “Annexing the area would prevent burials and visits to the Islamic cemetery. This is extremely serious and completely unacceptable to us.”</p><p>In Bethlehem, Hebron, and the rest of the West Bank, Palestinians feel powerless to stop what they view as a creeping annexation.</p><p>Mamdouh al-Natsheh, a shop owner in Hebron, said he now has a growing sense that what is unfolding is an attempt to impose a permanent reality.</p><p>“The city is being taken from its people step by step,” he said. “Daily restrictions are turning it into a fixed policy that suffocates every detail of life.”</p><p>He added that the deepest impact is on children and young people, growing up in a city that is “divided and constantly monitored”, stripping them of a natural sense of the future.</p><p>“I fear the day will come when we are told this area has been officially annexed, and that our presence depends on permits,” al-Natsheh said. “In Hebron, a house is not just walls – it is history and identity. Any annexation means the loss of security and stability.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
