David Ellison’s father, billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, is a close ally of US President Donald Trump. Paramount declined to comment on Tuesday on Netflix’s all-cash offer.</p><p>Warner Bros will hold a special investor meeting to vote on the Netflix deal, with the streaming pioneer saying that the meeting was expected to be held by April.</p><p>“Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement.</p><p>Shares of Netflix, which is slated to report quarterly earnings after the market close, are up 0.7 percent. Paramount shares were down 1.1 percent, while Warner Bros’s shares were up 0.7 percent in midday trading.</p><p>Alex Fitch, portfolio manager for Harris Oakmark, <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/8/warner-bros-investors-torn-on-paramount-skydance-bid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the fifth-largest investor</a> in Warner Bros with about 96 million shares as of September 30, predicted the bidding war for Warner Bros may not be over.</p><p>“This new agreement only ramps up the pressure,” said Fitch. “The changes show that Netflix is serious about winning, and the accelerated shareholder vote means Paramount needs to act with urgency. Now, it is up to Paramount to provide a clearly superior offer if they want to get this done.”</p><p>Netflix shares have fallen almost 15 percent since announcing the merger on December 5, closing at $88 per share on Friday, well below the $97.91 floor price of the original bid. That drop was part of Paramount’s argument that its bid was superior.</p><p>The new $27.75-per-share offer from Netflix replaces its earlier cash-and-stock bid for $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix stock.</p><p>“The merger consideration is a fixed cash amount to be paid by an investment-grade company, providing [Warner Bros] stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon closing the merger,” Warner Bros said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The company’s board also disclosed its valuation for Discovery Global, a planned spin-off that will contain television assets, including CNN and TNT Sports and the Discovery+ streaming service.</p><p>The board has maintained that the Netflix merger deal is superior to Paramount Skydance’s $30-per-share cash bid for the company because Warner Bros’s investors would retain a stake in the separately traded Discovery Global.</p><p>Warner Bros’s advisers used three separate approaches for valuing Discovery Global. The lowest share price they arrived at was $1.33 per share, by applying a single value across the whole company. The high end of the range they determined was a price of $6.86 a share, if the spin-off became involved in a future deal.</p><p>Paramount has said the cable spinoff central to the streaming giant’s offer is effectively worthless.</p><h2 id=\"a-looming-deadline\">A looming deadline</h2><p>The rival bidder went to court on January 12 to expedite the disclosure of this information, so investors could evaluate the competing offers for Warner Bros. A Delaware court judge rejected the request, finding that Paramount had failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm from the alleged inadequate disclosures about Warner Bros’s cable TV business.</p><p>Paramount Skydance, whose tender offer expires on January 21, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p><p>“Paramount will make another appeal to shareholders. Unless Paramount raises its bid, the appeal will be window dressing,” E-marketer analyst Ross Benes said.</p><p>The race is expected to come to a head at a shareholder vote later this year as Warner investors weigh the value of cable assets.</p><p>Warner Bros reiterated its reasons for rejecting the Paramount bid, saying its all-cash offer of $30 a share was insufficient after factoring in the “price and numerous risks, costs and uncertainties”.</p><p>“Netflix’s move to go all‑cash on the Warner Bros deal is a smart pivot at a time when its own falling share price had begun to weaken its hand,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “A cash bid strips away uncertainty and is unquestionably more appealing from Warner Bros’s perspective, even if it does nothing to ease regulatory scrutiny.”</p><p>A merger with Netflix would leave the combined company with roughly $85bn in debt, compared with $87bn for Paramount. But Netflix is worth considerably more, with a market valuation of $402bn, compared with $12.6bn for Paramount.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Netflix tie-up would be less leveraged – carrying a leverage ratio of under four – than a ratio of about seven with Paramount.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\">Netflix also agreed </a>to allow Warner Bros to reduce the amount of indebtedness to be borne by Discovery Global by $260m, according to the regulatory filing.</p><p>Netflix also has an investment-grade credit rating, whereas Paramount’s bonds are rated at junk levels by S&amp;P and would likely come under further pressure, Warner Bros said in its filing.</p><p>Winning over shareholders’ approval, however, may only be the first step in what could be a long process, given that lawmakers across ⁠the political spectrum have ​voiced concerns that further media consolidation could drive up prices and reduce consumer choice.</p><p>The Ellisons have argued that their relationship with Trump gives them an easier regulatory path to approval.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The speed of the change has rendered them somewhat invisible.</p><p>“When you think about this muzzle-velocity stuff, there are some things that we don't even realize has happened,” Updegrove said.</p><p>He pointed to the loss of institutional knowledge after Trump's widespread layoffs as an example of decisions with as-yet unseen consequences.</p><p>“Even the things that we know have gone through, we don't see the full effects and won't for many years.”</p><p>And yet, Updegrove speculates that a lack of velocity in one critical area may prove to be the downfall of Trumpism: economic growth.</p><p>The consumer prices repeatedly topped polls of voter concerns in the 2024 election, and Trump had promised that, “starting on day one”, he would “end inflation and make America affordable again”.</p><p>But Updegrove says average Americans are not seeing the promised turnaround in their pocketbooks.</p><p>“If we successfully turn the tide on Trump, I don't know that it will ultimately be driven by our fear of the erosion of our democracy, rather than a dissatisfaction with the pace of economic change,” he said.</p><p>“At the end of the day, we might see a revival of democracy due to the price of hamburger meat.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Using terms like “counterinsurgency operations” is not coincidental. Israel instrumentalises military terms to conceal intention and fabricate reality. From <a href=\"/news/2025/1/23/what-is-israels-deadly-iron-wall-military-raid-in-the-west-banks-jenin\">Operation Iron Wall</a>, to Operation Summer Camps and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/collective-punishment-family-home-of-suspect-demolished-in-west-bank\">Operation Five Stones</a>, to, most recently, the “counterterrorism” operation in al-Khalil (Hebron), these are presented and reported as temporary, targeted, and reactive.</p><p>But they are not. The intensified military aggression – along with settler militia violence, infrastructure destruction, home demolitions and ever multiplying roadblocks and checkpoints – are meant to create facts on the ground that make life for Palestinians impossible – similar to Gaza.</p><h2 id=\"the-west-bank-s-war-zones\">The West Bank’s war zones</h2><p>In 2025, Israel’s military onslaught in the West Bank resulted in the largest mass displacement campaign Palestinians have faced since 1967, with nearly 50,000 Palestinians violently kicked out of their homes.</p><p>The Israeli army destroyed the refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarem and denied their residents the right to return. It has now effectively transformed the two camps into its military headquarters in the north.</p><p>Israeli troops also undertook the near-total destruction of infrastructure, including roads, sanitation systems and the electric grid. At least 70 percent of Jenin city’s roads were bulldozed, and the majority of water pipelines and sewage networks were destroyed in Jenin and Tulkarem within weeks, incurring millions of dollars in economic loss.</p><p>Thousands of households were disconnected from both water and electricity across the district. And still today, displaced families live in hard-to-access areas with hardly any civilian infrastructure.</p><p>In parallel, the Israeli army expanded the geography of its violence. Israeli troops now carry out regular raids in cities in the centre of the West Bank, including Ramallah and Ariha (Jericho), and in the south like al-Khalil (Hebron) and Bethlehem. In these attacks, Palestinians are besieged, terrorised and at times executed by Israeli soldiers who are operating with impunity.</p><p>This week, the Israeli army launched a large-scale operation in al-Khalil (Hebron) under the guise of bringing law and order. The whole city has been placed under lockdown with Israeli tanks patrolling the streets, while men and boys are being detained, subject to field interrogation and held under brutal conditions.</p><p>But Israeli violence is not limited to army raids and operations only. Where the army goes, settlers follow. In true settler-colonial spirit, the army acts as the trailblazer to usher attacks by Israeli settler militias on Palestinian people and property and shepherd land annexation. In the last two years, Israelis living illegally in the West Bank have been armed with military-grade weapons ranging from US-made M16s to pistols and drones, and they are using them at will.</p><p>It is by now clear that Israel’s “counterinsurgency” operations are not about achieving victory “on the battlefield”. They are a coordinated effort with settlers to re-engineer the spatial and social environment in the West Bank so there can be no dissent or resistance.</p><p>When a counterinsurgency logic is applied to an occupied civilian population, it transforms homes, streets, and daily routines into instruments of control.</p><h2 id=\"the-infrastructure-of-fear\">The infrastructure of fear</h2><p>Last January, Israeli settlers put up billboards on main roads in the West Bank. In big bold letters, they wrote: “there is no future in Palestine”. Palestinians understood this for what it was: a declaration of war. We are now in the middle of it.</p><p>Every week, there is an average of nine Palestinians killed, 88 more injured, 180 arrested, a dozen more tortured in field interrogations, coupled with an average of 100 Israeli settler attacks, 300 military raids and assaults and 10 demolitions of Palestinian homes and property. This is all just a week’s work.</p><p>These figures do not just reflect the heightened level of violence, but also its frequency. The aim of this intensification is to erode any sense of normalcy for Palestinians.</p><p>Thousands of raids over the course of a year, coupled with settlement expansion, new bypass roads, hundreds of new military checkpoints, and systemic surveillance, are not episodic; they have transformed violence from exception to routine, normalising disruption as a condition of governance.</p><p>Settler-colonial violence dictates Palestinian lives; it shapes when people sleep, where children play, when they can go to school, whether businesses open, and how futures are imagined. It imposes the need for constant recalibration. It drains and exhausts.</p><p>Across the West Bank, Palestinian daily life is structured around violent interruptions. Israel is not only redrawing the map through de facto annexation, but it is using fear as infrastructure to redraw the boundaries of where it is safe for Palestinians to exist.</p><p>This affects every aspect of life. As a Palestinian journalist, every time I hit the road, I am met with a familiar, crippling anxiety about what could happen. I rarely take the same route twice. One day, it’s a village closed off; the next, an entire city. An hour-long drive turns into a three-hour, sometimes four-hour one. I reroute through the mountains, again and again, as Israeli gates and checkpoints appear at every entry and exit of every Palestinian village and town.</p><p>Our life in the West Bank is measured in detours. They don’t just highlight Israel’s systemic and expedited theft of territory and life-sustaining resources, but they serve to rob time and deplete socioeconomic capacity. Israel has not only ruptured territorial continuity in the West Bank, but destroyed social life, psychological grounding, and political possibilities.</p><p>And so while some Palestinians are pushed out at gunpoint, the rest are being pushed out through the infrastructure of fear.</p><p>Israel has successfully created a hostile environment where even homes can become battlefields in a matter of minutes. At the same time, violence from armed Israeli militias and the proliferation of outposts suffocate urban areas like Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem and al-Khalil (Hebron).</p><p>The Israeli army has even taken to carrying out systemic lootings of currency exchange shops and stealing valuables, like gold and silver, from households. This is as important as the daily terror because Israel is not only destroying physical infrastructure, but simultaneously making recovery and rebuilding impossible.</p><h2 id=\"fragmenting-a-people\">Fragmenting a people</h2><p>A disconnected land is a disconnected people. Palestinian cities in the West Bank are shrinking and are being swallowed into an ever-expanding Israeli colonial state.</p><p>Last year, Israel formalised plans to develop the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/15/how-the-world-is-reacting-to-israels-settlement-plan-in-occupied-west-bank\">illegal E1 settlement project</a>, and this year, it is expected to push forward the plan to expand settlements near Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley and across Ramallah. These developments would effectively cut off occupied East Jerusalem from the West Bank and the north from the south. Israeli settlers are now erecting Israeli flags on Palestinian roads and homes as a symbol of conquest.</p><p>The West Bank is pivotal for understanding that war does not only arrive with bombs; sometimes it comes with checkpoints, permits, zoning restrictions, state-sponsored violence, and the rerouting of life-sustaining resources away from the Palestinians and towards settlements. It is not merely the fragmentation of land in preparation for colonisation, but the slow degradation of the native population’s capacity to exist collectively.</p><p>The West Bank is where war takes hold beneath the threshold of headlines, without any front lines.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Its shops sell jewellery, household items, carpets, bags, crockery and other goods.</p><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the building was packed on Saturday night during the wedding season, a factor that contributed to the high death toll.</p><p>More than 72 hours after the fire broke out, officials have yet to confirm its cause. Police officials said on the night of the blaze that it may have been triggered by a short circuit.</p><p>Sindh Police Inspector General Javed Alam Odho said it appeared the fire was caused by a circuit breaker but stressed that “nothing definitive can be said about this at this time.”</p><p>Namra Khalid, a Karachi-based urban researcher, said a detailed investigation is needed before conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>“However, I think the main concern should be about what allowed the fire to become so big at such a rapid pace,” Khalid told Al Jazeera. “Fires can start anywhere, but what structural, systemic failures allowed it to spread at such scale, and why such failures are allowing repeated fires in the city at an unimaginable scale?”</p><h2 id=\"why-did-rescue-efforts-take-so-long\">Why did rescue efforts take so long?</h2><p>Rescue officials said the operation to recover those still missing is still being conducted because the size of the building and the extent of the damage mean they must proceed cautiously.</p><p>Officials told local media that much of the structure has collapsed and what remains may have to be demolished due to severe structural damage.</p><p>Hassan ul-Haseeb, a spokesperson for the provincial rescue service Rescue 1122, said access to the site was a major challenge on the night of the fire.</p><p>“On the one hand, the road was narrow, and on the other hand, a large number of people were there just to watch the spectacle, due to which the entire road was blocked and water tankers had difficulty finding their way there,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Ul-Haseeb added that the materials inside the plaza, including large amounts of plastic, caused the fire to repeatedly flare up despite sustained efforts by firefighters, prolonging the operation.</p><p>He said people on the ground floor were able to escape using the building’s 13 entry and exit points.

Officials at the time said the factory was crammed with combustible materials, including piles of clothes and chemicals.</p><p>Eight years later, a Pakistani court ruled that the <a href=\"/news/2020/9/22/pakistan-court-rules-2012-blaze-as-arson-sentences-two-to-death\">Baldia inferno</a> was a case of arson, not an accident. The court issued death sentences to two men who belonged to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a political party that was in power in the city at the time.</p><p>In recent years, fires have continued to break out across Karachi.</p><p>City planners and engineers estimated that about 70 percent of the city’s residential, commercial and industrial buildings lack adequate fire safety systems.</p><p>In both 2023 and 2024, Karachi recorded more than 2,500 fires.</p><p>In August, eight people were killed when a warehouse burned to the ground because of a short circuit. In June, another shopping mall was destroyed and hundreds of shops razed although no casualties were reported.</p><p>Muhammad Toheed, a Karachi-based urban planner and director of the research organisation Karachi Urban Lab, said the repeated incidents point to longstanding failures in governance.</p><p>“The government cannot make any excuses at all since the fire brigade and such related rescue work falls under its purview, and it is a clear and simple governance failure over a long period of time,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The building codes, safety mechanisms, routine inspections, ensuring presence of fire extinguishers and necessary training drills, all of these are practically nonexistent,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"chronic-failures\">‘Chronic failures’</h2><p>For a city of more than 20 million people, Karachi is served by just 35 fire stations, according to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, which oversees the fire brigade. According to Rescue 1122’s ul-Haseeb, Karachi has only 57 fire trucks and six ladder trucks.</p><p>Toheed, the urban researcher, said he had visited Gul Plaza frequently and noted that it was relatively better designed than many other buildings in the city with multiple entry and exit points.</p><p>“This was a building with fire extinguishers, reasonably sized stairs where people can move and lots of exit points, yet we have so many casualties. If we use Gul Plaza as a benchmark, then the rest of Karachi is a ticking time bomb,” he warned.</p><p>Khalid agreed, saying the city is weighed down by informal fixes and chronic failures.</p><p>“Lack of regulation, inspection and enforcement have created an environment where safety is optional and accountability is not there, and on top of it, we don’t have the emergency response mechanism,” she said.</p><p>Toheed said city authorities also need to urgently address the lack of capacity and training among rescue officials.</p><p>“We must start from scratch. It is important to find out what training our rescue officials have as this is a very specialised thing,” he said, referring to some ground reports from the rescue efforts at Gul Plaza suggesting shortcomings.</p><p>Khalid said she hoped the Gul Plaza fire would prompt change.</p><p>“We keep reading about such events, but then news fades out. But I really hope that this time people remember what happened and the administration is pushed into action to do something about it, to ensure we don’t have another Gul Plaza-like tragedy in future,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Former musician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, secured 25 percent.</p><p>Bobi Wine’s National Unity Platform (NUP) party and two other presidential candidates have rejected the results, alleging irregularities including ballot stuffing, intimidation, and the blocking of party agents from polling stations. The United Nations also says Thursday’s vote was marred by “widespread repression and intimidation”.</p><p>On the day the country’s Electoral Commission announced Museveni’s win, Bobi Wine appeared in a video on social media, telling supporters that he was forced into <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/ugandas-wine-says-escaped-raid-on-house-amid-disputed-presidential-vote\">hiding</a> after his home was raided by police and other unknown individuals.</p><p>“I know they are looking for me, but even if they succeed and get me, and do whatever, I want to say this to you fellow Ugandans,” he said on <a href=\"https://x.com/HEBobiwine/status/2012486868298846649\">video</a>, “We reject whatever is being declared by Mr Simon Byabakama [the chair of the Electoral Commission] because those so-called results that they are declaring are fake and they don’t in any way reflect what happened at the polling stations.”</p><p>The opposition and its supporters say the government has violently cracked down on dissent, shutting down the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/uganda-cuts-internet-days-before-presidential-election\">internet</a> and arresting protesters.</p><p>Museveni has accused Bobi Wine’s party of trying to destabilise the country.</p><p>Ugandan authorities said the four-day internet shutdown was a security measure<strong> </strong>aimed at preventing the spread of misinformation that could cause fear and chaos.</p><p>The government also said <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/incumbent-president-museveni-takes-strong-lead-in-uganda-election-count\">seven people</a> were killed in Butambala, with police stating that protesters attempted to attack a polling station and a police post. The NUP disputes this account, saying at least 10 people were killed when police fired at the home of a party official, a claim Al Jazeera could not independently verify.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Speaking with Al Jazeera’s Catherine Soi in an exclusive interview while in hiding, Bobi Wine condemned the government’s “crackdown to intimidate, to silence, and to subdue the forces of change”.</p><p>He also alleged he had “evidence” of fraud, videos showing “not the police, not the military, but electoral commission officials” ticking ballot papers in favour of Museveni.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> How are you? How’s your family?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> I’m alive. I don’t know how my family is, but I try to keep in touch with my wife. She’s OK, she’s strong. [The security forces are] still at my home. Nobody’s allowed to access the house.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> The police spokesman told us that you are not under arrest, that you are at home; obviously, you’re not. What do you say to them?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> I saw the police spokesperson saying I’m in my house. The same police person said that the people that were shot and killed in the house of my deputy president were actually attacking the police station. And yet they were inside the house. You know, so much goes on, and the shamelessness of the Ugandan regime now is bottomless. You know, they’ll do something glaringly – and they lie about it.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> You’re talking about the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/incumbent-president-museveni-takes-strong-lead-in-uganda-election-count\">incident in Butambala</a>? Tell us about what happened.</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> Ten people were killed in Butambala at the house of my deputy president. They were shot dead. The police shot through the door of a garage, a car storage room and killed 10 people. But scores were also killed in Iganga. Many people were killed in Kawempe and many other places.</p><p>So, one of the reasons why I could not stay home is that, as a leader, I had to keep in touch with these people; I had to give guidance. I had to be in touch and know what is happening. It was extremely dangerous for me. You’ve heard the head of the military, who is General Museveni’s son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, promising to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ugandas-military-head-says-he-wants-behead-opposition-leader-2025-01-06/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cut off my head</a>, and we had earlier information that they were coming to harm me. So, in that fracas when they raided my house, I used a few old skills to get my way out.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4234658\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4234658\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4234658\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26012621846736-1768280170.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bobi Wine addresses supporters during a rally.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4234658\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Uganda opposition presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known as Bobi Wine, addresses supporters during his final campaign rally at Aga Khan Grounds, in Kampala, Uganda, Monday, January 12, 2026. [File: Samson Otieno/AP]</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> The president has called you a traitor and a “terrorist” – you and other officials of your party. What do you have to say to that?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> It should be known that in every dictatorship, especially here in Africa, to run against a dictator means being a terrorist, means being a traitor and everything. I mean, a priest, a Catholic priest called Father [Deusdedit] Ssekabira was arrested and General Museveni was talking about him, saying the Catholic priest was arrested and detained incommunicado for more than two weeks for working with me. But I was not arrested. Young people are in prison for their association with me and the party that I lead. But I, with the secretary-general and many others, are not detained. This is a crackdown to intimidate, to silence and to completely subdue the forces of change; everybody that yearns for change and everybody that does not support General Museveni.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> You have rejected the elections. You said that the election is rigged. What evidence do you have?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> We have evidence before, we have evidence during and after the election.</p><p>A day or two before the election, several of our polling agents were picked up by the military. Some of them are still missing.</p><p>And then you have seen videos. They turned off the internet. And this time, not the police, not the military, but electoral commission officials took part in ticking ballot papers in favour of General Museveni. We have record of them. We have videos of them doing that, and we’ve started uploading them on social media. (Al Jazeera was unable to verify videos on social media purporting to show officials filling in ballot papers. The Electoral Commission spokesperson declined to speak to Al Jazeera about this allegation.)</p><p>The Electoral Commission chairperson … announced results that nobody knows where they come from. They were supposed to pick them from the declaration of results forms and the district tally sheets. Our agents were there; they had different results on the forms. But the Electoral Commission chairperson was declaring something completely different. So, we rejected.</p><p>Like we said to the people before, that this was going to be a protest vote. We encouraged people for more than a hundred days that should the dictatorship try to subvert the voice of the people, the people of Uganda should rise up according to Article 29 of our constitution and reclaim their voice. That is what we encourage them to do.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> And what does that mean? Protests?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> That means nonviolent, legally accepted protests. It means protesting, it means rejecting the abuse of democracy, fighting back against any subversion of our democracy. Our constitution, Article 29, provides that the people of Uganda can protest and demonstrate peacefully and unarmed. And that is exactly what we’ve encouraged them and continue to encourage them to do.</p><p>It could be protesting on the streets. Some of us started protesting by holding high the national flag. Others can protest by staying at home. We gave it back to the people of Uganda to find numerous creative ways of protesting … to fight back in the most moral, constitutional and legal way possible.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> And going to the Supreme Court is not an option for you?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> The judicial system in Uganda is not independent at all. In the previous presidential election petitions, the Supreme Court has ordered for certain reforms – they’ve been completely ignored. So we don’t have hope in the judicial system of Uganda. That’s why we’ve always encouraged the people of Uganda to be the ones to take back their voice.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> The government and security forces accused you and your supporters throughout the election of flouting electoral rules, maybe campaigning where campaigns are not supposed to be happening, and that’s why you have been met with this kind of violence and tear gas and blocking rallies. What is your response?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> That’s what they are saying. But the law as it is in Uganda permits a candidate, most importantly a presidential candidate, to campaign everywhere where there are people. And indeed that campaign programme was confirmed and ratified by the Electoral Commission of Uganda. However, I was not allowed to even drive on the main roads. I was not allowed to campaign in cities or populated areas. I was always sent to the bushes, but people came there.</p><p>But also, the Electoral Commission was never in charge of this election; the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/protect-the-vote-bobi-wine-opposition-brace-for-tense-uganda-election\">military took charge</a> of this election. … I mean, if there was anything wrong that I did, if there’s anything that was against the law, I would have been apprehended a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> There are some Ugandans who subscribe to whatever you’re saying, but there’s a lot of fear in the country. And they’re saying, OK, the election is now done, so let’s just move on.</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> Moving on is resigning to slavery. We’ve said it many times that living under a military dictatorship for 40 years is like slavery. Ugandans don’t have a right, they don’t have a voice. Uganda is an extremely young country – the second youngest country in the world [by age], governed by a ruler who is over 80 years old.</p><p>Corruption is the order of the day. The country is in a mess. And we, as a current generation – that are the parents of today, that are going to be starting this country – it is our right and duty to ensure that we take charge of our own destiny.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera:</strong> And finally, you cannot go home?</p><p><strong>Bobi Wine:</strong> My reason for not being home is to be able to speak to the world. If I was in my house, you would not be able to access me.</p><p>I would love to be in my home. I’ve not changed my clothes in days. I want to be home. I want to be free. I want to take care of my people.</p><p>But the military and police have taken over my home. They’ve vandalised my gate. They’ve cut the padlocks. They’ve cut power at my house. So they’ve more or less colonised my home.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s no rule of law in Uganda. I cannot find redress with the courts. I cannot find redress with any institution of state. I just have to fight back in my own crude, non-violent way.</p><p><em>Note: This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
