The announcement came at a highly sensitive moment, just as negotiations entered their second phase, focused on the security and economic arrangements necessary for stabilising the Strip and launching reconstruction efforts.</p><p>United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803, adopted on November 17, 2025, and aligned with United States President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/what-is-the-trump-plan-for-gaza-and-will-it-work\">Gaza peace proposal</a>, granted an international mandate to form a transitional peace council (TPC), deploy a stabilisation force, and set a framework stretching until the end of 2027. In the midst of shaping this new transitional architecture, Blair’s anticipated role quickly emerged as a source of deep concern for many stakeholders.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"What are the next steps in implementing Trump's Gaza peace plan? | Inside Story\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtjnC7h6rr4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><p>Since the Trump administration began engaging in efforts to end the war, several plans have circulated. Yet the plan attributed to Blair appeared closest to Trump’s thinking and may have informed key elements of the vision he unveiled in late September. That alone reignited controversy: why would placing Blair in such a consequential position be viewed as a grave misstep?</p><p>Blair carries a heavy political legacy rooted in what many consider the most disastrous foreign policy decision of the 21st century: the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which he championed alongside then-US President George W Bush under the false pretext of weapons of mass destruction (as later confirmed by the United Kingdom’s Chilcot inquiry). The war devastated Iraq, fuelled sectarian conflict, opened the door to years of foreign intervention, and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. For many across the region and beyond, Blair became a symbol of unaccountable power and catastrophic decision-making.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"🇮🇶 Should Tony Blair be punished for the Iraq War? | UpFront\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2XS2zIUDlGI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><p>Within the Palestinian and Arab context, Blair’s record is even more troubling. As the Quartet’s <a href=\"/economy/2011/10/9/palestinians-urge-blair-to-quit\">special envoy to the Middle East peace process</a> from 2007 to 2015, he was widely accused of reinforcing Israeli policies, enabling the entrenchment of the Gaza blockade, and allowing Israel to evade its obligations under peace frameworks. Although the Quartet’s mandate was to support negotiations, foster economic development, and prepare institutions for eventual statehood, none of these goals meaningfully advanced during Blair’s tenure. Meanwhile, illegal Israeli settlement expansion accelerated, and the occupation deepened.</p><p>Most consequential was the Quartet’s decision, following the <a href=\"/news/2006/1/26/hamas-wins-huge-majority\">2006 Palestinian legislative elections</a>, to impose sweeping political and economic sanctions on the new Hamas-led government. These conditions, which required Hamas to recognise Israel and renounce armed resistance before lifting the blockade, effectively triggered Gaza’s long-term isolation. The decision dealt a severe blow to Palestinian political cohesion and helped entrench the division whose consequences are still felt today.</p><p>During Blair’s years in office, Gaza endured four devastating Israeli assaults, including the 2008-09 <a href=\"https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/Gazaunderattack/index.html\">Operation Cast Lead</a>, one of the bloodiest military campaigns in the Strip’s history during his mandate. Yet Blair achieved no political breakthrough. Instead, British media investigations revealed serious conflicts of interest, suggesting that the former prime minister used his Quartet role to facilitate business deals benefitting companies linked to him, earning millions of pounds despite his lack of diplomatic achievements. Multiple reports indicated that he was not fully dedicated to his envoy responsibilities, devoting significant time to his private consultancy work and lucrative speaking engagements.</p><p>In 2011, Blair also openly opposed Palestine’s bid for full UN membership, calling it a move that was “deeply confrontational” and reportedly lobbied the UK government to withhold support.</p><p>Years later, in 2017, he admitted that he and other world leaders were wrong to impose an immediate boycott on Hamas after its electoral victory – an admission that came only after Gaza had suffered the long-term consequences of that policy.</p><p>For these reasons, Palestinians, Arab states, and numerous donor countries perceived Blair’s anticipated role in the proposed board for peace with profound scepticism. Given his political record, clear alignment with Israeli positions, and unresolved allegations of profiteering, Blair is seen not as an impartial stabiliser but as a liability capable of undermining the fragile trust necessary for any transitional process.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Report finds former UK PM Blair involved in ‘Gaza Riviera’ scheme | AJ #shorts\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3W6NnUM9jsY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><p>Removing him is therefore a step in the right direction, yet not sufficient on its own. The real test lies in determining whether his private consulting firm and affiliated networks are also excluded, or whether his departure is merely symbolic. If Blair exits in name only, while his institutional influence persists behind the scenes, then the risks to the peace process remain substantial.</p><p>Gaza’s next chapter cannot afford symbolic gestures or half measures. The challenges ahead, including restoring governance, rebuilding a devastated territory, and reviving a viable path towards a two-state solution, require figures with credibility, transparency, and clean political records. Blair does not fit that profile. His removal, if genuine, represents not just an administrative adjustment but a necessary correction to years of mismanagement, failed diplomacy, and decisions whose costs Palestinians have borne more than anyone else.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I inherited a total mess. Prices were at an all-time high when I came in.”</p><p>He also told Politico: “If you think of gasoline a gallon, they had it at $4.50, almost $5.00. You go to some of the states, you had it at $6.00. We hit, uh, three states two days ago, $1.99 a gallon.”</p><h3>The facts</h3><p>Philadelphia-based nonprofit Factcheck.org wrote in January this year that while inflation did rise under Biden, Trump did not, in fact, inherit the “worst inflation” in history.</p><p>The annualised inflation rate was below 3 percent during the six months before Trump took office in his second term.</p><p>The organisation explained the rise in inflation under Biden was partly down to the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>According to Factcheck.org, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose from 5.4 percent to 9.1 percent in the 12-month period ending in June 2022. But this was far from the worst the US has experienced. That was in the aftermath of World War I, when inflation hit 23.7 percent in June 1920.</p><p>In March 1980, inflation hit 14.8 percent, marking one of the most severe spikes in consumer prices in modern US history.</p><p>Trump’s statements about petrol prices are also slightly misleading.</p><p>In the US, the average price of petrol – called “gas” in the US – was $3.05 per gallon (3.8 litres) in November this year, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). According to online marketplace Choose Energy, the cost per gallon ranged from $2.41 in Oklahoma to $4.53 in California as of December 3.</p><p>The $1.99 price cited by Trump applies to isolated low-price stations in certain states and does not reflect a general statewide average.</p><h2 id=\"claim-ilhan-omar-is-in-the-us-illegally\">Claim: Ilhan Omar is in the US illegally</h2><p>During the Pennsylvania rally, Trump launched an attack on Ilhan Omar, the Democrat who has served as a Minnesota representative in Congress since 2019.</p><p>While bemoaning immigration to the US by people from Somalia and other countries, he claimed that Omar is in the US illegally.</p><p>“I love this Ilhan Omar, whatever the hell her name is. With her little turban. I love her. She comes in, does nothing but bitch. She’s always complaining. She comes from her country, where, I mean, it’s considered about the worst country in the world,” Trump said to a crowd of supporters, who roared with applause.</p><p>“We gotta get her the hell out,” he said. “She married her brother in order to get in, right … she married her brother to get in, therefore she’s here illegally.”</p><p>The crowd of supporters at the rally started chanting “Send her back!”</p><p>Trump also claimed that Somalia has no military, parliament or police. “They police themselves, they kill each other all the time.”</p><h3>The facts</h3><p>First, <a href=\"/where/somalia/\">Somalia</a> does have a military, a parliament and a police force.</p><p>While Omar was born in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, in 1982, her family fled the Somali Civil War and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before seeking asylum in the US in 1995, when she was 12.</p><p>Once asylum is granted – as it was to Omar’s family – the US Refugee Admissions Program grants lawful permanent resident (LPR) status to refugees, who can then apply for citizenship five years later.</p><p>Omar became eligible for citizenship five years after she entered the US, and finally became a citizen in 2000, when she was 17 years old.</p><p>Doubts about Omar’s legal status in the US and claims that she married her brother have circulated among the US right wing since 2018, shortly before she was elected to Congress. In 2018, Omar dismissed these claims as “disgusting lies” in a statement to The Associated Press (AP). She provided AP with detailed marriage and divorce records.</p><p>Ilhan Omar first married Ahmed Abdisalan Hirsi in 2002 in a Muslim faith ceremony, had two children, and later separated. In 2009, she married British citizen Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in a civil marriage, separating in 2011; she reunited with Hirsi in 2012, and after legally divorcing Elmi in 2017, remarried Hirsi legally in 2018.</p><p>There is no verifiable evidence to back up allegations that either Hirsi or Elmi is Omar’s brother. She has strongly denied these allegations.</p><h2 id=\"claim-the-venezuela-boat-strikes-save-25-000-american-lives-each-time\">Claim: The Venezuela boat strikes save 25,000 American lives each time</h2><p>During Trump’s Politico interview, he repeated the claim that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro “sends in a lot of drugs” to the US.</p><p>Since September, US military strikes on at least 21 Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have killed <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2025/11/15/us-confirms-four-people-killed-in-20th-strike-on-vessel-in-the-caribbean\">more than 80 people</a>.</p><p>In September, a top US Navy commander ordered a second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat, despite almost completely destroying it in the first attack. According to witnesses, there were only two survivors clinging to debris in the water after the first strike, and both were killed in the second.</p><p>When Trump was asked about that second strike, he said: “It looked like they were trying to turn back over the boat, but I don’t get involved in that. That’s up to them. Uh, the admiral that did is a highly respected man. And we save 25,000 people every time we knock out a boat.”</p><p>During the rally in Pennsylvania, Trump again made the claim that for every US strike on alleged Venezuelan drug boats, “we save 25,000 American lives”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>The facts</h3><p>The Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/does-each-boat-strike-off-the-coast-of-venezuela-save-25000-us-lives\">has not provided any evidence</a> that strikes on Venezuelan boats each save 25,000 American lives by preventing drug trafficking into the US. Indeed, it has not provided evidence that any of the boats it has struck were carrying drugs or were affiliated with drug cartels, as it claims.</p><p>Furthermore, there is <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">little evidence</a> that drugs are trafficked from Venezuela on a large scale. The 2023 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) World Drug Report said global cocaine production had hit a record 3,708 tonnes, up nearly one‑third from 2022, with most coca cultivation taking place in Colombia, followed by Peru and Bolivia.</p><p>Trafficking routes into the US in 2023-2024 primarily passed through Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, not Venezuela, although it does serve as a minor transit corridor for Colombian cocaine moving into the eastern Caribbean.</p><p>The dominant US-bound maritime route remains through the eastern Pacific, then into Mexico and Central America, where most large seizures occur before drugs can pass overland into the US. The US Drug Enforcement Administration’s own 2024 report similarly identified Colombia as the source for about 84 percent of cocaine seized in the US, and made no mention of Venezuela.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"claims-about-transgender-people-and-black-people\">Claims about transgender people and Black people</h2><p>During the Pennsylvania rally, Trump claimed the Democrats want “transgender for every member in your family”.</p><p>He added: “If they’re not feeling well that night, let’s just change their sex.”</p><p>Trump also said: “Black people love Trump. I got the biggest vote with Black people.”</p><h3>The facts</h3><p>In the US, access to medical transition or “gender‑affirming” treatments, such as puberty blockers, hormone therapy or surgeries, is not a uniform process nationwide. It varies significantly from state to state depending on local laws, medical practices and insurance coverage provisions.</p><p>However, while some European countries have placed restrictions on access to such treatments – especially for children, for whom there are concerns that puberty blockers, which are largely untrialled, might cause lasting developmental harm – these can be more readily available in parts of the US.</p><p>There is certainly no evidence that the Democratic Party believes all families should have a transgender member.</p><p>When it comes to Black voters, it is true that Trump <a href=\"/news/2024/3/18/why-are-black-voters-backing-donald-trump-in-record-numbers\">made significant inroads</a> in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Overall, he secured 20 percent of the Black vote in November 2024 – a big rise from the 12 percent he won in 2020.</p><p>However, this means that his opponent for the presidency, Democrat Kamala Harris, in fact won the majority of the Black vote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Mamdani built his campaign around freezing rents and expanding affordable housing.</p><p>So what exactly is Gracie Mansion, and why does it matter in a city where housing has become a key political issue?</p><h2 id=\"what-is-gracie-mansion\">What is Gracie Mansion?</h2><p>Gracie Mansion has been the official residence of the mayor of New York City since 1942. A yellow-painted, Federal-style wooden house built in 1799, it is located inside Carl Schurz Park on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.</p><p>According to the Historic House Trust, which oversees the city’s historic homes, it was originally designed as a two-storey country villa overlooking the East River.</p><p>The main house reportedly has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, with period fireplaces and high ceilings.</p><p>The residence today includes the original two-storey structure plus an events wing, which was added in the 1960s. According to the New York City Parks and Recreation Department, the combined complex now measures roughly 12,000 to 13,000 square feet (1,200 square metres), accommodating formal sitting rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms and spaces for official functions.</p><p>The building is maintained as a city-owned asset and is made available to each incoming mayor as their official home.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-it-called-gracie-mansion\">Why is it called Gracie Mansion?</h2><p>The house takes its name from Archibald Gracie, a Scottish-American shipping merchant who constructed it in 1799 within an estate to be his family’s country seat. At the time, it was some distance outside the city limits.</p><p>Although Gracie later lost the property due to financial hardship, his name remained attached to the estate in subsequent decades, and the city retained it when it took ownership at the end of the 19th century.</p><p>New York City acquired the property in 1896, incorporating the surrounding estate into what would become Carl Schurz Park. According to the Historic House Trust and the Gracie Mansion Conservancy, the building served a series of public uses during the following few decades, including as temporary quarters for the Museum of the City of New York.</p><p>In 1942, New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses urged Mayor Fiorello La Guardia to designate the house as the city’s official mayoral residence. At the time, the city lacked any formal mayoral home.</p><p>Moses saw this as an opportunity to create a dignified civic residence that would mirror the executive mansions used in other major American cities.</p><p>In 1966, the city added the Susan E Wagner Wing, a modernist extension designed to accommodate receptions and large meetings.</p><p>Since 1981, the house has been maintained by a public-private partnership, which funds its conservation and oversees public tours.</p><p>In 2002, Mayor Michael Bloomberg updated the interior and exterior of the building and increased accessibility to the public.</p><p>It has since been known as the “People’s House”.</p><h2 id=\"have-mayors-always-lived-at-gracie-mansion\">Have mayors always lived at Gracie Mansion?</h2><p>Gracie Mansion did not become the official mayoral residence until 1942, when La Guardia moved in following the city’s decision to assign the house to the mayor’s office.</p><p>Since 1942, most mayors have lived there, including Ed Koch, David Dinkins, Bill de Blasio and Eric Adams.</p><p>The most notable exception was Michael Bloomberg, who chose to remain in his private townhouse on the Upper East Side for the duration of his three terms as mayor. Bloomberg used Gracie Mansion only for events, according to US media reports.</p><p>Some mayors have divided their time between Gracie Mansion and their private residences, including Ed Koch, who kept his Greenwich Village apartment, and Rudy Giuliani’s family, who remained partly based in their East Side home.</p><h2 id=\"when-is-zohran-mamdani-moving-in\">When is Zohran Mamdani moving in?</h2><p>Mamdani, 34, will take office in January. He has said he and his wife, the illustrator Rama Duwaji, will leave the rent-stabilised Astoria, Queens apartment he has lived in since 2018 and move into Gracie Mansion. The couple do not have children.</p><p>In a statement, Mamdani said his decision to move into the mansion – described by US media as being worth $100m – had been driven by safety considerations for his family and the need to focus fully on implementing the “affordability agenda” that shaped his campaign.</p><p>He also described the move as using the residence in the way it was intended – a civic resource provided so the mayor can perform official duties more effectively.</p><p>The move has raised questions about how this aligns with his tenants’ rights and affordability agenda, however, as he had previously tied the fact that he lived in a rent-controlled apartment to his campaign agenda of more affordable housing for New Yorkers.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“To Astoria: thank you for showing us the best of New York City,” Mamdani said in a statement on Wednesday. “While I may no longer live in Astoria, Astoria will always live inside me and the work I do.”</p><h2 id=\"why-else-is-gracie-mansion-significant\">Why else is Gracie Mansion significant?</h2><p>The mansion has been the site of many protests – many of them revolving around housing rights, particularly for asylum seekers and migrants. In August 2023, for example, an anti-immigration rally clashed with migrants’ rights counterprotesters on the doorstep.</p><p>People marching in the rally shouted slogans such as, “No migrants on Long Island! We pay a lot of property taxes!”</p><p>When the current New York mayor, Eric Adams, sought to remove New York City’s “right to shelter” law, which guarantees shelter with basic standards for homeless people, that year, a major protest and “sleep-in” took place outside Gracie Mansion in November.</p><p>In March 2024, Adams reached a legal agreement with homeless rights advocates allowing homeless migrants and asylum seekers to stay for only a maximum of 30 days in a shelter.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4164355\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4164355\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4164355\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1786786415-1765355972.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gracie\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4164355\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Protesters march during a rally and ‘sleep-in’ outside Gracie Mansion, New York City Mayor Eric Adams’s official residence, urging him to stop attacking the city’s right-to-shelter policy [Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-severe-is-new-york-city-s-housing-crisis\">How severe is New York City’s housing crisis?</h2><p>Housing policy was the centrepiece of Mamdani’s mayoral campaign.</p><p>He has pushed for a multi-year rent freeze on the city’s roughly one million rent-stabilised apartments, along with stronger tenant protections, more social housing and limits on speculative buying by landlords.</p><p>The city’s Housing and Vacancy Survey, cited in the city’s Rent Guidelines Board’s 2025 report, put the rental vacancy rate at just 1.41 percent, far below the 5 percent level that triggers rent-regulation powers in New York State.</p><p>“This translates into the availability of just 33,000 vacant units out of almost 2.4 million rental units Citywide,” the report reads.</p><p>Separately, market data shows how high <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/the-new-york-city-mayoral-race-in-five-maps-and-charts\">New York rents</a> have become.</p><p>Realtor.com’s 2025 quarterly report put the citywide median asking rent at about $3,600 a month. Meanwhile, Douglas Elliman’s August 2025 rental market report shows that two-bedroom units routinely list for $5,000 to more than $5,500 in Manhattan and $3,200 to $4,000 in many Brooklyn and Queens neighbourhoods.</p><p>In each of the five boroughs of New York City, average rents make up a high proportion of average incomes.</p><p>In Manhattan, where the average income is about $5,100 per month, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $4,200. In Brooklyn, the average income is about $3,400, compared with the average rent on a one-bedroom apartment of $2,800.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4073175\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4073175\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4073175\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Interactive_NYC_Mayor_Oct30_2025-01-1761900940.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_NYC_Mayor_Oct30_2025-NYC AT A GLANCE\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4073175\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, cities which prioritise affordable housing, like Vienna, Austria, take a very different approach. The city owns and manages hundreds of thousands of apartments and keeps rents far below market levels.</p><p>According to several media reports, a typical two-bedroom apartment in Vienna can be rented for less than 600 euros ($697) a month. In New York, similar units are advertised for five to eight times that amount.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The irony here is that the STC, led by Aidarus al-Zubaidi, is also a member of the Yemeni PLC. But the relationship between the two groups is shaky and at times, turbulent.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 2 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Yemen’s government condemned the STC’s latest military advance and land grab across the south and labelled the group separatists – calling their action a “unilateral and a blatant violation of the transitional phase’s framework”.</p><p>On the ground, STC forces have completed their control over the remaining southern governorates, furthering the group’s efforts to revive its decades-old aspiration of establishing an <a href=\"/opinions/2014/12/3/south-yemen-and-the-question-of-secession\">independent state</a> in the south of Yemen.</p><h2><strong>The battle of Hadramout</strong></h2><p>The latest and rapid developments are redrawing the map of control in Yemen, and it could have further implications on the future of a strong, coherent and unified country.</p><p>The fall of Hadramout last week was sudden, and it was seen as a shocking development – although it came after a long period of tension in the oil-rich province. The Yemeni government remained more of a bystander – maintaining some military brigades stationed in its camps in the governorates of Hadramout and al-Mahra. While local and tribal proxies affiliated with regional countries, they were competing for control and influence.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Who are the separatists that claim control of all south Yemen? | AJ #shorts\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p6Gf84n2pqY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><p>Taking advantage of its superior military equipment and massive forces, the STC advanced nearly unchallenged to overtake Hadramout and al-Mahra.</p><p>The government forces lacked modern weapons, sufficient manpower and perhaps the willingness to fight.</p><p>The fall of Hadramout was pivotal and posed greater importance in the eyes of many Yemeni politicians, given the special status of this governorate locally and regionally. It dealt a final blow to what remained of the components of Yemeni unity and the government’s legitimacy, and it thwarted all the bets that considered Hadramout to be immune from falling to STC forces.</p><p>Both the incoming STC forces and government and local tribal fighters had their own alliances and allegiances to competing regional powers – with connections and loyalties with tribal leaders, politicians and local actors in Hadramout.</p><h2><strong>Why does Hadramout matter?</strong></h2><p>Hadramout is a crucial and essential governorate in Yemen, occupying more than a third of the country’s area, approximately 200,000 square kilometres (77,000 square miles), with a population of nearly two million.</p><p>It is home to the largest share of Yemen’s oil wealth, containing the most important oil fields and export terminals. Furthermore, it is a stronghold of Yemeni and Arab Gulf businessmen and a cradle of cultural and historical wealth. In short, Hadramout is the Yemeni governorate that possesses the elements of a fully fledged state, and its inhabitants had hoped to establish a Hadrami state that would restore their past glories, far removed from the political and military conflict that engulfed the rest of Yemen’s governorates.</p><p>Hadramout governorate has always had a unique political and administrative character throughout all eras and political systems, especially during the socialist regime that ruled the South from the early 1970s until 1990, when the two Yemeni parts, North and South, unified.</p><p>This unique character continued under the unified state, as Hadramout remained governed by its own people and refused to accept officials from outside its geographical boundaries. Consequently, the people of Hadramout consider the STC’s control over it an unprecedented occupation, given that most of the STC’s leaders come from the Lahj and Dhale governorates, which are marginal areas – and that would be unacceptable for them. Therefore, the stability and continuity of the STC’s authority in the governorate are doubtful because the group lacks local and popular support.</p><h2><strong>‘Divorce without return’</strong></h2><p>These repercussions will undoubtedly cast a shadow over the eight-member PLC in Yemen, headed by <a href=\"/news/2022/5/5/yemens-new-presidential-council-gets-started-on-the-right-foot\">Rashad al-Alimi</a>, who, along with his cabinet members and his guards, was expelled from the presidential palace in the al-Maashiq district of Aden.</p><p>Many considered this a “divorce without return” and a disastrous end to all previous understandings and agreements aimed at maintaining a political order based on shared principles that would not harm any party.</p><p>In light of these developments, the legitimate government now only controls modest areas of land in the governorates of Taiz and Marib.</p><p>But Marib is already besieged by Houthi forces from the north, and by the STC forces from the south. The Houthis are a group backed by Iran and control the capital and the north and northwestern parts of Yemen. Taiz is besieged by the Houthis from the north and from the east by the forces of Brigadier General Tariq Saleh, the son of the ousted Yemeni president, <a href=\"/news/2017/12/5/yemen-who-was-ali-abdullah-saleh\">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a>.</p><p>It is not unlikely that these areas will fall into the hands of either of these two powerful parties at any moment. If that happens, the legitimate Yemeni government will become just a piece of paper, even though it practically lacks any influence on the ground since the rise of the STC forces and the growing power of the Houthis.</p><h2 id=\"the-unattainable-southern-aspiration-for-secession\">The unattainable southern aspiration for secession</h2><p>As political sociology researcher Fayrouz al-Wali says, the STC does not have the authority to declare southern independence, despite its military control on the ground, because this decision rests not with it but with external regional powers that have deep interests in southern Yemen.</p><p>She noted that the path to statehood in the south does not lead through the gates of the Ma’ashiq Palace in Aden, but rather through the United Nations Security Council, where regional powers could play a pivotal role.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Yemen: The North-South Divide | Al Jazeera World\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXk-k5oA1rs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><p>There is also a realisation that it would be difficult for the STC to declare independence in the foreseeable future, at least, because of the lack of essential resources to fund the budget of a nascent state without even the most basic elements of sustainability. Such a state would inherit an empty treasury from a country exhausted by more than a decade of war.</p><p>In addition to the economic, security and military challenges, and the lack of public services, the southern state envisioned by the STC would face discord with neighbouring powerful countries and other nations that do not wish to see Yemen fragmented into warring mini-states. This would create an unstable security situation with dire consequences for the entire region.</p></div></div></body></html>"

To the right of the main entrance is a supply room with diminishing medical supplies. On the other side is an ambulance that Makata says is now rarely used.</p><p>Health posts like this were set up to serve remote communities and alleviate pressure on district hospitals. They were crucial in providing communities with basic healthcare, antenatal care, family planning and vaccines.</p><p>The clinic in Mulanje used to see dozens of women a day, providing maternal care, including helping women give birth, dispensing medicines and, when needed, transport to the hospital. But now, since funds were cut, it is open only around once every two weeks, stretching its supplies for as long as it can and unable to regularly transport visiting healthcare workers.</p><p>Health posts like this are facing closure – 20 have already shuttered in the country – due to the Trump administration cutting United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funding in February. This is forcing the country’s health system to withdraw critical services, placing further stress on hospitals, and leaving thousands of women and children without needed care in a region burdened by poverty and long distances to hospitals.</p><p>Makata, a nursing officer specialising in maternal and newborn care, usually based at the district hospital, says she used to visit the post two or three times a week. Now she rarely comes and no longer sees most of the patients she used to care for.</p><p>“Most of the women who relied on this post now find the distance to access a district hospital too far,” she tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>It would take a large chunk of a day, travelling on the bumpy dirt roads of Mulanje district, to reach one. That long visit “takes them away from their day-to-day activities, which bring income or food to their table,” she explains.</p><p>Many cannot afford to do that and now go without care.</p><p>“They are failing to get the ideal treatment for antenatal care services, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy,” Makata says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121840\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121840\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121840\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3665-1763738869-rotated-e1765274404509.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ireen Makata, a nursing officer and safe motherhood coordinator at Musa Community Health Post in Mulanje [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"baby-and-mother-in-jeopardy\">‘Baby and mother in jeopardy’</h2><p>USAID funding was all-encompassing. It funded remote medical outposts, covering everything from the training of new staff and the provision of drugs and supplies for pregnant women to petrol for ambulances.</p><p>The US government provided close to 32 percent of Malawi’s total health budget before the cuts.</p><p>USAID funded the health posts through a programme called <a href=\"https://imaworldhealth.org/momentum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MOMENTUM</a> in 14 of Malawi’s 28 districts, starting in 2022, helping strengthen existing clinics and set up new ones. As of 2024, there were 249 posts. The programme also provided medical outreach to communities and equipment. About $80m was being invested in the programme by Washington.</p><p>Early this year, US President Donald Trump issued stop-work orders on USAID-funded programmes as part of an executive order to pause and re-evaluate foreign aid.</p><p>With that move, MOMENTUM was shelved, and the two dozen mobile posts were shuttered as a result. Medical trainees were left in limbo, and life-saving equipment was sold off in fire sales by Washington.</p><p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) still provides technical and financial support to several remote districts for maternal and newborn health, but the available resources are not enough to cover the sites funded by MOMENTUM. There are fears that the UNFPA sites will run out of resources and supplies in the coming months.</p><p>In the wake of Trump’s funding cuts, health experts in Malawi have raised urgent concerns that new mothers and children will face the greatest impact, with many lives potentially lost as a result.</p><p>Makata has set up a WhatsApp group for women to contact her with concerns and questions, but she is frustrated that she cannot work as she used to.</p><p>“We would go to where people resided and give them permanent and long-term care,” she says, referring to the posts. “It’s not easy for me to see this. We can’t help those who need the services the most.”</p><p>Massitive Matekenya, a community leader for the Musa community in Mulanje district, dressed in a black blazer and oversized chequered-green tie, is at the vacant Mulanje health post.</p><p>These days, he says, it is hard to put on a brave face for the people he represents.</p><p>“Women in our community are now giving birth on the way to the district hospital since it’s such a long distance away,” says Matekenya. “That puts baby and mother in jeopardy with the potential of the mother bleeding out.”</p><p>Matekenya struggles to boost morale as he is constantly faced with community anger over the fact that medical outreach has ended.</p><p>He says a 40-year-old woman from his community recently died from malaria. “She had no quick referral to the nearest health facility due to issues of transport,” Matekenya says, noting that the community reached out to a politician but that his assistance came too late.</p><p>“I’m worried,” he says. “With family planning services not being offered any more, we are expecting to see a spike in pregnancies, and we are anticipating a possible rise in maternal deaths.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121825\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121825\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121825\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3520-1763738700-rotated-e1765274778184.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121825\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Female patients recovering or awaiting treatment for obstetric fistula at the Bwaila Fistula Centre in Lilongwe [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"impact-on-fistula-care\">Impact on fistula care</h2><p>In a health clinic in Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe, a woman dressed in black with a golden brooch shuffles from hall to hall. Margaret Moyo is tending to her daily responsibilities as head coordinator at the Bwaila Fistula Centre.</p><p>Obstetric fistula occurs when a hole between the birth canal and bladder or rectum is formed during an obstructed and extended labour. Women who do not receive medical treatment can be left incontinent.</p><p>Beyond the physical pain, women suffering from obstetric fistula also face social stigma due to the constant leaking and are often ostracised from their communities.</p><p>The Bwaila Fistula Centre receives more than 400 patients a year from all over the country, as well as from districts in neighbouring Mozambique. It has 45 beds, one doctor and 14 specialised nurses, and some 30 patients were at the centre when Al Jazeera visited in August.</p><p>With fewer resources, individuals will not be seen as often during pregnancy, which could lead to undetected maternal health issues, including more cases of fistula, Moyo argues. She is also concerned that conversations around prevention and education will take a backseat.</p><p>“The focus should be on training midwives, access to care and education to delay pregnancy in younger women since they are often most at risk of fistula,” says Moyo.</p><p>Before the USAID cuts, Malawi’s government had already forecast a $23m shortfall for reproductive, maternal, and newborn health funding for 2025 owing to drops in foreign aid.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121835\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121835\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3578-1763738815-rotated-e1765274691904.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Margaret Moyo, head coordinator at the Bwaila Fistula Centre in Lilongwe [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"i-am-able-to-help-them\">‘I am able to help them’</h2><p>For the past five years, Moyo has been running what she calls an “ambassador” programme at her facility. Patients who undergo successful fistula repair and are reintegrated into their communities are trained and sent out into their communities.</p><p>So far, 120 fistula survivors have become patient ambassadors who educate through community outreach to bring in new patients for treatment.</p><p>One such ambassador is Alefa Jeffrey. Wearing a grey “Freedom from Fistula Foundation” T-shirt, the 36-year-old mother of four crosses her arms and gazes towards the floor as she talks about being ostracised after she gave birth and developed a fistula.</p><p>“I wasn’t allowed to go to church because the other girls made fun of me and said I smelled bad because I was leaking urine and stool,” she says. “My family told me to go to a traditional healer, but he wasn’t able to help.”</p><p>Jeffrey could deal with the physical pain, but she was tormented by the negative interactions with friends and family.</p><p>“I got used to dealing with fistula, but it was what people were saying that was giving me the most pain,” recounts Jeffrey, who says she even contemplated suicide.</p><p>But she also started looking for answers, asking the traditional healer and then eventually meeting an ambassador who came to her community to speak to women.</p><p>Having successfully undergone treatment, involving surgery and follow-up patient and educational care, Jeffrey now advocates for fistula education.</p><p>She has set up a WhatsApp group for people to chat with her for information about the condition. She has also brought in 39 mothers from her community to the clinic.</p><p>“I’m an expert now. I’m able to convince people to come, which isn’t easy,” says Jeffrey. “Some women have lived with a fistula for so long they don’t believe they can be repaired, and they have already given up, but I am able to help them.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3893-1763738989-rotated-e1765274144588.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patients await treatment for various ailments at the Nsanje District Hospital [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"lessons-from-the-past-we-didn-t-panic\">Lessons from the past: ‘We didn’t panic’</h2><p>Although health experts are worried about the future of a system without USAID in a country where more than 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, government leaders say they have been there before.</p><p>Back in 2017, during his first presidency, Trump halted funding for the <a href=\"/news/2017/4/4/us-ends-funding-for-united-nations-population-fund\">UNFPA and several groups</a> that provided family planning. Malawi’s government approached NGOs and other countries to alleviate the gaps in funding.</p><p>Through community and grassroots innovations, they believe they can weather the storm again.</p><p>“We didn’t panic when we heard about the USAID cuts,” says Dr Samson Mndolo, Malawi’s secretary of health. “Instead, we looked at how to be more efficient and get more services for our money.</p><p>“We looked at areas where we could maximise resources, so for example if an officer goes to a community to do immunisations, they can now provide family planning services in the same trip too.”</p><p>Sitting in his office in the Lilongwe City Council building behind an organised desk, Mndolo discusses the challenges.</p><p>“As soon as the stop-work orders came out, we lost close to 5,000 health workers. The majority of these are what we call HIV diagnostic assistants,” he says, referring to the fallout from the USAID cuts. “We are looking now to push towards a health system that is more community-based and not necessarily hospital-based.” In such a system, doctors and health workers from central hospitals would be dispatched more to remote communities, and regular community outreach would become part of their remit, requiring them to perform a wider array of services.</p><p>Mndolo and his colleagues are setting up online initiatives and WhatsApp chat groups to field questions from remote patients. He remains optimistic about Malawi’s health system and says the worst thing the country can do now is to lose hope.</p><p>“Each crisis is an opportunity. This gives us a chance to strengthen the system and retrain our workforce and digital health systems,” he says.</p><p>“We are not naive. This will take some time, but once we get a hold of that as a nation, we can be better with time; that is the opportunity that is there for us.”</p><p>Despite such reassurance, those in remote communities say they feel isolated.</p><p>Tendai Kausi, a 22-year-old mother from the Musa community in the Mulanje district, still goes to the remote health post for help with her four-year-old son, Saxton. But because of the cuts and closures, many women from her community do not, and she has seen new mothers carry pregnancies in their isolated villages – far from healthcare and without routine checks.</p><p>“This is not good for the development of our country,” she says.</p><p>“My child will be affected because the services here will not get better,” Kausi says. “I feel very sad for my community.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121831\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121831\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121831\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3531-1763738771.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Malawi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patients at the Bwaila Fistula Centre [Imran-Ullah Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

She is the first woman ever elected as mayor in the city.</p><p>She won Tuesday’s run-off after leading the first round of voting on November 4 with 35 percent of the vote to Gonzalez’s 19 percent.</p><p>“Tonight, the people of Miami made history,” Higgins said in a statement. “Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city.”</p><p>Higgins’ victory adds to a run of recent Democratic wins, including races in New Jersey and Virginia, as the party looks towards the 2026 midterms. That trend continued with strong results in November’s off-year elections and a solid showing in this month’s special House race <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/tennessee-special-election-results-what-we-know-about-matt-van-eppss-win\">in Tennessee</a>.</p><p>While Miami’s mayor wields limited formal power, the role is highly symbolic, representing a city with a large Latino population at the centre of national immigration debates.</p><p>Home to roughly half a million residents, Miami is Florida’s second-most populous city after Jacksonville. In recent election cycles, it has shifted towards Republicans, making a Democratic win stand out even more. Trump had won Miami-Dade County in the 2024 presidential election against her Democratic rival Kamala Harris.</p><p>Hispanic or Latino residents make up roughly 70 percent of Miami’s population. In Miami-Dade County overall, <a href=\"https://www.beaconcouncil.com/demographics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about</a> 69–70 percent of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino – a demographic majority that significantly shapes the region’s cultural and political identity.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-are-some-of-the-key-issues-of-this-campaign\">What are some of the key issues of this campaign?</h2><p data-start=\"99\" data-end=\"148\">Immigration was a key issue in Higgins’ campaign.</p><p data-start=\"150\" data-end=\"378\">In Miami, she often talked about Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, saying she heard from residents who were worried about family members being detained. She described the election as a referendum on the president’s policies, which have caused concerns about due process.</p><p data-start=\"150\" data-end=\"378\">More than 200,000 people have been arrested since Trump launched the crackdown on migrants in January. At least 75,000 people, who were arrested as part of Trump’s fight against gang members and criminals, had no criminal records, according to new data. He has deported hundreds of migrants and halted asylum and green card applications.</p><p data-start=\"150\" data-end=\"378\">The Trump administration had also ordered the arrest of several students who participated in protests against Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Several of them have since been released by the courts.</p><p data-start=\"150\" data-end=\"378\">The difference between the candidates was clear during a debate last month. Higgins called immigration enforcement in Miami “cruel and inhumane” and criticised the detention centre opened by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, commonly known as “Alligator Alcatraz”.</p><p data-start=\"380\" data-end=\"768\">In that same debate, her opponent, Gonzalez, said he supported federal law enforcement rounding up “people who commit crimes”.</p><p data-start=\"380\" data-end=\"768\">“I support putting down migrant criminals, I cannot in good conscience fight with the federal government and defend a rapist or a murderer,” Gonzalez added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4163468\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4163468\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4163468\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25342819698069-1765314765.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Republican Emilio Gonzalez and Democrat Eileen Higgins\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4163468\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This combination of images shows candidates for mayor of Miami, from left, Republican Emilio Gonzalez and Democrat Eileen Higgins [AP]</figcaption></figure><p data-start=\"770\" data-end=\"888\">Higgins repeated her message in an interview with El Pais <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-12-08/eileen-higgins-government-officials-are-talking-about-our-residents-as-if-they-are-less-than-human-they-are-not-criminals-theyre-part-of-this-community.html\">this week,</a> drawing a sharp contrast with Trump’s approach.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1012\">“He and I have very different points of view on how we should treat our residents, many of whom are immigrants,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"1014\" data-end=\"1141\">“That is the strength of this community. We are an immigrant-based place. That’s our uniqueness. That’s what makes us special.”</p><p data-start=\"1336\" data-end=\"1560\">Affordability was also a major issue in the race. Higgins focused her campaign on local concerns such as housing costs, while Gonzalez campaigned on repealing Miami’s homestead property tax and streamlining business permits.</p><p data-start=\"1562\" data-end=\"1786\">“My opponent is keen on building, building, building,” Gonzalez <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/politics/miami-mayor-runoff-election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told CNN</a>. “She wants to put a skyscraper in every corner … then calling it affordable housing, which is a misnomer, because very rarely is it truly affordable.”</p><p data-start=\"1562\" data-end=\"1786\">During a speech in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Trump raised <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/18/trump-mcdonalds-lower-prices\">the issue of affordability</a>, which Democrats have highlighted. He blamed high prices on his predecessor, Joe Biden.</p><p data-start=\"1562\" data-end=\"1786\">The cost of living has been on the election campaign agenda in recent gubernatorial and mayoral elections in which Democrats have made gains, including <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/5/mamdanis-win-a-rejection-of-genocide-donor-rule-and-the-democratic-elite\">the much-publicised New York mayoral election</a>. The Democratic wins show that the issue has resonated with voters.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"who-is-eileen-higgins\" data-start=\"184\" data-end=\"466\">Who is Eileen Higgins?</h2><p data-start=\"124\" data-end=\"389\">Higgins is Miami’s first non-Hispanic mayor in nearly three decades. Born in Ohio and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, she earned a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from the University of New Mexico and later completed an MBA at Cornell University.</p><p data-start=\"393\" data-end=\"643\">Before becoming mayor, Higgins represented a politically conservative district that includes Little Havana, the city’s well-known Cuban enclave.</p><p data-start=\"393\" data-end=\"643\">She has embraced the nickname “La Gringa,” a term commonly used in Spanish to refer to white Americans.</p><p data-start=\"647\" data-end=\"1066\">Her professional background spans international development and consulting, with a focus on infrastructure and transportation projects across Latin America. She later served as Peace Corps country director in Belize and went on to work as a foreign service officer for the United States Department of State, where her portfolio included diplomatic and economic development efforts in countries such as Mexico and South Africa.</p><p data-start=\"647\" data-end=\"1066\">After her government service, Higgins returned to the private sector before eventually entering local politics in Miami.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"
