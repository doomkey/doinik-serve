It can also be transmitted to humans via contaminated food products or directly from person to person.</p><p>The virus can be deadly. It typically incubates in the human body for five to 14 days, with symptoms occurring within three to four days.</p><p>It causes severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans, progressing from fever and headache to acute encephalitis (brain inflammation) in severe cases, Kaja Abbas, associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology and dynamics at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and Nagasaki University, said.</p><p>Symptoms can also include convulsions and mental confusion, and patients can fall into a coma within 24 to 48 hours in severe cases.</p><p>“The case fatality rate is high, between 40 percent and 75 percent, among people infected with the Nipah virus,” Abbas told Al Jazeera.</p><p>However, the virus’s basic reproduction number, which is the expected number of secondary infections stemming from a primary case, is “typically below one”, he said. This suggests the virus spreads in only a limited way via human-to-human transmission and there is a low likelihood of the virus becoming a widespread pandemic.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273618\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273618\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273618\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_Nipah_Jan29_2026-1769677212.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Nipah_Jan29_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4273618\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"where-have-outbreaks-of-the-nipah-virus-occurred-before\">Where have outbreaks of the Nipah virus occurred before?</h2><p>The first known outbreak of NiV was reported in 1998 when pig farmers and butchers in Malaysia and Singapore contracted it from infected pigs. At least 250 people were infected, with more than 100 deaths.</p><p>In 2014, NiV infections in the Philippines were associated with the slaughter of horses and consumption of infected horse meat.</p><p>Since 2001, there have been sporadic but recurring outbreaks in South Asia, particularly in Bangladesh and India.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, outbreaks in Bangladesh have been linked to humans consuming contaminated raw palm sap, having close contact with other people’s secretions and excretions, and caring for infected patients.</p><p>According to the WHO, the first cases in India were recorded in West Bengal in 2007 but an earlier outbreak was retrospectively identified in the state’s Siliguri city in 2001. The 2001 Siliguri outbreak occurred in a healthcare setting where 75 percent of cases were of hospital staff or visitors, the WHO said.</p><p>Since 2018, dozens of deaths have been reported in India’s Kerala state, which is now regarded as the world’s highest-risk region for the virus.</p><p>The reasons for other outbreaks in Indian states are unclear. Some medical experts have <a href=\"/features/2025/7/26/what-is-the-nipah-virus-and-is-it-spreading-in-southern-india\">suggested</a> outbreaks may have been triggered by human consumption of fruit contaminated by bat saliva or urine, while the Indian Council of Medical Research has suggested that while the virus is primarily spread by physical contact, it may also be airborne.</p><p>According to Abbas, there is no clear evidence about the cause of the latest outbreak in West Bengal, which has occurred after decades without outbreaks.</p><p>Abbas said the fact that the two confirmed cases are both healthcare workers in the same hospital indicates a potential transmission from an infected but undiagnosed patient to the healthcare workers at the hospital.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273710\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273710\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273710\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-29T063807Z_517781593_RC2BPP9129J1_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-NIPAHVIRUS-1769679681.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nipah\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4273710\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Field laboratory assistants catch a bat to collect specimens for Nipah virus research in the Shuvarampur area of Faridpur, Bangladesh, on September 14, 2021 [File: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-there-a-vaccine-for-the-virus\">Is there a vaccine for the virus?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/nipah-virus\">According to</a> the WHO, there is currently no approved treatment or vaccine available for people infected by the virus or animals carrying the virus.</p><p>The University of Oxford has been conducting clinical trials in Bangladesh to test a Nipah virus vaccine and <a href=\"https://cepi.net/university-oxford-launches-worlds-first-phase-ii-nipah-virus-vaccine-trial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched</a> the second phase of trials in December 2025.</p><p>In the absence of approved vaccines, doctors have been treating patients with antivirals such as Ribavirin. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nipah-virus/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to</a> the United States government’s Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), Ribavirin was used to treat a small number of patients in a 1999 Nipah outbreak in Malaysia, but its efficacy in treatment remains unclear.</p><p>The CDC has said that the drug Remdesivir could also help prevent Nipah “when given to exposed nonhuman primates”.</p><p>The Indian state of Kerala <a href=\"/features/2025/7/26/what-is-the-nipah-virus-and-is-it-spreading-in-southern-india\">used</a> Remdesivir during a 2023 outbreak which resulted in an improved case fatality rate.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-announced-enhanced-screening-for-nipah-virus\">Which countries have announced enhanced screening for Nipah virus?</h2><p>Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal and Malaysia have all tightened international airport screening.</p><p>Thailand’s health ministry told journalists that it has assigned special parking bays for aircraft arriving from Nipah-affected countries, and passengers have been asked to complete health declaration forms before immigration.</p><p>Thermal scanners have also been installed at the Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok to screen people for fever and other symptoms of the virus.</p><p>Malyasia, Indonesia and Nepal have implemented similar measures at their international airports.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-best-way-to-prevent-the-spread-of-this-virus\">What is the best way to prevent the spread of this virus?</h2><p>On Wednesday, Hong Kong daily The South China Morning Post <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3341520/nipah-cases-india-raise-regional-anxiety-experts-say-wider-spread-unlikely\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> that social media channels in China had been flooded with posts from people expressing concern over the outbreak of the virus in India.</p><p>“It’s so scary, especially with the Spring Festival coming up.

Freshly collected date palm juice should be boiled, and fruits should be thoroughly washed and peeled before consumption. Fruits with sign of bat bites should be discarded,” the WHO reported.</p><p>It added that people should wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling sick animals or their tissues, and during slaughtering and culling procedures.</p><p>To control the spread of the virus in healthcare settings, WHO said, “contact and droplet precautions should be used in addition to standard precautions. In some cases, “airborne precautions” may also be required.</p><p>“Close unprotected physical contact with Nipah virus-infected people should be avoided. Regular hand washing should be carried out after caring for or visiting sick people,” the WHO added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It allowed him to remain in the country to care for his son, despite a 2006 order calling for his removal.</p><p>But the conditions of his stay included annual check-ins with ICE, which Maher completed for more than two decades. Over that time, he provided immigration agents with documents explaining his son’s complications from his surgeries and the care he needed to survive.</p><p>But on October 28, 2025, something changed. During Maher’s last check-in, ICE agents took him into detention as part of Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/trumps-approval-on-immigration-falls-to-record-low-new-poll-finds\">hardline immigration policies</a>.</p><p>His family spent months trying to convince officials of the role Maher played in his son’s life. Their petitions went unheeded.</p><p>Arnaout and other family members attended to Wael in his absence, but they were acutely aware of the unique bond the father and son had built over their 30-year relationship.</p><p>“It was very scary, because we didn’t want to do anything wrong,” Arnaout recounted. “His body was very fragile. We had to wait for Maher to call, so we could ask the questions we needed to ask.”</p><p>“One time, his feeding tube came all the way up,” she added. “We had to wait until Maher called so we could show him through video whether we were doing the right steps or not.”</p><h2 id=\"ice-is-responsible\">‘ICE is responsible’</h2><p>Wael’s family draws a direct line between his death and his father’s enforced absence, noting the 30-year-old experienced a physical and psychological decline as the months of separation stretched on.</p><p>During that time, he twice ended up in intensive care, and his health deteriorated during his most recent visit.</p><p>“ICE is responsible for the death of Wael,” Arnaout said. “They may not kill him with a bullet, but they killed him inside.”</p><p>As it became clear Wael’s final moments were approaching, family lawyer Ali Elhorr made a desperate appeal to ICE officials for Maher’s release.</p><p>First, Elhorr travelled to an ICE field office in Dallas, where he was told to contact the Bluebonnet Detention Center, where Maher was being held.</p><p>He was then given an email and sent back to the Dallas field office, before being redirected to another detention centre in Alvarado, Texas, an hour’s drive away.</p><p>Finally, Elhorr found the docket officer in charge and explained the situation. Soon after, he received an update.</p><p>“Basically, Maher would only be allowed a virtual [visit],” Elhorr recalled. “So basically, a Zoom call.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Maher was not able to be in the room as his son died. Elhorr’s efforts to gain Maher a supervised release for Wael’s funeral met a similar end.</p><p>“Initially, it seemed like they had agreed. They asked me to send through email exact funeral details, like times and locations of the different events, and it seemed like they were actually working to move him,” Elhorr said.</p><p>“And then, about 15 minutes later, I get another call from the officer who said, ‘My director called me and told me that he would not be allowed to attend his funeral.'”</p><p>To Elhorr, the message was clear: “The decision was made from higher up.”</p><p>The government’s indifference to Maher’s requests has drawn nationwide outrage, as the family shared their story on a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-mahers-family-during-this-urgent-crisis\">GoFundMe page</a> to help raise money for their legal fees.</p><p>“It’s just no compassion. No moral compass. It’s shameful in this country,” said Mustafaa Carroll, the interim executive director of the Texas branch for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).</p><p>“I have four sons. I can’t imagine what that must be like,” Carroll added. “They’re treating him like a hardened criminal.”</p><h2 id=\"this-has-to-stop\">‘This has to stop’</h2><p>According to his lawyer and family, Maher has no criminal history and no history of disobeying the provisions set out by immigration officials.</p><p>They are seeking to have Maher’s immigration case reopened after discovering that the individual who initially filed his immigration paperwork appears to have fraudulently posed as a lawyer.</p><p>Elhorr hopes the case, which is making its way through immigration court, could lead to Maher’s removal order being nixed. He has lived in the country since 1994.</p><p>ICE did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for information on Maher’s case.</p><p>However, in a statement to NBC News last year, an ICE spokesperson described Maher as a “criminal alien and self-admitted member of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] – a murderous foreign terrorist organization that has carried out countless terrorist attacks and plane hijackings”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Elhorr said the claim is as baffling as it is false. He emphasised that Maher has “zero involvement” with the PLO, which is an umbrella term for a coalition of Palestinian groups.</p><p>Furthermore, while the PLO was designated as a “terrorist” group by the US in 1987, it has been regularly granted waivers to maintain a diplomatic presence in the US.</p><p>For her part, Arnaout said Wael’s death has added a new dynamic to the push for Maher’s release.</p><p>“Maher was Wael’s arms, his legs, his lungs,” she said. “He has not been holding up. He is always alone, thinking about his son. We don’t want to lose him, too.”</p><p>“No family should go through this. No one,” she added. “This has to stop.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thiaw, who last week <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/22/senegal-coach-defends-afcon-final-walk-off-ahead-of-expected-sanction\">defended his side’s actions</a>, was banned for five African games and given a fine of $100,000 for bringing the game into disrepute, the African confederation said.</p><p>The game restarted after a delay of about 15 minutes. Morocco missed the penalty, and Senegal won the African title 1-0 after extra time.</p><p>The heated final in Rabat also saw supporters trying to storm the field, Morocco’s and Senegal’s players scuffling on the sidelines, reporters from the two countries fighting in media areas and a bizarre sequence in which Moroccan ball boys tried to seize a towel being used by Senegalese goalkeeper Edouard Mendy – in an apparent bid to distract him and help their team win the continental title.</p><p>That behaviour by the home team’s ball boys led to a $200,000 fine for Morocco’s federation, which will be a cohost of the 2030 World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal and has come under scrutiny for the chaotic African final.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>That behaviour by the home team’s ball boys led to a $200,000 fine for Morocco’s federation, which will be a co-host of the 2030 World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal and has come under scrutiny for the chaotic African final.</p><p>Morocco was hoping to host the 2030 World Cup final in Casablanca at the Hassan II Stadium, set to be the largest football arena in the world with a capacity of 115,000 people after its planned completion in 2028. But this month’s African final reflected badly on it.</p><p>Morocco coach Walid Regragui said the game had given African football a “shameful” image.</p><p>Senegalese players Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr were banned for two African games, Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi was also banned for two games with one suspended and Morocco’s Ismael Saibari was banned for three games and fined $100,000 for unsporting behaviour.</p><p>CAF dismissed an appeal by Morocco to have the result cancelled and Morocco declared the winner because of the Senegalese walk-off.</p><p>The game even strained diplomatic ties between Senegal and Morocco, prompting government officials in both nations to pledge to stay friends and call for calm. In Morocco, rights groups denounced what they called hate speech targeting sub-Saharan African residents in the country.</p><p>Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko said on an investment-related trip to Morocco days after the game that the reaction to it should be seen as “emotional outbursts produced by fervour and not as political or cultural rifts”.</p><p>In a further blow to Morocco’s 2030 FIFA World Cup ambitions, the president of Spain’s football federation <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/27/spanish-football-president-declares-it-will-host-2030-world-cup-final\">declared on Tuesday</a> that his country would be hosting the final.</p><p>FIFA, who will have the deciding say, have yet to confirm where the showpiece match of the tournament will be held.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the actual crossing process differs sharply by direction. A European Union monitoring mission is also expected to be on hand, but its role is unclear. Here is the reported plan:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Leaving Gaza:</strong> For Palestinians exiting to Egypt, Ynet reported, there will be no physical Israeli presence inside the terminal. Instead, Israel will operate a “remote control” system. <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/uk-police-to-use-ai-facial-recognition-tech-linked-to-israels-war-on-gaza\">Facial recognition</a> cameras will transmit live feeds to an Israeli command centre where officers will have the capability to remotely lock the electronic gates instantly if a “<a href=\"/news/2023/5/7/chilling-effect-israels-ongoing-surveillance-of-palestinians\">suspect</a>” is identified.</li>\n<li><strong>Entering Gaza:</strong> For Palestinians trying to return home, the process is far more invasive. Returnees will be funnelled into an Israeli military checkpoint established just past the border. There, they will be subjected to body searches, X-ray scanning and biometric verification by Israeli soldiers before crossing the “yellow line”, which marks the 58 percent of Gaza that Israeli forces still occupy, and leaving Israel’s self-proclaimed buffer zone.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rafah-2-a-one-way-ticket\">‘Rafah 2’: A one-way ticket?</h2><p>This structural disparity has raised alarm among observers. Major General Samir Farag, former head of the Egyptian army’s Morale Affairs Department, told Al Jazeera that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to bypass <a href=\"/news/2005/11/15/deal-struck-over-gaza-border-crossing\">the 2005 Agreement</a> on Movement and Access concerning the Rafah crossing.</p><p>Farag said the Israeli proposal involves opening Rafah “in one direction” for exit only as part of a “displacement” agenda – a move he said Egypt has “categorically rejected”.</p><p>Ibrahim Al-Madhoun, director of the Palestinian Institution for Media, argued that this setup, often referred to as “Rafah 2”, is not a border crossing in the traditional sense but a “sorting platform managed with a mentality of forced displacement”.</p><p>“Israel is making exit relatively easier via remote monitoring while making entry a humiliating, physical ordeal at a military post,” Al-Madhoun told Al Jazeera. “They are engineering a system where people are encouraged to leave but are too terrified – or simply denied permission – to return.”</p><p>The proposed system marks a departure from the 2005 agreement, which designated Rafah as a Palestinian-Egyptian crossing under EU supervision, specifically to guarantee Palestinian sovereignty.</p><p>Security expert Osama Khaled warned that the implications of the new mechanism go beyond logistics. By inserting itself into the minutiae of the crossing, Israel would secure a permanent chokehold on this Gaza lifeline.</p><p>“This is comprehensive electronic surveillance designed to ensure a mandatory Israeli presence,” Khaled said. “It transforms the crossing from a sovereign gateway into a tool for political blackmail.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The sharp focus on the Rafah crossing also has a darker side. According to comments by retired Israeli General Amir Avivi, who still advises the military, Israel has cleared land in Rafah to construct an enormous facility to entrench its military control and presence in Gaza for the long term.</p><p>Avivi on Tuesday described the project as a “big, organised camp” capable of holding hundreds of thousands of people. He said it would be equipped with “ID checks, including facial recognition”, to track every Palestinian entering and leaving.</p></div></div></body></html>"

minorities, as government forces continue to <a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/syrian-army-offensive-overjoys-some-leaves-others-with-existential-fear\">consolidate control of the country</a> after a rapid offensive against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the north of the country.</p><p class=\"selectionShareable\">Interior Minister Anas Khattab issued the decision on Wednesday, mandating that the decree applies to all Kurds residing in Syria and explicitly includes those listed as stateless, the Anadolu news agency reported, citing the Syrian television station Alikhbariah.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of

href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">had declared</a> the recognition of Kurdish as one of the country’s national languages and the restoration of citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians, as he announced a ceasefire between Syrian and Kurdish forces.</p><p>The rapid advance of Syrian forces forced the SDF to withdraw from more cities, including Raqqa and Deir Az Zor, allowing the government in Damascus to unite the country after a nearly 14-year-long ruinous civil war.</p><p>The development has drawn praise from United States President Donald Trump, who told al-Sharaa that he was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trump-praises-syrian-president-al-sharaa-after-offensive-against-sdf\">“very happy”</a> about the Syrian army offensive despite the previous US backing of the SDF.</p><p>Still, there have been reports of <a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/syrian-army-offensive-overjoys-some-leaves-others-with-existential-fear\">Kurdish civilians facing a shortage of food</a> and displacement as a standoff between Syrian forces and the SDF continues in the country’s northern region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the Anadolu report, the authorities in charge of rolling out al-Sharaa’s order have been asked to draft instructions and guidelines for the decree’s implementation at once.</p><p>Under al-Sharaa’s decree, the state has also been instructed to safeguard the culture and language of Syrian Kurds, as well as the teaching of the Kurdish language in public and private schools in Kurdish-majority areas.</p><p>The decree has also designated March 21 as the date of the Newroz festival, a nationwide celebration welcoming spring that is widely observed, not just in Syria.</p><p>On Wednesday, al-Sharaa met <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/28/putin-congratulates-al-sharaa-on-his-efforts-to-unify-syrian-territory\">Russian President Vladimir Putin</a> in Moscow to discuss the future of Syria and the presence of Russian troops in the country.</p><p>At the meeting, Putin praised his Syrian counterpart’s ongoing efforts to stabilise his country.</p><p>Since al-Sharaa’s forces toppled Russian ally Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Moscow has been working to build relations with him and ensure a continued military foothold in the country to bolster its influence in the Middle East.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Billions of dollars of savers’ money cannot be left to chance in banks in a region held by rebels.” He points out that the authorities in Kinshasa were and are the “only ones responsible” if the money was lost as a result of the war, and they avoided the worst by closing the banks and moving the cash to “secure” locations far from the ”sound of boots”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Since the fall of Goma, M23 rebel leaders and Congolese authorities have been trading accusations over the closure of banks in Goma and other regions under M23 administration.</p><p>The coordinator of the M23-AFC political-military alliance believes that holding the population’s savings against their will may constitute a war crime.</p><p>“They ordered the banks not to open.

No bank can legally operate under US sanctions,” Congolese Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya Katembwe emphasised during a media briefing last year.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the banks to ask about the reasons for continued closure, but most did not respond. Access Bank in eastern DRC said they were “not authorised” to comment.

He hopes for the total withdrawal of the M23-AFC from all areas under their control.</p><p>Muweza has been between jobs since M23 took over the city and wants all ongoing peace initiatives to be concluded to enable the Congolese people to enjoy an “endless peace” that seems “elusive” right now.</p><p>A year since M23’s rapid advance, peace deals mediated by the United States and Qatar have been signed by the rebels and the DRC’s government, while regional efforts also continue. The rebels recently withdrew from the city of Uvira, on the border between the DRC and Burundi, allowing the “symbolic” return of authorities installed by Kinshasa.</p><p>But for Congolese across the east of the country, the future remains uncertain.</p><p>“They [M23] have done well on security, but we are very hungry,” said David Linda, a resident of Goma. “Peace is good. People are sleeping well. The guns are silent. But we don’t have food.”</p><p>A year after her life and bank account were thrown into disarray, Zawadi, the pharmacy owner – like other businesspeople in Goma – is still finding workarounds to make a living.

But until the banks reopen, this is her only choice.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it has become central to the voting climate as the most visible guarantor of public order, with the police still weakened in morale and capacity after the upheaval of 2024, and with the country still reckoning with a “security apparatus” that watchdogs and official inquiries say was used to shape political outcomes under Hasina.</p><p>For nearly a year and a half now, soldiers have policed the streets of Bangladesh, operating under an order that grants them magisterial powers in support of law and order.

But the military chose not to, he said, in part because it had learned from the fallout of past experiments with its direct political control.</p><p>Asif Shahan, a political analyst and professor at Dhaka University, said the military was aware that a takeover would have also jeopardised key interests, including Bangladesh’s United Nations peacekeeping deployments, which carry both financial benefits and reputational weight for the armed forces. Bangladesh has for decades been one of the biggest suppliers to UN peacekeeping missions, and receives between $100m and $500m a year in payouts and equipment reimbursements for these services.</p><p>But Shahan argues that the military remains “an important political actor”. Today, he said, its influence is “less about overt intervention than the institutional weight it carries through the security and intelligence apparatus”.</p><p>He also pointed to what he called the army’s “corporate” footprint. That footprint spans involvement in major state infrastructure projects, the military’s own business conglomerate, and the presence of serving and retired officers across commercial and state bodies.</p><p>Shahan said the last Hasina government “gave them a share of the pie”, leaving “a kind of culture of corruption … ingrained”. He suggested that this could translate into informal pressure on whoever governs next to do the same, and anxieties inside the force over whether “the facilities and privileges” it has accumulated will shrink.</p><p>On the election itself, Shahan too said that the possibility of the army trying to gain overt control was “very low” unless there is such a major law and order breakdown that there is public demand for the army to step in as the “only source of stability”,</p><p>Others who track the military closely agreed. Rajib Hossain, a former army officer and author of the best-selling book Commando, said he “strongly believes” the army will avoid partisan involvement for its own sake. “The army will play a neutral role during this election,” he said. “What we’ve observed on the ground over the past year and a half, there is no record of the army acting in a partisan way.”</p><p>But, he added, pressure on the institution has been intense since 2024. “Internally, there’s an understanding that if the army fails to act neutrally, it could lose even the public credibility it still has,” he said.</p><p>Mustafa Kamal Rusho, a retired brigadier general at the Osmani Centre for Peace and Security Studies, also told Al Jazeera that the military does not have “any clear intent” to influence politics, though “it still remains a critical power base”.</p><p>That leverage was clearest during the 2024 uprising, Rusho said, when Bangladesh’s political crisis reached a point that many Bangladeshis and international watchdogs viewed the military’s posture as decisive. “If the military did not take the stand that it took, then there would have been more bloodshed,” he said.</p><p>With protests <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2024/8/5/bangladesh-protests-live-army-chief-to-address-nation-amid-new-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">escalating</a>, the military refused to fully enforce Hasina’s curfew orders and decided troops would not fire on civilians. It enabled Hasina to flee to India on an air force plane, and the army chief then announced an interim government would be formed.</p><p>In an Al Jazeera <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txhtxb0ZjVk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentary</a> on the uprising last year, Waker-uz-Zaman, who is related to Hasina and was appointed less than two months before her collapse, also stressed that his forces would not turn their guns on civilians. “We don’t shoot at civilians. It’s not in our culture … So we did not intervene,” he said.</p><p>In the same interview, he added: “We believe that the military should not engage in politics … It’s not our cup of tea.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273206\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273206\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273206\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-12-16T170242Z_329957784_RC2CDL3DOEQ0_RTRMADP_3_REUTERS-ARCHIVE-1769664979.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C517&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"President Hussain Muhammad Ershad of Bangladesh meeting British PM Thatcher at Downing St. London.

Rahman was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/world/bangladesh-leader-is-shot-and-killed-in-a-coup-attempt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assassinated</a> in 1981 in a failed coup attempt by another group of military officers. The BNP remains a key contender in the February 12 vote, now led by Rahman’s son, Tarique Rahman, who has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/bangladesh-opposition-leader-tarique-rahman-returns-after-17-years-in-exile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">returned to front-line politics</a> after a long exile.</p><p>In 1982, then army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad seized power and ruled for much of the 1980s. Writer and political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/bengali/articles/cx208wg3n1jo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described</a> Ershad’s takeover as coming only months after he publicly argued that “the army should be brought in to help run the country”.</p><p>Eventually, a pro-democracy movement led by Zia’s wife, Khaleda Zia, and Hasina, also Mujibur Rahman’s daughter, forced him from office. The BNP won a landmark election, and in 1991, Khaleda became the country’s first female prime minister.</p><p>Since then, Rusho said, the military’s influence “became more indirect”, though Bangladesh still saw an abortive May 1996 showdown when the then army chief, Lieutenant General Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim, defied presidential orders, and troops loyal to him moved towards Dhaka. Nasim was arrested and removed from office.</p><p>A decade later, in 2007, the military in effect “fully backed” a caretaker government that was formed to replace Khaleda’s second administration, which had ruled between 2001 and 2006. That caretaker government was installed in January 2007 after a breakdown in the election process and escalating political violence. The International Crisis Group <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/rpt/asia-pacific/bangladesh/151-restoring-democracy-bangladesh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described</a> the caretaker administration as “headed by technocrats but controlled by the military”, while then-army chief Moeen U Ahmed argued the political climate “was deteriorating very rapidly” and that the military’s intervention had “quickly ended” street violence.</p><p>It was only after 2009, when Hasina came back to power – her Awami League had first ruled between 1996 and 2001 – that the military became “subordinate to the civilian regime”, Rusho said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273209\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273209\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24203441938562-1769665076.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladeshi military force soldiers on armored vehicles patrol the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh, Saturday, July 20, 2024.

The interview, which critics described as something unprecedented for a serving army chief, placed the military close to the country’s central political debate.</p><p>Hossain, the former army officer and author, criticised the public nature of the intervention. “If he [Zaman] had discussed this after sitting with all the stakeholders … the interim [administration], political parties, protest leaders … and then gone to the media, that would be acceptable,” he said. “But here, he declared it unilaterally and blindsided the government from his position of power. He had no authority to do that.”</p><p>“You may say this is an extraordinary, transitional time and the military has a role to play,” Hossain added. “But then, why do we have an administration at all?”</p><p>Shahan, the Dhaka University professor, said Zaman “came very close” to crossing the line and explained it as a product of military institutional culture after August 5. “Military organisations … like to follow standing operating procedures, order, stability,” he said. But August 5, he added, was “a political rupture” that forced the army and the nation into uncertainty: about the interim government’s longevity, legitimacy and how it would deal with the military.</p><p>Those anxieties, Shahan said, likely pushed Zaman to speak. In principle, he said, it is reasonable for the army chief to say elections are needed for stability. But “when he set a specific timeline – within 18 months – that is beyond his role”, Shahan said. “It then appears as if he is dictating.”</p><p>Shahan added that the problem becomes sharper when that kind of specificity appears to respond to a party demand; he was referring to a time when only the Bangladesh Nationalist Party was repeatedly pushing for a vote timetable.</p><p>Eight months later, in May 2025, Zaman again weighed in, telling a high-level military gathering, according to local media reports, that his position had not changed and that the next national vote should be held by December 2025. After that, Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special adviser to Yunus, wrote on Facebook that “the army can’t meddle in politics” and argued that the military chief had failed to maintain “jurisdictional correctness” by prescribing an election deadline.</p><p>Around the same period, rumours emerged suggesting that <a href=\"/features/2025/5/24/why-is-bangladeshs-interim-leader-muhammad-yunus-considering-resigning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yunus had considered resigning </a>amid political discord.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273212\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273212\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273212\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24226468280254-1769665174.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Military personnel stand in front of a portrait of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on July 30, 2024, during a national day of mourning to remember the victims of recent deadly clashes.

Human Rights Watch has described enforced disappearances as a “hallmark” of Hasina’s rule since 2009.</p><p>When the United States sanctioned the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in 2021 over allegations of extrajudicial killings, the US Department of the Treasury <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>, “These incidents target opposition party members, journalists, and human rights activists.” Critics argue that security institutions became central to governance, and questions about how that machinery was used are now part of the post-Hasina political settlement.</p><p>Hossain, the former officer, said the Hasina-era legacy still echoes inside the top brass. “If you look at the leadership, the general, five lieutenant generals, and some major generals and brigadier generals, a lot of them were part of Hasina’s apparatus,” he said, “aside from a handful of professional officers”.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://coied.portal.gov.bd/pages/publications/final-report-69662bc77746b8be8ee26287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> by Bangladesh’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances says disappearances were used as a “tool for political repression” and that the practice “reached alarming levels during key political flashpoints”, including in the run-up to elections in 2014, 2018 and 2024. The commission said it verified 1,569 cases of enforced disappearance.</p><p>In cases where political affiliation could be confirmed, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/what-is-bangladeshs-jamaat-e-islami-party-could-it-lead-the-country-next\">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> and its student wing accounted for about 75 percent of victims, while the BNP and its affiliated groups accounted for about 22 percent. Among those “still missing or dead”, the BNP and its allies accounted for about 68 percent, while the Jamaat and its affiliates accounted for about 22 percent, the report said.</p><p>The commission also noted that the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), the military-run intelligence agency, had been “accused of manipulating domestic politics and interfering in the 2014 parliamentary elections”, and argued that perceived alignment with the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/11/bangladesh-bans-activities-of-awami-league-the-party-of-ousted-pm-hasina\">Awami League</a> compromised its neutrality.</p><p>Several senior military officers, including 15 in service, are now facing trial in a civilian tribunal on charges of enforced disappearances, murders and custodial tortures.</p><p>The proceedings have become a delicate issue in civil-military relations, as cases against serving officers in civilian courts are rare in Bangladesh’s history.</p><p>Former army chief Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan wrote on Facebook that local media had reported disagreements over the “trial process” for officers accused of crimes against humanity and that those disagreements had created what he described as a “chasm” between the interim government and the army’s top leadership.</p><p>Hossain, the former officer, however, said he disagreed. “These trials are not defaming the army,” Hossain said. “Rather, they are a kind of redemption for the institution to recover from the stigma created by the crimes of some self-serving officers.”</p><p>He argued that accountability could motivate younger officers and reduce the risk of the military being politically exploited again. Rusho, the retired brigadier general, also argued that politicisation under Hasina was driven less by formal doctrine than by executive control over careers.</p><p>“Promotions, important postings, placements … they were influenced considerably by the executive branch,” he said. “When you influence postings, some people’s loyalty often gets diverted to political masters, [and] it affects … professionalism and capability.”</p><p>Kean of the International Crisis Group said the real test for Bangladesh now would be whether it can stop the security state from being reabsorbed into partisan politics.</p><p>“The military is going to remain a powerful institution in Bangladesh, with a level of influence in domestic politics,” he said. “One hopes that the lesson of the past 18 months is that the military is better to support civilian administrations rather than be in power directly – that it can be a stabilising force, and one that is ultimately committed to democracy and civilian leadership.”</p><p>But, he added, the onus to do that isn’t only on the generals. Civilian politicians, too, needed to resist the temptation to misuse the military. That alone, he suggested, would help Bangladesh keep the army in the barracks and politicians accountable to the people, not to men in khakis.</p></div></div></body></html>"
