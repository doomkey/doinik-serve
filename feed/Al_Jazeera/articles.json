It requires the Justice Department to publish all of its documents related to Epstein in an easily searchable format.</p><p>Though the law allows for some limited redaction to protect the identities of victims, critics argue that scores of documents have been published with heavy redactions. Some of those blacked-out sections appear to shield the identity of powerful figures involved with Epstein.</p><p>During her opening statement on Wednesday, Bondi, a prosecutor from Florida, defended her record of addressing sexual abuse.</p><p>“I have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"epstein-victims-were-present\">Epstein victims were present</h2><p>With several victims of Epstein seated behind her in the hearing room, Bondi forcefully defended the department’s handling of the files related to the well-connected financier, an issue that has dogged her tenure.</p><p>During her opening remarks, Bondi deemed Epstein a “monster” and issued an apology to the victims.</p><p>“I am deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster,” Bondi said.</p><p>At one point during the hearing, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, asked the Epstein victims to raise their hands if they had not had a chance to meet with a member of the Justice Department. All the victims raised their hands.</p><p>The victims included Danielle Bensky, who met Epstein in 2004 when she was 17 years old. She has accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her.</p><p>“There was such a lack of empathy today. There was such a lack of, honestly, humanity today,” Bensky told an NBC programme after the hearing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"bondi-clashes-with-democrats\">Bondi clashes with Democrats</h2><p>Congressional Democrats accused the US attorney general on Wednesday of engaging in a “cover-up” of the Jeffrey Epstein files and turning the Department of Justice into an “instrument of revenge” for Trump.</p><p>Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin criticised the slow release of the Epstein files and the redactions made to the documents.</p><p>“You’re running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice,” Raskin said. “You’ve been ordered by subpoena and by Congress to turn over six million documents, photographs and videos in the Epstein files, but you’ve turned over only three million.”</p><p>When pressed by Representative Jayapal, Bondi refused to turn and face the Epstein victims in the audience and apologise for what Trump’s Justice Department has “put them through”. She accused the Democrat of “theatrics”.</p><p>Texas Democrat Jasmine Crockett stormed out of the hearing after a spat with Bondi. “This is a big cover-up. And this administration is still engaged in it. In fact, this administration is complicit,” Crockett said.</p><p>During a heated exchange, Crockett said Bondi would be remembered as one of the worst attorneys general, prioritising loyalty to Trump over the law, before yielding the rest of her time.</p><p>Bondi shot back that Crockett had not even tried to question her and accused her of ignoring the fact that Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries had taken money from Epstein after his conviction, a claim Jeffries has denied.</p><p>The attorney general also clashed with Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California. Lieu asked whether Trump had attended a party with underage girls, a question Bondi deemed “ridiculous”.</p><p>Bondi insisted there was no evidence Trump had committed a crime.</p><p>Lieu suggested that her answer amounted to lying under oath, noting that Trump’s name appears repeatedly in the Epstein files. Bondi shot back: “Don’t you ever accuse me of committing a crime.”</p><p>Trump’s name appears multiple times in the released Epstein files, but not in connection with the sexual abuse of women. Rather, the records primarily show that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/how-well-did-trump-and-epstein-really-know-each-other-a-timeline\">he and Epstein were acquainted</a> and had a social relationship.</p><p>For instance, Trump was listed as a passenger on Epstein’s private jet at least eight times between 1993 and the mid-1990s.</p><p>On February 1, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One about his name being mentioned in the latest tranche of Epstein files: “I was told by some very important people that not only does it absolve me, it’s the opposite of what people were hoping, you know, the radical left.”</p><h2 id=\"republicans-join-democrats-in-questioning-bondi\">Republicans join Democrats in questioning Bondi</h2><p>Bondi accused Democrats of using the Epstein files to distract from Trump’s successes, even though it was Republicans who initiated the furore over the records and Bondi herself fanned the flames by distributing binders to conservative influencers at the White House last year.</p><p>Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to require the files’ release, accused the Justice Department of a “massive failure” to <a href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?search=all%3AL6N3WT1GT&amp;linkedFromStory=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comply with the law</a> as he questioned why billionaire Leslie Wexner’s name was redacted in an FBI document listing potential co-conspirators in the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.</p><p>Bondi said Wexner’s name appeared numerous times in other files the department released and that the DOJ unredacted his name on the document “within 40 minutes” of Massie spotting it.</p><p>“Forty minutes of me catching you red-handed,” Massie replied.</p><p>On Tuesday, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna revealed the names of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/six-men-named-in-us-congress-why-is-so-much-redacted-in-the-epstein-files\">six men</a>, including Wexner.

Her security clearance was also revoked.</p><p>Palestinian leaders are now questioning whether Oslo’s foundational agreements of the two-state solution were brokered by a mediator vulnerable to elite blackmail and foreign intelligence pressure.</p><p>The plan was heralded in the Western world at the time, and in the 30 years since, has been trampled on by successive Israeli governments, with the far-right leadership now openly pushing for <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/palestinians-sense-west-bank-annexation-after-israel-approves-new-rules\">annexation of the occupied West Bank</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Investigations by the Norwegian broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.nrk.no/urix/slik-hjalp-rod-larsen-og-epstein-hverandre-med-rekruttering-1.17754499\">NRK</a> and newspaper <a href=\"https://www.dn.no/jus/utenriksdepartementet/terje-rod-larsen/jeffrey-epstein/rod-larsen-hjalp-epstein-med-visum-til-russisk-eks-modell/2-1-1937969\">Dagens Næringsliv</a> (DN) detail how Rod-Larsen used his position as president of the International Peace Institute (IPI) think tank in New York to launder the reputation of Epstein’s associates.</p><p>According to the files, Rod-Larsen wrote official letters of recommendation to US authorities to secure visas for young Russian women in Epstein’s orbit, claiming they possessed “extraordinary abilities” suitable for research roles.</p><p>In reality, these women were often models with no academic background who were allegedly trafficked and abused by the financier. One victim told NRK she believed Epstein sent her to Rod-Larsen’s institute “to manipulate” her, while another described how the diplomat facilitated her visa after a direct request from Epstein’s assistant.</p><p>The transactional nature of the relationship was explicit. Documents show Epstein loaned Rod-Larsen $130,000 in 2013. More damningly, reports indicate that Epstein’s last will and testament included a clause bequeathing $5m each to Rod-Larsen’s two children – a total of $10m.</p><h2 id=\"oslo-was-a-trap\">‘Oslo was a trap’</h2><p>For Palestinians living under the reality of the failed agreements Rod-Larsen forged, the scandal offers a disturbing explanation for a “peace process” that many believe was rigged.</p><p>Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative political party, told Al Jazeera he was “not surprised at all” by the corruption allegations.</p><p>“We never felt comfortable with this person from the very first moment,” Barghouti said. “Oslo was a trap … and I have no doubt that Terje Rod-Larsen was being effectively influenced by the Israeli side all along.”</p><p>Barghouti argued that the revelation of millions of dollars potentially flowing from a Mossad-linked figure like Epstein to the Rod-Larsen family suggests the corruption was “directed to serve Israel’s interests against the interests of the Palestinian people”.</p><p>The ties between the disgraced <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">Epstein and Israel</a> have come into sharp focus after the release of millions of documents.</p><p>The documents have revealed more details of Epstein’s interactions with members of the global elite, including former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. But they also document his funding of Israeli groups, including Friends of the IDF (Israeli army), and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his ties to members of Israel’s overseas intelligence services, the Mossad.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-missing-archive\">The missing archive</h2><p>The scandal has reignited calls in Norway to open the “private archive” Rod-Larsen kept regarding the 1993 secret negotiations.</p><p>Media investigations have revealed that <a href=\"https://www.dagogtid.no/samfunn/ud-dokument-finst-i-israelske-arkiv/614217\">documents</a> from the critical period between January and September 1993 are <a href=\"https://www.prio.org/publications/4097\">missing</a> from the official Foreign Ministry archive. Critics argue these missing files could obscure the extent to which personal leverage or blackmail played a role in the concessions extracted from the Palestinian leadership during the secret talks.</p><h2 id=\"governing-by-blackmail\">Governing by blackmail</h2><p>Analysts argue the Rod-Larsen case is symptomatic of a wider system of global governance driven by systematic blackmail and intelligence operations.</p><p>Wissam Afifa, a political analyst based in Gaza, drew a parallel between the exploitation of minors on Epstein’s island and the geopolitical treatment of Palestinians.</p><p>“We, as Palestinians, were treated as minors … considered as having no right to demand our rights,” Afifa said. “Today we discover that a large part of the international system is essentially ‘Epstein Island’”.</p><p>Afifa suggested that the “silence” of the international community regarding the current genocidal war on Gaza could be linked to similar networks of influence and extortion.</p><p>“The world was managed from Epstein’s island … in dark rooms,” Afifa added. “We are victims of the influence network that Epstein managed with politicians, leaders and states”.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.dn.no/politikk/jeffrey-epstein/terje-rod-larsen/international-peace-institute/ud-gjennomgar-forholdet-til-rod-larsens-tankesmie/2-1-1938768?abtest=a\">Norwegian authorities</a>, including the economic crime unit Okokrim, open investigations into the scandal, the legacy of the diplomat who once shook hands on the White House lawn lies in tatters, casting a long shadow over the history of deeply flawed Middle East peacemaking.</p></div></div></body></html>"

the economy and increased investment in defence as key areas, with plans to invest one billion euros ($1.18bn) for military purposes, including the production of combat drones.</p><p>“During these years, as we have all witnessed, we have faced constant attacks and threats from Serbia,” said Kurti of tense relations with Kosovo’s northern neighbour, which has never recognised its independence

If the crime took place when the victim was a minor, then they have 10 years to sue from when they turn 18.<strong> </strong></p><p>In September 2022, Congress passed a law removing the statute of limitations for victims of child sex abuse, but that change did not apply to any crimes committed before that date.</p><p>Virginia’s Law calls for the 10-year statute of limitations for all federal civil cases relating to sexual abuse and trafficking – regardless of when abuses were committed – to be scrapped.</p><p>Introducing the law on Tuesday, Schumer told Congress: “When the truth of Jeffrey Epstein finally started to come out, when the world finally started to listen to their stories, oftentimes the laws in the books said, ‘Sorry, it’s too late. The deadline to bring your case has passed.</p><p>He said Virginia’s Law “will change that, because justice for victims of abuse should not have an expiration date”.</p><p>The bill will ultimately mean that many of Epstein’s alleged victims will now be able to lodge civil claims against Epstein’s estate.</p><p>“Virginia’s dream was to inspire and empower survivors to come forward in a world that too often turns away from abuse and pushes it into the shadows. She wanted to bring light,” Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, said during a news conference in the US Capitol.</p><p>Virginia’s Law also expands victims’ legal options in other respects, such as by covering relevant sex crimes committed outside the US where a US court has jurisdiction – for example, in cases where the abuser or victim is American or where there has been sex trafficking to or from the US.</p><p>Virginia’s Law would apply to federal cases only and will not change state statutes of limitations.</p><p>“The bill applies only to federal sex abuse crimes involving the mails or interstate commerce as stipulated in 18 USC 2421 et seq,” constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein told Al Jazeera.</p><p>This means the bill would cover federal sex‑abuse and trafficking crimes, which fall under the 1910 federal law, the Mann Act – cases in which the abuse involved crossing state lines or using the mails, the internet or other channels of interstate commerce.</p><p>“The federal bill would not supersede state laws that commonly create civil causes of action for sexual abuse, including assault. The state laws would complement the federal law,” Fein said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-bill-pass-into-law\">How does the bill pass into law?</h2><p>The bill will have to gain the approval of enough members of the Republican-dominated Senate and the House of Representatives before it can be signed into law.</p><p>The House includes 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats empty. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independent senators who caucus with the Democratic Party. So far, there is no scheduled date for a vote on Virginia’s Law in either chamber.</p><p>In both chambers, the law requires a simple majority of members present and voting, which means it needs 51 votes in the Senate and 217 votes in the House. The bill must pass both chambers before it goes to the Oval Office for the president to sign it into law.</p><p>However, a bipartisan push succeeded last year in forcing the Department of Justice to release all unclassified files from its Epstein investigation through the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-statute-of-limitations\">What is a statute of limitations?</h2><p>A statute of limitations is a time limit for bringing a case. In criminal law, it sets how long prosecutors have to file charges; in civil law, it sets how long a victim has to sue their abuser.</p><p>If this time limit elapses, a defendant cannot be prosecuted or sued, even if there is strong evidence that they committed a crime.</p><p id=\"according-to-an-article-published-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi\">Statutes of limitations exist to limit the deterioration of evidence, promote swift enforcement of the law and provide greater legal certainty, according to the FBI.</p><p>“Memories fade, witnesses die, and documents are commonly lost over time,” lawyer Fein said.</p><p>Crimes besides sexual abuse also have statutes of limitations.</p><p>In the US, statutes of limitations for nonfederal civil and criminal cases vary by state. In criminal cases, they can also vary depending on whether the sexual abuse was a “felony” or “misdemeanour”, and whether the victim was a minor or an adult.</p><p>Felonies are serious crimes punishable by a year or more in a state or federal prison, while misdemeanours are “less serious” crimes that are punishable by fines, probation, or less than one year in a local jail.</p><p>For example, in Alabama, there is no statute of limitations for criminal cases of rape, sexual abuse involving violence or threats of violence, or sexual offences against a victim below the age of 16.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Arkansas, the criminal statute of limitations is six years for rape and three years for certain sexual assault offences.</p><p>States usually have separate statutes of limitations for civil cases, and they can be very different from the criminal ones.</p><p>Many states are moving to increase or scrap statutes of limitations for sexual abuse cases. Iowa, Vermont, California, Texas and others have eliminated or greatly extended criminal statutes of limitations for many sex crimes for both criminal and civil cases.</p><p>Other states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Florida and Alabama, have expanded civil filing windows, often allowing victims to sue decades after the abuse or after it is discovered. Several have also lengthened or lifted criminal statutes of limitations for certain sex crimes, particularly where there is strong evidence, such as DNA.</p><p>Virginia’s Law will not supersede any state laws, as it will relate to federal cases only.</p><h2 id=\"what-can-we-expect-if-virginia-s-law-passes\">What can we expect if Virginia’s Law passes?</h2><p>The bill would scrap civil time limits so that many survivors whose cases are currently time‑barred would now be able to sue. Some lawyers expect a flurry of lawsuits, particularly from Epstein victims, if this happens.</p><p>In May 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law the New York State Adult Survivors Act (ASA), allowing adult survivors of sexual assault to file civil lawsuits, regardless of when the abuse occurred. In 2019, New York had opened a similar window for people abused as children under its Child Victims Act.</p><p>The ASA expired in late November 2023. While the Act was active, more than 3,000 civil suits were filed under it, including writer E Jean Carroll’s successful <a href=\"/news/2023/4/25/what-to-know-about-e-jean-carroll-civil-rape-trial-against-trump\">sexual abuse and defamation case</a> against President Donald Trump.</p><p>In June 2019, Carroll published an excerpt of her book in a New York Magazine article alleging that Trump had raped her in 1996. Trump denied these allegations. In November 2019, Carroll sued Trump for defamation. After the ASA took effect in 2022, she filed her lawsuit against Trump for defamation as well as sexual abuse.</p><p>“If the law passes, an indeterminate number of women may bring civil actions against men identified in the Epstein files, [for example] Prince Andrew, seeking damages,” Fein said.</p><p>“The number is unknown because victims commonly are reluctant to sue because of [the] social stigma attached to women perceived to be promiscuous.”</p><h2 id=\"have-some-victims-been-barred-from-suing-in-other-ways\">Have some victims been barred from suing in other ways?</h2><p>The Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program was a fund set up in June 2020 by Epstein’s estate, with court approval in the US Virgin Islands, to provide compensation to many women who say they were abused. However, they were required to waive their right to sue Epstein or his estate in exchange for the compensation.</p><p>Some 225 claims were submitted under this fund before it shut down in August 2021 at the end of its remit. It is unclear whether women who received payouts from the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program would be able to benefit from Virginia’s Law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His barber shop was also demolished later that day.</p><p>Agando is one of the thousands of Makoko residents forcibly evicted from their homes by the Lagos State government, in a demolition operation that began in late December and only ended when the Lagos State House of Assembly ordered it be halted earlier this month.</p><p>The government said the demolitions were being carried out due to the community’s proximity to an electric power line, and that people needed to move back by 100 metres (109 yards). But authorities have gone beyond the 100-metre mark. Nonprofit organisations (NGOs) working with the community say the demolitions took place between 250 and 500 metres (about 270 and 550 yards) inside the settlement, destroying people’s homes, rendering thousands homeless and causing the death of more than 12 people, including two infants, in the process.</p><p>During the weeks of demolitions, the surrounding water was dotted with canoes carrying beds, bowls and other household appliances, as anxious community members removed their valuables in case operations reached them. At the same time, there have been no plans to resettle or compensate victims.</p><p>“They did not stop where they said they would; they just kept demolishing the whole place,” said Innocent Ahisu, one of the community’s leaders.</p><p>“This is where we live and get what we eat and drink.

It overlooks the Third Mainland Bridge, which connects the affluent Lagos Island with mainland Lagos, and its residents are predominantly fishermen who fish in the same water on which they have dwelled for decades. An economic hub, it serves markets around the city with fresh and dried seafood.</p><p>Although it is home to about 200,000 people, the combination of poverty and lack of government development and social infrastructure has made it a slum. Yet its scenic waterways plied by canoes hawking everyday necessities and food, and its distinct culture, make it a popular destination for visitors. Much of the community sits on water, but a part is situated on land.</p><p>On an average day, the sunset’s reflection on the water, coupled with rising smoke from the wooden houses and children swimming nearby, makes Makoko picturesque from a distance – its rugged imperfections that are a testament to resilience also giving it a unique beauty.</p><p>But recently, the landscape of the village has resembled the aftermath of a storm, with only the carcasses of wooden structures left in many places.</p><p>At one of Makoko’s numerous processing hubs for dried fish, women working are anxious about what the demolition means for their business and economic future.</p><p>“We hope they can see that we are humans and stop demolishing our homes,” one of the older women who did not want to give her name said in the local dialect, Egun.</p><p>This eviction will only increase hardship for people who are already disproportionately affected by Nigeria’s cost-of-living crisis, observers note.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0348-1770827379.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Makoko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Women at work at one of the huts where fresh fish is smoked before being supplied to the market [Pelumi Salako/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"history-is-going-to-be-lost\">‘History is going to be lost’</h2><p>Phoebe Ekpoesi, a mother of three, has been staying at a relative’s house in Makoko after her home was demolished.

Last year, local Nigerian outlets <a href=\"https://guardian.ng/property/real-estate/lagos-investors-begin-55-hectare-mixed-use-development-scheme-in-makoko-waterfront/\">reported</a> that the government had entered an agreement with a private contractor to develop an estate in Makoko, and promptly began sand dredging and land reclamation opposite the area.</p><p>“The unofficial reason is that Makoko is sitting in a highly coveted area. Makoko sits on the waterfront overlooking the lagoon from the Third Mainland Bridge. So that intersection between urban poverty and highbrow property development is one of the biggest pressures,” Ibezim-Ohaeri said.</p><p>Forceful eviction and demolition are not new to Nigeria’s economic capital. They follow a historical trend that has seen informal settlements and waterfront communities pushed out to make way for luxury estate developments.</p><p>In 1990, 300,000 people were forcefully evicted from Maroko in Lagos to make way for what has now become parts of Victoria Island and Oniru Estate, both sought-after areas for wealthy Nigerians. Otodo-Gbame faced a similar <a href=\"/news/2017/4/10/thousands-displaced-as-police-raze-lagos-otodo-gbame\">fate</a> in 2017 when its 30,000 residents were rendered homeless, and more recently, to make way for the luxurious Periwinkle estate.</p><p>Another waterfront community, Oworonshoki, is currently being demolished, and activists say a luxurious estate might spring up in the location soon.</p><p>Between 1973 and 2024, 91 eviction operations were carried out in parts of Lagos.</p><p>“There is an eviction playbook in Lagos State, and if you look at all the other evictions, it follows the same playbook,” Ibezim-Ohaeri said. “It will first of all be cited that there is something wrong in that area, and at the end of the day, new highbrow developments that are far beyond the reach of the former owner will spring up in that area.”</p><p>Ibezim-Ohaeri, who has been a counsel for Makoko since 2005, said the state has made more than 20 attempts to evict the residents of the village, but the community has resisted through court orders and pressures from civil society organisations.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305874\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305874\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305874\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0342-1770827633.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Makoko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Makoko residents load the belongings they can salvage into canoes [Pelumi Salako/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-power-line-or-the-people\">The power line or the people?</h2><p>Other waterfront communities and informal settlements are also at risk, Ibezim-Ohaeri said, as the Lagos government recently announced its plans to reclaim more informal lands.</p><p>“What this means for Lagos is that it has continued to follow a pattern of classism right from the colonial era,” said Akinpelu, who added that “it is very much time for the government to start to rethink its ways because providing housing for high-income earners creates an imbalance in the city.”</p><p>Experts said the city should be thinking of mixed-income housing patterns that allow everyone to get shelter, and not push more people into homelessness in the city of 22 million people, where a housing crisis is brewing.</p><p>“We have to consider what can give way to what. The power line or the people? The power line itself can be moved, but they found it right that the people are the ones who should move for the power line,” Akinpelu said.</p><p>On January 29, Makoko community members demonstrated at the government secretariat and demanded an audience with the city’s governor, but they were forcefully dispersed by the police who fired tear gas. A large banner read: “A megacity cannot be built on the bones and blood of the poor.”</p><p>This week, a compromise was reached by the Lagos State House of Assembly and the community that residents would not rebuild on the demolished structures, compensation would be determined by a committee, and a water-city regeneration project would be implemented in Makoko.</p><p>Meanwhile, for those evicted and displaced, the future looks bleak.</p><p>In Makoko, Agando is back to sleep under the mosquito-infested shed with his pregnant wife and relatives at his pastor’s house. His family is considering finding a place in Ikorodu, northeast of Lagos, as soon as they are able to get enough money.</p><p>“This is what we have for now,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305863\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305863\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305863\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0353-1770827482.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Makoko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305863\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Nigerian flag stands amid the ruins of Makoko [Pelumi Salako/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

interview with Al Jazeera Arabic during his visit to Doha, Qatar, where he met top officials on Wednesday, Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said Israel had been fabricating pretexts to try to derail the negotiations with Washington, as the renewed talks were at a delicate stage.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories

engaged in any talks with Israel,” he said.</p><p>“However, Israel has inserted itself into this process, with their intent on undermining and sabotaging these negotiations.”</p><p>He said Israel’s strategy was “to destabilise the region”, and that its agenda “extends beyond its alleged concerns about Iran”, as was evidenced by its <a href=\"/news/2025/9/9/israeli-attack-in-doha-sparks-regional-and-international-condemnation\">attack on the Qatari capital</a> targeting Hamas officials in September.</p><p>“They are gambling not only with Iran, but also Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye,” he said, calling on regional leaders to “be aware of this.”</p><p>Israel’s attack on Iran in June came as Tehran and Washington were engaged in talks and effectively torpedoed the negotiations, which were several rounds in.</p><h2 id=\"netanyahu-meets-with-trump\">Netanyahu meets with Trump</h2><p>Iran and the US held a round of indirect negotiations in Muscat, Oman, on Friday, seeking to negotiate a resolution to the nuclear dispute, amid a US military buildup in the region and Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/trump-threatens-iran-with-something-very-tough-if-us-demands-are-not-met\">ongoing threats</a> to strike Iran if it does not accede to his demands.</p><p>Amid plans for a second round of talks – the timing of which is currently under discussion, Larijani said – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday for urgent talks with Trump, where he presented the US leader with <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/netanyahu-says-hell-present-principles-for-iran-talks-to-trump\">“principles”</a> for negotiating with Iran.</p><p>After the meeting, Trump said <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/nothing-definitive-reached-about-iran-during-netanyahus-visit-with-trump\">“nothing definitive”</a> had been reached, “other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"common-ground\">‘Common ground’</h2><p>Larijani told Al Jazeera that Tehran had not yet received a specific proposal from Washington in the negotiations, and that the talks in Muscat had consisted of an exchange of messages.</p><p>He said that Tehran was taking a positive position towards the negotiations, and that Washington, too, appeared to have concluded that negotiations were the preferred option.</p><p>He said there was common ground between Tehran and Washington regarding Iran not possessing a nuclear weapon, which it insists it is not pursuing.</p><h2 id=\"missiles-zero-enrichment-off-the-table\">Missiles, zero enrichment off the table</h2><p>However, Larijani <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/iran-says-missile-programme-non-negotiable-as-tehran-washington-eye-talks\">reiterated</a> that the negotiations would be limited to Iran’s nuclear programme, with issues such as Iran’s missile programme – which the US has pushed to address in the talks, and is a key concern for Israel – not up for discussion.</p><p>“When we met at the negotiating table, a clear boundary was drawn … our talks centred solely on the nuclear issue,” he said, adding that this was a “logical” approach.</p><p>“Our missile program stands entirely separate from the nuclear one. It is a domestic matter, basically linked to our national security. As such, it cannot be part of these negotiations.”</p><p>Similarly, he said, the notion of Iran reducing its uranium enrichment to zero was “not on the table”.</p><p>“It is impractical for a country that has already mastered this technology to reduce it to zero,” he said, citing the need for enriched uranium for peaceful civilian purposes such as in cancer treatment.</p><p>“Meanwhile, we are open to verification, and anybody is welcome to come and see [our facilities] for themselves.”</p><p>If the US did opt to attack Iran, as it did in a series of strikes targeting the country’s nuclear facilities in June as part of a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a>, then Tehran would respond by attacking US military bases in the region, Larijani said.</p><p>Before leaving Doha, Larijani also met with Muhammad Darwish, the head of Hamas’s Leadership Council, along with a senior delegation from the Palestinian group, to discuss the latest political developments in the region and Israel’s war on Gaza, Lebanon’s Al-Manar reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The sun hasn’t fully risen, but 15-year-old Mahmoud rubs the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>He woke up this morning not in a warm bed, but on a thin mattress in a crowded tent – displaced, like hundreds of thousands of others in Gaza.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>And Mahmoud did not reach for a schoolbag to get ready for school. Instead, he picked up a rough, frayed burlap sack.</p><p>“The sack is empty now, but I feel its weight even before I fill it,” Mahmoud said, as he looked at his palms, calloused and scarred from carrying the sack around Khan Younis’s streets, planning to begin his day. “My back hurts before I even start walking.”</p><p>But Mahmoud insisted that he has to fill his sack – even if that comes at the expense of his childhood and his <a href=\"/features/2026/2/11/young-and-old-struggle-to-get-their-studies-back-on-track-in-gaza\">education</a>.</p><p>The young Palestinian is forced by the economic situation in Gaza, brought on by Israel’s genocidal war, to spend his days filling his sack with items that can be used as fuel for his family.</p><p>Nylon, cardboard and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/israeli-drone-strike-kills-two-children-collecting-firewood-in-gaza\">scraps of wood</a> find their way into his sack.</p><p>“Sometimes I walk for six hours just to find a few pieces of wood,” Mahmoud said, describing his daily routine. “The dust from the rubble gets into my lungs. I cough all night. But I can’t stop, there is no fire to bake bread.”</p><p>Mahmoud feels a deep sense of responsibility for his family. He explained that his father was killed in an Israeli air strike early last year, one of more than 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza to be killed by Israel since the war started in October 2023.</p><p>As his mother’s eldest, and with Gaza mired in deep poverty with little help coming, Mahmoud knows that it is his job now to provide. Despite his age, he doesn’t consider himself a child any more.</p><p>“My mother is waiting for me to come back with something to make a fire,” he said. “If I collect any extra, I sell it at the market to buy bread.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"economic-strife\">Economic strife</h2><p>Mahmoud knows that life could be different. He talks about his school days with nostalgia in his voice.</p><p>“I used to go to school before the war, when my father was alive,” he said. “Sometimes, while I am dragging the sack through the market, I see my old math teacher, and I hide behind the wall. I don’t want him to see me like this – dirty, working like a donkey instead of studying. I was one of the top students.”</p><p>Mahmoud’s story is typical of Gaza’s current conditions and is tied to two issues that are a direct result of Israel’s genocidal war: the destruction of school buildings and the dire economic situation in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Israeli attacks – including air strikes, shelling and deliberate demolitions – have left much of Gaza decimated. According to the United Nations, more than 97 percent of schools in Gaza have either been damaged or destroyed, and most of the 658,000 children of school age in the enclave have had “limited access” to in-person learning for more than two academic years.</p><p>Even now, with a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/at-least-67-palestinian-children-killed-in-gaza-since-ceasefire-began-un\">shaky ceasefire</a> in place since October, many of the schools that remain standing are used as shelters for Gaza’s legion of displaced people, preventing them from being used for education.</p><p>While there are no accurate statistics on the number of children forced to work in Gaza, Palestinians on the ground say that they have seen an increase as a result of the enclave’s economic circumstances.</p><p>In November, the UN reported that Gaza’s economy had “collapsed”, with gross domestic product (GDP) – an important economic indicator – down 83 percent compared with the pre-war period.</p><p>The weak economy, coupled with a lack of electrical power and the thousands of families whose breadwinners have been killed in the war, led to situations like Mahmoud’s.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"child-trauma\">Child trauma</h2><p>“What we are witnessing in Gaza is not merely child labour,” said Yaqeen Jamal, an educational psychologist who has provided psychological support to children during the war. “It is the systematic destruction of an entire generation’s future.”</p><p>“These children lose their sense of security and their childhood, and they bear responsibilities that exceed their cognitive and physical capabilities,” she added.</p><p>Jamal said that would inevitably lead to dangers in the future. “The long-term effects will be catastrophic. We are facing a generation suffering from illiteracy and deteriorating mental health, which will create a societal gap that will be difficult to bridge.”</p><p>“Rebuilding schools and resuming the educational process must be the top priority, because education is the last line of defence for [these] people’s identity and future,” she said.</p><p>Reconstruction in Gaza is likely to take years, with Israel continuing to hinder the process, and uncertainty over whether Israel will attack Gaza again.</p><p>That means that children like 11-year-old Layla continue to be forced to work to help their families.</p><p>Her father suffers from a physical disability that limits his mobility, leaving him unable to work. The burden has instead fallen on Layla, who goes out every day to the streets of Khan Younis to sell tea.</p><p>She walks back and forth on al-Bahr Street – the main street in Khan Younis – calling out “hot tea, hot tea for one shekel”.</p><p>Layla carried a tray containing eight cardboard cups, two-thirds full of tea, and covered each cup with aluminium foil to keep it hot.</p><p>Asked about her favourite colour, she replied that it was pink, and remembered her pink room, full of her toys. Then she remembered her favourite toy, a pink doll.</p><p>Her doll currently lies under the rubble of the pink room, destroyed in Israel’s war.</p><p>“I wish that the colour pink would return to my life, that my room would return, that my family’s happy life before the war would return, she said. Then she hurried away down the street, focused on selling more tea.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The FAA and the military had planned to discuss the issue at a February 20 meeting, but the army moved ahead without final FAA approval, prompting the agency to halt flights in El Paso, sources said.</p><p>Here is what we know:</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-when-el-paso-s-airspace-was-shut-down\">What happened when El Paso’s airspace was shut down?</h2><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">On February 10, at about 11:30pm (05:30GMT) local time, the FAA stopped all flights to and from El Paso international airport, citing “special security reasons”.</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">The restriction was initially expected to last for 10 days.</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">The order covered an area of about 16km (almost 10 miles) around El Paso, including the nearby community of Santa Teresa, and was originally set to remain in place until the night of February 20.</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">Restrictions applied to all aircraft flying below roughly 5,500 metres (18,000 feet), while planes flying above that altitude were not expected to be affected.</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the airspace was closed due to the Department of Defense and the FAA dealing with an incursion by Mexican drug cartel drones, and “the threat has been neutralized”.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"936\">According to <a href=\"https://elpasomatters.org/2026/02/11/unexplained-faa-order-shuts-down-el-paso-southern-new-mexico-airspace-for-10-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local media reports</a>, the FAA also warned that pilots who failed to follow the order “may be intercepted, detained and interviewed by law enforcement/security personnel”.</p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"936\">The agency added that authorities could use deadly force if it was “determined that the aircraft poses an imminent security threat”.</p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"936\">The airspace closure risked disrupting activity in one of the largest cities in the US, as El Paso is home to nearly 700,000 residents and is among the country’s 25 most populous cities.</p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"936\">A restriction of this scale has only been applied once before in El Paso, after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when US airspace was closed nationwide following the coordinated airliner hijackings that led to the destruction of the World Trade Center towers in New York and damage to the Pentagon.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-the-faa-close-el-paso-s-airspace\" data-start=\"288\" data-end=\"694\">Why did the FAA close El Paso’s airspace?</h2><p>The agency initially cited “special security reasons”.</p><p>Transport Secretary Duffy said that a cartel drone had breached US airspace, an explanation that was echoed by officials at the White House and the Pentagon.</p><p>However, according to media reports, people briefed on the situation said the shutdown was linked to the Defense Department’s use of new high-energy laser technology designed to counter unmanned aircraft.</p><p>Bloomberg News, citing a source familiar with the matter, reported that the Pentagon was also flying drones as part of the tests, with some operating outside normal flight paths.</p><p>The activity occurred in airspace near El Paso international airport, prompting FAA concerns about potential interference with commercial flights.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, pushed back on the drone incursion explanation.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“I believe the FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly,” Escobar said during a morning news conference.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">There was “nothing extraordinary about any drone incursion into the US that I’m aware of”, she said.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“The information coming from the federal government does not add up,” Escobar added later.</p><p></p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">The airspace closure also drew backlash from other leaders, who said they were not properly consulted.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“This unnecessary decision has caused chaos and confusion in the El Paso community,” Renard Johnson, the mayor of El Paso, said at a news conference.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“I want to be very, very clear that this should have never happened. You cannot restrict airspace over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership. That failure to communicate is unacceptable,” Johnson added.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum denied the US claims that Mexican drones had entered US airspace.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“There is no information about the use of drones at the border,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">Security experts say drone incursions near sensitive sites are not uncommon, but the scale of the response in this case was unusual.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“It is not unusual that unidentified drones will wander over an airport or military base, causing short term disruption,” Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior adviser with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“However, it is unprecedented that the FAA would seek to shut down a large piece of airspace for days,” Cancian said.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“It is hard to believe that they had thought through the economic and social costs of such an action,” he added.</p><p data-start=\"938\" data-end=\"1124\">Close to 3.5 million passengers <a href=\"https://elpasomatters.org/2026/02/11/unexplained-faa-order-shuts-down-el-paso-southern-new-mexico-airspace-for-10-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travelled</a> through El Paso international airport between January and November 2025, according to data on the airport’s website.</p><h2 id=\"how-common-are-mexican-cartel-drone-incursions-along-the-us-border\" data-start=\"288\" data-end=\"694\">How common are Mexican cartel drone incursions along the US border?</h2><p data-start=\"825\" data-end=\"970\">The administration of US President Donald Trump has long warned that Mexican cartels are using drones along the border for drug smuggling activities.</p><p data-start=\"825\" data-end=\"970\">Mexican officials have expressed less alarm, at times minimising the security threat posed by drone activity in the region.</p><p data-start=\"825\" data-end=\"970\">Steven Willoughby, deputy director of the counter-drone programme at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), told Congress in July that cartels are using drones nearly every day across the border.</p><p data-start=\"825\" data-end=\"970\">According to DHS data, in the last six months of 2024, more than 27,000 drones were detected within 500 metres (1,640 feet) of the US southern border, mainly at night. He said that across the US-Mexico border, 326 flights a day were detected.</p><p data-start=\"825\" data-end=\"970\">“There’s been a substantial amount of incursion by Mexican criminal groups’ drones into US airspace, and they pose [a] great risk of colliding with civilian aircraft,” Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on non-state armed groups at the Brookings Institution, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"825\" data-end=\"970\">“In the case of El Paso, the risks were likely considered higher than in more remote desert areas,” Felbab-Brown said.</p><p data-start=\"825\" data-end=\"970\">“But outside of the airports, there is a significant amount of drones belonging to Mexican criminal groups that have been penetrating US systems, both to gather reconnaissance on where law enforcement agents are present and on the route, but also to carry drug payloads,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4306661\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4306661\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4306661\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-11T201859Z_2099827853_RC2KJJAS3LZC_RTRMADP_3_USA-TEXAS-AIRSPACE-1770862935.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Police officers stand near an exhibition of U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) drones, at El Paso International Airport\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4306661\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police officers stand near an exhibition of US Federal Aviation Administration drones, at El Paso international airport [File: Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-drones-being-used-in-conflicts-inside-mexico\" data-start=\"1162\" data-end=\"1333\">Are drones being used in conflicts inside Mexico?</h2><p data-start=\"1172\" data-end=\"1525\">Experts say drone technology is also being used inside Mexico, particularly in conflicts between rival criminal groups fighting for territory.</p><p data-start=\"1172\" data-end=\"1525\">One of the most prominent is the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel (CJNG), one of Mexico’s most powerful criminal organisations, known for its rapid expansion and use of military-style tactics and new technologies.</p><p data-start=\"1172\" data-end=\"1525\">CJNG has clashed with Carteles Unidos, a loose alliance of smaller groups formed largely to resist CJNG’s advance in the western state of Michoacan.</p><p data-start=\"1172\" data-end=\"1525\">In rural parts of Michoacan, which include farming communities known as ejidos, drones have increasingly been used not only for surveillance but also to drop explosives during territorial disputes.</p><p data-start=\"1172\" data-end=\"1525\">“In the deployment of drones in Mexico, we have seen other activities by the cartels, such as carpet bombing of rural Eiridas in Michoacan, with the purpose of driving populations out of an ejido,” Felbab-Brown, of Brookings Institution, explained.</p><p data-start=\"2191\" data-end=\"2413\">“The Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel has used these tactics to counter the local advantage of Carteles Unidos and their deep social roots in those communities. Unable to overcome that, they have tried to force people out,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"2191\" data-end=\"2413\">“At various times, reporting from Michoacan has suggested that tens of thousands, and in some cases possibly hundreds of thousands, of people have been displaced from ejidos as a result of these scorched-earth tactics carried out using drones,” she added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4306829\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4306829\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4306829\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2021-04-24T030148Z_762292320_RC232N9ZUALV_RTRMADP_3_MEXICO-VIOLENCE-RELIGION-1770869400.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A bullet-riddled facade with the acronym of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) is pictured in El Aguaje after the visit of Vatican's ambassador to Mexico Franco Coppola to the area and to the municipality of Aguililla, an area where the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and local drug gangs are fighting to control the territory, in Michoacan state, Mexico April 23, 2021.

about 16 percent of US energy production in 2023, behind natural gas and renewables at 43 percent and 21 percent, respectively.</p><h3>Trump: ‘Beautiful, clean coal’</h3><p>A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a California-based nonprofit, found that 99 percent of coal-powered facilities in the US were more expensive to run than the cost of their replacement with renewable alternatives.</p><p>Trump has championed the revival of “beautiful, clean coal” as crucial to boosting domestic manufacturing and achieving US dominance in artificial intelligence, despite the fossil fuel’s flagging competitiveness and contribution to greenhouse gases that drive climate change.</p><p>Trump, who initiated Washington’s exit from the Paris climate accord and has described the scientific consensus on warming temperatures as a “con job”, declared an “energy emergency” on his first day in office to prevent the closure of ageing coal plants.</p><p>The US Energy Department has forced at least five plants to extend their operations beyond their scheduled retirement date since Trump’s order.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the largest public utility provider in the US, voted to extend the lifespan of two coal plants that had been scheduled for closure by 2035.</p><p>The TVA vote came after the utility added four Trump appointees to its board of directors last month, after the US president had earlier fired three board members chosen by his predecessor, President Joe Biden.</p></div></div></body></html>"
