Nobody ran to shelters with each strike. Otherwise, you’d never be able to live your life. You’d always be in there.”</p><p>According to the local news site <a href=\"https://fonar.tv/tag/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B5+%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8+%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%85+%D0%92%D0%A1%D0%A3+2026+%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4\">Fonar.tv</a>, at least 458 civilians have been killed in Ukrainian attacks on the Belgorod region since the war began.</p><p>But major metropolises, such as Moscow and St Petersburg, have barely felt the war while the sanctions imposed by Ukraine’s Western allies are mere inconveniences.</p><p>“It’s so expensive. I’m in shock,” said Andrey, a 30-year-old Muscovite.</p><p>“It’s just like Europe – everybody’s complaining about the prices there too. Even if you only buy some beer, cigs and chocolate, you still wind up spending at least 1,000 roubles [$13] at the store. But in Moscow, people’s purchasing power hasn’t obviously fallen much. Kids are crowded in lines at supermarket cafes. The whole city is full of taxi drivers and endless delivery drivers.”</p><p>Some things have changed.</p><p>“It became very problematic to find some brands that you used to buy before,” said Kirill F, a 39-year-old photographer from St Petersburg who requested that his full name not be disclosed.</p><p>“They can be found from resellers, but they’ve become more expensive, and they’re no longer sold in stores,” he said. Some South Korean brands have returned to Russia, he said. LG washing machines and refrigerators are now available again.</p><p>Chinese brands are also available, but they are “not as good quality as the tech we used to get from Germany or Poland”, Kirill said.</p><p>To get around overseas payment restrictions because of Western sanctions, for example on apps, Kirill opened a bank account in Kyrgyzstan. It’s not an insurmountable obstacle but an annoyance, he said.</p><p>But Kirill is less sanguine about the restrictions imposed by his own government. Since 2022, the Kremlin has introduced <a href=\"/news/2023/3/24/activists-everyday-russians-and-a-soldier-punished-for-war-talk\">strict laws</a> penalising what it calls “fake news” about the invasion. Additionally, the authorities have blocked social media such as Instagram and Facebook and made it harder to use WhatsApp, Telegram and YouTube, promoting state-backed alternatives such <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/28/nuum-we-hardly-knew-ye\">RuTube</a> and the messaging app <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/02/19/russia-s-national-messenger-was-billed-as-a-platform-for-the-people-it-s-dominated-by-state-run-channels\">Max</a> instead.</p><p>“At first, we were blocked from using Facebook, but we had few people using it and they just installed VPNs, and then YouTube was banned,” Kirill recounted.</p><p>“For ordinary citizens, this blockage just worsens life. That’s all. Younger people perceive it as a violation of their personal life, and they will grow up hating the state.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4329293\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4329293\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4329293\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-19T060219Z_1167010498_RC2QNJALIN58_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-ECONOMY-1771758924.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C474&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A woman walks past a shopping mall at the Moscow International Business Centre, also known as Moskva-City, in Moscow, Russia February 17, 2026.

The Russian military now attracts <a href=\"/news/2025/8/26/despite-huge-manpower-losses-how-is-russia-replenishing-its-military\">plenty</a> of recruits through generous pay packets rather than relying on conscripts.</p><p>“At first, I thought [the war] was wrong, like what ‘denazification’ are you talking about?” Vladislav told Al Jazeera via Telegram before hastily deleting his messages. The Kremlin has described the Ukrainian leadership under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as pro-Nazi, and has insisted that its military operation is driven by a desire to “denazify” Ukraine.</p><p>“But then the Ukrainian side started posting photos of swastikas, SS skulls and other symbols of fascist ideology,” Vladislav said, referring to symbols that have appeared on some Ukrainian soldiers’ uniforms and unit flags. “… Both my grandparents were WWII veterans; may they rest in peace.”</p><p>Now, he said, he agrees with Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Zelenskyy and his entire fascist fraternity must be destroyed, no more prisons. … I hope my brother will make a huge contribution,” he added. “He’s a great guy, an excellent driver, and the fact that he spent so much time playing simulation games will help him defeat every Nazi scum in Ukraine.”</p><p>Kirill, too, had his doubts about the invasion, considering the outbreak of war a failure of Russian diplomacy, and still shakes his head when he sees Russian pro-war symbols in public.</p><p>But as time went on, his attitude towards both peace and liberals grew more jaded.</p><p>“We read both the foreign press and the liberal analysts, who told us the Russian economy had two weeks left, yet here we are four years later, and everything’s fine. What do you think our attitude will be towards the people who told us such things?” he asked rhetorically.</p><p>“I believe that since it’s already begun, we need to go all the way to victory,” Krill added. “If you started a fight, you can’t just say ‘I’m sorry’ and stop. That is to say, I don’t support [the invasion], but I also don’t support reparations, all this nonsense. No one will go for it. Even among those who are against the war, they don’t want to lose completely because their lives will be adversely affected.”</p><p>Then there’s the question of apathy. Historically, many Russians have concerned themselves more with day-to-day survival than the machinations of power, a trend that has continued with the “special military operation”.</p><p>“Everyone’s in denial. Almost everyone in my circles is staunchly apolitical and tries to ignore the news,” Andrey observed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4329297\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4329297\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4329297\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP24222450478643-1771759053.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Emergency workers and soldiers push a damaged car after a Russian missile hit a supermarket in Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 9, 2024.

Having completed both his national service, a 12-month mandatory draft, and a previous deployment to Syria, the 38-year-old trucker from Kemerovo in Siberia was mobilised into the elite Ural Battalion, where he was assigned the post of machinegunner in a support platoon.</p><p>“We’d been told for years that everything in Ukraine was steeped in Nazism and hatred of Russia and Russians,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“At the time, I thought and assumed this was a punitive operation aimed at the regime in that country than at the Ukrainian people as a whole.”</p><p>By January 2023, Medvedev’s unit entered the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, setting up base in an abandoned mine. Medvedev considered himself lucky to have been assigned to a support platoon because the assault squads “suffered 60 or 70 percent casualties in an hour of combat”.</p><p>Travelling through war-torn Ukrainian villages and speaking with the locals, Medvedev began questioning his mission. “The realisation that I was fighting a war that no one needed, that would bring no good to anyone in this world but would only produce a mountain of corpses, widows, orphans and miserable mothers and fathers haunted me,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>On July 7, 2023, he went AWOL and tried to return to his hometown.</p><p>“For the first few months after returning, I didn’t understand what was going on around me at all. There was a war somewhere, but here in Siberia or the Urals, people were living as if nothing was happening.”</p><p>Facing criminal indictment for abandoning his post, Medvedev contacted the organisation <a href=\"https://iditelesom.org/en\">Get Lost</a>, which helps draft dodgers and deserters. With its help, he escaped abroad.</p><p>“I miss my homeland very much. I hope to return but to a different country where people will begin to value and cherish peace.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4329307\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4329307\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4329307\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2023-02-16T120904Z_498227789_RC2WBZ93O3XE_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ANNIVERSARY-GEORGIA-RUSSIANS-1771759197.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C511&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Georgian citizen and teacher Miriam Nozadze conducts a Georgian language lesson for Russian exiles in Tbilisi, Georgia, February 15, 2023.

Among them were young men fearing they would be conscripted and sent to the front lines as well as those with deeply held anti-Putin convictions, such as 35-year-old Mike* from Russia’s fourth largest city.</p><p>Mike packed one small bag and decided “to get the hell out of Yekaterinburg”.</p><p>Mike has since settled in Berlin, where he’s involved in an activist community helping those still in the country. But he’s grown disillusioned with both the West and the liberal Russian opposition.</p><p>“The genocide in Gaza conducted in front of our very eyes with the clear complicity of Western elites shattered whatever illusions one could have about the Western powers helping Ukraine,” he sighed.</p><p>If the West isn’t ready to intervene more directly, Mike said, then a compromise seems more reasonable, even if that essentially means a defeat for Ukraine.</p><p>“After four years, the situation looks really bleak, and this winter in Ukraine, Putin’s regime showed its most cynical, completely inhumane nature by destroying civic infrastructure all across the country. That tells you a lot about how far they can go in pursuing their goals.”</p><p>Because of difficulties fitting in or finding work in their host countries, many Russian emigres have since returned home. Rising anti-immigrant sentiment, including in Germany, isn’t helping.</p><p>“Life is good, but I’m more and more conscious of my immigration status,” Mike said. “I didn’t plan on leaving [Russia], but I’m not fantasising about returning.”</p><p><em>*Some names have been changed for the security of interviewees while others requested that their full name not be disclosed.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On February 16, a group of Palestinian footballers, clubs and advocacy groups referred the heads of FIFA and UEFA to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The 120-page filing accuses Gianni Infantino and Aleksander Čeferin of “aiding and abetting war crimes (specifically, the transfer of civilian population into occupied territories) and crimes against humanity (specifically, apartheid)”.</p><p>This historic case marks the first time sports leaders are being accused of these crimes and sends a warning to presidents of all other corporate entities in and beyond athletics. It offers a perfect opportunity to challenge the impunity of Israeli apartheid, occupation and genocide.</p><p>Football is the world’s most popular form of cultural expression, with some five billion fans across the planet. Therefore, the stakes of this charge are immense in terms of the spectacle of accountability and legal precedent.</p><p>In the course of its campaign in Gaza, of genocide generally and “athleticide” particularly, Israel has killed 1,007 Palestinian sportspeople and destroyed 184 sports facilities, while damaging 81 others.</p><p>Although this “athleticide” cannot be directly attributed to the Israel Football Association (IFA), its activities linked to clubs from illegal Israeli settlements located on the occupied Palestinian territory and their participation in domestic and international tournaments can be seen as abetting Israeli crimes of occupation and apartheid.</p><p>Despite facing demands for the suspension of these clubs or the IFA, UEFA and FIFA leadership have taken no action. In a recent <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/fifa-president-sorry-for-british-football-fan-remarks-and-criticises-football-bans-and-boycotts-13502326\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview</a>, FIFA chief Infantino said he opposed a ban on Israeli teams from participation in global football, calling it “a defeat”. He went on to add that he was in favour of enshrining in FIFA statutes that no country should ever be banned from “playing football because of the acts of their political leaders”.</p><p>Ironic, when you consider he is the very person who oversaw the <a href=\"/news/2022/2/28/russia-expelled-from-world-cup-clubs-banned-from-competitions\">suspension of Russia</a> from FIFA in 2022 and the banning of Crimean clubs from playing in the Russian league, linked to UEFA, after the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014.</p><p>The complaint is filed against Infantino and Čeferin because private organisations cannot be defendants before the ICC, but those individuals responsible for their policies can be.</p><p>The focus of the complaint is the fact that the IFA has been permitted to materially support, recognise, and include in domestic and international competitions clubs that are based in the stolen settlement land of the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Article 64(2) of FIFA Statutes prohibits member associations and their clubs from playing on the territory of another member association without the latter’s approval.</p><p>The complaint alleges that by allowing the IFA to oversee clubs that operate on stolen land, Infantino and Čeferin are accountable for normalising illegal Israeli settlements, in direct contravention of a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">2024 pronouncement</a> by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and a resolution from the United Nations General Assembly, which found the settlements to be “unlawful” and required Israel to “cease immediately all new settlement activities, and to evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.</p><p>The existence of sanctioned Israeli clubs in West Bank settlements, the referral argues, contributes to the transfer of the civilian population into the occupied territory, contrary to the Rome Statute Article 8(2)(b)(viii), by normalising colonisation.</p><p>Likewise, because Israeli clubs in the occupied territory prohibit Palestinians from spectating matches or playing for or managing these teams, the continued sanction of these organisations falls under the definition of aiding and abetting apartheid (a crime against humanity pursuant to Rome Statute Article 7(1)(j).</p><p>In continuing to allow the membership of these clubs and the IFA in global and European sport, the filing alleges that Infantino and Čeferin have acted in full knowledge that they have participated in the violation of international law based on the fact that they have deliberately ignored numerous reports and letters advising them to intervene.</p><p>Now that the complaint has been formally filed, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC will conduct a preliminary examination to confirm that the elements of jurisdiction, admissibility, and the interests of justice have been satisfied. They will then have the option to either decline to open the investigation or proceed to investigate the legal issues raised in the complaint.</p><p>If an investigation does ensue, evidence-gathering will occur and arrest warrants or summonses may ultimately be issued. If that happens, this would set an important precedent and give momentum to the campaign for justice for Palestine.</p><p>It is notable that while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been able to dodge an ICC arrest warrant by cowering away from Rome Statute signatory states, it would be impossible for Infantino and Čeferin to do so while still fulfilling their roles, assuming it is enforced.</p><p>Football is, without question, one of the most popular sports on the planet. When such a cultural juggernaut is connected to business, what emerges is an industry like no other. FIFA and UEFA are global <a href=\"https://studentbriefs.law.gwu.edu/ilpb/2022/04/20/the-fifa-legal-monopoly-can-fifa-be-fixed/\">regulatory monopolies</a>, meaning their rules and regulations act the same way a country’s legislation acts on its population. They also preside over a huge, lucrative industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Given the amount of eyeballs and money at stake, the impact of a ban on participation is enormous, as Russia understands all too well after being subjected to suspension. This is no doubt exactly why the presidents of these organisations have refused to act against Israel under the guise of “political neutrality”.</p><p>As former UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Michael Lynk, told us: “When an occupying power is blatantly committing war crimes by creating civilian settlements in occupied territory, the rest of the world – including states, corporations and international sporting organisations – is required to ensure the enforcement of international law by doing everything in their power to bring the violations to a swift end. Yet, FIFA and UEFA are sportswashing the illegal Israeli occupation by allowing the Israeli Football Association to include clubs based in the illegal settlements to participate in their domestic leagues. Nothing could be further from the rules of fairness and equity.”</p><p>The bottom line is that sport is and has always been political. The veneer of “political neutrality” conceals the reality that politics is the name of the game for FIFA and UEFA.</p><p>Nobody is entitled to stand above international law. It is time for the ICC to prove it.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Now, you know, India is not a small country. It has 1.4 billion people. India is enormously powerful, enormously popular,” he said.</p><p>But India’s ties with Israel were not always this cosy. Here is a timeline of how their relations have evolved — from hostility and suspicion, to secret weapons trade and now open embrace — and what that means for India’s relations with Palestine.</p><h2 id=\"1930s-and-40s-india-opposes-the-creation-of-israel\">1930s and 40s: India opposes the creation of Israel</h2><p>Under British colonialism, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.</p><p>Between 1920 and 1948, Palestine was under British administration, and the United Kingdom, through the Balfour Declaration of 1917, had promised Jews, who had been displaced from Europe due to Adolf Hitler’s oppression, a homeland in the British Mandate in Palestine.</p><p>This was opposed by many nations, including India, which were also fighting British colonialism at the time.</p><p>“Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English, or France to the French,” Mahatma Gandhi, India’s most prominent freedom fighter, revered as the Father of the Nation, wrote in an article in his weekly newspaper Harijan, on November 26, 1938.</p><p>While he also sympathised with the Jews in his article and said “the German persecution of the Jews seems to have no parallel in history”, Gandhi stressed that it would be “wrong and inhumane to impose the Jews on the Arabs”.</p><p>“It would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home,” he wrote.</p><p>In 1947, India became an independent nation, and that same year, it voted against the United Nations Partition Plan of Palestine into the Jewish state of Israel and the state of Palestine, comprising Palestinian Arabs. According to the book, Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Volume 5, the first Indian prime minister’s sister, Vijaylaxmi Pandit, who was India’s envoy to the UN, received death threats to pressure New Delhi to vote in favour of the division. But the Nehru government did not buckle.</p><p>Instead, India, erstwhile Yugoslavia and Iran advocated for a single federated state with — per Nehru — “the largest possible autonomy to respected regions where the Jews and Arabs are in majority”.</p><p>“We have maintained that Palestine should be independent and free from the control of any single power; that no solution can be lasting unless it is based on the consent of both Arabs and Jews; and no lasting solution is possible which is imposed and maintained by force,” Nehru said in 1948.</p><p>In 1949, India also voted against Israel’s UN membership.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"1950s-india-recognises-israel-but-refuses-to-set-up-diplomatic-ties\">1950s: India recognises Israel, but refuses to set up diplomatic ties</h2><p>But Israel was keen for recognition and sent many envoys to meet Indian officials.</p><p>Renowned scientist Albert Einstein was among those nudged by Israel to help convince India to recognise the Jewish nation.</p><p>In a letter to Nehru in June 1947, Einstein told him to end “the rivalries of power politics and the egotism of petty nationalist appetites” and support “the glorious renaissance which has begun in Palestine”.</p><p>At the time, Nehru was not convinced, but eventually, on September 17, 1950, India recognised Israel. “We would have [recognised] long ago, because Israel is a fact. We refrained because of our desire not to offend the sentiments of our friends in the Arab countries,” Nehru said, post recognition.</p><p>However, India steered clear of establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. For four decades to follow, India even forbade the use of its passport for travel to Israel.</p><h2 id=\"1960s-pro-palestinian-with-an-opening-for-israel\">1960s: Pro-Palestinian, with an opening for Israel</h2><p>India’s political and diplomatic sympathies continued to lie firmly behind the Palestinian cause. In May 1960, Nehru visited UN troops stationed in Gaza.</p><p>But when war broke out between India and China in 1962, then Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion wrote to Nehru, offering his sympathies and weapons.</p><p>India accepted Israeli weapons and munitions, but requested that the ships supplying them not bear Israeli flags, so as not to antagonise New Delhi’s Arab allies. These details have been revealed in documents held in archives in Jerusalem, and India has not disputed them. This marked the beginning of a decades-long covert relationship between India and Israel.</p><p>Israel again supplied India with munitions during its 1965 war against Pakistan.</p><h2 id=\"1970s-secret-israeli-weapons-and-a-historic-palestinian-recognition\">1970s: Secret Israeli weapons and a historic Palestinian recognition</h2><p>As tensions between India and Pakistan spiked in 1971, DN Chatterjee, India’s ambassador to France, wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs, advocating for New Delhi to seek Israeli assistance.</p><p>The then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, accepted the proposal, scholar Srinath Raghavan wrote in his book, 1971. Through India’s external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the country began the process of procuring Israeli arms via Liechtenstein.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir wrote to Indira, seeking diplomatic recognition for Israel in return, but India demurred.</p><p>Instead, despite the military help it had sought and received from Israel, India grew even closer to the Palestinian movement diplomatically through the 1970s. In 1974, it became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. The following year, the PLO opened an office in India. Thousands of Palestinian students came to India for their higher studies.</p><h2 id=\"1980s-my-sister-and-a-planned-attack-on-a-nuclear-facility\">1980s: ‘My sister’ and a planned attack on a nuclear facility</h2><p>By the 1980s, India’s relations with Palestine and Israel had fallen into a familiar pattern. New Delhi overtly, loudly declared its support for the Palestinian cause, and PLO leader Yasser Arafat made frequent visits to the country. But covertly, Israel and India had established security ties.</p><p>In 1983, when Arafat visited India for a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, he described Indira, the prime minister, as his “sister”, underscoring the personal and nation-to-nation affinity that existed at the time between India and Palestine.</p><p>But the early 1980s also saw Israel propose to India a joint operation to attack a Pakistani nuclear facility, which New Delhi turned down.</p><p>In 1988, India became among the world’s first non-Arab nations to recognise Palestinian statehood.</p><h2 id=\"1990s-india-and-israel-establish-diplomatic-ties\">1990s: India and Israel establish diplomatic ties</h2><p>With the Cold War over and a unipolar world emerging, India adjusted several of its diplomatic positions. Domestically, India opened up its economy starting in 1991. Externally, it reached out to the United States and, in January 1992, turned its long-hidden relationship with Israel into the establishment of formal diplomatic ties.</p><p>In a September 2022 report for the Indian think tank Observer Research Foundation, retired Indian diplomat Navdeep Suri wrote that New Delhi took decades to establish diplomatic ties with Israel because of India’s “support for anti-colonial movements and its close ties with Arab countries”.</p><p>In fact, India’s prime minister in 1992, PV Narasimha Rao, announced the decision to set up diplomatic ties with Israel just weeks after Arafat had visited New Delhi and said he would respect India’s decision on the matter.</p><p>India and Israel set up their embassies in Tel Aviv and New Delhi, respectively.</p><p>In 1999, Israel helped India during the <a href=\"/news/2019/7/26/20-years-of-kargil-war-india-pakistan-remain-tense-over-kashmir\">Kargil war</a> when its troops were trying to force out Pakistan’s military and Kashmiri rebels who had occupied strategic positions on the Indian side of the de facto border between them, known as the Line of Control or LoC. Israel aided India militarily by supplying laser-guided bomb kits and missiles.</p><h2 id=\"2014-onwards-an-open-embrace\">2014 onwards: An open embrace</h2><p>In the early 2000s, India became one of Israel’s largest buyers of defence equipment.</p><p>But in 2014, when Modi came to power, India’s ties with Israel witnessed a sharp upturn; the hesitancy of the past was shed once and for all.</p><p>Under the Modi government in 2015, India’s president at the time, Pranab Mukherjee, became the first Indian president to visit Israel, seeking to strengthen bilateral economic and defence ties.</p><p>In July 2017, Modi visited Israel, becoming the first Indian prime minister to visit the country. During that visit, according to Indian media reports, Modi and Netanyahu said they “visualised that the two countries will become close partners in development, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, defence and security”. A year later, in January 2018, Netanyahu also <a href=\"/features/2018/1/15/indias-modi-gives-warm-welcome-to-israels-netanyahu\">visited</a> New Delhi.</p><p>In 2021, under Modi, the Indian Air Force participated in a multilateral air force exercise called Blue Flag-2021 in Israel. Israeli defence companies like Elbit Systems and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems have also established partnerships with Indian firms, such as Adani Group and Tata Advanced Systems.</p><p>Trade relations between the two nations have also strengthened under the Modi government. India is currently Israel’s second-largest trading partner in Asia, after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.</p><p>India’s main exports to Israel include pearls, precious stones, automotive diesel, chemicals, machinery, and electrical equipment, among others, while imports include petroleum, chemical machinery and transport equipment, etc. The two countries also signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) last September.</p><p>At a time when many Western countries, including allies of Israel, have sanctioned far-right members of Netanyahu’s cabinet, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, these ministers have been welcomed in India.</p><p>Israeli companies have also sought to <a href=\"/features/2024/1/24/undeterred-by-gaza-war-thousands-of-indians-turn-up-for-jobs-in-israel\">hire</a> more employees from India in recent years. After Israel suspended work permits for thousands of Palestinians following the October 2023 attack by Hamas and other Palestinian groups, Israel hired thousands of Indians to work in their place.</p><p>Meanwhile, India has been a tourist destination for Israelis, with many of them holidaying in the country after serving their mandatory time in the Israeli army.</p><p>Kfir Tshuva, a lecturer in economics at the Ramat Gan Academic College in Israel, said, under Modi, India and Israel’s relationship has become more visible and politically open.</p><p>However, he noted that India’s approach in the Middle East was also one of strategic balancing — in which New Delhi maintains separate and independent relationships with multiple actors that may have conflicting interests, rather than framing its policy as a zero-sum choice.</p><p>“This allows India to deepen cooperation with Israel in areas such as defence, technology and economic integration, while also sustaining diplomatic engagement with the Palestinian leadership and strong ties with Arab states,” he said.</p><p>“Modi’s visit to Israel [next week] should therefore be understood within this broader strategic calculus. It reflects New Delhi’s effort to integrate stronger bilateral cooperation with Israel into its wider regional strategy without undermining its commitment to peace, its support for a two-state solution, or its substantive relationships with Arab partners,” he added.</p><p>Kadira Pethiyagoda, author and geopolitical strategist, told Al Jazeera that there are currently multiple countervailing forces at play.</p><p>“On one hand, India’s short-term interests are advanced by defence trade and investment, and remittances from Israel; on the other, India’s long-term goal of becoming a ‘great power’ with a strategic footprint in the Middle East, invariably involves reducing US regional hegemony,” he said.</p><p>“This requires that Israel is balanced by other regional powers, like Iran, which have closer ties to India than the US. India would not want to contribute to Israel achieving complete dominance in the Middle East,” he noted.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-india-s-relations-with-palestine\">What does this mean for India’s relations with Palestine?</h2><p>Under Modi, India has officially maintained its support for a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel — backing the two-state solution — even as he has embraced more publicly warm ties with Netanyahu.</p><p>But India has been cautious in criticising Israel’s actions on Gaza, even before the genocidal war that began in 2023.</p><p>In 2016, India abstained from a UN vote which sought to bring Israel before the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its alleged war crimes during its conflict with Gaza in 2014. When Israel began its genocidal war on Gaza, India condemned the humanitarian crisis in the enclave but repeatedly abstained from UN resolutions which called for a ceasefire. In 2024, India also abstained from a UN Human Rights Council resolution which called for an arms embargo on Israel.</p><p>India has, however, been critical of Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank. Last week, India joined more than 100 nations in condemning Israel’s recent plans to occupy more territory in the region.</p><p>A joint statement issued by the nations rejected “all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem”.</p><p>“Such measures violate international law, undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region, run counter to the Comprehensive Plan, and jeopardize the prospect of reaching a peace agreement ending the conflict,” the statement added.</p><p>But India joined that statement only a day after the first batch of 80 countries and organisations signed it, drawing criticism from the domestic opposition.</p><p>Modi’s visit to Israel, too, has drawn condemnation from the opposition Congress party and others, who have accused him of reversing decades of Indian support for the Palestinian cause.</p><p>In a post on X after India condemned Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank, Congress party’s general secretary in charge of communication and media, Jairam Ramesh, said: “This is sheer hypocrisy and cynicism since the PM will be going to Israel early next week. If he is really serious – which of course he is not – he should call out his good friend Mr Netanyahu, and publicly express India’s grave concern at what Israel is executing in the occupied West Bank.”</p><p>Analysts have told Al Jazeera that Modi will likely be “highly diplomatic” with respect to discussing the Palestine issue during his Israel trip.</p><p>According to Pethiyagoda, India has had a fairly unique position among large powers in maintaining cordial ties with both sides in most of the world’s major conflicts.</p><p>“But the timing of the [Israel] visit, when the US is likely to strike Iran, is not ideal in terms of maintaining this image,” he said, referring to soaring tensions between Washington and Tehran. The Trump administration has amassed warships and jets close to Iran, in preparation for a potential attack, even as the US and Iran also engage in diplomatic talks.</p><p>He added that during his visit, Modi will likely make reference to the Gaza conflict but “in a neutral, highly diplomatic way”.</p><p>Tshuva said beyond India’s engagement with the Palestinian leadership, its ties with Arab states remain strategically significant.</p><p>“Gulf countries are vital to India’s energy security, trade flows, investment partnerships and the welfare of millions of Indian nationals working in the region,” he said.</p><p>“These economic and geopolitical considerations form an essential part of New Delhi’s Middle East policy and shape its careful approach to the Israeli-Palestinian issue,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Kashmiri Muslims won’t work here at all,” the shopkeeper was heard shouting in a viral video of the attack, which left Ganie unconscious, while his elder brother Danish, who was also attacked, suffered minor injuries.</p><p>Ganie, a class 10 dropout, received 12 stitches on his head and his left arm. He is unable to walk due to fractures in his leg.</p><p>Bloodied, bandaged and wearing a sling, he told Al Jazeera the Hindu shopkeeper was accompanied by two others as they thrashed him brutally.</p><p>“Not for anything I had done, but simply because of my identity as a Kashmiri Muslim,” he said at his home in Kashmir’s Kupwara district, more than 800km (about 500 miles) from Uttarakhand’s Vikas Nagar area where he was attacked.</p><p>Ganie’s was not an isolated case, but part of a growing trend of attacks across India on Kashmiri traders and migrant workers, accompanied by a drumbeat of rhetoric against the region’s people on social media and at times, in public speeches from influential individuals linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). That rhetoric often depicts Kashmiris as “security threats” to India, and as “antinational” and “Pakistani agents”.</p><p>Since Modi came to power in 2014, anti-Muslim hate in India has soared — often patronised and fomented by leaders of the Hindu majoritarian BJP, and at times legitimised through dog whistles by the prime minister himself.</p><p>But Kashmiri Muslims carry a double burden — their faith and their homeland are both subjects of suspicion and widespread hatred in today’s India.</p><p>On Christmas Day, shawl vendor Bilal Ahmad was attacked by a Hindu group in Uttarakhand’s Kashipur district after he refused to chant “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” (Hail Mother India), a nationalist slogan that imagines India as a mother goddess. The slogan has been weaponised by the BJP and Hindu right-wing groups, who have often used it as a war cry in their campaign against Muslims and other minorities.</p><p>Bilal said his family grew concerned after seeing a video of the attack online.</p><p>“They called me and urged me to return to Kashmir because of the increasing attacks on Kashmiris. After facing harassment, I decided to close my business and came back to Kashmir,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"no-easy-choices\">No easy choices</h2><p>But returning to Kashmir is not an easy choice for many.</p><p>Rampant unemployment due to limited job opportunities in Kashmir often pushes young Kashmiris out of the region to look for livelihoods elsewhere, mainly the northern Indian states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and the national capital territory of Delhi.</p><p>Since 2019, when Modi’s government scrapped the region’s decades-old partial autonomy guaranteed by the constitution and brought it under New Delhi’s direct control, a fledgling economy still recovering from the aftershocks of the move has compounded the job crisis.</p><p>However, anti-Kashmiri sentiments – and resultant attacks on them – spiked last year after a group of armed men attacked Indian tourists in Kashmir’s scenic Pahalgam area, killing 26 people. India accused Pakistan of backing the attackers, a charge Islamabad rejected. The attack triggered a four-day air war between India and Pakistan — the neighbours that control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full — while diplomatic tensions and sporting boycotts continue.</p><p>In recent months, about 200 cases of attacks on Kashmiri students, shawl sellers or migrant workers have been reported across India. Many were beaten, threatened, harassed, and forced to leave the areas where they were living or doing business.</p><p>When Bashir Ahmad visited a Hindu-majority locality in early January to sell shawls in Punjab state’s Moga district, he was stopped and asked to show permission to conduct his business. He knew it was a mere pretext. Failing to show any permit, he was abused, and his bag of shawls was thrown on the ground.</p><p>The 50-year-old man returned to Kashmir after the incident and advised fellow shawl sellers to operate only in areas that other Kashmiris had found safe.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4317473\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4317473\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4317473\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1000963785-1771238057.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kashmiri shawl seller\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4317473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shawl seller Bashir Ahmad returned to Kashmir after he was assaulted [Courtesy of Bashir Ahmad’s family]</figcaption></figure><p>In neighbouring Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, a retired Indian army soldier, Surjeet Rajput Guleria, abused and publicly interrogated an unidentified Kashmiri hawker on January 17, livestreaming the incident on Facebook.</p><p>The video shows him making anti-Muslim and sexually charged remarks, accusing Kashmiris of supporting Pakistan and engaging in pelting stones at Indian soldiers deployed in Kashmir. “Your sisters and daughters go to Pakistan and return pregnant,” he is heard saying in the video.</p><p>Local media reports said the Kangra police filed a report against Guleria, but no further action was taken.</p><p>On February 1, Guleria was back again – livestreaming his harassment of another Kashmiri hawker, Mohammad Ramzan, on Facebook.</p><p>“He threatened me and demanded that I leave the state. He went through my shawl bundles and mockingly accused me of carrying an AK-47 rifle instead of Kashmiri shawls,” Ramzan told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said such targeting of migrants “not only jeopardises livelihoods but also reinforces a climate of fear that affects families” dependent on seasonal trade for survival.</p><p>It is not just shawl sellers who have suffered.</p><p>Abdul Hakeem, a resident of Kashmir’s Kulgam district, ran a fruit-selling business in Punjab’s Jalandhar city. He said he faced constant harassment from fellow Hindu vendors, and finally left the area on February 6, after he was given an ultimatum to either leave the state or face consequences.</p><p>“I had to leave fruits worth about 100,000 rupees [$1,100] behind and return to the valley because my family was afraid due to the rising attacks on Kashmiris outside the valley,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>His 50-year-old mother, Misra Begum, said they did not want him to continue his business if he did not feel safe. “We would rather go without food than see our son get into trouble,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"troubling-pattern\">‘Troubling pattern’</h2><p>Kashmir’s main political parties — the governing National Conference and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) — have urged the federal government, which effectively governs the region, to intervene and stop the attacks on Kashmiris across the country.</p><p>Calling the attacks “unacceptable”, Kashmir’s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said earlier this month he had raised the issue at a meeting of the chief ministers of the northern Indian states and appealed to them to prevent such incidents.</p><p>Abdullah’s predecessor, Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP, alleged that the attackers operated with the backing of respective state authorities.</p><p>“[The] state governments appear to be granting silent patronage to mob violence, treating hatred as a shortcut to political success. The rule of law has been replaced by politics of fear,” she wrote on X on February 3, as she shared a video about an elderly Kashmiri man harassed in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh state.</p><p>BJP spokesman in Kashmir, Altaf Thakur, condemned the attacks on Kashmiri shawl sellers as “wrong and unacceptable”. He said the Kashmiris are an “inseparable part of the nation” and asserted the government would not tolerate such actions.</p><p>But Kashmiri lawmaker, Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, told Al Jazeera the attacks on Kashmiris are a “troubling pattern” that could not be ignored as they send “an alarming signal” to the people of Kashmir.</p><p>“Kashmiris, particularly small traders and shawl sellers, travel to different parts of the country to earn a livelihood, but repeated assaults and intimidation were causing fear and insecurity,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He quickly signed an executive order – resting on a different statute, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 – to impose the blanket 10 percent tariff, starting on Tuesday.</p><p>The 15 percent hike announced on Saturday is the highest rate allowed under that law.</p><p>However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended by Congress. No president has previously invoked Section 122, and its use could lead to further legal challenges.</p><p>It was not immediately clear whether an updated executive order was forthcoming.</p><p>The White House said the Section 122 tariffs include exemptions for certain products, including critical minerals, metals and energy products, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><h2 id=\"lawsuits\">Lawsuits</h2><p>Trump wrote on Saturday that his administration will continue to work on issuing other permissible tariffs.</p><p>“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,” he said.</p><p>The president has already said his administration intends to rely on two other statutes that permit import taxes on specific products or countries based on investigations into national ‌security or unfair trade practices.</p><p>Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic agenda, which he has used as a tool to address a range of goals – from reviving domestic manufacturing to pressuring other nations to crack down on drug trafficking, and pushing warring countries toward peace.</p><p>He has also wielded tariffs, or the threat of them, as leverage to extract trade concessions from foreign governments.</p><p>Federal data shows the US Treasury had collected more than $133bn from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Since the Supreme Court’s ruling, more than a thousand lawsuits have been filed by importers in the US to seek refunds, and more cases are on the way.</p><p>While legally sound, the path forward for such claims is not straightforward, especially for smaller firms, said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University.</p><p>“It’s pretty clear that they will win in court, but it’ll take some time,” Diamond said. “Once we get the court orders in effect, I don’t think those refunds will be all that messy for larger firms. Smaller firms are going to have a much more difficult time getting through the process.”</p><p>But foreign governments are managing “the real mess”, Diamond said.</p><p>“What do you do if you’re Taiwan, or Great Britain, and you have this existing trade deal, but now it’s kind of been turned upside down?”</p><p>The US-Taiwan trade deal lowers the general tariff on Taiwanese goods from 20 percent to 15 percent, the same level as Asian trade partners South Korea and Japan, in exchange for Taipei agreeing to buy about $85bn of US energy, aircraft and equipment.</p><p>The US-United Kingdom deal imposes a 10 percent tariff on imports of most UK goods, and reduces higher tariffs on imports of UK cars, steel and aluminium.</p><h2 id=\"pickpocketing-the-american-people\">‘Pickpocketing the American people’</h2><p>After ⁠the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News on Friday that those countries must honour their agreements ⁠even if they call for higher rates than the Section 122 tariffs.</p><p>Exports to the US from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19 percent, even though the universal rate is lower, Greer said.</p><p>Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19 percent, which was signed on Friday, remains in force despite the court decision.</p><p>The ‌ruling could spell good news for countries like Brazil, which has not negotiated a deal with Washington to lower its 40 percent tariff rate but could now see its tariff rate drop to 15 percent, at least temporarily.</p><p>Governments around the world have <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/trump-tariff-reactions\">reacted to the Supreme Court decision</a> – as well as Trump’s subsequent tariff announcement – with a mix of cautious optimism, trepidation and frustration.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he would coordinate a joint European stance before talks with Trump in early March, while Hong Kong’s secretary for financial services and the Treasury, Christopher Hiu, described the situation surrounding Trump’s new tariff moves as a “fiasco”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>With the November midterm elections in the US looming, Trump’s approval rating on his handling of the economy has steadily declined during his year in office.</p><p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday showed 34 percent of ‌respondents ‌saying they approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 57 percent said they did not approve.</p><p>Democrats, who need to flip only three Republican-held seats in the US House of Representatives in November to win a majority, have blamed Trump’s tariffs for exacerbating the rising cost of living.</p><p>They were quick to condemn Trump’s new tariff threat on Saturday.</p><p>Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.</p><p>“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.</p><p>California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he [Trump] does not care about you”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They will now be watching Arsenal’s Sunday derby with added interest.</p><p class=\"p1\">City were slick at the start and went ahead when a surging Omar Marmoush played in O’Reilly. He could have touched it on for Haaland ⁠to his left, but the 20-year-old opted to trust his left foot, and his powerful shot beat Nick Pope.</p><p class=\"p1\">Newcastle were level soon afterwards, ⁠though, as a weak clearance fell to Hall, whose ⁠shot took a touch off a City player before beating keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.</p><p class=\"p1\">Haaland was not on the scoresheet but showed many other attributes to his game, and it was his measured cross that was met by O’Reilly, ‌who directed his header past Pope.</p><p class=\"p1\">City were nowhere near as effective as an attacking force after the break, but they defended doggedly when required and were always a threat on the ‌counter-attack.</p><p class=\"p1\">They ‌now have 56 points from 27 games. Should Arsenal fail to beat Tottenham on Sunday, City will feel they have the title race firmly in their hands.</p><p>O’Reilly said he was “over the moon” about the goals and three points.</p><p>“The win was the most important thing: close the gap and apply as much pressure as possible,” he told TNT Sports.</p><p>“Very happy with the two goals. It is a dream of mine to win [the Premier League].”</p><p>Asked if City, unbeaten in eight games, can win the title, he added: “Yeah, definitely. We always believe we can win games.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Elsewhere on Saturday, ⁠Aston Villa’s faint Premier ⁠League title hopes suffered a blow as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Leeds United, and Chelsea’s top-four ambitions were damaged when they dropped two points against relegation-bound ⁠Burnley.</p><p class=\"p1\">Anton Stach’s stunning 31st-minute free kick past Emiliano Martinez looked like giving Leeds a vital victory at Villa Park, but substitute Tammy Abraham levelled late on.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chelsea moved above Manchester United into fourth spot on goal difference, but it felt like two points dropped for the second week running as they drew 1-1 with Burnley at home.</p><p class=\"p1\">Joao Pedro put Chelsea ahead, but the hosts were reduced to 10 men when Wesley Fofana received a second yellow ⁠card and Burnley equalised in stoppage time through Zian Flemming.</p><p class=\"p1\">Brighton’s James Milner broke the Premier League appearance record in ⁠their 2-0 win at Brentford.</p><p class=\"p1\">The 40-year-old former Manchester City and Liverpool ⁠player made his 654th appearance to go past Gareth Barry.</p><p class=\"p1\">West Ham had the opportunity to really put some pressure on Nottingham Forest and Spurs in the relegation battle, but played out a turgid draw with visiting Bournemouth. It ‌was ‌the sixth successive Premier League stalemate between the sides.</p></div></div></body></html>"
