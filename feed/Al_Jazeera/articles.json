That is not an issue.”</p><p>United defender Luke Sahe, in July, spoke out in solidarity with Amorim’s attempt to change what he described at the time as <a href=\"/sports/2025/7/30/shaw-says-amorim-right-to-challenge-toxic-man-utd-dressing-room\">a “toxic” changing room</a> at Old Trafford.</p><p>Mainoo may have his opportunity to start the Villa game with Brazilian midfielder Casemiro suspended following his booking in <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/16/man-united-bournemouth-draw-in-eight-goal-premier-league-thriller\">the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth</a>.</p><p>Defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are still injured, while Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo are all on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/venezuela-slams-european-councils-renewed-sanctions-as-futile\">European Commission</a> and the United States <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/us-slaps-sanctions-on-maduro-family-venezuelan-tankers-what-we-know\">Trump administration</a> have both recently renewed or extended sanctions against Venezuelan oil, as well.</p><p>As a result, a parallel, unofficial maritime network has emerged to keep sanctioned oil moving.</p><p>The Singapore Strait is a vital artery for global maritime trade, carrying about one-third of the world’s traded goods at some point along their journeys. For tankers at sea, it is almost unavoidable – the strait is a natural gateway between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, also a busy trade artery.</p><p>The Maritime and Port Authority monitors vessel movements within Singaporean waters. But international law limits what action it can take once ships move into the high seas – in effect, international waters – allowing shadow fleets to thrive in regulatory grey zones.</p><p>In recent weeks, suspect shipping activity has been noted just beyond Singapore’s territorial waters – roughly 22.2 kilometres from its coast – in international waters, just outside of the city state’s law enforcement reach.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-shadow-fleets-and-how-do-they-avoid-sanctions\">What are ‘shadow fleets’ and how do they avoid sanctions?</h2><p>As a result of record <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/trump-hits-russias-oil-giants-with-sanctions-eu-bans-russian-lng\">sanctions</a> by Western governments in recent years over Russia’s war in Ukraine, Iran’s nuclear programme and, most recently, United States President Donald Trump’s campaign against Venezuela, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to more than 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization database.</p><p>All vessels at sea are required to fly a flag showing the legal jurisdiction governing their operations in international waters. The body which grants ship nationalities is the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p><p>A shadow ship, or “ghost” ship, is typically an ageing vessel with obscure ownership. These vessels frequently change flags – for instance, when the US <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/act-of-piracy-or-law-can-the-us-legally-seize-a-venezuelan-tanker\">seized the tanker, Skipper</a>, off the coast of Venezuela earlier this month, the government of Guyana, Venezuela’s neighbour, said it was “falsely flying the Guyana flag”, and clarified that it was not registered in the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Operators of shadow ships also falsify registration details, broadcast false geo-location codes, or even switch off tracking systems altogether to evade detection and skirt UNCLOS laws.</p><p>These vessels typically carry sanctioned oil and other restricted goods such as military equipment. They often conduct risky ship-to-ship transfers of cargo under the cover of night to avoid detection. This can create serious safety and environmental risks.</p><p>Additionally, most of the tankers are owned by shell companies in jurisdictions such as Dubai, where rapid buying and selling by anonymous or newly formed firms can take place, making it even harder to trace their origins.</p><p>Jennifer Parker, a specialist in maritime law at Australia’s University of New South Wales, said the increasing number of shadow fleets presents a “real challenge”.</p><p>Parker told Al Jazeera that “finding out who owns them and who insures them has been incredibly difficult because of the [murky] paper trail around them”.</p><p>She added that “often they would do what is called bunkering, which is the process of transferring fuel at sea between ships. So that makes it hard to track where that ship has actually come from and where that oil has come from.”</p><p>She added: “Sometimes, what they do is actually mix oil, so you will have a legitimate ship that will do a ship-to-ship transfer at sea with a shadow fleet and they will mix the oil so it becomes hard to really trace where that oil has come from … to avoid sanctions.”</p><h2 id=\"what-sort-of-problems-do-these-tankers-cause\">What sort of problems do these tankers cause?</h2><p>When ageing, uninsured vessels are involved in accidents, it can lead to environmental disasters like oil spills.</p><p>According to Bunkerspot, a specialist maritime publication, a shadow tanker spill, which can cause enormous damage to water, wildlife and local coastlines, can cost up to $1.6bn in response and cleanup alone.</p><p>Last December, Russian authorities scrambled to contain <a href=\"/news/2024/12/19/the-russian-tanker-disaster-and-an-oil-leak-in-kerch-strait-what-it-means\">an oil spill in the Kerch Strait</a> caused by two 50-year-old tankers which had been damaged during a heavy weekend storm. The scale of the environmental damage and the associated cleanup costs remain unclear.</p><p>In addition to vessel collisions, they can cause environmental damage through chemical leaks and illegal waste dumping.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4183932\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4183932\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4183932\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-01-08T121511Z_1645682517_RC2L5CA6GKCV_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-OIL-SPILL-1766143668.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C523&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kerch\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4183932\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A volunteer cleans up a bird covered in oil following an oil spill by two tankers damaged in a storm in the Kerch Strait, at a veterinary clinic in the Black Sea resort city of Saky, Crimea, on January 8, 2025 [Alexey Pavlishak/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-uses-shadow-fleets-the-most\">Who uses shadow fleets the most?</h2><p>Russia is the primary beneficiary of ghost fleet trading. Moscow has largely <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/27/russias-shadow-vessels-using-false-flags-to-skirt-sanctions-report-says\">maintained its oil exports</a> despite Western sanctions, ensuring steady revenue for its war in Ukraine. Though not to the same extent, Iran and Venezuela also sell fossil fuels using ghost fleets.</p><p>China and India, currently the largest buyers of Russian crude, benefit from steep discounts, often purchasing oil well below the Western-imposed $60 per barrel <a href=\"/news/2022/12/2/eu-agrees-to-60-russian-oil-price-cap\">price cap</a>, which was imposed in December 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Tracking by S&amp;P Global and Ukrainian intelligence shows that Russia relied heavily on its shadow tanker fleet in 2025. India has been the main destination, importing about 5.4 million tonnes (or 55 percent of Russian crude oil sales via shadow tankers) between January and September.</p><p>China has taken a smaller but still significant share of about 15 percent. Overall, most Russian seaborne crude now moves outside Group of Seven (G7)-compliant shipping, underscoring the shadow fleet’s central role in this trade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-actions-have-governments-taken-against-shadow-fleets\">What actions have governments taken against shadow fleets?</h2><p>To avoid enforcement of sanctions, many shadow tankers have moved out of major shipping lanes. In part, this is down to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/eu-hits-russian-oil-shadow-fleet-with-new-sanctions-over-ukraine-war\">European authorities</a> now requiring physical inspections during ship-to-ship transfers, making it riskier for these vessels to operate on conventional routes.</p><p>For instance, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Finland and Estonia recently began carrying out insurance checks on tankers transiting the Gulf of Finland and the waters between Sweden and Denmark. This is aimed at ensuring compliance with 2022 sanctions on Russian oil.</p><p>Meanwhile, in July 2025, the United Kingdom imposed measures – such as restrictions on access to UK ports, insurance and financial services – on 135 shadow fleet vessels and two linked firms, aiming to reduce Russia’s shipping capacity and cut its energy earnings.</p><p>In the US, President Donald Trump has warned that comparable measures will follow if Russia refuses to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, raising the prospect of closer transatlantic coordination with the UK and Europe against shadow fleets.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Some residents expressed worries about what the rebels’ presence meant for the city.</p><p>When the group took control of Goma, the capital of neighbouring North Kivu province, in January, and then seized South Kivu’s capital, Bukavu, in February, businesses suffered.

Many told us they felt lucky that the city had avoided a violent confrontation between M23 and the Congolese army and its militias, which might have besieged and bombarded Uvira for weeks.</p><p>By Saturday, as M23’s control of the city settled in, residents emerged from their homes. By Monday, those people who could, resumed work, shops were opened and daily life continued.</p><p>Although the residents we spoke to are aware that political discussions are taking place in Kinshasa, many are more concerned about the day-to-day challenge of getting by without the threat of violence. Some said they feel their quiet lives have been upturned less by the rebels than by the Congolese army and its militias, which began massing in the area this year to use as a base from which to tackle M23.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4184022\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4184022\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4184022\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty_694543237b-1766146851.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"UVIRA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO - DECEMBER 15: A Wazalendo militant surrenders a weapon to members of the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group on December 15, 2025 in Uvira, Democratic Republic of Congo.

The group, composed mainly of Tutsis, says it is fighting for the rights of people from its ethnic community who have been marginalised by the state.</p><p>In 2012, M23 captured Goma, before the rebels were forced back a year later by a coalition of Congolese forces, the United Nations and foreign troops.</p><p>But the group re-emerged in late 2021, fortified by, the UN says, some 4,000 Rwandan soldiers, a claim Kigali denies. This newer, stronger M23 has since made significant gains, capturing Goma again this year, followed by Bukavu and other key areas.</p><p>As M23 has advanced, the Congolese army has allied itself with other armed groups to help it fight the rebels.</p><p>But critics say the government does not have effective control over these disparate militias, with many accused of abuses in the areas they oversee.</p><p>After the M23 took Goma and Bukavu, Uvira – an important port city on the northern tip of Lake Tanganyika, directly across from Burundi’s largest city, Bujumbura – became a symbol of resistance for the government. It was a city where military heads, militia leaders and politicians from Kinshasa also gathered.</p><p>But for many residents, this has meant seven to eight months of limbo at the mercy of those soldiers and militia groups. Many people in Uvira told us they had been left traumatised by the militias, some of whom they accuse of beating and stealing from locals.</p><p>While they do not necessarily support M23 rebels either, they are grateful that when the rebels took control of the city, at least the gunshots stopped.</p><p>“We suffered here a lot with the armed groups operating under the government,” Eliza Mapendo told Al Jazeera from a market in Uvira, one among several residents blaming the army and militias for overrunning the area and sometimes harassing the community.</p><p>“For now, we feel good enough, secure, this is how we are working freely at this market.

Ukrainian forces said they prevented reinforcements from entering the city through a gas pipeline, a tactic Russia had used in the siege of Chasiv Yar, and the isolated Russian troops were being supplied solely by drone. Ukraine’s General Staff said its forces were still repelling Russian attacks on Friday.</p><p>Russia’s Ministry of Defence insisted it had control of the situation. “Units of the Zapad Group of Forces exercise reliable control over all districts of liberated Kupiansk,” it said on Monday, claiming that Ukraine’s efforts to enter the city from the south were being suppressed.</p><p>“The only thing that can be said for sure is that the Russian Armed Forces are still holding part of the centre and north of Kupiansk, but most of it is already either in the grey zone or under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” wrote a Russian military reporter on the Telegram messaging app.</p><p>On Wednesday this week, Colonel General <a href=\"/news/2024/2/13/who-is-ukraine-armys-new-commander-in-chief-and-what-challenges-does-he-fa\">Oleksandr Syrskii</a>, Ukraine’s Army commander-in-chief, told a Ramstein-format of Ukraine’s allies that his forces had taken back 90 percent of Kupiansk. At the same time in Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov was telling Russian President Vladimir Putin that “the enemy is unsuccessfully trying to regain” the city.</p><p>“The Russian Defense Minister, Belousov, continues to lie that Russia controls Kupiansk,” wrote Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation, on Telegram. “In reality, most of the city is controlled by the Ukrainian Defense Forces, which are continuing to clear it of Russians. However, all of Putin’s officials, from [commander-in-chief Valery] Gerasimov, who was the first to lie about controlling the city, to Belousov, continue to lie in the presence of Putin himself.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Contrary to the available evidence, Belousov also insisted that Russia had seized Pokrovsk, which Russia calls Krasnoarmeysk, and was on the cusp of vanquishing neighbouring Myrnohrad, which Russia calls Dimitrov. Both towns are in the eastern Donetsk region, and are almost surrounded by Russian forces to the north, south and east.</p><p>“Russian soldiers continue to inflict fire damage on Ukrainian troops in Dimitrov, the last stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Krasnoarmeysk agglomeration,” Belousov told Putin.</p><p>But Syrskii told allies that Ukrainian forces had regained about 16 square kilometres (6 square miles) in the northern part of Pokrovsk and 56sq km (22sq miles) west of the city. “Logistics in Myrnograd are complex, but the operations continue,” he wrote.</p><p>Russia had claimed complete control over Pokrovsk on December 2 and was sticking to its story.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4177415\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4177415\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4177415\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1765877913.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1765877913\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4177415\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"submarine-and-oil-refinery-explosions\">Submarine and oil refinery explosions</h2><p>A third point of contention was Ukraine’s successful use of an underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) to strike a Russian Kilo-class submarine on Monday (December 15), in what is considered the first such attack in military history.</p><p>Video of the Russian fleet at anchor in the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea shows a huge explosion in the stern section of the submarine.</p><p>Ukraine’s State Security Service later claimed credit for the attack.</p><p>However, Russia’s Defence Ministry said: “Not a single ship or submarine as well as the crews of the Black Sea Fleet stationed in the bay of the Novorossiysk naval base were damaged as a result of the sabotage.”</p><p>The ministry published footage of what it said was the attacked submarine, in which it appeared undamaged above the surface, but the video did not show the stern section.</p><p>Ukraine’s long-range strikes against Russia scored other successes, on which Russia did not comment.</p><p>Ukraine struck the oil refinery in Yaroslavl, northeast of Moscow, on December 12.

They’re not interested in going to war with governments.”</p><p>But the Trump administration appears to be applying the “war on terror” language of the Obama and <a href=\"/news/longform/2023/4/5/iraq-war-20-years-on-visualising-the-impact-of-the-invasion\">George W Bush era</a> to the militarisation of Washington’s drug policy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has designated drug organisations as “foreign terrorist” organisations and classified the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/trump-signs-executive-order-labeling-fentanyl-weapon-of-mass-destruction\">synthetic drug fentanyl</a> as a “weapon of mass destruction” (WMD), echoing Bush’s false claim that Iraq possessed WMDs to justify the 2003 US-led invasion.</p><p>“The WMD designation is meant to underscore the administration’s narrative that these are fearsome armies and invading forces that have weapons of mass destruction at their disposal. But again, I think that doesn’t have any basis,” Walsh said.</p><p>He raised concerns that the designation could be used to “unlock authorities” for the administration to conduct strikes inside the US.</p><p>Walsh said the Trump administration is declaring power to strike anyone associated with designated “terrorist” groups – alleged drug traffickers in the case of the boat strikes – anywhere.</p><p>“This is a flawed legal reasoning all across the board,” he said. “But my point here is that there’s no limiting principle on where and when that authority could be asserted by President Trump. So it could be in Caracas tomorrow.

That doesn’t mean that what Trump is doing is sanctified. It’s a pattern of expansion of US warmaking,” Moyn told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is the American executive giving itself more permission slips to do more things over time.

We moved on,” Slot told reporters on Friday, referring to his decision to bring Salah on as a substitute in last week’s <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/13/salah-assists-ekitikes-brace-as-liverpool-beat-brighton\">2-0 victory over Brighton</a>.</p><p>Salah said after the 3-3 draw at Leeds United – the third consecutive game for which he was benched – that he had been thrown under the bus for Liverpool’s woes this season. He was <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/8/inter-milan-vs-liverpool-champions-league-salah-team-start-and-lineups\">dropped from the squad</a> that travelled to Inter Milan in the Reds next match. Subsequently, interest was shown from Saudi Arabia about <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/9/liverpools-mohamed-salah-a-transfer-target-for-saudi-arabia\">bringing Salah to the Saudi Pro League</a>.</p><p>“Now he’s at the AFCON playing big games for himself and the country,” Slot continued. “All the focus for him is over there and there should not be any distraction of me saying anything because we moved on after the Leeds interview and he played against Brighton.”</p><p>Despite a difficult second season for Slot in England, Liverpool sit seventh in the Premier League and would move into the top four with a victory against struggling Spurs.</p><p>The English champions transformed their squad over the summer transfer window, spending nearly 450 million pounds ($602m) to bring in Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.</p><p>Apart from the impressive Ekitike, all the new signings have struggled, and Slot conceded he had been overly optimistic over how long it would take for his new-look squad to perform consistently.</p><p>“I think we are getting closer and closer to the team I want us to be and that has gone with ups and downs,” said the Dutchman.</p><p>“But for me, that makes complete sense because all the changes we’ve made during the summer, and we made them on purpose because we thought we needed to.</p><p>“If I’m completely honest, maybe I didn’t expect it to take maybe as long as it did, but, looking back on it, reflecting on it now, I think I’ve been too positive because if you go with a new group where not all of them are completely ready to play every single game, 90 minutes in this intensity, you have to adapt.</p><p>“Sometimes he can play, then he cannot play. So it takes maybe a bit of time, and we’ve been very unlucky.”</p><p>Joe Gomez and Cody Gakpo will miss the trip to Tottenham due to injury, but Slot is hopeful that Dominik Szoboszlai will be fit to start.

Officials urged citizens to resist mob violence perpetrated by “fringe elements”.</p><p>“This is a critical moment in our nation’s history when we are making a historic democratic transition,” a government statement declared. “We cannot and must not allow it to be derailed by those few who thrive on chaos and reject peace.”</p><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists called on authorities to ensure media safety and accountability for those responsible.</p><p>Protesters had previously marched towards the Indian High Commission in Dhaka on Wednesday, reflecting deteriorating relations between the neighbouring countries since Hasina’s government collapsed.</p><p>Hadi, who led the student protest group Inqilab Moncho, had planned to run for parliament in the February 2026 national election. Police have launched a manhunt for his killers, releasing photographs of key suspects and offering a reward for information.</p><p>Special prayers were held in mosques nationwide, and Saturday was designated an official day of mourning for the slain student leader.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The appointments often took all day and sometimes required missing school and final exams. Jose felt embarrassed to tell his teachers and classmates where he was going, but also knew he had to fulfil his immigration obligations and maintain good conduct and his arrest-free record.</p><p>“You have to follow the law, because when you follow the law things go well, right?” Jose said.</p><p>That day, Jose heard the rattle of handcuffs. The officer told him not to make a scene. As Josue turned and saw his older brother restrained, a different officer handcuffed him, too.</p><p>By the time the brothers had walked into ICE’s field office for their 8am appointment, about two months into President Donald Trump’s second administration, rumours were swirling that immigration agents were detaining people at routine immigration check-ins. These appointments are typically for people with pending immigration cases who aren’t considered threats to the public.</p><p>Detaining people at check-ins became part of Trump’s effort to carry out mass deportations, one of his <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/maga-meter-tracking-donald-trumps-2024-promises/promise/1617/carry-out-the-largest-domestic-deportation-operati/\">2024 campaign promises</a>. But the strategy contradicted Trump’s and his administration’s assurances that immigration agents would pursue “the worst of the worst always first”.</p><p>“I’m talking about, in particular, starting with the criminals. These are some of the worst people anywhere in the world,” Trump said on August 22, 2024.</p><p>On October 31, CBS News correspondent Norah O’Donnell asked Trump about his promise “to deport the worst of the worst, violent criminals”. Trump answered: “That’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>Neither Jose nor Josue have been convicted of a crime. The same is true of <a href=\"https://tracreports.org/immigration/detentionstats/pop_agen_table.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">73 percent of the more than 65,000 immigrants</a> in ICE detention as of November, a record number of detainees. Nearly half of all immigrants in ICE detention have neither a criminal conviction nor pending criminal charges. Of the immigrants with criminal convictions, 5 percent have been convicted of violent crime such as murder or rape, according to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.</p><p>Despite what Trump said, some of the most high-profile moments during his administration’s mass deportation campaign did not lead to large-scale arrests of violent criminals.</p><p>In March, the Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"/news/2025/3/17/trump-deports-238-gang-members-to-el-salvador-whats-the-controversy\">sent nearly 250 Venezuelan men</a> to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. A ProPublica investigation later found that only 32 of the men had US criminal convictions, most for nonviolent offences such as retail theft or traffic violations.</p><p>In the first half of a months-long Chicago immigration crackdown dubbed “<a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/lawsuit-alleges-horrific-conditions-at-us-immigration-facility-in-chicago\">Operation Midway Blitz</a>“, immigration officers arrested 1,900 people, two-thirds of whom had no criminal convictions or pending charges, according to a Chicago Tribune analysis.</p><p>When PolitiFact asked the White House whether its detention strategy was in line with what Trump and officials have said publicly, spokesperson Abigail Jackson said: “The Trump Administration’s top immigration enforcement priority is arresting and removing the dangerous violent, illegal criminal aliens that Joe Biden let flood across our Southern Border – of which there are many. Recent ICE <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/newsroom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arrests</a> include criminal illegal aliens who are rapists, pedophiles and murderers. But anyone who is illegally present in the country, and as a result breaking US laws, is eligible for deportation if they do not take advantage of self-deportation opportunities.”</p><p>Jose and Josue were applying for legal status. They were not in hiding and had spent years appearing before ICE officers and immigration judges.</p><p>In May, Jose and Josue were deported to <a href=\"/opinions/2021/12/11/remembering-us-backed-state-terror-in-el-salvador\">El Salvador</a>, a country the rest of their family had already fled.</p><p>“We followed the law and we were punished,” Jose said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-brothers-quest-for-legal-residency\">The brothers’ quest for legal residency</h2><p>Fleeing threats of <a href=\"/news/2024/2/2/trapped-in-this-hell-how-one-el-salvador-town-transformed-under-bukele\">gang violence</a> in El Salvador, Jose and Josue arrived in the US in summer 2016 at the ages of 11 and 10 with their mother, Alma Lopez Diaz.</p><p>US officials stopped the family at the southern border and released them into the US while they sought asylum. The family moved in with the boys’ aunt in Georgia.</p><p>The brothers enrolled in school and learned English by reading books, using language-learning apps and correcting themselves after classmates teased them.</p><p>By 2020, judges had denied the family’s asylum case and appeals because gang extortion is not generally considered a reason for asylum, said Ala Amoachi, who became the brothers’ immigration lawyer in 2024. Jose and Josue had received a deportation order.</p><p>Deportation orders are paused when people file appeals. Jose and Josue were appealing until 2020, when their appeals ran out, but they continued to appear at ICE check-ins. Amoachi said the government likely didn’t deport them during that time because they had no criminal records and for humanitarian considerations “such as family unity and the fact that they have a younger brother who’s a US citizen and who’s disabled”.</p><p>By 2025, when the brothers were detained, they had a viable pathway to obtaining legal status, based on a process their attorney started in 2024.</p><p>We contacted DHS to ask why the brothers were detained and deported while they had a pending immigration case and received no reply.</p><p>During his second term, Trump has significantly curtailed legal pathways for immigrants. In January, he ended a Biden-era programme that let people schedule immigration appointments at the border and legally enter the US to seek asylum. Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has stripped hundreds of thousands of people of temporary legal protections that let them live and work in the US.</p><p>Jose continued to try to build what he called his American dream, but his immigration status presented obstacles to buying a car and getting a job.</p><p>In 2024, the brothers moved to Long Island, New York, where their mother’s long-distance partner lived.</p><p>Amoachi initiated a process for them to apply for Special Immigrant Juveniles Status, a protection for young immigrants who were abused, abandoned or neglected by a parent. The brothers’ father had abandoned them, court documents say. When approved, the status allows immigrants to eventually apply for permanent residency. The brothers’ previous lawyer in Georgia had failed to tell them this status was an option, Amoachi said.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, immigrants granted Special Immigrant Juveniles status were protected from deportation. In June, the Trump administration ended the <a href=\"/news/2025/4/25/venezuelans-in-state-of-uncertainty-over-us-temporary-protected-status\">deportation protection programme</a> and began detaining and deporting people with Special Immigrant Juveniles status. Immigrant advocacy groups are <a href=\"https://nipnlg.org/work/litigation/acr-v-noem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suing</a> the government over the changes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-sudden-unexpected-outcome\">A sudden, unexpected outcome</h2><p>Jose’s dream of starting fresh in New York was short lived.</p><p>At the March 14 appointment, an ICE officer asked whether the brothers were contesting their removal order, and when Jose handed over their paperwork, the officer said, “‘This doesn’t work’,” Jose recounted.</p><p>Within minutes, the brothers were in handcuffs.</p><p>There’s no data about how many people have been arrested while attending required ICE check-ins, but news stories and social media clips are rife with examples of immigrants being detained and separated from family members. Lawyers have warned clients about the tactic. In San Diego, several immigrants are suing the government following their detention at check-ins.</p><p>Amoachi, who has worked as an immigration lawyer for 15 years, said before Trump’s second term, she had never seen a case like Jose’s and Josue’s – young men with deportation orders but no criminal convictions or gang affiliation and a pending application – end with detention.</p><p>About a week after the brothers were detained, Trump’s border czar Tom Homan said the administration was prioritising criminals.</p><p>“We’re going to keep targeting the worst of the worst, which we’ve been doing since Day One, and deporting from the United States,” Homan said on March 23.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"leaving-everything-behind\">Leaving everything behind</h2><p>Detention was the first leg in a two-month journey which would take the brothers back to El Salvador.</p><p>Hours after the brothers were detained, immigration officers shackled them and took them to a Buffalo, New York, detention centre.</p><p>In detention, Jose worked with a detained pastor to host weekly church services. Josue took a job in the kitchen – cleaning dishes and helping serve food – earning $1 a day. He used the money to call his mom or buy ramen, a delicacy in detention. Josue also taught English to fellow detainees and served as an unofficial translator for immigration officers.</p><p>On March 26, a New York family court judge ruled that Jose and Josue had been abandoned by their father and it was not in their best interest to return to El Salvador. Even so, they remained detained.</p><p>In early May, officers called in the brothers for processing, which would mean they’d either be deported or released, Jose said. Fellow detainees rooted for them.</p><p>The outcome wasn’t as hoped. The brothers were transported to Louisiana.</p><p>For several days, Jose and Josue stayed in holding cells dubbed “hieleras” – Spanish for “ice boxes” – with about 100 people in each. On May 7, their mother’s birthday, an officer called the brothers’ names to board a flight to El Salvador. Once on the plane, Jose said an officer entered with a separate list of names for people who could get off the flight. That was Jose’s last hope. But the brothers’ names weren’t called.</p><p>“When the plane took off, I knew I was leaving behind my mum,” Jose said. “Literally everything was staying behind. Our dreams. Everything.”</p><h2 id=\"stuck-in-limbo\">Stuck in limbo</h2><p>Nine years after fleeing their home country, Jose and Josue, now 21 and 20, landed in El Salvador. They had no passports; US immigration authorities had taken them when they applied for asylum and never returned them.</p><p>Authorities gave each brother a piece of paper with his name on it as a form of identification. When Jose and Josue arrived at an immigration processing centre, they saw people waiting for US deportees. No one was waiting for them.</p><p>“I looked at my brother and said, ‘Now what? What do we do?’” Jose said.</p><p>Their mother sent their grandmother’s childhood friend to pick them up. For the first few nights, the brothers couldn’t eat or sleep. They have since been diagnosed with PTSD and depression, Amoachi said.</p><p>A few weeks after Jose and Josue arrived in El Salvador, Josue’s high school in Georgia held its graduation ceremony. Rather than walking across the stage, he watched from his phone as they announced his name, and he cried in Jose’s arms.</p><p>Seven months after being deported, Jose and Josue yearn for the possibility of reuniting with their families. Amoachi has filed several appeals on their behalf.</p><p>Jose said the brothers followed the conditions: Going to court, attending ICE check-ins, having good moral conduct and no criminal record.</p><p>“So what is the legal pathway?” Jose asked. “There isn’t one.”</p><p><em>PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.</em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ukraine has not held elections during Russia’s nearly four-year assault because it cannot hold ballots during war.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Moscow’s larger army has made steady advances in recent months, seizing between 12 and 17 square kilometres (4.5 and 6.6 square miles) daily in 2025, according to Western assessments.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The Russian president also attacked Western handling of frozen Russian assets, labelling plans to use them for Ukraine as “robbery” rather than theft because it was being done openly.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“Whatever they stole, they’ll have to give it back someday,” he said, pledging to pursue legal action in courts he described as “independent of political decisions”.</p><p>European Union leaders agreed to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/eu-agrees-hefty-105b-ukraine-loan-without-using-russian-assets\">provide a hefty $105bn interest-free loan</a> to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs in its war with Russia for the next two years, EU Council President Antonio Costa said.</p><p>The leaders decided early on Friday ‍to borrow cash on capital markets to fund Ukraine’s defence against Russia rather than use frozen Russian assets, diplomats said.</p><p>Putin also warned that any attempt to blockade Kaliningrad, a vulnerable Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania, could trigger a “large-scale conflict.” The territory hosts Russia’s Baltic Fleet.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The annual event, which Putin has held in different formats since 2001, drew about three million questions from Russians via phone, text and online platforms. An artificial intelligence system processed the queries to identify common themes.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Putin’s comments come at a pivotal moment, and are watched closely by Western officials who will want to get a read on how he intends to present the situation on the ground to the Russian public.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Trump has launched a major diplomatic push to end nearly four years of fighting, but negotiations have stalled over sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">US officials estimate that Russia and Ukraine have suffered more than two million casualties since Moscow launched its invasion in February 2022. Neither side discloses reliable loss figures.</p></div></div></body></html>"
