On Friday, his secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, revealed that he had directed her to end the lottery immediately.</p><p>She also identified the suspect as Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, who received his green card, a certificate for permanent residency, through the lottery in 2017.</p><p>“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” Noem wrote in her social media statement.</p><p>“At President Trump’s direction, I am immediately directing USCIS [US Citizenship and Immigration Services] to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.”</p><h2 id=\"campaign-to-end-visa-lottery\">Campaign to end visa lottery</h2><p>Friday’s announcement is not the first time Trump has sought to wind down the diversity visa lottery.</p><p>Trump has long sought to narrow the country’s pathways to legal immigration, and he has used crime as a pretext for doing so.</p><p>Noem herself pointed out that, in 2017, Trump “fought” to shut down the diversity visa lottery in the wake of an attack in New York City in which a truck rammed into a crowd of people, killing eight.</p><p>Speaking at a graduation ceremony for the FBI in December 2017, Trump, then in his first term as president, called on Congress to “end the visa lottery system”.</p><p>“They have a lottery. You pick people. Do you think the country is giving us their best people? No,” Trump said.</p><p>“What kind of a system is that? They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people.”</p><p>The Diversity Immigrant Visa Programme was established in 1990 to ensure applicants from underrepresented countries had access to the US immigration system.</p><p>Immigration rights advocates have long argued that pathways to permanent residency are narrow for those who do not already have a spouse, relative or some other kind of sponsor in the country.</p><p>The visa lottery helps to answer that need by creating an alternative route to residency.</p><p>The lottery system selects visa recipients randomly, but critics argue it remains a long-shot avenue to gain US residency, and even successful applicants must still pass a rigorous screening process after the lottery.</p><p>While the Diversity Immigrant Visa Programme used to accept 55,000 applicants each year, in 2000, that number was lowered to its current level, according to the American Immigration Council.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4185383\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4185383\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4185383\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25353530715939-1766189719.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C575&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Surveillance footage of the Brown University suspect, with a suitcase\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4185383\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Surveillance images released by police show Claudio Neves Valente, the suspect in the mass shooting at Brown University [Providence Police Dept via AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"suspect-identified\">Suspect identified</h2><p>Friday’s decision to immediately suspend the lottery comes as new details emerge about Neves Valente, a physics scholar found dead in a storage unit in New Hampshire after a nationwide manhunt.</p><p>The search began on December 13, when gunfire erupted on the campus of Brown University, a prestigious Ivy League school in Providence, Rhode Island.</p><p>The school’s fall semester was at its conclusion, and the exam period had begun. Students in the Barus and Holley physics laboratory were taking their end-of-course exams when a suspect, clad in black, entered the building and opened fire, killing two students and injuring nine others.</p><p>The physics lab was close to the edge of campus, and the suspect was able to escape on foot undetected.</p><p>The manhunt included several false starts, as authorities said they quickly detained a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/brown-university-in-us-reports-active-shooter-situation-on-campus\">person of interest</a>, only to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/14/person-of-interest-held-in-hunt-for-gunman-who-killed-2-at-brown-university\">release</a> the individual without charges.</p><p>Then, on November 15, law enforcement officials announced that a plasma physics scholar named Nuno Loureiro had been found dead at his home after suffering multiple gunshot wounds.</p><p>Loureiro was also a Portuguese immigrant, and he had served as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a highly regarded science institution.</p><p>It was not immediately clear that the two shooting incidents were related, and authorities faced pressure to bring the Brown University shooter to justice as the manhunt dragged on.</p><p>But on Thursday night, officials announced they had discovered Neves Valente dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and that they believed him to be responsible for both attacks.</p><p>Neves Valente had previously studied in a PhD programme at Brown, though he did not complete his degree, and he had been Loureiro’s classmate in Portugal.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"visa-revocations\">Visa revocations</h2><p>The Trump administration has a track record of revoking visas and terminating immigration programmes after high-profile attacks.</p><p>On November 26, for example, two National Guard members from West Virginia were shot while on patrol in Washington, DC, as part of Trump’s crime crackdown in the capital.</p><p>The suspect in that case was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who had previously worked with allied forces during the US-led war in Afghanistan.</p><p>One of the National Guard soldiers, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, ultimately died from her wounds.</p><p>Trump responded to the incident by announcing that he was halting all <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/us-pauses-visas-for-all-afghan-passport-holders-halts-asylum-requests\">visa applications and asylum requests</a> from Afghan nationals, despite outcry from human rights and veterans groups.</p><p>The Republican leader also said he would <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-pauses-immigration-from-third-world-countries-what-that-means\">pursue a “permanent pause”</a> on entry for immigrants from “all third-world countries”.</p><p>In the aftermath of the shooting, Trump’s White House tightened entry for 19 countries it had identified in June as “high risk” and expanded the list of restrictions to include 20 more countries.</p><p>Trump has also taken targeted actions to strip individuals of their immigration status following shootings.</p><p>After the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk in September, the Trump administration announced it was yanking visas from six foreign nationals who posted disrespectful comments or memes online about the attack. They hailed from countries ranging from Argentina to Brazil, and Germany to Paraguay.</p><p>Free-speech advocates said the decision was a clear violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the freedom of expression.</p><p>But the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to boot foreign nationals whose views do not align with its policy priorities.</p><p>“Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed,” the US State Department <a href=\"https://x.com/StateDept/status/1978218124957696495\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in response.</p><p>The suspect in the Kirk shooting is a 22-year-old US citizen named Tyler James Robinson from Utah.</p><p>Studies have repeatedly shown that US-born citizens are more likely to commit violent crimes than immigrants.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Refused entry by border police as they did not have departure stamps from Israel on their passports, they were stuck on the aircraft for 12 hours before being allowed to disembark.</p><p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa admitted the passengers “out of compassion”, but said at the time that his government, which has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, would investigate as it seemed that they had been “flushed out” of the Gaza Strip.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"forced-evacuations\">Forced evacuations</h2><p>Israeli officials have previously openly stated that they support what they have termed the “voluntary emigration” of Palestinians from Gaza, in what effectively would be their forced evacuation.</p><p>In March 2025, Israel’s security cabinet set up a controversial bureau to get Palestinians to leave Gaza voluntarily, which was headed by former deputy director of the Ministry of Defence, Yaakov Blitstein. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said at the time that 40 percent of Gaza residents were “interested in emigrating”.</p><p>The previous month, Al-Majd Europe set up its online presence with a new website stating that it focused on relief efforts in Muslim countries, specifically “for Gazans wishing to exit Gaza”, with claims that it had organised mobile health clinics in the enclave and trips for Palestinian doctors abroad that Al Jazeera later discovered to be false.</p><p>A passenger from the November flight to South Africa, whose identity was kept hidden for his own protection, said he contacted the organisation after finding the link online, which promised not only a way out of Gaza, but safety and medical treatment for injuries. “Initially, it said it was free. Then they asked for $1,400 [per person]. Then the price went up to $2,500,” he said.</p><p>Testimonies gathered by Al Jazeera showed that payments requested varied from $1,000-2,000 per person, with strict criteria for signing up. Only families would be accepted on condition that they kept their departure secret, with details on flight departures only released a few hours before takeoff.</p><p>Passengers say they were told to arrive at the Karem Abu Salem crossing (called Kerem Shalom in Israel) in southern Gaza. When they arrived, their personal belongings were confiscated, and they were put on buses to Ramon Airport, near the Israeli city of Eilat, apparently by Israeli authorities.</p><p>Nigel Branken, a South African social worker who helped tho Palestinians on the plane, previously told Al Jazeera that there were “very clearly … marks of Israel involved in this operation to take people … to displace them”.</p><p>Evacuees told Al Jazeera they were not informed of their final destination until moments before boarding. They were then escorted onto a flight registered to a brand new airline called FLYYO without exit stamps in their travel documents.</p><p>Al Jazeera discovered that FLYYO has organised a number of similar flights, all taking off from Israeli airports, headed to Romania, Indonesia, South Africa, Kenya and other destinations.</p><h2 id=\"false-identity\">False identity</h2><p>Further scrutiny of Al-Majd Europe, which said it was a “humanitarian foundation established in 2010 in Germany”, with a head office located in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem, later revealed its identity to be a sham.</p><p>Al Jazeera found no company registered by that name on any German or European database. The supposed address does not appear in official Jerusalem records, with the location on Google Maps corresponding to a hospital and a cafe.</p><p>While digging into the flights, Al Jazeera found two faces linked to the organisation – both Palestinians. The first was Muayad Hisham Saidam, which the organisation lists as its humanitarian projects manager in Gaza.</p><p>A search of Saidam’s name reveals that in May 2024, his wife created a public page to ask for donations to help her family leave Gaza. A year later, Saidam posted an image of himself boarding a plane chartered by Fly Lili, another Romanian airline, announcing that he was departing Gaza.</p><p>Using the angle of his shadow, time of the flight and the location of the plane on the Ramon Airport runway, Al Jazeera discovered Saidam was likely on a flight on May 27, 2025, which left Israel for Budapest, with 57 Palestinian passengers from Gaza.</p><p>It appears that Saidam’s identity is real, and that his family was likely evacuated to Indonesia. But his connection to Al-Majd Europe is unclear.</p><p>The second public face of the organisation belongs to a man named only as Adnan, though he appears to have no digital footprint.</p><p>On November 13, the day of the Johannesburg flight, a page containing a number of partner companies was deleted from Al-Majd’s website. Using open-source intelligence techniques, Al Jazeera recovered the page, which showed a number of well-known groups that Al-Majd claimed to have been working with, including the International Red Cross.</p><p>One name stood out: Talent Globus – a recruitment company established in Estonia in 2024, with a fund containing only $350. Its website lists four employees, including Director Tom Lind, a businessman with Israeli and Estonian citizenship.</p><p>Lind’s name has been linked to a number of other companies where he’s listed either as a founder or director – all without official registration or physical addresses.</p><p>Lind’s name appeared in reports by Israeli newspaper Haaretz as one of the coordinators of the flights of Palestinians leaving Ramon Airport.</p><p>In May 2025, Lind posted on his LinkedIn page that he had left Talent Globus, and was instead focused on “humanitarian efforts to support Palestinians”. He said that, alongside a network of individuals and groups, he had assisted with the evacuation of a “substantial number” of people from Gaza.</p><p>Photos of the other three employees of Talent Globus from its website – James Thompson, Maria Rodriguez, David Chen – all turned out to be stock images.</p><p>And much like those employees, it appears as though Al-Majd itself is a fake humanitarian group, leading to the question of what those behind the organisation are trying to hide.</p><p>Publicly, Israel has seemed to back down from its plan to encourage “voluntary emigration”. But Al Jazeera’s investigation poses more questions – is Al-Majd part of a bigger plan, a way to quietly empty Gaza of its inhabitants, one secret flight at a time?</p></div></div></body></html>"

Those assertions, however, have been contradicted by the US intelligence community, which found no evidence that Maduro controls the gang.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Friday, Rubio said that the US is working with governments in the Western Hemisphere to ensure stability in the Caribbean region. But Venezuela, he underscored, is an outlier.</p><p>“There’s one place that doesn’t cooperate, and it’s the illegitimate regime in Venezuela. Not only do they not cooperate with us, they openly cooperate with terrorist and criminal elements,” he said.</p><p>“For example, they invite Hezbollah and Iran to operate from their territory.”</p><p>Trump’s allies have accused Maduro of forging ties with Hezbollah, but the US has not provided evidence that the Lebanese armed group, which was weakened by last year’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/israel-lebanon-officials-meet-as-pressure-mounts-to-disarm-hezbollah\">war with Israel</a>, is operating in the South American country.</p><p>Rubio’s comments come as the US continues to amass troops and military assets around Venezuela, raising speculation about plans to topple Maduro by force.</p><p>Trump has also announced an oil blockade on Caracas as he and his top aides continue to falsely claim that Venezuela’s oil <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-aide-stephen-miller-suggests-venezuelan-oil-belongs-to-us\">belongs to the US</a>.</p><p>Rubio was asked on Friday how he would square Trump’s self-image <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-state-of-the-nation-address\">as a peacemaker</a> with the escalating military threats to Venezuela.</p><p>“We reserve the right – and have the right – to utilise every element of national power to defend the national interest of the United States,” Rubio said. “And no one can dispute that. Every country in the world reserves the same option. We just simply have more power than some of them.”</p><h2 id=\"ukraine-not-our-war\">Ukraine ‘not our war’</h2><p>The ongoing war in Ukraine, which has been raging since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, was also a key topic in Friday’s news conference.</p><p>Rubio explained that the Trump administration is trying to gauge what <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/putin-takes-aim-at-zelenskyy-in-annual-qa-says-he-wont-negotiate-on-land\">Russia and Ukraine</a> are able to accept to help reach a peace deal, but he emphasised that the war is not a top priority for Washington.</p><p>“It’s not our war. It’s a war on another continent,” he said.</p><p>However, Rubio insisted that only the US can bring about a peace agreement in Ukraine.</p><p>“What we’re trying to figure out here is, what can Ukraine live with and what can Russia live with? Sort of identify what both sides’ positions are, and see if we can sort of drive them towards each other to some agreement,” Rubio said.</p><p>“If you were to ask [for] prioritisation, I would argue that something <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">in our hemisphere</a> for our national interest is more important than something in another continent,” he said. “But it doesn’t make Ukraine and Russia unimportant. We care about it. That’s why we’re involved in it.”</p><p>While campaigning for re-election in 2024, Trump pledged to end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24 hours of reclaiming the presidency.</p><p>He has since had to walk back those remarks, but the Republican leader has maintained an active role in peace negotiations, even hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin for a meeting in Alaska in August.</p><p>Trump has lobbied for the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on ending world conflicts.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-pressing-to-finalise-phase-one-of-gaza-truce\">US pressing to finalise phase one of Gaza truce</h2><p>Rubio also stressed on Friday that Washington is pushing to complete phase one of the <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/19/live-gaza-ceasefire-mediators-to-hold-talks-on-second-phase\">ceasefire in Gaza</a>, so the second stage can begin.</p><p>The three elements Rubio highlighted were setting up a Palestinian technocratic committee to help govern Gaza, establishing the foreign-led “board of peace”, and deploying an international policing force to the territory.</p><p>“This is something we’re aiming at very soon. It’s what we’re focused on right now like a laser,” he said.</p><p>“No one is arguing that the status quo is sustainable in the long term, nor desirable, and that’s why we have a sense of urgency about bringing phase one to its full completion.”</p><p>“Once we’ve established that, we have a lot of confidence that we are going to have the donors for the reconstruction effort and for all the humanitarian support in the long-term building of phases two and phases three.”</p><p>The US is currently hosting talks with officials from Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye to discuss moving to the next stage.</p><p>Since the Trump-brokered ceasefire in October, Israel has killed 395 people in Gaza, including an average of two children a day. On Friday, Israeli forces attacked a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/us-to-host-qatari-turkish-and-egyptian-officials-for-gaza-ceasefire-talks\">wedding gathering</a>, killing at least six people and wounding many others.</p><p>Israel has also refused to allow an adequate amount of aid into the territory, and blocked the entry of temporary homes, despite the fact that displaced people’s tents have flooded amid harsh winter weather.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera asked Rubio about Israel’s violations, but the secretary of state failed to address the premise of the question. Instead, he stressed that work to ensure peace in Gaza is ongoing.</p><p>“This is the hard work of diplomacy and peacemaking. Peacemaking isn’t just signing a piece of paper; it’s actually complying with it,” he said. “And compliance, oftentimes, in most cases, requires daily, constant follow-up and nurturing.”</p><h2 id=\"cooperation-with-china\">Cooperation with China</h2><p>As a senator, Rubio was a <a href=\"/features/2025/2/20/marco-rubio-a-traditionalist-hawk-in-the-age-of-trump\">China hawk</a>. But on Friday, he struck a softer tone when he spoke about relations with Beijing, underscoring the need for cooperation despite bilateral tensions.</p><p>“I think I’ve been nice to China,” Rubio said jokingly. He added that the US has made “good progress” with China.</p><p>“If there’s a global challenge that China and the US can work together on, I mean, we can solve it,” he told reporters. “And there’ll be points of tension. We recognise that our job is to balance these two things. I think both sides understand that.”</p><p>After an escalating trade war early in Trump’s second term, the US and China reached a <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/30/trump-says-xi-agreed-to-one-year-trade-deal-after-amazing-talks\">one-year deal</a> in November to freeze tariffs and resolve other issues.</p><p>For nearly a decade, US officials have described the global competition with Beijing as their most pressing foreign policy issue.</p><p>But in recent months, Trump has turned his attention to the Americas, appearing to de-prioritise the rivalry with China.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"commitment-to-nato\">Commitment to NATO</h2><p>The Trump administration has been blasting Europe and its leaders over their migration policies and the regulations of the European Union, but Rubio reasserted the US’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/rubio-says-progress-but-ways-to-go-in-efforts-to-end-russia-ukraine-war\">commitment to the NATO military alliance</a> on Friday.</p><p>He suggested that NATO’s common defence, as spelled out in Article Five of the alliance treaty, which commits each member to treat an attack on an alliance ally as an attack against every NATO country, would deter any Russian military campaign beyond Ukraine.</p><p>“It’s why we remain in NATO,” he said. “That’s why we’re in this alliance, and that’s why Article Five in the NATO alliance is important.”</p><p>The only request the US has of its fellow NATO allies, Rubio added, is that they increase their military spending.</p><p>Trump has sought to raise the minimum defence spending for members of the alliance to 5 percent of each country’s gross domestic product (GDP), but some countries, most notably Spain, have pushed for greater flexibility in their military budgets.</p><p>European allies in NATO have also expressed concerns about Trump’s commitment to the military alliance, citing ambiguous statements he has made in the past about the Article Five commitment. But Rubio sought to put those worries to rest.</p><p>“We’re committed to the alliance. And our commitment isn’t just rhetorical,” Rubio said. “Our commitment is action, in the troops that have been deployed and the monies that have been spent, and the capabilities that are located in the cooperation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It allowed the government to redact information that might be used in ongoing investigations or that might identify victims. Explicit material was also allowed to be concealed.</p><p>Still, Khanna said Justice Department leaders owed the public “ a clear timeline of when the rest of the documents will be released and an explanation for why they did not release all of them today”.</p><p>He also criticised Friday’s release for containing “ very heavy redactions”, even for material that should have already been publicly available from grand jury materials.</p><p>“They owe the Congress and the American public an explanation for every redaction that I didn’t see published on the DOJ page,” Khanna told reporters. “The law is very clear that any redaction has to be justified in writing.”</p><h2 id=\"frustrations-with-friday-s-release\">Frustrations with Friday’s release</h2><p>Friday’s release on the Justice Department website included a search bar that promised the “full Epstein library”.</p><p>But on social media, users complained that there was a queue to enter the Justice Department’s site and that the search tool failed to return results for basic terms related to the case.</p><p>Viewers also pointed out that many of the newly released materials included pages that were largely blacked out.</p><p>“ I was encouraged initially when Todd Blanche said that we were going to have hundreds of thousands of documents released,” Khanna himself said. “So far, I have not seen much new.”</p><p>Khanna and Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky were among the sponsors for the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p><p>He warned that members of the Trump administration could face consequences if they fail to release the full Epstein file.</p><p>“Thomas Massie and I will continue to explore all options to fight to make sure that they comply with the law, whether that is holding people in inherent contempt, recommending people for prosecution, recommending impeachment or private lawsuits,” Khanna said.</p><p>The official account for the Democratic Party, meanwhile, underscored Blanche’s comments that Friday’s release would be partial.</p><p>“Trump’s DOJ will not comply with today’s release deadline for the Epstein files,” the party wrote. “All files were required by law to be released today.”</p><p>Even some Republicans appeared to express frustration with the limited scope of Friday’s file drop.</p><p>“Release all the files,” Congress member Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on social media in the hours after Blanche’s interview. “It’s literally the law.”</p><p>In the lead-up to Friday’s release, Massie himself posted a 14-minute video on social media instructing the public about how to evaluate Friday’s file release.</p><p>“The victims’ lawyers have been in contact with me, and collectively they know that there are at least 20 names of men who are accused of sex crimes in the possession of the FBI. These would reside in the FD-302 forms,” he said.</p><p>“The FBI fills out these forms to summarise or memorialise what a witness gave them as far as testimony when they interviewed with the FBI.”</p><p>“So if we get a large production on December 19, and it does not contain a single name of any male who’s accused of a sex crime or sex trafficking or rape or any of these things, then we know they haven’t produced all the documents.”</p><h2 id=\"honouring-survivors-requests\">Honouring survivors’ requests</h2><p>Survivors of Epstein’s abuses have long petitioned for the US government to release its full file on the late financier, who died in 2019 while in a New York City jail, awaiting federal trial.</p><p>Previously, in 2008, he had been found guilty on solicitation and child prostitution charges after reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors in Florida, but critics slammed that deal as a lightweight sentence that failed to hold Epstein accountable for the magnitude of his crimes.</p><p>Hundreds of women have stepped forward in recent years to testify to sexual abuse and misconduct at Epstein’s hands. Many say they were minors at the time of the abuse.</p><p>Public scrutiny has long swirled around the case, given Epstein’s wealth and prominent connections. He was known to socialise with figures including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, scholar Noam Chomsky and political figures like Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.</p><p>Earlier this year, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly a prince in the United Kingdom, had his royal titles and privileges stripped as a result of his association with Epstein and the sexual abuse allegations against him.</p><p>In the US, the case has proven to be a lingering black eye for the Trump White House, which has publicly touted itself as the “most transparent administration in history”.</p><p>Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base was strongly associated with Epstein-related conspiracy theories, including that the late financier kept a “client list” to coerce the rich and powerful.</p><p>But despite a public statement in February that the list was on her desk, Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi later issued a memo in July, alongside FBI director Kash Patel, saying that the government had no such document.</p><p>That fuelled public outcry against the Trump administration, reigniting rumours and scrutiny about the president’s own relationship with Epstein.</p><p>Trump has long denied being friends with Epstein, despite photos and documents that suggest a certain intimacy.</p><p>In July, Trump told reporters that he and Epstein had a falling-out after the financier allegedly poached employees from the Mar-a-Lago spa.</p><p>“I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people,'” Trump explained. “And then, not too long after that, he did it again. And I said, ‘Outta here.'”</p><p>In a recent article with the magazine Vanity Fair, Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles acknowledged Trump was in the Epstein files, but she denied he was involved in any wrongdoing: “He’s not in the file doing anything awful.”</p><p>“I know it’s a passe word, but [they were] sort of young, single playboys together,” Wiles told the publication.</p><p>Trump has often gone on the offensive against critics who sought to tie him to the Epstein files, calling members of his own base “stupid” for fixating on the file.</p><p>But in November, he reversed course and urged Republicans to vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act. It passed with bipartisan support, with a vote of 427 to one in the House of Representatives and unanimous approval in the Senate.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We’re not doing it anymore,” Trump said at a White House news conference, flanked by nine pharma executives.</p><p>Mehmet Oz, the director of the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Service, said Regeneron, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AbbVie would visit the White House after the holidays for the launch of the government’s TrumpRx website.</p><p>US patients currently pay by far the most for prescription medicines, often nearly three times more than in other developed nations, and Trump has been pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices to what patients pay elsewhere.</p><p>The details of each deal were not immediately available, but officials said they included agreements to cut cash-pay direct-to-consumer prices of select drugs sold potentially through the TrumpRx.gov website, to launch drugs in the US at prices equal to – not lower than – those in other wealthy nations and to increase manufacturing. In return, companies can receive a three-year exemption from any tariffs.</p><h2 id=\"drug-prices-fall\">Drug prices fall</h2><p>Merck said it will sell its diabetes drugs Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR – set to face generic competition next year – directly to US consumers at about 70 percent off list prices. If approved, its experimental cholesterol drug enlicitide will also be offered through direct-to-consumer channels.</p><p>Enlicitide is one of two Merck drugs expected to receive a speedy review under the FDA’s new, fast-track pathway, the Reuters news agency has previously reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Amgen said it will expand its direct-to-patient programme to include migraine drug Aimovig and rheumatoid arthritis medicine Amjevita, offering both at $299 a month – nearly 60 percent and 80 percent below current US list prices.</p><p>In July, Trump sent letters to leaders of 17 major pharmaceutical companies, outlining how they should provide so-called <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/trump-reveals-prescription-drug-deal-with-pharmaceutical-giant-astrazeneca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most-favoured -nation prices</a> to the US government’s Medicaid health programme for low-income people, and guarantee that new drugs will not be launched at prices above those in other high-income countries.</p><p>So far, five companies have struck deals with the administration to rein in prices. They are Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk and EMD Serono, the US division of Germany’s Merck.</p><p>A portion of revenues from each company’s foreign sales will also be remitted to the US to offset costs, officials said.</p><p>The companies pledged together to invest more than $150bn in the US for R&amp;D and manufacturing, according to officials, although it was unclear whether that included earlier commitments. Several also agreed to donate drug ingredients to the US strategic reserve.</p><p>Trump has long focused on the disparity between drug prices in the US and other wealthy countries, which have government-run health systems that negotiate price discounts.</p><p>The spectre of tighter price controls by the US government initially spooked investors, but the terms of the deals announced so far have calmed many of those fears.</p><p>Analysts have noted that Medicaid, which accounts for only approximately 10 percent of US drug spending, already benefits from substantial price discounts, exceeding 80 percent in some cases.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The idea that this will save consumers a lot of money is highly speculative.”</p><p>These fuel efficiency measures, along with the US consumers’ continued preference for SUVs and other petrol guzzlers,  have led Ford Motors to announce a $19.5bn hit as it cut back plans to produce EVs. General Motors also announced a $1.6bn impact related to its EV pullback in quarterly results declared in October and warned there could be more hits. It also announced 3,400 layoffs across its EV sites.</p><p>Federal cutbacks will hinder an already slow transition to EVs in the US, where they form less than 10 percent of the market, well below the global EV sales, which made up 25 percent of all cars sold this year.</p><p>“The government can assist markets in this transition,” says Andrew Hoffman, Holcim professor of sustainable enterprise at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.</p><p>The US is a “unique market”, Hoffman says, in liking SUVs and pick-up trucks because of the long distances that can cause range anxiety for electric car drivers. It underscores the need for a charging station network, another area where the Trump administration has made cuts that impact business plans. On Tuesday, 16 states sued the Trump administration for withholding billions in grants for EV charging station infrastructure.</p><p>Tesla, the US’s largest EV manufacturer, is expected to be hit the most by these changes. In November, its US sales dropped 23 percent from a year before, as the $7,500 tax credit ended.</p><p>While Google parent Alphabet-backed electric-powered autonomous vehicle Waymo has expanded its operations to a range of US cities this year, it has a fleet of just a few thousand cars and overall experts see the EV share of the market to drop further.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Along with the ending of tax credits for EVs, a reduced charging network could push consumers towards petrol-guzzling cars, even though lower fuel efficiency in those will mean higher fuel costs that could hurt household budgets.</p><p>“Buying gas-guzzling cars will cost consumers more money,” says Dan Becker, director of the Safe Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity.</p><p>Given that the proposed new standards are only for new cars, they may not matter much for fuel consumption in the next year or two, but “if the rules hold, they will significantly impact fuel consumption in the 2030s,” says Mathew Tarduno, assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p><h2 id=\"polluting-climate-endangering-human-health\">Polluting climate, endangering human health</h2><p>The new standards are the latest in a slew of measures announced this year that could make US cars less fuel-efficient.</p><p>In July, when the tax and spending bill was passed, the penalties for cars not meeting fuel efficiency standards were brought down to zero. Rules for tailpipe emissions were also relaxed, tax credits for EVs ended in September, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposal to overrule the Endangerment Finding, EPA’s longstanding, science-based finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, and roll back standards to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new cars and trucks.</p><p>The EPA’s rollback on the Endangerment Finding is imminent, environmental groups say, adding they are presenting their views to the EPA on all of these proposals and are preparing for legal fights to oppose the rollback, if that goes through.</p><p>On the fuel standards, there is a public hearing period until the end of next month. “We plan to share our view with the administration and then, with colleagues, sue them [if the proposal goes through],” said Center for Biological Diversity’s Becker.</p><p>“One area on which future lawsuits might focus is how the Department of Transportation treats EVs in setting new standards. The department is required to set fuel economy standards at the maximum feasible level,” says Nikki Reisch, director of the climate and energy programme at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).</p><p>“Gas-powered cars can’t compete with EVs and hybrids in terms of fuel efficiency. These cleaner, more efficient technologies exist and cannot simply be ignored,” she added.</p><p>Vehicular emissions contribute to toxins in ambient air known as carcinogens and can also cause respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, according to the EPA.</p><p>The transportation sector is, in fact, the leading cause of air pollution in the US, as per the American Lung Association.</p><p>The easing of fuel standards “turns back the clock on public health standards”, says William Barrett, assistant vice president of nationwide policy at the American Lung Association.</p><p>The impact of increased air pollution from possibly increased vehicle emissions could have a particularly acute impact on children, Barrett says.</p><p>“Children are more vulnerable because their lungs are still developing. Increased pollution could have an immediate and lasting effect on them, such as keeping them on the sidelines of a soccer game or increasing ER visits.”</p><p>The Lung Association also plans to give its comments during the public hearing process with a view to holding off the new standards.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"freedom-of-choice\">Freedom of choice</h2><p>But Karl Brauer, an auto analyst and writer for iSeecars.com, says car emissions have been reducing since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970 and also because of subsequent regulations that were brought in to lower emissions.</p><p>“Cars got cleaner a long time ago,” Brauer says. “Continuing with such regulation will have diminishing returns.”</p><p>The proposed new fuel standards will lead to “lower costs and higher profit margins for auto companies and lower prices for consumers,” and they will lead to “more freedom of choice”, Brauer says, because with tax credits for EVs gone, petrol and electric vehicles will now compete for consumer preferences on equal footing.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Major carmakers will save more than $35bn in technology costs through 2031, the Trump administration said in the fuel standards rollback December 3 announcement.</p><p>But at the same time, fuel costs for drivers are expected to soar, and US drivers are expected to pay up to $185bn more through 2050, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported.</p><p>Chief executives of Ford and General Motors flanked Trump during his announcement at the White House.</p><p>GM CEO Mary Barra said the announcement would allow carmakers to offer a range of petrol and electric vehicles while keeping prices down and meeting consumer preferences. “Regulatory requirements do not get ahead of the consumer,” she said at a New York Times Deal Book summit.</p><p>With petrol prices having fallen in the last few weeks, Brauer says a fuel-based car would be less expensive than an EV. Besides, the lack of sufficient charging stations can make them unattractive.</p><p>But the new standards could move US car makers in a direction divergent from global markets, which are moving towards higher fuel efficiency and electric cars. While the proposed standards could serve to make SUVs and other petrol guzzlers more attractive in the US, they could make competing in global markets harder.</p><p>“One question is whether US automakers will be forced to comply with different types of regulations in different places,” says Tarduno of the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p><p>China is now the world’s largest car manufacturer and exporter, known especially for its electric vehicles. “GM and Ford will want to be players in the world. If they don’t make EVs, they will get shut out by Chinese carmakers,” says the Center for Biological Diversity’s Becker.</p><p>But Brauer has a different take.</p><p>“Internal combustion cars,” he says, are a competitive advantage for US car makers, given that China has spent years building its lead on electric vehicles. The US, he says, should build on it.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2024/11/26/ceasefire-between-lebanons-hezbollah-and-israel-what-to-know\">a ceasefire agreement</a> between Israel and Hezbollah has held talks in southern Lebanon, as Israel and the United States ramp up pressure to disarm the Lebanese group.</p><p>Civilian and military delegations from Israel and Lebanon met in the southern Lebanese town of Naqoura on Friday for closed-door discussions, the 15th such gathering since the truce was signed in November 2024.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The US embassy in Beirut said military participants offered “operational updates” and agreed on the need to strengthen the Lebanese army as a guarantor of security south of the Litani River.</p><p>“Civilian participants, in parallel, focused on setting conditions for residents to return safely to their homes, advancing reconstruction, and addressing economic priorities,” the embassy said in a statement.</p><p>“They underscored that durable political and economic progress is essential to reinforcing security gains and sustaining lasting peace.”</p><p>The talks come as Israel has repeatedly violated the ceasefire with Hezbollah, carrying out <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/israel-strikes-across-south-eastern-lebanon-in-latest-truce-violation\">near-daily attacks</a> across Lebanon, most notably in the south.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a series of air strikes across the country a day before the Friday meetings, claiming in a statement that it was targeting the Lebanese group’s military operatives and infrastructure.</p><p>Reporting from Naqoura, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said the talks were expected to focus on solidifying what has largely been a one-sided truce.</p><p>“At least that is what Lebanon wants,” she said. “The Israeli army still occupies more than 10 square kilometres [about 4sq miles] of Lebanese territory along the border.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"next-meeting-in-january\">Next meeting in January</h2><p>After the meetings, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun met Lebanese diplomat Simon Karam, who has been appointed as the country’s top civilian negotiator.</p><p>A statement by the Lebanese presidency said Aoun stressed that allowing tens of thousands of Lebanese civilians who have been displaced as a result of Israel’s attacks to return to their villages and homes was “an entry point for addressing all other details”.</p><p>Aoun said the committee’s next meeting is scheduled for January 7.</p><p>He also welcomed a separate diplomatic agreement reached in Paris between the US, France and Saudi Arabia to organise an international conference in early 2026 to support the Lebanese army and the country’s internal security forces.</p><p>Israel’s National Security Council Deputy Director for Foreign Policy Yosef Dreznin represented the country in the civilian talks.</p><p>The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the meeting as a “continuation of the security dialogue aimed at ensuring the disarmament of Hezbollah by the Lebanese army”.</p><p>“During the meeting, ways to promote economic projects were discussed in order to underscore the mutual interest in removing the Hezbollah threat and ensuring sustainable security for residents on both sides of the border,” it said in a statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Washington, DC, on Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US wants to “empower” the Lebanese government to remove Hezbollah’s weapons, underscoring Israeli threats to take action against the Lebanese group.</p><p>“We all would hope that we could avoid that,” Rubio said.</p><p>“In order to have peace, you have to avoid that, and the best way to avoid it is to have a strong Lebanese government that can actually control the country, that Hezbollah is no longer an armed threat to Israel or to the Lebanese state.”</p><p>For its part, Hezbollah has <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/hezbollah-to-treat-lebanons-disarmament-decision-as-if-it-does-not-exist\">rejected the prospect</a> of laying down its weapons while Israel continues to regularly launch attacks on Lebanon and occupy parts of its territory.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/hezbollah-leader-promises-response-to-israels-strike-killing-top-commander\">Naim Qassem</a>, who became Hezbollah’s secretary-general after his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah and most of the group’s military and political leadership were assassinated by Israel, has accused the Lebanese government of giving concessions without receiving anything in return.</p><p>Paul Salem, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera that the talks remain limited at the moment but may, in the future, evolve into broader topics, including a full cessation of hostilities.</p><p>“I doubt it will get into anything related to peace, certainly not now,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
