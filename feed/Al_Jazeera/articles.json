But Australian authorities have reserved the right to update the list of banned platforms as required.</p><p>A number of young people and advocates have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of the new ban, including 18-year-old journalist and founder of youth news service 6 News Australia <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/meta-sets-date-to-remove-australians-under-16-from-instagram-facebook\">Leo Puglisi</a>, who told an Australian Senate inquiry that the ban will affect young people’s access to information.</p><p>UNICEF Australia has also expressed concerns about implementation, saying the changes proposed by the Australian government “won’t fix the problems young people face online”.</p><p>“Social media has a lot of good things, like education and staying in touch with friends,” UNICEF Australia said in a statement.</p><p>“We think it’s more important to make social media platforms safer and to listen to young people to make sure any changes actually help.”</p><p>Katrina Lines, the CEO of children’s therapy provider Act for Kids, said that parents should start having conversations with children as soon as possible about how they can stay connected as the ban comes into effect over the coming weeks.</p><p>“It’s important to keep the lines of communication open in the lead up to and even long after these changes take effect,” Lines said.</p><p>Act for Kids said it surveyed more than 300 Australian children aged 10 to 16, and found 41 percent would prefer to connect with family in real life compared to only 15 percent who preferred to spend time online. But Lines said families still need to work out how to improve in-person connections.</p><p>“One way of starting this conversation could be by asking them how they would like to stay connected to friends and family outside of social media,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"global-concern\">Global concern</h2><p>The Australian ban comes amid growing global concern over the effects of social media on children’s health and safety, and companies including TikTok, Snapchat, Google and Meta Platforms – the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp – are facing lawsuits in the United States for their role in fuelling a mental health crisis.</p><p>Regulators around the world are closely watching whether Australia’s sweeping restrictions can work.</p><p>Malaysia’s Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said on Sunday that the Malaysian government also plans to ban social media for users under the age of 16, starting from next year.</p><p>He said the government was reviewing the mechanisms used in Australia and other nations to impose age restrictions for social media use, citing a need to protect youths from online harms such as cyberbullying, financial scams and child sexual abuse.</p><p>“We hope by next year that social media platforms will comply with the government’s decision to bar those under the age of 16 from opening user accounts,” he told reporters, according to a video of his remarks posted online by local daily The Star.</p><p>In New Zealand, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is also planning to introduce a similar bill to restrict children’s social media use, while Indonesia, too, has said it is preparing legislation to <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/14/after-australias-ban-indonesia-mulls-minimum-age-for-social-media\">protect young people</a> from “physical, mental, or moral perils”.</p><p>In Europe, France, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Greece are jointly testing a template for an age verification app, while the Dutch government has advised parents to forbid children under 15 from using social media apps like TikTok and Snapchat.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We are seeing demolition and systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure and landmarks, and the turning of this area into a barren landscape,” Abu Azzoum said.</p><p>“People here are concerned about the potential expansion of Israel’s attacks to other areas in Gaza in the coming days. People are also sceptical of the possibility of moving from phase one of the ceasefire to phase two as they are still waiting to see if the deal can be sustained and if there will be advancements in terms of the flow of humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts,” he added.</p><p>Phase one of the ceasefire – based on US President Donald Trump’s peace plan – involves the exchange of captives and prisoners, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the opening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt.</p><p>So far, Hamas has released all remaining living captives and returned dozens of bodies, except for three. Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinians, including prisoners serving life sentences. But it has placed restrictions on border crossings that continue to impede the delivery of aid, according to humanitarian groups.</p><p>Israel has also refused to allow the Rafah crossing to open.</p><p>Phase two of the ceasefire meanwhile calls for Gaza to be governed under a technocratic Palestinian committee, with oversight and supervision of the Trump-led “board of peace”. The board is to also deploy a temporary <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/what-is-the-international-stabilisation-force-for-gaza\">International Stabilisation Force</a> to secure border areas, train Palestinian police and also demilitarise Gaza.</p><p>Hamas, however, says it will not lay down weapons as long as the Israeli occupation continues.</p><p>Tump’s plan also says no Palestinian would be forced to leave Gaza and that “Israel will not occupy or annex” the territory.</p><p>The plan has now been <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/unsc-approves-us-resolution-mandating-intl-stabilisation-force-in-gaza\">endorsed</a> by the United Nations Security Council.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Meanwhile, Lebanon’s government has come under pressure from Israel via its main benefactor, the United States, as both countries urge it to move faster to disarm Hezbollah and meet with Israelis for direct talks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-has-the-upper-hand\">Israel has ‘the upper hand’</h2><p>Lebanon’s leadership had pushed for indirect negotiations with Israel, even though the issue is divisive inside the country. Just two days before Israel’s attack on Beirut’s suburb, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun addressed the issue.</p><p>“The Lebanese state is ready to negotiate under the UN, US or joint international sponsorship – any agreement that would establish a framework for a permanent end to transborder aggressions,” Aoun announced on Friday from Tyr, a southern city that suffered extensive damage during last year’s war.</p><p>Aoun did not say explicitly whether or not the talks would be direct. Analysts, however, told Al Jazeera that Israel’s recent uptick in attacks indicates it is not looking to negotiate.</p><p>Israel “has got the upper hand militarily at the moment, and they don’t seem to be interested in negotiating in earnest,” Nicholas Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They’re quite happy sniping away at Hezbollah on a daily basis … Lebanon is doing what they can under the circumstances, but I don’t think they have a willing interlocutor in the Israelis at this stage.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite an ostensible ceasefire, Israel has <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/23/israeli-jets-bomb-villages-across-lebanon-despite-ceasefire\">intensified attacks</a> in Lebanon’s south and Bekaa Valley in recent days. At least 13 people were <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/israeli-attack-on-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon-kills-at-least-13\">killed</a> by an Israeli strike on Lebanon’s largest Palestinian refugee camp last week, in an attack that killed mostly children and marked the highest death toll in a single strike since a ceasefire was agreed in November last year.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 300 people in Lebanon since then, including <a href=\"/features/2025/11/12/israel-intensifying-attacks-on-lebanon-is-it-planning-another-war\">around 127 civilians</a>, according to the United Nations. It also continues to occupy at least five points in south Lebanon, despite the ceasefire stating Israel would withdraw its troops from Lebanese territory.</p><p>“The problem is that Israel is not interested in negotiating at the moment. It wants to eliminate Hezbollah or push the Lebanese army into a clash with the party,” Kassem Kassir, a Lebanese journalist close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Every time Aoun or [Prime Minister Nawaf] Salam talk about negotiations, Israel escalates its aggression.”</p><h2 id=\"israel-should-demonstrate-good-faith\">Israel ‘should demonstrate good faith’</h2><p>Tabtabai’s killing marks the highest-ranking Hezbollah target killed since the ceasefire. The attack also came a week to the day before Pope Leo XIV’s planned visit to the country and a day after Lebanon mutedly celebrated its 82nd independence day.</p><p>US and Israeli officials have warned Lebanon of an intensification should the country not move faster to disarm Hezbollah. In August, Lebanon’s cabinet <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/lebanese-cabinet-holds-more-talks-on-disarming-hezbollah-under-us-pressure\">approved</a> a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah and bring the group’s weapons under the state’s control. Hezbollah has <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/hezbollah-rejects-calls-to-disarm-says-demands-serve-israel\">refused</a> to relinquish its weapons, saying the move serves Israel.</p><p>Still, the Lebanese army has been criticised by some US officials for moving too slowly in disarming Hezbollah. Analysts say the Lebanese government has also been criticised for failing to establish a political consensus on the divisive issue.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Israel’s actions are undermining the Lebanese government’s efforts, according to analysts. After Lebanon’s cabinet approved the plan to disarm Hezbollah, US Special Envoy Tom Barrack visited Israel in an effort to get its military to stop attacks and withdraw troops from the Lebanese territory. He came back empty-handed.</p><p>The US recently cancelled a planned trip by Lebanon’s army chief Rodolphe Haykal to Washington, DC after the LAF issued a statement critical of Israel. Haykal had previously proposed suspending LAF operations on disarming Hezbollah until Israel stops its attacks.</p><p>“If Israel actively wants to enter and succeed in negotiations, it should demonstrate good faith in entering, and ways for that would be to at least reduce attacks on Lebanese territory or withdraw from some points in the south. They could create a positive dynamic to develop a consensus,” David Wood, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Lebanon, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"choices-before-hezbollah\">Choices before Hezbollah</h2><p>Since last November’s ceasefire, Hezbollah has only responded to Israeli attacks <a href=\"/news/2024/12/2/israeli-attacks-kill-two-people-in-lebanon-hezbollah-responds\">once</a>. Under its new Secretary-General Naim Qassem, the group has largely shown restraint.</p><p>Still, there are concerns in Lebanon that the group may decide to soon change tactics.</p><p>“There is definitely a mood to strike back against the Israelis, not just from today’s attack but in general,” Blanford said. “But they know very well that if they do, the Israelis will escalate, and no one in Lebanon will thank Hezbollah for doing that.”</p><p>Israel’s military superiority and its US backing leave Hezbollah and the Lebanese state with few choices. Currently in Lebanon, the issue of negotiations with Israel and Hezbollah’s disarmament is divisive.</p><p>Analysts said many in the country fervently oppose direct negotiations, though the government has expressed a willingness to enter indirect talks, similar to 2022’s <a href=\"/news/2022/10/14/what-to-know-about-the-israel-lebanon-maritime-border-deal\">maritime agreement</a> between Israel and Lebanon.</p><p>Many in Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s supporters, say they would be open to seeing Israel withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon and demarcate the border. Few welcome a renewed aggression, suggesting diplomacy as a likely preference.</p><p>But analysts say that would require Israel to respect the agreements it enters into, including the various ceasefire deals it has <a href=\"/news/2025/2/9/heres-how-israel-is-repeatedly-violating-the-lebanon-ceasefire\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/israel-has-violated-gaza-truce-nearly-500-times-in-44-days-killed-hundreds\">violated</a>.</p><p>“What we’ve seen since the ceasefire is that Israel speaks more loudly with actions than words,” Wood said. “Opponents [of negotiations] can point to Israel’s behaviour in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza, and say Israel is not bound by its own agreements.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Two of the officials said covert operations would likely be the first step in this “new action” against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>This was less than shocking news given that more than a month ago, US President Donald Trump himself announced that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela – a rather unique approach since one does not normally broadcast actions that are supposed to be, um, secret.</p><p>Anyway, it’s no secret that the US has been overseeing a massive military build-up in the region with about 15,000 US troops currently stationed there under the guise of fighting “narcoterrorism”. Since early September, Trump has also presided over wanton extrajudicial executions in the Caribbean Sea, repeatedly ordering the bombing of what he claims are drug-trafficking boats.</p><p>In addition to violating both international and US law, the strikes have produced little to show for themselves beyond terrorising local fishermen.</p><p>To be sure, the US has never met a <a href=\"/opinions/2021/6/17/as-the-drug-war-turns-50-the-us-is-still-public-enemy-number-one\">“war on drugs” it didn’t love</a>, given the convenient opportunities the whole drug-war narrative offers for wreaking havoc worldwide, militarising the Western Hemisphere, <a href=\"/opinions/2023/5/21/fentanyl-the-new-face-of-the-us-war-on-the-poor\">criminalising poor Americans</a> and all sorts of other good stuff.</p><p>Never mind that US financial institutions have for decades reaped profits from the international drug trade – or that “The CIA Drug Connection Is as Old as the Agency,” as an article on The New York Times website <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/03/opinion/IHT-the-cia-drug-connectionis-as-old-as-the-agency.html\">puts it</a>.</p><p>It should come as no surprise by now that the president who campaigned on keeping the US out of wars and then promptly <a href=\"/opinions/2025/7/2/did-god-want-trump-to-bomb-iran\">bombed Iran</a> has now found another conflict in which to embroil the country. And as is par for the course in US imperial belligerence, the rationale for aggression against Venezuela doesn’t hold water.</p><p>For example, the Trump administration has strived to pin the blame for the fentanyl crisis in the US on Maduro. But there’s a slight problem – which is that Venezuela doesn’t even produce the synthetic opioid in question.</p><p>As NBC News and other hardly radical outlets have pointed out, Venezuelan drug cartels are focused on exporting cocaine to Europe, not fentanyl to the US.</p><p>Nevertheless, on November 13, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth – pardon, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, as per <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/us-department-of-defense-to-be-renamed-department-of-war-report\">administrative rebranding</a> – took to X to <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430\">assure</a> his audience that the massive US military build-up off the Venezuelan coast is a mission that “defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people”.</p><p>This is the same administration, of course, that was just <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/10/the-government-shutdown-has-escalated-the-us-war-on-the-poor\">threatening to starve</a> impoverished Americans by withholding essential food assistance, which suggests that the wellbeing of “our people” isn’t really of utmost concern.</p><p>Consider also the fact that Trump slashed federal funding for gun violence prevention programmes in a country where <a href=\"/opinions/2022/7/31/us-gun-violence-capitalism-is-the-culprit\">mass shootings</a> have become a way of life. Obviously, <a href=\"/opinions/2022/5/26/the-american-nightmare\">massacres in elementary schools</a> are “killing our people” in a way that has nothing whatsoever to do with Venezuela.</p><p>But it’s so much more fun to blame Maduro for everything, right?</p><p>Poverty itself is a major killer in America – as is the domestic pharmaceutical industry (speaking of opioids). However, none of these full-blown crises has merited a remotely gung-ho response from the valiant defenders of the Homeland.</p><p>Like his predecessor <a href=\"/opinions/2014/3/4/remembering-hugo-chavez\">Hugo Chavez</a>, Maduro has long been a thorn in the side of US empire – hence the current campaign to discredit him as a “narcoterrorist” and thereby set the stage for regime change. He also happens to be a pet target of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is seen as the main architect of Washington’s war plans in Venezuela. Potentially eyeing a presidential bid in three years, Rubio is seeking to curry favour with his Florida constituency, which includes fanatically right-wing members of the Venezuelan and Cuban diasporas.</p><p>According to the Reuters report on impending “Venezuela-related operations”, two of the US officials consulted told the news agency that “the options under consideration included attempting to overthrow Maduro”. If the plans succeeds, Rubio would join the lengthy roster of US politicians who have propagated deadly havoc abroad in the interest of political gains at home.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported on Saturday that the White House had “proposed an idea for US military planes to drop leaflets over Caracas in a psychological operation” to pressure Maduro.</p><p>Sounds like a page – or a leaflet – out of the old <a href=\"/news/2005/11/23/israel-drops-leaflets-on-lebanon-town\">Israeli military playbook</a>.</p><p>And as the Trump administration barrels on with its not-so-covert plans for Venezuela, such hemispheric recklessness will secure neither the US homeland nor anyone else’s.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
