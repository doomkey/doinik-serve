As I stood by the side of the road, I felt a small hand tugging at my clothes.</p><p>I looked down and saw a little girl, no older than eight. She was barefoot, her shirt was torn, and her hair was messy and unwashed. Her eyes were beautiful, and her face showed innocence, yet exhaustion and despair clouded it.</p><p>She pleaded: “Please, please, give me just one shekel, God bless you.”</p><p>Before I gave her the money, I decided to speak with her. I knelt down and asked, “What is your name, my dear?”</p><p>She replied in a frightened voice, “My name is Nour, and I am from the north.” Her name, which means “light” in Arabic, stood in stark contrast to the darkness surrounding her.</p><p>I asked her, “Why are you asking for money, Nour?”</p><p>She looked at me hesitantly, then whispered, “I want to buy an apple… I crave one.”</p><p>In Gaza, a single apple now costs $7; before the war, a kilogramme of apples was less than a dollar.</p><p>I tried to ignore the pain rising in my chest. I thought about the circumstances we now face, where young children are forced to beg in the street just to buy an apple.</p><p>I gave Nour one shekel ($0.30), but as soon as I did, the situation worsened. A large group of children, all Nour’s age or younger, gathered around me, repeating the same request. I felt immense distress.</p><p>For more than two years, we have faced genocide. We have witnessed countless tragedies and horrors. But for me, the sight of children begging in the streets is particularly unbearable.</p><p>Before the war, Gaza was still a poor place. We used to see child beggars, but they were few, mostly roaming in a few areas. Now, they are everywhere, from the north to the south.</p><p>The genocidal war has destroyed families and livelihoods across Gaza. The carnage has orphaned more than 39,000 children, and the enormous destruction has deprived more than 80 percent of the workforce of their jobs, driving countless children into extreme poverty and forcing them to beg for survival.</p><p>But child begging is not just a result of poverty; it is a sign of a deep disintegration affecting the family, the education system, and the community. No parent sends their child to beg because they want to. The war has left many families in Gaza without options, and in many cases, there are no surviving parents to keep the children away from the streets.</p><p>Child beggars do not just lose their childhood; they also face exploitation, harsh labour, illiteracy and psychological trauma that leaves a lasting effect.</p><p>The more begging children increase in number, the more the hope for this generation diminishes. Houses can be rebuilt, infrastructure can be restored, but a young generation that is deprived of education and hope for the future cannot be rehabilitated.</p><p>The strength Gaza possessed before the war was not just about military power; it was about human power, the main pillar of which was education. We had one of the highest levels of literacy in the world. The enrolment rate for primary education stood at 95 percent; for higher education, it reached 44 percent.</p><p>Education stood as a counterforce to the debilitating siege that dispossessed the people of Gaza and crippled the economy. It nourished skills and ingenuity within the young generations to help them cope with an increasingly harsh economic reality. More importantly, education gave children a sense of direction, security and pride.</p><p>The systematic attack on Gaza’s education system – the destruction of schools, universities, libraries and the killing of teachers and professors – has pushed what used to be a remarkably resilient and effective educational system to the brink. The pillar that protected children and guaranteed them a clear future is now falling apart.</p><p>After I left the Nuseirat roundabout, Nour’s eyes stayed with me. It was not just because of the pain of seeing an innocent child being forced to beg. It was also because of the realisation that this encounter brought about: That the capacity of the next generation to rebuild Gaza one day is being taken away.</p><p>The world allowed Israel to carry out genocide in Gaza for two years. It knew what was going on, and yet it chose complicity and silence. Today, it cannot erase its guilt, but it can choose to redeem itself. It can take all necessary action to save the children of Gaza and to grant them the rights they are inherently given by the Convention on the Rights of Children: The right to food, water, healthcare, a safe environment, education, and protection from violence and abuse.</p><p>Anything short of that would mean continuing support for the slow genocide of Gaza.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Those who force authorities to arrest them “may never be allowed to return,” according to a Department of Homeland Security statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The decision comes <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ethiopia-travel-advisory.html\">despite</a> the State Department’s own travel advisory for Ethiopia, which urges Americans to “reconsider” travel to the country due to “sporadic violent conflict, civil unrest, crime, communications disruptions, terrorism and kidnapping”.</p><p>The advisory, still in effect, warns that multiple regions remain off-limits and that the US embassy is “unlikely to be able to assist with departure from the country if the security situation deteriorates”.</p><p>Federal authorities justified the termination by citing peace agreements signed in recent years, including a 2022 ceasefire in Tigray and a December 2024 deal in Oromia. Analysts have also <a href=\"/news/2025/3/25/are-ethiopia-and-eritrea-on-the-brink-of-war\">warned</a> of the risk of renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p><p>The Federal Register notice acknowledged that “some sporadic and episodic violence occurs” but claimed improvements in healthcare, food security and internal displacement figures demonstrated the country’s recovery.</p><p>However, the notice also cited national interest concerns, including Ethiopian visa overstay rates that exceed the global average by more than 250 percent and unspecified national security investigations involving some TPS holders.</p><p>The Ethiopian termination is part of a broader pattern under President Donald Trump, whose administration has moved to end protections for nationals from Haiti, Venezuela, Somalia, South Sudan and other countries since returning to office.</p><p>His administration has dismissed many nations as “Third World” countries, a term largely no longer used given its pejorative impetus for developing nations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Over the past two weeks, Trump has escalated inflammatory racist attacks on Minnesota’s large Somali community in particular, including calling Somali immigrants “<a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/12/5/what-are-the-implications-of-trumps-somali-garbage-comments\">garbage</a>” and directing a surge of ICE agents into the state, alarming residents and drawing criticism.</p><p>As of March 2025, approximately 1.3 million people held TPS in the United States, according to the American Immigration Council, a Washington-based research and advocacy organisation.</p><p>Trump has identified immigration control as central to his national security strategy, with the document published this month describing migration policies in Europe and elsewhere as contributing to what they term “civilizational erasure,” a far-right theory which is has been comprehensively debunked.</p><p>The approach has drawn sharp criticism for its racial selectivity. While terminating protections for Ethiopians who fled documented armed conflict, the administration simultaneously opened a refugee resettlement programme for white South Africans of Afrikaner ethnicity, claiming “race-based discrimination”. That discrimination has been rejected by the South African government and by numbers of Afrikaners themselves.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Scott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, told Al Jazeera the contrast revealed a “perverse honesty” about the administration’s priorities.</p><p>“If you’re white and you’ve got connections you get in,” he said. “If you’re not white, forget about it.”</p><p>Legal challenges have mounted against several TPS terminations, with courts temporarily blocking some decisions.</p><p>Ethiopian TPS beneficiaries can continue working during the 60-day transition period, but after the deadline, anyone without an alternative legal status becomes subject to immediate arrest and removal.</p><p>The administration has offered what it calls a “complimentary plane ticket” and “$1,000 exit bonus” to those who depart voluntarily using a mobile app to report their departure.</p></div></div></body></html>"

from a fund meant for Indigenous communities.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Arce, who left office just a month ago, appeared before Judge Elmer Laura in a virtual hearing on Friday, two days after his arrest on the streets of La Paz.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 2 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The judge rejected appeals from Arce’s legal team for his release and ruled he must await trial in one of the capital’s largest prisons, citing the seriousness of charges that “directly affect state assets and resources allocated to vulnerable sectors”.</p><p>No trial date has been set.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The accusations centre on Arce’s time as economy minister under former President Evo Morales between 2006 and 2017, when authorities say he oversaw the diversion of approximately $700m from a state fund created to channel natural gas revenues into development projects for Indigenous peoples and peasant farmers.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Interior minister of the new right-wing government, Marco Antonio Oviedo, has described the 62-year-old former president as “the principal person responsible” for approving transfers of large sums into personal accounts

innocence during Friday’s hearing, saying he had no personal involvement in managing the fund and dismissing the case as politically motivated. “I’m a scapegoat,” he told the judge. “The accusations are politically motivated.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">His defence lawyers had requested his release on health grounds, noting his previous battle with kidney cancer.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">However, Judge Laura denied the appeal and exceeded the prosecution’s request of three months’ detention by ordering five months in a state prison rather than a juvenile facility.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The case first emerged almost a decade ago in 2015 when the Indigenous fund was shut down amid corruption allegations, but investigations stalled during the years of Movement Toward Socialism governance.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The probe was <a href=\"/news/2025/10/20/bolivia-elects-centre-right-rodrigo-paz-as-president\">revived</a> after

His vice president, Edmand Lara, celebrated Arce’s arrest on social media, declaring that “everyone who has stolen from this country will return every last cent”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Former ministers in Arce’s administration have condemned the arrest as an abuse of power and political persecution against the Movement Toward Socialism party.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">If convicted, Arce faces up to six years in prison.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Koizumi pushed back, saying the Type 03 guided missile system was purely defensive and “intended to counter aircraft and missiles invading our nation”.</p><p>Beijing views Taiwan as its own territory and has promised to unite the island with the Chinese mainland, an aspiration that Taipei says infringes on its sovereignty and that only Taiwan’s citizens can decide their future.</p><p>Both countries have since traded quarrelsome accusations, with Japan summoning China’s ambassador earlier this month over an incident in which Chinese military aircraft <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/japan-accuses-chinese-jets-of-directing-fire-control-radar-at-its-aircraft\">allegedly twice locked fire-control radar</a> onto Japanese fighter jets.</p><p>Illuminating aircraft with radar signals a potential attack that could force targeted planes to take evasive measures, making it among the most threatening actions a military aircraft can take.</p><p>For its part, the Chinese embassy denied Tokyo’s claims, saying in a statement that “China solemnly demands that Japan stop smearing and slandering, strictly restrain its frontline actions, and prevent similar incidents from happening again”.</p><p>Beijing has summoned the Japanese ambassador, <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/22/china-spat-with-japan-on-taiwan-deepens-reaches-un-whats-it-all-about\">written to the United Nations</a>, urged citizens to avoid travelling to Japan and renewed a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/china-to-suspend-imports-of-japanese-seafood-amid-diplomatic-row-reports\">ban on Japanese seafood imports</a>, while cultural events involving Japanese performers and movies <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/china-suspends-japanese-film-releases-amid-diplomatic-row-over-taiwan\">have also been hit</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
