Trump then postponed a 2019 visit to the Nordic country after Danish PM Frederiksen slammed the idea.</p><p>He has refused to rule out the use of military force to seize control, noting in March that the US would “go as far as we have to”.</p><p>Geographically part of North America, Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, lies about 2,900km (1,800 miles) from New York – closer than it is to Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital, which is situated roughly 3,500km (2,174 miles) to the east.</p><p>The semi-autonomous territory has a population of 57,000 people.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3570999\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-Greeland-1741684530.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Where is Greenland-1741684530\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"why-has-trump-sent-an-envoy-to-greenland-what-does-that-signify\">Why has Trump sent an ‘envoy’ to Greenland – what does that signify?</h2><p>On Sunday, the US president appointed Louisiana Governor Landry as special envoy to Greenland, prompting anger from Copenhagen, which summoned the US ambassador to explain the decision.</p><p>Following the announcement, Landry said it would be an honour to serve in a role meant to “make Greenland a part of the US”, further amplifying Denmark’s concerns about the White House’s intentions.</p><p>Taking to his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said Landry is aware “how essential Greenland is” for US national security.</p><p>Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defence College in Denmark, said while Trump is “clearly serious” about his interest in Greenland, it is unlikely he would try to take it by force.</p><p>“But we certainly see attempts to gain influence through other channels such as strategic investments and pushing narratives that portray Denmark as a bad partner,” Jacobsen told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The appointment of Jeff Landry as special envoy and Tom Dans as the leader of the US Arctic Research Commission should be seen as new elements in this strategy,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-have-greenlanders-responded-to-this-latest-move\">How have Greenlanders responded to this latest move?</h2><p>Lokke Rasmussen, the foreign minister of Denmark, said Trump’s appointment of Landry confirmed continued US interest in Greenland.</p><p>“However, we insist that everyone – including the US – must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he told the AFP news agency.</p><p>On Monday, Greenland’s Prime Minister Nielsen said Greenland is friendly towards Washington and that “they know there is no obstacle to the United States increasing security in the Arctic on Greenlandic territory if they wish to do so.</p><p>“But going from that to pressuring to take over a country that is populated and has its own sovereignty is not acceptable,” Nielsen told the daily Sermitsiaq.</p><p>People in Greenland broadly favour increased independence from Denmark – but not the transfer of sovereignty to the US.</p><p>In 2009, Denmark granted Greenland extensive self-governing powers, including the right to pursue independence from Denmark via a referendum.</p><p>In August, Denmark summoned the US charge d’affaires after at least three officials linked to former President Trump were spotted in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, gauging local sentiment on strengthening ties with the US.</p><p>In March, US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, were accompanied by White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright on a tour of the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/11/mapping-greenlands-resources-population-centres-and-us-military-base\">US’s Pituffik Space Base</a> in northwestern Greenland “to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with US service members”, according to a statement released by Vance’s office.</p><p>However, Greenland’s acting head of government, Mute Egede, wrote in an online post at the time that Greenland had not in fact extended any invitation for an official or private visit.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In response to Landry’s announcement, European Union Commission President ⁠Ursula von der Leyen and European Council ‍President Antonio Costa said Arctic ‍security ‍was and will remain a “key priority” for the EU, “one in which we seek to work with allies and partners”.</p><p>“Territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law. These principles ​are essential not ‌only for the European Union, but for nations around the world,” ‌they said ‌on ⁠X.</p><p>On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated France’s backing for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both Denmark and Greenland.</p><p>He said Greenland “belongs to its people” and Denmark “serves as its guarantor”.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-greenland-strategic-for-the-us\">Why is Greenland strategic for the US?</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly emphasised that the Arctic’s strategic geography – particularly Greenland’s position between North America and Europe – is key to US defence and global security interests.</p><p>Its location, offering the shortest route from North America to Europe, would give Washington leverage for its military and its ballistic missile early-warning system.</p><p>The US is also interested in placing radars in the waters that connect Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom. These waters are a gateway for Russian and Chinese ships, which the US wants to track.</p><p>The island also hosts the Pituffik Space Base, a major US military installation used for surveillance and missile warning operations.</p><h2 id=\"what-mineral-resources-does-greenland-have\">What mineral resources does Greenland have?</h2><p>Trump has denied that its mineral wealth is the real reason he is so interested in Greenland. However, it is rich in mineral resources critical for the production of modern technologies, including rare-earth elements for electronics and clean energy, as well as uranium, zinc and other base metals.</p><p>It also holds potential oil and gas deposits, though their extraction is restricted. Surveys indicate that Greenland contains a substantial share of the critical raw materials identified by the EU.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3570887\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3570887\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3570887\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-Greenlands-mineral-resources-MARCH9-20250D-1741681526.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Greenlands mineral resources-MARCH9-2025-1741681526\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3570887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"which-other-countries-are-scrambling-for-positions-in-the-arctic-and-why\">Which other countries are scrambling for positions in the Arctic and why?</h2><p>Several countries have become increasingly active in the Arctic in recent years.</p><p>Climate change and a rapidly melting ice sheet are the main reasons the Arctic has become a geopolitical hotspot.</p><p>The Arctic is heating at a rate four times faster than the global average, increasing its accessibility for maritime trade routes and resource exploration – including by non-Arctic countries as well as those with an Arctic presence.</p><p>China has deployed vessels capable of serving both military surveillance and research functions in the region. The purposes are to collect data and secure access to resources and shipping lanes, which are emerging as a result of melting ice.</p><p>Last year, Canada unveiled a 37-page security policy detailing plans to enhance its military and diplomatic presence in the Arctic, citing threats posed by increasing Russian and Chinese activity.</p><p>In recent years, Russia has expanded its naval presence, deploying missile systems and ramping up weapons testing in the Arctic.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has also noted Trump’s interest in the region.</p><p>During an address at the International Arctic Forum in the Russian city of Murmansk, the largest city within the Arctic circle, earlier this year, Putin said he believed Trump was serious about taking Greenland and that the US would continue its efforts to acquire it.</p><p>“It can look surprising only at first glance, and it would be wrong to believe that this is some sort of extravagant talk by the current US administration,” said Putin, adding that he expects the US to continue to “systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic”.</p><p>Putin also expressed concerns about Russia’s neighbours, Finland and Sweden – both of which have borders inside the Arctic circle – joining NATO, the transatlantic military alliance between North America and Europe. Finland joined NATO in 2023, and Sweden joined in 2024.</p><p>“Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernising military infrastructure,” Putin said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"could-the-us-take-greenland-by-force\">Could the US take Greenland by force?</h2><p>Jacobsen said if the US were to invade Greenland, it would mean the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p><p>Denmark and the US are founding members of NATO, a European and North American military alliance founded in 1949.</p><p>“On a personal level for Trump, it would also mean the end of any ambitions for getting a peace prize, which he has strived for so long,” Jacobsen told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“All his efforts to end the wars in Ukraine, Israel-Palestine and elsewhere would have no effect to this end.”</p><p>Jacobsen added that there are still “reasonable people in the right positions” who would pull the “handbrake on such an unreasonable idea like invading Greenland”.</p><p>“I truly don’t believe it will happen,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The PKK is labelled a “terrorist” organisation by the United States, the European Union and Turkiye.</p><p>The agreement was seen as a means of avoiding a potentially explosive confrontation between Damascus and the US-trained SDF. However, 10 months on, while the agreement has helped the two sides avoid clashes, little progress has been made.</p><p>”For there to be any progress on implementing this point, one side would have to give way … as such, the status quo prevails,” McGee added.</p><p>A point of contention seems to be between the SDF’s preferred position of incorporating their existing battalions into the Syrian armed forces with a degree of autonomy, versus Damascus’s preferred position of the individual integration of SDF fighters.</p><p>Analysts told Al Jazeera that these two positions were likely untenable and that an agreement didn’t seem imminent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Turkiye has backed Damascus and even threatened unilateral military intervention should an agreement not be reached.</p><p>“We just hope that things go through dialogue, negotiations and peacefully. We don’t want to see any need to resort to military means again. But SDF should understand the patience of the relevant actors is running out,” Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan told Turkish state media.</p><p>After a decades-long armed rebellion by the PKK, Turkiye has reached a deal with the group to disarm and lay down its weapons. Despite Fidan’s strong words, analysts said it is unlikely it would want to undermine those talks by militarily confronting the SDF.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"kurdish-self-administration\">Kurdish self-administration</h2><p>On December 8, the more than five-decade rule of the Assad regime ended, allowing millions of Syrians to return to their country amid hopes for a better future. This was particularly true in areas controlled by the SDF during Syria’s civil war; under Bashar al-Assad, Kurdish rights were restricted and many Kurds said they were treated as second-class citizens.</p><p>But during Syria’s revolution and the subsequent almost 14 years of civil war, the SDF controlled areas in the northeast – at times by force and against the will of Arab inhabitants – and was able to build a level of autonomy. Analysts said the group is hesitant to relinquish that power.</p><p>“In terms of Kurdish self-defence and ability of Kurds to make own decisions, they think they’ve now achieved something which they’ve never had before, and don’t want to give it up,” Robin Yassin-Kassab, a Syrian writer and co-author of the book Burning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said on Monday that the SDF ”showed no willingness” to integrate into the country’s central administration in Damascus.</p><p>Yet analysts say there is a deep mistrust between Damascus and the SDF and that the government could have taken some steps to build confidence.</p><p>“The government has failed to take advantage of certain opportunities to show good faith in implementing the agreement from its side,” McGee said.</p><p>He added that the government could have taken steps such as recognising Newroz as a national holiday or acknowledging the rife Kurdish statelessness that occurred under the Assad regime.</p><p>“Also, during my recent visit to Hasakah, many locals were commenting on the fact that services [such as civil documentation] that had been available to them through the Security Squares of Qamishli and Hasakah under the Assad regime are no longer in place since December last year,” McGee said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"little-progress\">Little progress</h2><p>Syria’s new administration has gained substantial international and regional backing, and that could have built its confidence in its dealings with the SDF.</p><p>The US, in particular, has grown closer to Damascus in recent months, with al-Sharaa making a historic visit to the White House and seemingly winning the approval of US President Donald Trump.</p><p>The US also trained and armed the SDF in its fight against ISIL (ISIS). But Trump’s special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, has said the US supports the SDF integrating into the Syrian state and that it would not like to see the SDF breaking away to form an autonomous entity or even a semi-autonomous region like Iraqi Kurdistan. Barrack also praised the ”reasonable options” presented by the government to the SDF.</p><p>“The US want the SDF to integrate into the new Syrian transitional government but don’t want the SDF – Damascus to descend into conflict because it will create more opportunities for ISIL to pop up in vacuums,” Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an analyst of Kurdish politics based in Erbil, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>On Friday, Reuters news agency reported that Damascus “expressed openness to the SDF reorganising its roughly 50,000 fighters into three main divisions and smaller brigades as long as it cedes some chains of command and opens its territory to other Syrian army units”.</p><p>However, officials also told Reuters a deal didn’t appear to be imminent and more talks were needed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, analysts said the March 10 deal signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi in Damascus did have a positive impact in limiting clashes.</p><p>“It is notable that there has been extremely little direct conflict between the Syrian government and self -administration since the signing of the agreement, indicating that at least the provision relating to the ‘ceasefire’ has broadly held,” McGee said. “Other provisions have clearly, however, seen little progress.”</p><p>It’s still unclear how Monday’s clashes may affect the deal, and analysts say the prospect of SDF fighters integrating into government forces before the end of 2025 is unlikely.</p><p>“The deadline is approaching fast but some officials say it’s more important to implement the agreement than focus on the deadline, so there could be an extension,” van Wilgenburg said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

How they come back to their families after the night shift, what they tell their children and, most importantly, themselves.</p><p>But I prefer the memory of a crowd of high school graduates who walked past my house in June, at dawn, after their prom night that coincided with an especially long and loud air raid.</p><p>Their laughter and happiness about the sunrise, the clouds of blossoming trees around them, the rugs of flowers and grass under their feet, and the future ahead of them made them sound immortal. It was a sound that defied Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>In recent months, blackouts have been the most inevitable part of each air raid. It feels as though keeping millions awake and horrified during the raids is only part of Moscow’s strategy of terrorising Ukraine.</p><p>Moscow’s logic appears simple: if you do not want to surrender, you will freeze. It methodically destroys power stations, transmission and central heating lines to keep millions without electricity, light and heat.</p><p>And then there are “planned outages”. There are usually three a day, lasting between two and eight hours.</p><p>You can hear an outage because even the sounds in your ears barely register, such as the fridge’s purring or the flow of hot water in the heating system, are gone. You can see an outage because the neighbourhood lights go out, making the stars in the night sky closer and brighter.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-survive-darkness\">How to survive darkness</h2><p>What saves you from darkness and disconnection is gadgets.</p><p>Apart from smartphones with energy-saving modes, wi-fi hotspots and flashlights, there are laptops, tablets, wireless speakers and vacuum cleaners running on batteries.</p><p>There are also inexpensive rechargeable lamps – I have 10 of them. Three are pint-sized and bright enough for my mother to read. Three more are motion-activated, which means she can safely use the bathroom any time, and the cat is perpetually amazed.</p><p>There is a cap lamp that makes me look like a miner and helps me cook or find something in the basement, and two tiny lamps that can be stuck into a power bank and just glow in a corner.</p><p>And there is a Christmas garland in the kitchen that makes each outage feel festive.</p><p>But the most important device, the symbolic hearth of my powerless house, is a $1,200, 20kg (40lbs) battery that can keep us warm and energised for up to 12 hours.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>I live on the outskirts of Kyiv in a remodelled summer house that has its own pump and a natural gas-powered heating system. Both need electricity, along with the two 50-litre (13-gallon) water heaters.</p><p>But boiling water and microwaving meals is too energy-consuming, so we stick to frying pans and an old-fashioned whistling kettle that scares the cat.</p><p>And when the power is back on, there is no room for procrastination.</p><p>You need to recharge all the lamps and devices, start a washing machine, wash dishes, and go out for groceries without risking your life while crossing the road with the traffic lights off.</p><p>The electricity’s comeback may be deceptive – sometimes, it’s too weak. I recently tried to microwave a bowl of soup, twice, but it remained cold.</p><p>And for extreme emergencies, I have a gasoline-fuelled generator.  It’s loud, shaky and stinky, and you need an entire canister of gas worth $30 for it to keep it going all night.</p><p>But such generators keep Ukraine running.</p><p>You can see them next to shops, offices and apartment buildings. Some are chained to trees or walls to prevent theft, and some are too huge and heavy to be carried away.</p><p>During a recent music festival celebrating Ukrainian composers, a giant diesel generator powered the concert hall.</p><p>My internet provider turns them on seconds after an outage begins, so I am online no matter what.</p><p>You also need to be prepared when you go out.</p><p>After covering the 2008 Russian war in Georgia, I used to drive everyone around me mad with my I-have-to-be-ready-for-any-emergency obsession.</p><p>Now, all of Ukraine feels the same obsession.</p><p>The phone has to be fully charged. There has to be a power bank in my backpack – along with a basic first aid kit, a lighter (I don’t smoke), extra batteries for the Dictaphone, pens and a pencil to take notes in subzero temperatures, when ballpen ink freezes.</p><p>A couple of months ago, I used the lighter at Kyiv’s Independence Square, dotted with hundreds of tiny Ukrainian flags next to photos of fallen soldiers.</p><p>I helped a man with a toddler light a tiny candle that he wanted to place next to the photo of his younger brother.</p><p>“He’s the toddler’s father,” the man said, and all I could utter was “God rest his soul” as I walked away, hiding tears and putting the lighter back.</p></div></div></body></html>"

People here feel abandoned to their sad fate.”</p><p>Fears that the conflict will not only continue, but that it could soon take on a regional dimension, are deepening, too – a sensitive prospect in a DRC where two civil wars in the past were prompted by its neighbours.</p><p>Uvira, the newly captured city the rebels then withdrew from as a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/drc-says-m23-vow-to-pull-out-of-uvira-is-a-distraction-as-forces-remain\">“trust-building measure”</a> following US pressure last week, is a major transport and economic hub in the huge South Kivu province. It’s strategically located on the border with Rwanda and is just 30 kilometres from the Burundian capital, Bujumbura. The city was the last eastern stronghold of the Congolese army and its allies – local “Wazalendo” militias and about 3,000 Burundian soldiers. Early this year, M23 also seized control of South Kivu’s capital city, Bukavu, as well as Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.</p><p>Experts say M23’s advance on Uvira widens the group’s area of control significantly, puts it at the mouth of the mineral-rich Katanga region, and positions Rwandan proxies right at Burundi’s doorstep at a time when both governments are ramping up a war of words and accusing each other of backing rebels.</p><p>Rwanda, for its part, continues to distance itself from accusations that it backs M23.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3566952\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3566952\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3566952\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-02-24T113957Z_501805205_RC22OCAXX3LP_RTRMADP_3_CONGO-SECURITY-CHILDREN-1741531651.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: A view shows the remains of a vehicle hit by heavy and light weapons during the fighting in the town that led to the fall of Goma into the hands of the M23 rebels, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, February 5, 2025.

But they collapsed after a highly anticipated meeting between the presidents of Rwanda and DRC was called off. Both sides accused each other of foiling the talks.</p><p>“There’s a sense of deja vu,” Nicodemus Minde, East Africa analyst at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), said. “It’s symbolic because we were exactly here last year … the prospects for peace are dire.”</p><p>Conflict in the DRC has long been mired in a complex mix of ethnic grievances, poor governance and interference from its much smaller neighbours. It <a href=\"/news/2024/2/21/a-guide-to-the-decades-long-conflict-in-dr-congo\">goes back</a> to the 1994 genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda, which displaced millions into neighbouring eastern DRC, making them a minority there. Rwanda has since viewed the DRC as a hiding place for Hutu genocidaires, however, and its hot pursuit of them toppled a government in Kinshasa and led to the first and second Congo wars (1996-2003). The UN also accused the Rwandan and allied Ugandan forces of looting the DRC’s vast mineral wealth, including gold, coltan and tin, during the conflict.</p><p>Scores of militias emerged as governments armed and counter-armed civilians in the wars, many of which are still active in the DRC. The M23 itself is only the latest iteration of a Tutsi militia that fought in the Congo wars, and whose fighters integrated into the DRC army. In 2012, these fighters revolted, complaining of poor treatment by the Congolese forces. Now, the M23 claims to be fighting the marginalisation of ethnic Tutsis, some of whom say they are systematically denied citizenship, among other complaints. The M23 and its allied Congo River Alliance (AFC) have not stated goals of taking Kinshasa, even though members of the group have at times threatened to advance on the capital. Officially, the rebels claim to be “liberating” eastern DRC communities.</p><p>In 2012, M23 initially emerged with enough force to take the strategic city of Goma, but was forced back within a year by Congolese forces and a special UN intervention force of troops from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi. When the M23 resurfaced in late 2021, though, it was with much more ferocity, boosted by about 4,000 Rwandan troops in addition to its own 6,000 fighters, according to the UN. Lightning and intensely bloody offensives have since seen it control vast swaths of territory, including the major cities of Goma, Bukavu – and now, Uvira.</p><p>On the map, M23 appears to be eking out a slice of Congolese territory wedged between the DRC and neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. If it gains control of the two Kivus in their entirety, it would lord over a resource-rich area five times Rwanda’s size with easy access to Kigali and Kampala.</p><p>“They are trying to create some sort of buffer zone which the neighbouring countries, particularly Rwanda but also Uganda, have an interest in controlling,” analyst Paul-Simon Handy, also of the ISS, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kigali officially denies backing M23, but justifies its actions based on accusations that the DRC supports a Hutu rebel group, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). The FDLR did exist for many years in the DRC, but it simply no longer poses a significant threat to Kigali, analyst Minde said.</p><p>Rwanda’s tensions with Burundi have similar historic correlations, as Hutus who perpetrated the 1994 genocide similarly fled there, and Kigali alleges the government continues to back rebels. In 2015, Burundi accused Rwanda of sponsoring an abortive coup in Bujumbura. Kigali denies this.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4150927\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4150927\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4150927\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251204__876B4DQ__v1__HighRes__UsRwandaDrcDiplomacyTrump_cropped-1764876353.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"drc\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4150927\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump hosts the signing ceremony of a peace deal with the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, left, and the president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Felix Tshisekedi, right, at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, DC, on December 4, 2025 [Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"does-the-us-deal-have-a-chance\">Does the US deal have a chance?</h2><p>Several African countries have attempted to help solve the crisis, militarily and diplomatically, but all have failed. The regional bloc, the East African Community, of which the DRC is a part, deployed about 6,500 Kenyan-led peacekeepers to stabilise eastern DRC, as Kenyan diplomats developed a Nairobi Peace Process in 2022 that was meant to see several rebel groups agree to a truce. The agreement collapsed only a year later, however, after Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi grew frustrated over the force’s refusal to launch offensives against M23.</p><p>Then, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which the massive DRC is also a part, deployed troops from South Africa, Tanzania and Malawi in May 2023. There was hope that the trio, which proved crucial in driving back the first M23 insurrection, would again record success. They appeared no match for the new M23, though, and withdrew this June.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Angola-led Luanda Peace Process collapsed after President Joao Lourenco stepped back in March, citing frustration with both sides amid constant finger-pointing.</p><p>Qatar and the US stepped in to broker peace in June this year, using a unique two-pronged approach. The Doha peace talks, on the one hand, have focused on negotiations between the DRC and M23, while the Washington talks focus on the DRC and the Rwanda governments. Some experts warned that Washington’s motivation – aside from President Donald Trump’s fixation on being a <a href=\"/video/fact-check/2025/8/27/trumps-diplomacy-peacemaker-or-political-prestige\">global peacemaker figure</a> – was a clause in the deal that guarantees US extraction of rare earth minerals from both countries. The agreement was unlikely to hold on that basis, rights groups said.</p><p>After a few no-shows and wobbles, the M23 finally agreed to the Doha framework on November 15. The agreement includes eight implementation protocols, including one on ceasefire monitoring and another on prisoner exchange. On <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/trump-hails-great-day-for-the-world-as-drc-rwanda-finalise-peace-deal\">December 4</a>, President Trump sat next to a smiling Paul Kagame and Tshisekedi as all three signed the US-peace deal in Washington, which mandated both Rwanda and DRC to stop supporting armed groups. There were pockets of fighting as the signatures were penned, but all was supposed to be largely peaceful from then on.</p><p>What happened in Uvira barely a week after was the opposite. The Congolese government said at least 400 people were killed and 200,000 others displaced as M23 fighters pressed on the city. Thousands more were displaced into Burundi, which already homes some 200,000 Congolese refugees. Fleeing Uvira residents shared accounts of bombed villages, summary killings and widespread sexual violence by both sides, according to medical group Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-there-hope-for-peace\">Is there hope for peace?</h2><p>Even though M23 began withdrawing from Uvira on Thursday, analysts are still scrambling to understand what the group was hoping to achieve by taking the city, shattering the peace agreements and angering Washington.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly scolded Rwanda after Uvira’s capture, saying Kigali had violated the deal. Last week, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau met with DRC Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner in Washington and promised that the US “is prepared to take action to enforce adherence” from Rwanda.</p><p>What that action looks like is unclear, but what’s certain, Minde said, was that the agreement seemed to favour Kigali more than Kinshasa.</p><p>“If you look at the agreement, the consequences [of either party breaching] were not forthright, and this points to the weakness of the deal,” he said, adding that there is much more at stake for DRC if there is a breach, including escalating conflict and mass displacement within the country. But that was not taken into account, the analyst explained.</p><p>Uvira’s fall, albeit on hold, is not only a blow to Trump’s peacemaker reputation but also sharpens tensions between Burundi and Rwanda, with analysts saying it could lead to direct clashes.</p><p>Bujumbura accuses Kigali of supporting the antigovernment Red Tabara rebels – a charge Rwanda and the rebels deny – and tensions between the two governments have led to border closures since last year. Last week, M23 announced that it captured hundreds of Burundian soldiers during the Uvira offensive.</p><p>Fears of a regional spillover also prompted the UN Security Council to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/un-security-council-urges-rwanda-to-withdraw-troops-from-eastern-dr-congo\">extend </a>the mandate of the MONUSCO peacekeeping mission for a year, ahead of its December 20 expiration. The 11,000 troop force has been in place since 1999, but has a complicated relationship with the DRC government, which says it has not done enough to protect civilians. MONUSCO forces initially <a href=\"/news/2024/1/13/un-says-all-peacekeepers-will-leave-dr-congo-by-end-of-2024\">began withdrawing</a> in 2024, but then paused that move in July amid the escalating M23 offensive. Ituri, the force’s headquarters, is held by M23, meaning the troops are unable to do much.</p><p>Amid the chaos, the finger pointing, and the political games, it’s the Congolese people who are feeling the most despair at the turn of events so close to the new year, analysts say. After more than three decades of war that has turned the green, undulating hills of eastern DRC into a perpetual battlefield, Masameko in Goma said it’s locals, more than anyone else, with the most at stake.</p><p>“People have suffered enough and need to breathe, to sleep with the certainty that they will wake up tomorrow,” he said. “[They need] to live in their homes without fear of a bomb falling on them. That is all the people in this part of the republic need.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

As a teenager reading and listening to the news before the dawn of social media, I didn’t fully understand the historical or political context, but I understood there was a need to act. A need to put an end to a humanitarian crisis. It is one of the events that ultimately led me to become a physician and work in areas of conflict and natural disasters.</p><p>In the first two weeks of December, I volunteered with an NGO providing medical care in a camp for internally displaced persons (IDP) in al-Dabba, in Sudan’s Northern State. In some ways, I have circled back to the beginning, back to the place that first incited me to action.</p><p>Over the course of the two weeks in which we were in al-Dabba, the population of the camp grew from 2,000 to more than 10,000. It felt at times like there would never be enough resources to accommodate all the newcomers. Not enough food and water. Not enough medication. Not enough latrines.</p><p>Instead, what I witnessed over and over again was the courage, generosity, and selflessness of the Sudanese people: From the IDPs themselves to the local staff of the NGO I was volunteering with.</p><p>These are the stories of some of those whom I met during the course of a day in the camp.</p><p>People like 15-year-old Fatima*. It had taken her 21 days to get to al-Dabba. She fled from el-Fasher as the Rapid Support Forces, a militia that is currently fighting the Sudanese army, advanced upon her hometown.</p><p>She was 10 weeks pregnant with her first child. She needed to be transferred to hospital for a fetal ultrasound. I asked her gently if the father of the child would be accompanying her to the hospital. She looked away. Her mother whispered to me that she had been raped. I took Fatima’s hand in mine and sat with her in silence, her tears falling onto my sleeves.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4191283\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4191283\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4191283\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251203_164927-1766479737.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='A photo of an inscription that reads \"We are all el-Fasher\" written in Arabic on the side of a tent' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4191283\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A graffiti written on a tent says “We are all el-Fasher” in Arabic, al-Dabba camp, Sudan [Courtesy of Dr Nabiha Islam]</figcaption></figure><p>Then I met Aisha, a mother of five. She had lost her husband on the long and harrowing journey from el-Fasher to al-Dabba. Her haemoglobin was extremely low and I told her I would need to transfer her to the nearest hospital for a blood transfusion. She couldn’t bear to leave her children as they were having recurrent nightmares and not sleeping well at night after losing their father.</p><p>We spent the better part of an hour trying to problem-solve with her and settled on having the children stay with their grandma while Aisha was transferred to the hospital.</p><p>Then there was Khadija. It had taken her four weeks to get to al-Dabba. In the chaos of fleeing el-Fasher, she watched her husband get shot in the back. As heart-wrenching as it was to leave without giving him a proper burial, she carried on with her three young children, fleeing on foot.</p><p>En route, there was little to eat and limited potable water. Her youngest child died from severe diarrhoea and malnutrition. She somehow managed to find the strength to cobble together enough money to hitchhike in a vehicle with her two remaining children for part of the way.</p><p>But tragedy struck again. They ended up in a motor vehicle accident. Her second child died from her injuries. Khadija arrived at al-Dabba with her eldest son – the only surviving child.</p><p>When I met her in our medical tent, Khadija was 36 weeks pregnant with her fourth child. She had a urinary tract infection, so I gave her a course of antibiotics. She thanked me profusely, kissing both my cheeks. Her gratitude made me feel all the more embarrassed that I had so little to offer someone who had been through so much. I told her she would be in my prayers.</p><p>Suddenly, she leaned in close and asked me my name. I told her my name and she repeated it, letting it roll gently off her tongue. Then she pointed at her pregnant belly and said, “This is what I will name my child.” I felt overwhelmed by what she was giving me when so much had already been taken from her.</p><p>At one point, I needed to take a break for noon prayers, so I walked over to the thatched straw home of Auntie Najwa. She had been in the IDP camp for more than a year. Her prayer mat was one of her very few possessions. But she offered it freely to anyone who needed it. Her home felt like a haven of safety. She insisted I drink tea. When I politely declined, she offered me cooked beans and lentils. Her generosity left me humbled.</p><p>And so did the courage of my translator, Ahmed. He was a member of the local staff at the NGO where I was volunteering. At the beginning of the war in 2023, Ahmed took his parents and siblings to Egypt, made sure they were safe, and then returned to Sudan to continue serving his people. I heard stories like this over and over again.</p><p>The local team in Sudan had made countless sacrifices to remain in the country and serve its people despite innumerable threats to their own personal safety. When I think about the worry and concern of my own father as he dropped me off at the airport before my flight to Sudan, I can only imagine what Ahmed’s parents feel knowing their son remains in a warzone by choice while they live in relative safety.</p><p>Sudan is experiencing the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. Yet it has received less than 35 percent of its global funding needs. One third of the population has been displaced. One in two is hungry. Many parts of the country are experiencing famine, with millions at risk of starvation.</p><p>I don’t know where the solutions lie. But I do know we, as an international community, have failed Sudan and its people over and over again.</p><p>We can do better. We must do better.</p><p>Fatima, Khadija, Aisha, Auntie Najwa, and Ahmed deserve better.</p><p>The Sudanese people deserve far better.</p><p><em>*All names have been changed to protect their identities.</em></p><p data-start=\"6919\" data-end=\"7201\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

PKK is designated as a “terrorist group” by the United States and the European Union. In March, the PKK <a href=\"/news/2025/3/1/pkk-declares-ceasefire-in-40-year-conflict-with-turkiye-kurdish-media\">announced</a> it would give up armed struggle after a <a href=\"/news/2025/2/27/jailed-pkk-leader-calls-for-end-to-decades-long-conflict-with-turkiye\">call</a> from its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan. Thousands of people were killed in the four decades of armed rebellion against the Turkish state.</p><p>Following the SANA report, the SDF said in a later statement that it had issued instructions to stop responding to attacks by Syrian government forces following de-escalation contacts.</p><p>Under a March agreement signed by the SDF and Damascus, the Kurdish-led force was to merge with the new Syrian army, but details were left vague, and implementation has stalled.</p><h2 id=\"sdf-playing-for-time\">SDF ‘playing for time’</h2><p>Syrian analyst Gamal Mansour, a lecturer in political science at the University of Toronto, told Al Jazeera that the SDF had been “playing for time” and that it was “politically inexpedient” for the group to “move the needle forward”.</p><p>Syrian forces had, however, “provoked the SDF into a kinetic movement from their strongholds of Ashrafiyah and Sheikh Maqsoud, the two neighbourhoods that they control”.</p><p>Kurdish units linked to the SDF and the Kurds’ domestic security forces retained control of the two neighbourhoods despite a disengagement agreement reached in April with the Syrian authorities.</p><p>Syria’s Ministry of Interior said on Monday that Kurdish forces attacked government personnel at joint checkpoints in the two Kurdish-majority areas.</p><p>But the SDF accused “factions affiliated with the interim government” of carrying out an attack on a checkpoint.</p><p>Both sides issued denials. The Syrian Defence Ministry denied attacking SDF positions, while the Kurdish-led force denied targeting Aleppo neighbourhoods.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"deep-fracture\">Deep fracture</h2><p class=\"p1\">Integrating the SDF into state forces would mend Syria’s deepest remaining fracture in the wake of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad’s ouster last year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Failing to do so risks an armed clash that could derail the country’s emergence from 14 years of devastating war, which killed more than 350,000 people and displaced nearly half of the country’s pre-war population of 13 million. There is a risk of potentially drawing in Turkiye, as well, which has threatened an incursion against Kurdish fighters it views as “terrorists”.</p><p>A major sticking point had been whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or whether it would be dissolved and its members individually absorbed into the new military.</p><p>Turkiye, which shares a 900km- (560-mile) border with Syria, is opposed to the SDF joining as a single unit because of the group’s links to the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/10/27/has-the-kurdish-pkk-given-up-on-its-dream-of-a-homeland\">PKK</a>.</p><p>Kurdish officials have said a preliminary agreement has been reached to allow three divisions affiliated with the SDF to integrate as units into the new army, but it is unclear how close the sides are to finalising it.</p><p>Mansour, the analyst, said time was running out. “Fidan said four days earlier that the parties in question have run out of patience, that the SDF’s manipulation of time as a strategic asset towards creating more latitude for themselves is something that cannot be withstood by Turkiye and the other parties in question,” he said.</p><p>Fidan, whose delegation also included Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, said on Monday: “Syria’s stability means Turkiye’s stability.”</p><p>He called on the SDF to “cease to be an obstacle to Syria achieving stability, unity and prosperity”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Asaad al-Shaibani, the Syrian foreign minister, accused the SDF of “systematic procrastination”.</p><p>Fidan’s delegation also met with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. According to al-Shaibani, talks also addressed “combating terrorism and preventing” a resurgence of the ISIL (ISIS) group.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
