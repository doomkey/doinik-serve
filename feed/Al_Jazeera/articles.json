And the next day, we would see upper body, chest, thoracic pattern, and then there were days we saw only head wounds, upper neck bullet wounds. And what it felt like, at least for me, the position that I went with, was that somebody behind the gun that day was going to choose the way they were either going to maim or decide to kill people,” he said.</p><p>“It was age indiscriminate.”</p><p>Yousaf’s comments are the latest by medical staff in Gaza that accuse Israeli forces and US contractors of targeted and indiscriminate violence at the GHF sites.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said last week that the GHF-run food distributions in famine-stricken Gaza have become sites of “<a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/gaza-aid-distribution-declared-orchestrated-killing-by-msf\">orchestrated killing and dehumanisation</a>“, while Human Rights Watch said the shootings amount to serious violations of international law and war crimes.</p><p>On Tuesday alone, at least 19 aid seekers were killed at GHF sites in Gaza, while many more were wounded, according to medics and witnesses.</p><p>At least 1,838 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid, and another 13,409 have been wounded since the GHF began its operations in late May, official figures show.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Israel and the GHF deny the killings.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"all-of-gaza-is-a-death-trap\">‘All of Gaza is a death trap’</h2><p>Yousaf, the US paediatrician, said the victims at the sites were mainly boys and young men, as they are often the ones taking the risk to try to get food for their families, “given the dynamic of the risk associated with trying to carry a 5-pound [2.3kg] bag of flour, maybe kilometres, sometimes”.</p><p>“The people would tell us they were sometimes at the site, or around the area, or they were trying to leave… and they were shot indiscriminately; it was like they were being sprayed. It seemed quite obvious to them and to us, from a pattern-recognition perspective, in terms of who came to the ER [emergency room], that on a given day, whoever was making the decision behind the trigger was choosing a very specific pattern of fire,” he said.</p><p>The doctor went on to describe all of Gaza as a “death trap”.</p><p>“It is a cage in which people are being marked for death. It almost feels like there is a quota for the number of people that need to be killed on a given day,” Yousaf said.</p><p>On the days that Palestinians stayed away from the GHF sites, because Israel allowed in more aid trucks, there would be more intense air attacks, he said.</p><p>“The last four days that we were there, when there was a bit more aid access via food trucks that were allowed in, the risk profile changed and them going to the food distribution sites wasn’t nearly worth the risk because there was some food elsewhere, we saw a significant uptick in bomb blasts on the streets, homes, vehicles. So the pattern of the MCIs – the mass casualty incidents – changed from bullet wounds, mostly boys and young men, to just indiscriminate bombings. We saw women and children, elderly, on the days the bombs come in,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The doctor described the Israeli atrocities in Gaza as a “genocide”.</p><p>One clear aspect of this, he said, was Israel’s refusal to let him and his colleagues take in medical supplies or baby formula.</p><p>“When we were screened by the [Israeli military] at the border, the vast majority of us had things confiscated from our bags. Things like food and multivitamins and antibiotics and medical supplies, like stethoscopes, everything you can imagine, that we wished we could have to treat the people on the ground in Gaza,” he said.</p><p>“And this resulted in a situation in which, when those patients came in, in different stages of dying, screaming in pain for their mothers… we knew that in any other environment, we could have done something for them, but in the environment of Gaza, in the death trap that is Gaza completely, we were unable to give them the aid that they deserve, to provide the human dignity and humanity that they deserve.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

sexual violence such as genital violence, prolonged forced nudity and repeated strip searches conducted in an abusive and degrading manner,” Guterres wrote.</p><p>Because Israel has denied access to

ethically diverse and globally-connected market, Elhajjar said.</p><p>Because Singapore is seen as sophisticated, efficient and forward-looking, success in the city-state “sends a powerful message”, he said.</p><p>The rise of Chinese brands has coincided with Singapore’s growing reliance on China’s economy.</p><p>China has been Singapore’s largest trading partner since 2013, with bilateral trade in goods last year reaching $170.2bn.</p><p>As Western firms scaled back or paused expansion, Chinese brands moved in, with many effectively propping up Singapore’s property sector and entrenching themselves in the country, said Alan Chong, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).</p><p>Singapore’s government has also actively courted Chinese firms amid the uncertainty from US President Donald Trump’s arrival on the geopolitical scene, Chong said.</p><p>“You see the positive image of the United States slipping quite consistently,” Chong told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The US has acted in a miserly, resentful sort of way with ongoing trade tariffs, whereas China remains a factory of the world – seen as an economic benefactor – so there will be a swing in terms of looking at China favourably.”</p><p>Chong said that Singapore has also become a virtual second home for some middle-class Chinese nationals, many of whom own property in the

analysts have observed the rise of “born-again Chinese” (BAC) – people of Chinese descent outside China, especially in Singapore and Malaysia, who embrace a strong pro-China identity, despite limited cultural or linguistic ties.</p><p>Donald Low, a lecturer at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has defined so-called BACs as those who adopt an “idealised, romanticised” idea of a China that is “inevitably rising” and “stands heroically against a hegemonic West”.</p><p>The success of Chinese brands in Singapore has not been without some pushback.</p><p>Some Singapore residents have felt alienated by stores that operate mainly in Mandarin Chinese, Elhajjar said, given that the city-state has one of the world’s largest immigrant populations, as well as large minorities of native-born Malays and Indians.</p><p>There have also been concerns raised about homegrown brands being priced out of the market by the arrival of large firms with deep pockets.</p><p>Rising rents resulted in the closure of 3,000 F&amp;B businesses in 2024, the highest number since 2005, Channel NewsAsia reported in January.</p><p>In a recent white paper, the Singapore Tenants United for Fairness, a cooperative representing more than 700 business owners, called for curbs on “new and foreign players”.</p><p>Leong Chan-Hoong, the head of the RSIS Social Cohesion Research programme, cautioned against blaming Chinese enterprises for social tensions or rising rents, describing the inroads made by some brands as part of the natural cycle of a market-driven economy.</p><p>“As a global city-state, we are always at the forefront of such transitions,” Leong told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3885262\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3885262\" class=\"wp-caption

presence of Chinese brands is simply an unremarkable part of daily life.</p><p>Ly Nguyen, a 29-year-old Vietnamese migrant working in tech sales, said she started collecting Labubu, the globally popular gremlin-like toys created by Pop Mart, after being captivated by their “ugly but fun” aesthetic.</p><p>“Labubu represents independent creativity and a newfound confidence in Chinese-designed memorabilia,” Nguyen told Al Jazeera.</p><p>For Nguyen, the popularity of Labubu dolls, which have been spotted with celebrities such as Rihanna and BLACKPINK’s Lisa, points to a generational shift in how Chinese cultural exports are viewed.</p><p>“The more familiar people become with these brands, the more likely younger generations will have a new, much more favourable perception towards China as a cultural power,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But his lawyers have argued that Barco Mercado and others in the facility have faced “crowded, squalid, and punitive conditions”. They also said they were denied access to their client after his arrest.</p><p class=\"p1\">Barco Mercado testified that the holding room was “extremely crowded” and “smelled of sewage” and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p class=\"p1\">“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said in a sworn declaration. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”</p><p>Barco Mercado has since been transferred to a facility in upstate New York.</p><p>In court filings, other detainees complained that they had no soap, toothbrushes or other hygiene products while locked in the 26 Federal building.</p><p>They also said they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and faeces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period could not use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.</p><p>A mobile phone video recorded last month showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four holding rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.</p><h2 id=\"ice-responds-to-allegations-of-ill-treatment\">ICE responds to allegations of ill treatment</h2><p>At Tuesday’s hearing, a government lawyer conceded that “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated”.</p><p class=\"p1\">“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” said Jeffrey S Oestericher, a representative for the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York.</p><p>The government also tried to downplay allegations of overcrowding at the facility and inhumane conditions.</p><p class=\"p1\">In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, the assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that 24 people were held in the building’s four holding rooms as of Monday.</p><p>That number was well below the 154-person limit imposed by the city fire marshal for the floor.</p><p>Zanello also said that each room was equipped with at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products were available, including soap, teeth cleaning wipes and feminine products.</p><p>The 26 Federal Plaza site has become a flashpoint in New York as the city contends with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigration.</p><p>The holding cells are on the 10th floor, just two floors below an immigration court. The building also houses the New York field office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other government offices.</p><p>While ICE has conducted <a href=\"/news/2025/6/7/police-protesters-clash-in-los-angeles-following-immigration-raids\">high-profile raids</a> on factories, farms and other workplaces elsewhere in the country, New York City has seen its immigration arrests largely unfold in court buildings, as migrants and asylum seekers exit their civil immigration hearings.</p><p>Critics have denounced such arrests as violations of the right to due process. They warn that, <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/6/27/why-the-trump-administration-is-targeting-immigration-courts-for-arrests\">by carrying out arrests in court</a> buildings, officials could discourage foreign nationals from pursuing lawful paths to immigration.</p><p>But in January, the Trump administration rescinded guidelines that limited immigration arrests in “sensitive locations”, court buildings generally considered to be among them.</p><p>An analysis <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/08/11/26-federal-plaza-immigration-court-trump-arrests-data-analysis/?ref=hellgatenyc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published</a> this week by local news outlet The City found that half of all court arrests nationwide in late May and early June took place in New York City.</p></div></div></body></html>"
