I know that all the questions will still be about Mo on Friday, ahead of the next game.”</p><p>Liverpool skipper van Dijk said it was an important victory for the players amid intense scrutiny and criticism.</p><p>“Winning is a good feeling, especially in the period we are in – trying to find consistency, something to build in,” the Liverpool defender told Amazon Prime.</p><p>“It was always going to be tough here. It nearly ended 0-0, but it ended positively for us.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Elsewhere in the Champions League on Tuesday, Bayern Munich’s 17-year-old midfielder Lennart Karl produced an audacious bit of skill to continue his high-scoring start to life in the Champions League in a 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chelsea were beaten in the Champions League for the first time in nearly three months as Belgium forward Charles De Ketelaere set up the equaliser and scored an 83rd-minute winner, and Atalanta came from behind to win 2-1 in Bergamo.</p><p class=\"p1\">Atletico Madrid came from behind to beat PSV Eindhoven 3-2 away on Tuesday and move up to the seventh spot in the Champions League standings, all but ensuring their progress to the knockout stages.</p><p class=\"p1\">Two headers by Jules Kounde, three minutes apart, gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory over Eintracht Frankfurt at Camp Nou.</p><p class=\"p1\">Tottenham Hotspur moved up to ninth after beating Slavia Prague 3-0 on an own goal and two penalties, and Marseille held on for a 3-2 win over Union Saint-Gilloise – whose players and fans twice celebrated what they thought were goals to level the score late on, only for both to be ruled out for narrow offsides on video review.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olympiakos broke through a determined Kairat Almaty defence to take a 1-0 win in Kazakhstan and boost their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Such designations can only be made at the federal level.</p><p>Moreover, CAIR is a domestic group with dozens of chapters across the country and hundreds of employees and contributors who are US citizens. It therefore cannot be labelled a foreign group.</p><p>“Material support to terrorism” is a serious criminal charge that would require legal proceedings, and the civil rights group has not yet faced any formal accusations.</p><p>But DeSantis’s announcement echoes a similar move taken by Texas Governor <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/cair-sues-texas-governor-over-unconstitutional-terror-designation\">Greg Abbott</a>, another Republican, last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desantis-welcomes-lawsuit\">DeSantis ‘welcomes’ lawsuit</h2><p>Founded in 1994, CAIR describes itself as the largest Muslim American civil liberties organisation. The group says it supports “free enterprise, freedom of religion and freedom of expression” and opposes all violence against civilians.</p><p>CAIR has been involved in <a href=\"/news/2019/9/5/us-judge-terrorist-watchlist-violates-constitutional-rights\">major lawsuits</a> defending Muslim civil rights, including cases that made it to the US Supreme Court.</p><p>The group has also filed legal challenges to protect the free speech of US citizens involved in advocacy for Palestinian rights.</p><p>In his executive order on Monday, DeSantis — who launched an unsuccessful <a href=\"/news/2023/5/24/us-elections-2024-who-is-the-republican-contender-ron-desantis\">bid for president</a> last year — also designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a “terrorist” group.</p><p>Israel is mentioned throughout the decree, which says that Hamas is seeking “the eradication of Jews from their historic homeland of Judea and Samaria”, another term for the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">occupied West Bank</a>, a Palestinian territory.</p><p>CAIR has long been a target for right-wing, pro-Israel advocates. The Israeli government itself has asked its Ministry of Defence to consider designating the US nonprofit as a terrorist group.</p><p>In Tuesday’s interview, Rahim criticised DeSantis for pursuing “Israel First” policies, instead of protecting US citizens who might be affiliated with CAIR.</p><p>She underscored that, in 2019, DeSantis held his first official cabinet meeting as Florida governor in Israel, a sign of his close relationship with the country.</p><p>Rahim also slammed the governor for failing to speak out about the plight of his Palestinian American constituents.</p><p>In July, Israeli settlers in the West Bank <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/the-love-he-gave-family-vows-to-keep-sayfollah-musallets-memory-alive\">beat to death</a> Florida ice cream shop worker Sayfollah Musallet, and 16-year-old Florida teen Mohammed Ibrahim was jailed by Israel for more than eight months this year without any public protest from the governor.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“What type of priorities is he showing the people of Florida when he elevates an ‘Israel First’ policy and ignores the needs of the Floridian people?” Rahim told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, Rahim told reporters that CAIR is proud to be “America First”, highlighting the patriotism of the Muslim group while questioning DeSantis’s loyalties. She said CAIR’s mission was to defend the rights enshrined in the US Constitution.</p><p>The Florida governor has said he would welcome a lawsuit against CAIR’s “terrorist” designation, arguing that a legal challenge would give the state “discovery rights to be able to subpoena” the group’s bank records.</p><p>However, if CAIR were indeed suspected of any criminal activity, state officials should be able to seek a search warrant to investigate its activities, without waiting for a lawsuit.</p><p>Rahim appeared unfazed by the prospect of having the group’s records made public. “We welcome it as well, and we will see him in the courtroom,” she told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"islamophobia-on-the-rise\">Islamophobia on the rise</h2><p>The targeting of CAIR comes amid a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/30/mamdanis-new-york-victory-sparks-islamophobic-backlash-in-us\">spike in Islamophobia</a> across the country, with politicians, including allies of President Donald Trump, sharpening their anti-Muslim rhetoric.</p><p>Earlier this year, several right-wing Congress members, including Chip Roy and Tommy Tuberville, introduced bills against the establishment of Islamic law — measures that critics consider a red herring.</p><p>Rather than addressing a real issue, rights advocates say the legislation is instead aimed at demonising the Muslim community and portraying Islam as a threat to the Constitution.</p><p>Last month, anti-Muslim activists also marched on the city of Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to a large Muslim community. There, they hurled racist insults at residents and tried to burn the Quran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Muslim American activist Ahmed Bedier, who hosts a radio show in Florida’s Tampa Bay area, said there appears to be a concerted effort by right-wing and pro-Israel advocates to paint Muslims as a threat to distract from the atrocities in Gaza.</p><p>“This definitely feels like there is a coordinated campaign to convince Americans that somehow Muslims are the real enemies — that there’s this Muslim scare: ‘The Muslims are taking over. Sharia is conquering,'” Bedier told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He added that targeting CAIR is a “political stunt masquerading as a security policy”.</p><p>So far, the federal government has not commented on DeSantis’s move against CAIR. The US State Department, which has the authority to label groups as “terrorist”, did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>But Trump himself has been intensifying his anti-immigrant rhetoric, recently calling the largely Muslim <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ilhan-omar-denounces-donald-trump-for-calling-somali-immigrants-garbage\">Somali community</a> in the US “garbage”.</p><p>As far back as 2015, when he was campaigning for his first term as president, Trump has called to ban all Muslims from entering the US.</p><p>However, during his re-election campaign last year, Trump actively courted the Muslim community, <a href=\"/news/2024/11/2/why-many-arab-voters-in-michigan-are-flocking-to-trump-ahead-of-us-election\">visiting Dearborn</a> and inviting imams to join him onstage at one of his rallies in Michigan.</p><p>On Tuesday, Rahim called on the US president to side with CAIR against DeSantis.</p><p>“Every person and every politician has a chance and an opportunity to make the right decision,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Even in this case, despite all of President Trump’s history, his remarks, his comments, his bigotry, we would invite him to study the facts and to take a position based on facts and justice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Some platforms say they will use AI tools to estimate ages based on photos, while young users may also choose to prove their age by uploading a government ID.</p><p>There is keen interest in whether Australia’s sweeping restrictions can work as regulators around the globe wrestle with the potential dangers of social media.</p><p>Malaysia has indicated that it <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/24/malaysia-says-it-will-ban-social-media-for-under-16s-from-next-year\">plans to introduce a similar ban</a> next year.</p><p>Australian Minister for Communications Anika Wells said <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/meta-starts-blocking-teens-in-australia-under-social-media-ban\">last week</a> that the European Commission, France, Denmark, Greece, Romania and New Zealand were also interested in setting a minimum age for social media.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A total of 22 declared strikes have been carried out in the Caribbean, even though they are widely considered illegal under both international and US law, since drug trafficking is a criminal activity.</p><p>The press statement by the groups says that they hope to force a disclosure from the OLC that “apparently blesses the ongoing strikes as lawful acts in an alleged ‘armed conflict’ with unspecified ‘drug cartels’”.</p><p>NYCLU staff attorney Ify Chikezie told Al Jazeera in a phone call that the lawsuit was filed after the State Department, Department of Defense, and OLC failed to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in defiance of legal requirements.</p><p>“We believe that the public has the right to see the document justifying the administration’s strikes,” said Chikezie, adding that the government is trying to evade scrutiny.</p><p>Legal experts roundly reject the administration’s claim that drug trafficking constitutes an attack on the US and that alleged traffickers are therefore unlawful combatants who can be killed with military force.

If that keeps going the way it’s going, in my opinion, many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer,” Trump said. “Their immigration policy is a disaster.”</p><p>Trump’s comments come less than a week after his administration released a National Security Strategy <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">berating Europe</a> and warning of “civilisational erasure” on the continent.</p><p>The document called for “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Asked about the possibility of interfering in Europe’s internal affairs, Trump said he is focused on governing the US. However, he did not rule out endorsing candidates and parties in European elections, akin to his support for right-wing politicians in Latin America.</p><p>Trump also confirmed that his Hungarian ally, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is seeking a US bailout, similar to the $40bn aid package that Washington handed to the government of Argentinian President <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/27/argentine-assets-cheer-milei-partys-election-victory-with-massive-rally\">Javier Milei</a>.</p><p>But the US president denied Orban’s claim that an assistance deal <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/9/hungarian-leader-orban-says-he-secured-financial-shield-from-trump\">has been secured</a>.</p><p>It may be difficult for the US to empower allies beyond Hungary. Many European far-right parties that echo Trump’s rhetoric have been shunned in their own countries.</p><p>In Germany, for example, groups across the political spectrum have vowed not to include the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/2/german-security-service-designates-far-right-afd-as-extremist\">hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party</a> in any governing coalition.</p><p>In 2017, during his first term, Trump sparked a diplomatic crisis with the United Kingdom when he shared fake videos from a British far-right leader that purported to paint Muslim immigrants as violent.</p><p>Then-UK Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2017/11/30/trump-attacks-may-defends-britain-first-tweets\">Theresa May</a> called the posts “wrong”, and several politicians condemned the US president.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump renewed his attacks on one of his most frequent political targets – London’s Mayor <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/9/23/un-general-assembly-2025-live-day-one\">Sadiq Khan</a>.</p><p>The US president questioned Khan’s ideology and suggested that the mayor, a Muslim, was elected by immigrants, echoing the “great replacement” <a href=\"/news/2022/5/18/great-replacement-the-conspiracy-theory-stoking-racist-violence\">conspiracy theory</a> that alleges an unfounded plot to replace white voters with newcomers.</p><p>“If you take a look at London, you have a mayor named Khan. He’s a horrible mayor. He’s an incompetent mayor, but he’s a horrible, vicious, disgusting mayor,” Trump said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Although the UK has been adopting restrictive immigration laws, Trump claimed that it is “allowing people just to come in, unchecked, unvetted”.</p><p>“Look at the mayor of London. He’s a disaster. He’s a disaster,” Trump said. “He’s got a totally different ideology of what he’s supposed to have. And he gets elected because so many people have come in, and they vote for him.”</p><p>Trump also attacked Khan during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September, suggesting that the London mayor adopted Islamic law in the city.</p><p>The US president’s rhetoric against Khan and Europe has been met with a muted response over the past weeks.</p><p>UK Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/is-keir-starmer-facing-a-plot-to-depose-him-as-uk-prime-minister\">Keir Starmer</a> has only defended and voiced support for Khan – his Labour Party ally – without condemning or directly criticising Trump.</p><p>In his Politico interview, Trump also decried the state of Paris – a major destination for US tourists – as well as Sweden, saying that the Nordic country is now “very unsafe”.</p><p>Sweden, home to around 10.6 million people, had 92 homicides last year – far less than half of the 250 murders recorded in the US city of Memphis, which has a population of less than 630,000 people.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its brutality has deepened the conflict and destabilized the region, creating the conditions for terrorist groups to grow,” Treasury official John K Hurley said in a statement.</p><p>The conflict, the Treasury added, “has provoked the world’s worst ongoing humanitarian crisis”.</p><p>Fighting has raged in Sudan since the outbreak of war in April 2023, and more than 12.4 million people have been forced from their homes, contributing to displacement both within the country’s borders and in surrounding areas. More than 3.3 million people have fled Sudan as refugees.</p><p>Just this week, a United Nations committee called for an end to the hostilities, citing a long list of human rights abuses committed by the RSF and its allies.</p><p>They include ethnically motivated killings, torture, the targeting of humanitarian workers and the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.</p><p>On January 7, the US Department of State <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/genocide-determination-in-sudan-and-imposing-accountability-measures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> it had determined the RSF had committed genocide against ethnic groups in Sudan as part of its armed campaign, though it also highlighted abuses on both sides of the conflict.</p><p>Tuesday’s Treasury statement references that genocide determination and adds that the fighting threatens US interests in Africa.</p><p>“The civil war in Sudan risks destabilizing the region and making the country a safe haven for those who threaten the United States,” the statement reads.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"more-than-300-colombian-recruits\">More than 300 Colombian recruits</h2><p>While the Treasury has sanctioned RSF leaders and organisations in the past, Tuesday’s economic penalties shine a spotlight on the role Colombian nationals have played in the fighting.</p><p>According to the US government, hundreds of Colombian military veterans have flown to Sudan since September 2024, in order to intervene on the RSF’s behalf.</p><p>Many start by training RSF fighters, including child soldiers. They also provide RSF forces with information about operating drones, artillery and military-style vehicles.</p><p>In addition, the US Treasury has accused Colombian nationals of engaging in the fighting firsthand, including during the 18-month siege on <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/10/29/satellite-images-reveal-mass-killing-sites-in-sudans-el-fasher-city\">el-Fasher</a>, the capital of the North Sudan state and a city the RSF seized in October.</p><p>“Colombian fighters have participated in numerous battles across Sudan, including in its capital, Khartoum, as well as Omdurman, Kordofan, and El Fasher,” the Treasury’s statement reads.</p><p>“The presence of Colombian fighters in Sudan would not be possible without the assistance of numerous individuals and companies, mostly from Colombia.”</p><p>In a September letter to the UN Security Council, a representative of Sudan’s government estimated that between 350 to 380 Colombian mercenaries have arrived in the African country to participate in the fighting. Most of them, he said, were “retired soldiers and officers of the Colombian Army”.</p><p>Colombia has gained a reputation as an international marketplace for mercenaries.</p><p>Experts often point to the role of Colombia’s own internal conflict in producing out-of-work fighters. Since 1964, Colombia has been mired in fighting between multiple armed forces, including right-wing paramilitary groups, left-wing rebels, criminal networks and the country’s own military.</p><p>Accusations of human rights abuses have been rampant in that conflict as well, and at least 450,000 people have been killed, according to a government truth commission.</p><p>According to Tuesday’s statement from the US Treasury, two of the sanctioned individuals, Quijano Becerra and his wife, Oliveros Forero, run a Bogota-based employment firm called International Services Agency.</p><p>That firm, the Treasury says, holds “group chats” and “town halls” to recruit Colombian fighters for Sudan, “including drone operators, snipers, and translators”.</p><p>The organisation allegedly obscures its actions through a Panama-based company called Global Staffing, also known as Talent Bridge.</p><p>The Treasury also sanctioned Duque Botero and Muñoz Ucros for running another Bogota-based employment company with similar aims.</p><p>That company, called Maine Global Corp, allegedly hires Colombians and works with Global Staffing to convert currency in order to ensure the fighters’ payments. A fourth company, Comercializadora San Bendito, was accused of facilitating the wire transfers.</p><p>From 2024 to 2025, the Treasury estimated the payments processed amounted to “millions of US dollars”. All four companies mentioned in the Treasury’s statement faced sanctions, alongside their leaders.</p><p>Sanctions freeze any assets individuals or groups may have in the US. They also make it illegal for US-based entities to do business with the designated individuals.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The court’s conservative members have argued that political spending is a constitutionally protected form of free speech.</p><p>In 2010, the court reshaped the country’s campaign finance landscape with the landmark ruling Citizens United v Federal Election Commission that struck down previous limits on individual expenditures. Corporations and donors rushed to take advantage, leading to a considerable increase in campaign spending.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the transparency watchdog Open Secrets, spending by super PACS, or a kind of political action committee that can raise unlimited funds from donors, corporations, and other groups, rose from $62.6m in 2010, the year of the ruling, to $622.7m two years later. By 2024, the figure had exploded to $4.1bn.</p><p>The court has continued to chip away at limits in a series of additional rulings since Citizens United.</p><p>“The coordinated party spending limits are at war with this court’s recent First Amendment cases,” Noel Francisco, a lawyer for the Republican challengers, told the justices.</p><p>Some of the court’s liberal justices noted the surge in <a href=\"/news/2024/10/9/harris-campaign-hits-1bn-in-fundraising-reports\">political spending</a> that has accompanied previous decisions on campaign finance.</p><p>“Once we take off coordinated expenditure limits, then what’s left?” asked Justice Sonya Sotomayor. “What’s left is nothing. No control whatsoever.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The case before the court was brought by two Republican committees for House and Senate candidates, and was first filed in Ohio in 2022 when a pair of Ohio Republicans, Steve Chabot and current Vice President <a href=\"/news/2024/7/15/who-is-jd-vance-trumps-pick-for-us-vice-president\">JD Vance</a>, were running for Senate.</p><p>The Trump administration has joined the request to strike down a prior federal election law intended to prevent arrangements in which wealthy donors circumvent limits on individual spending by directing those sums to a party, with the understanding that it will be spent in support of a particular candidate.</p><p>“More speech,” Francisco told Sotomayor in response to her concerns, “is always better than less.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

An ally quoted by the FT rejected claims that opposition from regional governments had forced him out of Trump’s planned “peace board”, insisting discussions were ongoing.</p><p>Another source said Blair could still return in “a different capacity”, noting he is favoured by both Washington and Tel Aviv.</p><p>Trump’s Gaza plan led to a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with Israeli forces continuing attacks across the besieged territory. At least 377 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire took effect in October, according to Gaza authorities. More than 70,000 people have been killed since Israel launched its genocidal war against the Palestinian people in Gaza in October 2023, according to Gaza health authorities.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Arrests were made without warrants, over a neighbour’s grudge, a relative’s rumour, or a bribe.</p><p>In the days after the regime’s collapse, some Syrians celebrated. Others ran to the prisons. At Sednaya Prison, people grabbed whatever documents they could, as papers were trampled into the ground and crucial evidence disappeared underfoot. Families searched for loved ones, even beneath the floors - what they found were ropes, chains, and electric cables.</p><p>Only a few families were reunited after al-Assad’s fall.</p><p>For the rest, grief and hope coexist as the whereabouts of the disappeared remain unknown.</p><p>The new government, led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has pledged to uncover the truth. In May 2025, decrees created the National Commission for the Missing and the National Commission for Transitional Justice. Advisory boards have been appointed, and legislation is being drafted.</p><p>But progress is slow in a nation stripped of laboratories, specialists, and funds.

Each set of remains is boxed and sent to an identification centre. There, the process stops. The boxes of bones stay sealed. According to the White Helmets, no family has been reunited with the remains of the disappeared.</p><p>Officials and humanitarian workers say that without DNA laboratories, forensic specialists, or a functioning identification system, the bones can only be stored, even when families are sure they know who they are.</p><p>On November 5, the National Commission for the Missing signed a cooperation agreement with the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP), the Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria (IIMP), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p><p>Officials say these institutions will investigate past crimes, build a national database of the missing, support families, and, eventually, identify and return remains.</p><p>The cooperation agreement was billed as the start of a comprehensive national process for truth and justice, committing all parties to share expertise and help build the backbone of an identification system.</p><p>The task is vast. There are no reliable official figures; estimates of the disappeared range from 120,000 to 300,000 people, numbers compiled from various sources without a unified database.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Before anyone can be identified, the state must gather what already exists – detention registers, civil documents, military files, and lists held by opposition groups and by survivor associations like the Caesar Families, Families for Freedom and the Sednaya Association.</p><p>Then they must collect testimonies from survivors and families, and coax information from former officials and guards who may know where people were taken or buried. All this must be uploaded into a central database that has not yet been built.</p><p>“You cannot start immediately searching, looking for answers,” says Zeina Shahla, a member of the government’s National Commission for the Missing. “You need to set up the ground.”</p><p>Right now, Syria has only a single identification centre in Damascus, set up with the ICRC, but no dedicated DNA laboratory. Offices in other cities are promised, but not yet open.</p><p>“We have huge needs – technical needs, financial needs, human resources,” Shahla says.</p><p>“Most of them are not available in Syria, especially the … scientific resources. We don't have DNA labs. We don't have the forensic labs. We don't have the doctors. So we need a lot of resources.</p><p>“And of course, this fight is too complicated because it's affecting millions of people.
