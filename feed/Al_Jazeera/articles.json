But what is humanitarianism under genocide? There must be alternatives – alternatives that demand a much bolder and more disruptive approach to humanitarianism amid such brutal political decline.”</p><p>According to the International Rescue Committee, which is among the 37 aid groups and is reportedly weighing the demands, Palestinians make up almost a fifth of all aid workers killed since records began.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It wasn’t planned – it just ended up like that. A routine deployment to Kenya saw me head to the Kenya-Somalia border in Mandera town for a drought story.</p><p>At the time, there was hardly any international news coverage on this drought in the Horn of Africa. I was not expecting anything dramatic. I was wrong. The drought is bad.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>As soon as we drove to really remote parts of Mandera County, I started seeing signs that something was wrong.</p><p>The team drove past several dry riverbeds. The camels were thin. Then, we saw the communal graveyards where dead livestock had been dumped and burned.</p><p>I spoke to a local chief in Mandera, Adan Molu Kike. He was a quiet, unassuming elderly man who went out of his way to explain to me how devastating the recent drought is.</p><p>“Our animals started dying in July last year, and they are still dying,” he told me. Then, he asked what country I had come from. I told him Zimbabwe.</p><p>“Have you seen a drought this bad in your country?” he asked me.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>We were moving with a team from the Kenya Red Cross Society. They were keen to show me more about how the drought was affecting communities.</p><p>Water was the biggest challenge. With several rivers dry, water had to be brought in every week from aid agencies. Some communities got water once a week. Others saw the water bowsers arrive twice a week.</p><p>There is usually a timetable. If you miss a delivery, that means no water until the next delivery. The water – brown in colour – also has to be shared with livestock.</p><p>I see pastoralist Mohamed Hussein dragging two containers of water he has just collected from the water bowser delivery truck. He looks tired and doesn’t look like he wants to chit-chat, but he indulges us.</p><p>“I had 100 animals, but now I have only 20 left … My crops in the field are dead,” he says.</p><p>We talk about the drought and water situation. He says three of his goats died the night before. He says it’s because of the drought.</p><p>Hussein insists on showing me the animals in his back yard. He drags one away and tosses the dead goat in a bush. I remember thinking that out here in the desert like Mandera, it’s survival of the fittest.</p><p>Yet, people can’t mourn for too long over dead livestock. He has to keep the few he has left alive or else his family goes hungry.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"from-extreme-drought-to-massive-floods\">From extreme drought to massive floods</h2><p>As journalists, we come into a country, file our reports and fly home. But some experiences stay with you. This drought story did.</p><p>I left Kenya and headed home, thinking my stint reporting on climate change stories was finished for at least a few months. I was wrong.</p><p>I got back home to learn that it’s been raining a lot. Some places in Harare, Zimbabwe, even had flash floods. I thought nothing of it – only that it was interesting coming from a very hot climate to a wet one.</p><p>Then, the next day, news started circulating about floods and very heavy rain in South Africa and Mozambique.</p><p>As journalists, we never really switch off, so I was keeping an eye on the floods in Southern Africa, but I didn’t expect to be deployed to another climate change crisis so soon.</p><p>A day or two later, the situation worsened, and I was heading to Mozambique.</p><p>Again, at the time, there wasn’t much in international media coverage about the floods in Mozambique. South Africa was getting more media attention at the time. So I had no idea of the scale of these floods.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>I landed in Mozambique and went to a neighbourhood in the capital, Maputo, that was affected by floods.</p><p>I put on my gumboots and waded through dirty, smelly floodwaters in between people’s submerged homes. I was shocked – but nothing prepared me for what I later saw elsewhere in the country.</p><p>In Marracuene, I saw a huge toll gate submerged and road signs sticking out on top of the water along a major highway. The highway was now metres deep underwater.</p><p>Then, we got Xai Xai, the capital of Gaza province in the south. Swaths of agricultural land were underwater. Parts of Xai Xai city were submerged. Restaurants, shops and businesses in the city centre sat in water.</p><p>“Now, the water must go down first, and then, we must start cleaning,” Richard Sequeira, the boat captain who was showing me the devastation, said. “There are a lot of snakes and animals around. Maybe 45 days to two months, we will be out of our houses and living like this.”</p><p>He is right. It could be weeks before the water recedes and disappears. But there could be more flooding in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>Authorities in neighbouring South Africa’s Mpumalanga province have ordered people to evacuate from flood-prone areas immediately. The dam there is full and could start releasing water.</p><p>Mozambique is downstream. That means all that water will make its way to already flooded communities. An Al Jazeera reporting team could be back here again.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He directed aid groups to leave within 48 hours.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">Koang told The Associated Press news agency on Monday that the operation aims to recapture towns recently seized by opposition forces and “re-establish law and order”.</p><p>“The country is not at war,” Information Minister Ateny Wek Ateny told reporters in Juba on Tuesday. “We are only stopping the advancement” of the opposition forces, he said.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, this came days after a senior army commander was filmed urging his troops to kill civilians and destroy property in the Jonglei offensive, drawing rebuke from the <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2026/01/1166831\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Nations</a> and others.</p><p class=\"p1\">“It is now indisputable: South Sudan has returned to war,” said Alan Boswell, the International Crisis Group’s project director for the Horn of Africa. “It is incredibly tragic for a country that only grows weaker and poorer.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Here’s what to know about the resurgence of violence in South Sudan:</p><h2 id=\"government-s-battlefield-losses\" class=\"p1\">Government’s battlefield losses</h2><p class=\"p1\">Beginning in December, a coalition of opposition forces seized a string of government outposts in central Jonglei, a region that is the homeland of the Nuer ethnic group and an opposition stronghold.</p><p class=\"p1\">Some of those forces are loyal to opposition leader <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/why-riek-machars-trial-brings-existentially-high-stakes-for-south-sudan\">Riek Machar</a>, while others consider themselves part of an ethnic Nuer militia called the White Army. White Army fighters have historically fought alongside Machar but consider themselves a distinct group.</p><p class=\"p1\">Machar, an ethnic Nuer, was made the most senior of five vice presidents under a <a href=\"/news/2025/3/7/fighting-flares-in-south-sudan-is-the-2018-peace-deal-in-danger\">2018 peace agreement</a> that ended fighting between his forces and those loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, the country’s largest group.</p><p class=\"p1\">That five-year civil war was waged largely along ethnic lines, killing an estimated 400,000 people.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3953257\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3953257\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3953257\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reuters_68c943e3-1758020579.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C510&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3953257\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Sudan President Salva Kiir [File: Tiksa Negeri/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"suspension-of-government-s-number-two\" class=\"p1\">Suspension of government’s number two</h2><p class=\"p1\">There has been a resurgence of violence in the past year, with sporadic fighting.</p><p class=\"p1\">Machar was suspended last year as South Sudan’s number two after White Army fighters overran a military garrison in the town of Nasir. He now faces <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/south-sudan-charges-vp-machar-with-treason-murder-over-military-attack\">treason</a> and other charges over that attack, which authorities allege Machar helped orchestrate. But Machar’s allies and some international observers say the charges are politically motivated. He remains under house arrest while his trial unfolds slowly in the capital, Juba.</p><p class=\"p1\">Machar’s trial is widely seen as a violation of the 2018 peace agreement. Yet Kiir and his allies say the agreement is still being implemented, pointing to a faction of the opposition still in the unity government.</p><p class=\"p1\">Forces loyal to Machar have declared the agreement dead, and have since ratcheted up pressure on the army by seizing armouries and launching hit-and-run attacks on government positions. The government has relied largely on aerial bombardments to beat back a rebellion that analysts say is gaining momentum across multiple states.</p><p class=\"p1\">After seizing the government outpost of Pajut in Jonglei on January 16, opposition forces threatened to advance towards Juba. The government has responded by amassing fighters in nearby Poktap, while several thousand Ugandan soldiers defend Juba.</p><p class=\"p1\">Army chief Paul Nang gave his troops one week to “crush the rebellion” in Jonglei.</p><h2 id=\"spare-no-lives\" class=\"p1\">‘Spare no lives’</h2><p class=\"p1\">On Saturday, a day before the army announced its offensive, a senior military commander was filmed urging his forces to kill all civilians and destroy property during operations in Jonglei. It was not clear who took the video, which has been shared on social media.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Spare no lives,” General Johnson Olony told forces in Duk county, not far from Pajut. “When we arrive there, don’t spare an elderly, don’t spare a chicken, don’t spare a house or anything.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Armed groups in South Sudan, including the military, have repeatedly been implicated in civilian abuses, including sexual violence and forced recruitment.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olony’s comments were particularly aggressive and drew concern. “We are shocked, we are disturbed, we are surprised,” said Edmund Yakani, a prominent civic leader.</p><p class=\"p1\">His words showed that government troops were being “empowered to commit atrocities, to commit crimes against humanity, and, potentially, even to commit a genocide,” Yakani said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_801042\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-801042\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-801042\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3aa08f3fbdf34c5b8e682e2c0c4281aa_18.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C431&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"South Sudan's Vice President Riek Machar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-801042\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Sudan’s suspended First Vice President Riek Machar [File: Samir Bol/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p class=\"p1\">The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan expressed “grave alarm” at developments that it said “significantly heighten the risk of mass violence against civilians”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Machar’s political group said in a statement that Olony’s words were an “early indicator of genocidal intent”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Speaking to the AP, government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny called Olony’s comments “uncalled for” and “a slip of the tongue”.</p><p class=\"p1\">But he also said while it was possible that Olony was “trying to boost the morale of his forces”, his words are not indicative of government policy.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olony, appointed assistant chief of defence forces for mobilisation and disarmament a year ago, also leads a militia, known as the Agwelek, from his Shilluk tribe that agreed to integrate into the army last year.</p><p class=\"p1\">The deployment of forces to Nuer communities by Olony is contentious because of a separate rivalry between the Shilluk and Nuer communities. In 2022, White Army fighters razed Shilluk villages and displaced thousands of civilians before the government intervened with attack helicopters.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olony’s forces were also involved in military operations in other Nuer communities last year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Deploying him to Jonglei “is incendiary”, said Joshua Craze, an independent analyst and writer on South Sudan. “His presence in the state is a propaganda gift to the opposition in its mobilisation efforts.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The players involved are Facundo Garces, Rodrigo Holgado, Imanol Machuca, Joao Figueiredo, Gabriel Palmero, Jon Irazabal and Hector Hevel, all of whom have featured for the Harimau Malaya national team.</p><p>“This means that the 12-month suspension from all football activities imposed by FIFA on the seven players has been temporarily lifted,” the federation said in a statement. “They are now allowed to continue their careers and participate in football-related activities until CAS makes a final ruling.”</p><p>It did not say when a final ruling is expected.</p><p>Last month, FIFA overturned the results of three Malaysia matches over player ineligibility.</p><p>In its latest decision, FIFA’s disciplinary committee also changed the results of three friendlies the players had appeared in – against Cape Verde on May 29, Singapore on September 4 and Palestine on September 8, the FAM said.</p><p>“All three matches were declared lost by forfeit [score of 3-0], and FAM was sanctioned with a fine of 10,000 Swiss Francs [$13,060]. The decision remains subject to appeal,” a FIFA spokesperson said.</p><p>Malaysia had drawn 1-1 with Cape Verde and earned 2-1 and 1-0 wins over Singapore and Palestine, respectively.</p><p>The scandal had led to uproar in Malaysia, with fans and some lawmakers calling for action against the FAM and government agencies responsible for granting the players’ citizenship.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The next thing he knew, Himanshu Pal, 21, stood there, helpless, looking over the body of his colleague, rammed by a car.</p><p>His friend, Ankush, was “just 18, and just out of high school,” Pal told Al Jazeera. It was Ankush’s first day in a metropolitan city, after he came from his village in eastern Bihar, more than 1,000km (600 miles) away; he rented a cheap electric bike and signed up with Swiggy, one of India’s quick commerce giants.</p><p>Ankush packed his first order and tried to figure out how to reach the location – mandatorily within 10 minutes – when Pal held his hand and showed him the way around the app. “He was trying his best: looking at the phone, then on the road, a customer calling back; then on the phone, a traffic light, and then on the road again,” Pal recalled, from October last year.</p><p>“That was all. A car hit and left him dead at the signal.” Pal and his colleagues crowdfunded for an ambulance to take the body back to his village.</p><h2 id=\"quick-delivery-quick-death\">Quick delivery, quick death</h2><p>India’s rapid delivery services are a marvel to the rest of the world, competing to deliver everything from food to groceries and medicines to cigarettes to the country’s 430 million-strong middle class. Swiggy, where Ankush worked, and Zomato have been the dominant quick commerce platforms for more than a decade. But others have joined, too, including Zepto and Flipkart Minutes. In December 2024, Amazon entered the market with a 15-minute delivery service called Tez — which means “fast” in Hindi and Urdu.</p><p>As competition tightened, some, like Zomato’s Blinkit service, explicitly promised 10-minute deliveries, while others like Swiggy’s Instamart tried to get riders to deliver in most cases in about 10 minutes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4270436\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4270436\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4270436\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/s1-1769580759.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Screen\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4270436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Screen grab]</figcaption></figure><p>But for riders trying to beat traffic-congested and potholed roads in India’s metropolises, these top-down delivery deadlines have often served as a death trap. Riders and unions have repeatedly pointed out road accidents that often lead to deaths but are not reported as workplace fatalities. And the dangers extend well beyond crashes. Workers ride long hours outdoors in extreme heat, alongside deadly exposure to toxic air in cities like Delhi and Bengaluru. Payouts are influenced by a star-based rating system, which means that riders can’t push back against misbehaving customers.</p><p>In early January, the Indian government intervened and asked all quick commerce platforms to stop promising “10-minute deliveries” after a nationwide strike by the gig workers over dangerous working conditions.</p><p>But experts and workers toiling within India’s mammoth quick commerce engine say that the reality remains largely unchanged — the intense competition for speedy deliveries means that with or without a formal 10-minute promise, riders are under pressure to do whatever it takes to get packages to customers as fast as possible.</p><p>“The Indian middle class is literally riding on the back of the poor,” said Vandana Vasudevan, the author of OTP Please!, a 2025 book on the lives of gig workers. “They sit at home, and are extremely pampered by this rather innovative tech model,” she told Al Jazeera, “but all these privileges are coming at the cost of workers.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4248764\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4248764\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248764\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2021-07-13T111814Z_853912162_RC2KJO944EB1_RTRMADP_3_ZOMATO-IPO-1768732554.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C528&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gig worker\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4248764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Delivery workers of Zomato, an Indian food-delivery startup, check their phones as they wait to collect orders outside a restaurant in Kolkata, India, on July 13, 2021 [Rupak De Chowduri/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"rise-of-10-minute-delivery\">Rise of 10-minute delivery</h2><p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, which paved the path for digitising grocery services in India, quick commerce platforms have leveraged small “dark stores” — a warehouse exclusively meant to store goods for online shopping — in neighbourhoods to deliver thousands of products, from groceries and skincare to the latest iPhone.</p><p>As companies like Walmart’s Flipkart, Swiggy, or IPO-bound Zepto raced for even faster deliveries, they also redefined how urban India bought into the psychological appeal of instant gratification. Where many Indians previously planned and purchased, a <a href=\"https://ijsred.com/volume8/issue5/IJSRED-V8I5P142.pdf\">study</a> last year found that quick commerce had turned several of them into more impulsive buyers.</p><p>India’s gig economy, a $11.5bn market, has been ballooning: gig workers are projected to rise from 7.7 million in 2021 to 23.5 million by 2030, according to Niti Aayog, a government think tank.</p><p>In the last financial year, quick commerce platforms had a record-high year, with gross orders worth $7bn, more than double the previous year. The sector has been an investment darling, recording a staggering 142 percent compound annual growth rate from 2022.</p><p>But driving this apparent success story are two darker demographic factors, say experts. Middle-class neighbourhoods in Indian cities, while crammed together, are often segregated communities, making it easier for companies to rent a cheap warehouse near a posh locality. Meanwhile, the gap between the rich and the poor has reached a historic high, visible in everything from stagnant wages to the concentration of vast wealth. This allows companies to keep hundreds of riders idle, at every single store, waiting in line to pick the next order and race to deliver, without providing social security or minimum wages.</p><p>After the direction from officials of India’s labour ministry, quick commerce companies appear to have replaced the marketing promise of instant delivery within 10 minutes with other features like the availability of products.</p><p>But experts say that won’t change much – for the companies, or their workers.</p><p>The removal of the 10-minute delivery catchline is largely “optics-driven rather than business-altering,” Karan Taurani, executive vice president at securities firm Elara Capital, told Al Jazeera, adding that the proposition of quick commerce continues to be anchored in speed and convenience that remains structurally superior to horizontal e-commerce timelines.</p><p>A week after the government direction, platforms were often still showing a delivery time of less than 10 minutes, when Al Jazeera checked in three different cities in the national capital region, which also includes New Delhi.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4248781\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4248781\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248781\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-13T134545Z_857944782_RC2Z2S9F8FPI_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ECOMMERCE-1768732683.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C510&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gig worker\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4248781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A bird flies over a hoarding featuring an advertisement of the SoftBank-funded Blinkit, an Indian company which is offering 10-minute deliveries for groceries, in New Delhi, India, on January 20, 2022 [Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-inherent-design-problem\">‘The inherent design problem’</h2><p>Quick commerce companies maintain that the new direction would have no material impact on their business model.</p><p>Delivery riders agree.</p><p>“We deliver groceries to doorsteps, keeping our lives on [the] line every single time,” said Pal, waiting outside a dark store near a wealthy neighbourhood in Noida, just outside New Delhi, for his next order. “This instant delivery idea is so rubbish; what could one possibly need within 10 minutes?”</p><p>The riders say the problem is inherent in the design. “The system works on simple maths for us: the more orders you deliver, the more you earn,” added Pankaj Kumar, another delivery rider, hovering over Pal’s shoulder.</p><p>“If we want to earn money on these platforms, we need to ride faster – all the while, flying my bike on the wrong side [of the road] and jumping signals,” Kumar said.</p><p>However, Vasudevan, the author, said that “the government’s intervention is a welcome step that has come as a relief to some workers.”</p><p>“The 10-minute problem comes with customer expectations; once you do away with the promise, the act of speed becomes at least voluntary,” she said.</p><p>“The architecture of a faster delivery is not a wrong thing in itself,” argued Vasudevan. “But a tight deadline is an architectural imposition on the riders that became the norm, unfortunately.”</p><p>And India’s quick commerce model has little regard for its workers’ welfare, Vasudevan added.</p><p>The Indian government is also introducing new labour laws that formally recognise gig workers for the first time, propose social security benefits, including pensions and accident insurance, and plans to establish a social security fund, partly funded by companies.</p><p>But for now, those plans exist just on paper – and workers say that they learned that there’s only one way for them to be heard: through collective action.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4248772\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4248772\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248772\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-10-14T134136Z_862568660_RC2BKAAJMEI3_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-RETAIL-QUICK-COMMERCE-1768732602.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C533&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gig worker\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4248772\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Swiggy gig workers assist another worker as he parks an electric three-wheeler delivery scooter during a promotional event in Mumbai, India, on October 14, 2024 [Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"you-snooze-you-lose\">You snooze, you lose</h2><p>In the face of worsening working conditions and fluctuating wages, several workers’ groups coordinated a strike on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>Shaik Salauddin, national general secretary of the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT) that led the stoppage, told Al Jazeera that their demands from the platform companies were met with “corporate flexing power muscles, from PR games to intimidating riders”.</p><p>Salauddin, who is also part of a committee interacting with the Indian government on regulations, said that the demands included making companies’ algorithms, which dictate payouts, transparent and reliable. The workers are also asking for an end to “arbitrary blocking of workers’ IDs” and the right to organise protests.</p><p><span>Delivery riders say platforms use automated algorithms to deactivate a worker’s account, essentially firing them without notice, for a range of reasons, including lower ratings, frequent order cancellations, or customer complaints. The riders involved in protests have also faced police investigations in some cases.</span></p><p>In a statement on the strike, which sparked a fierce debate in the country on workers’ working conditions, one of the quick commerce leaders, Deepinder Goyal, who until recently headed Eternal, Zomato’s parent company, called the complaining workers “miscreants” who caused law and order problems.</p><p>The government appeared to disagree.</p><p>Welcoming the government’s intervention, Salauddin said, “Our collective voice reached the CEOs and the government; it is a win for those unionising.</p><p>“Thousands of riders logged off during peak hours in a protest for the right to life and dignity at the workplace,” said Salauddin.</p><p>But, “if the companies cheat us, then we will not sit silently,” he said, referring to the issue that the platforms are still delivering orders within 10 minutes after the government’s intervention.</p><p>Kumar, the delivery rider in Noida, said none of the riders were informed of any change by the platforms.</p><p>After the government intervention, Kumar said, the onus of riding quickly lies with them, now.</p><p>He fractured his right shoulder while delivering an order last year. Kumar said he was not provided with financial assistance in his treatment. Three days later, with a plaster on, he returned to the store, willing to ride with one hand. The manager had no problem, he said.</p><p>“If we lose a streak – of say hours in a day, days in a week – then we lose incentives,” said Kumar, standing dejected outside the dark store.</p><p>“What are we for the company? Just robots on bikes, delivering orders,” he added. “What’s for them to lose if one bike goes off the street?”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4248766\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4248766\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248766\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2021-07-13T112013Z_1150101235_RC2LJO9XD22L_RTRMADP_3_ZOMATO-IPO-1768732568.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C526&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gig worker\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4248766\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A delivery worker of Zomato, an Indian food-delivery startup, rides her bicycle along a road in Kolkata, India, on July 13, 2021 [Rupak De Chowduri/Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

That is a better track record of unity than the one displayed in 2003, when then-US President George W Bush called on member states to join his invasion of Iraq.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Spain, Britain, Poland, Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia said “yes”.</p><p>France turned the invitation down on the grounds that Trump’s board “goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question”.</p><p>Trump pointedly did not invite Denmark, a close US ally, following a diplomatic fracas in which he had threatened to seize Greenland, a Danish territory, by force.</p><p>The US leader signed the charter for his Board of Peace on January 22 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, calling it “one of the most consequential bodies ever created”.</p><p>It has come across to many of the countries invited to join it as perhaps too consequential – an attempt to supplant the United Nations, whose mandate the board is meant to be fulfilling.</p><p>Although Trump said he believed the UN should continue to exist, his recent threats suggest that he would not respect the UN Charter, which forbids the violation of borders.</p><p>That impression was strengthened by the fact that he invited Russia to the board, amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"trump-needs-a-big-win-ahead-of-midterms\">‘Trump needs a big win ahead of midterms’</h2><p>“Trump is thinking about the interior of the US. Things aren’t going well. He needs a big win ahead of the November midterms,” said Angelos Syrigos, a professor of international law at Panteion University in Athens.</p><p>The US president has spent his first year in office looking for foreign policy triumphs he can sell at home, said Syrigos, citing the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the bombing of Iran and his efforts to end the Ukraine war.</p><p>Trump has invited board members to contribute $1bn each for a lifetime membership, but has not spelled out how the money will be spent.</p><p>His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a member of the executive board.</p><p>“How will this thing function? Will Trump and his son-in-law <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/trumps-board-of-peace-appears-to-seek-wider-mandate-beyond-gaza\">administer</a> it?” asked Syrigos.</p><p>Catherine Fieschi, a political scientist and fellow at the European University Institute, believed there was a more ambitious geopolitical goal as well.</p><p>“It’s as though Trump were gathering very deliberately middle powers … to defang the potential that these powers have of working independently and making deals,” she said.</p><p>Much like Bush’s 2003 “coalition of the willing” against Iraq, Trump’s initiative has cobbled together an ensemble of countries whose common traits are difficult to discern, ranging from Vietnam and Mongolia to Turkiye and Belarus.</p><p>Fieschi believed Trump was trying to corral middle powers in order to forestall other forms of multilateralism, a pathway to power that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney outlined in his speech at Davos, which so offended Trump.</p><p>“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: [to] compete with each other for favour, or to combine to create a third path with impact,” Carney had said, encouraging countries to build “different coalitions for different issues” and to draw on “the power of legitimacy, integrity and rules”.</p><p>He decried the “rupture in the world order … and the beginning of a brutal reality where geopolitics among the great powers is not subject to any constraints”.</p><p>After the speech, Trump soon rescinded Canada’s invitation.</p><p>Countering agglomerations of power and legitimacy was Trump’s goal, Fieschi believed.</p><p>“Here you bind them into an organisation that in some ways offers a framework with Trump in it and the US in it, and implies constraints,” said Fieschi. “It’s not so much benign multilateralism as stopping the middle powers getting on with their hedging and with their capacity to have any kind of autonomy, strategic and otherwise.”</p><p>At the same time, she said, Trump was suggesting that the Board of Peace “might give them more power than they have right now in the UN”.</p><p>“Trump thinks this is like a golf club and therefore he’s going to charge a membership fee,” Fieschi said.</p><p>“If it was a reconstruction fee [for Gaza], I don’t think people would necessarily baulk at that,” she noted, adding that the fee smacked of “crass oligarchic motivation”.</p><p>The Board of Peace is called into existence by last November’s UN Security Council Resolution 2803 to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.</p><p>It is defined as “a transitional administration” meant to exist only “until such time as the Palestinian Authority (PA) has satisfactorily completed its reform program … and [can] effectively take back control of Gaza.”</p><p>Trump’s charter for the board makes no mention of Gaza, nor of the board’s limited lifespan. Instead, it broadens the board’s mandate to “areas affected or threatened by conflict”, and says it “shall dissolve at such time as the Chairman considers necessary or appropriate”.</p><p>China, which has presented itself as a harbinger of multipolarity and a challenger of the US-led world order, rejected the invitation.</p><p>“No matter how the international landscape may evolve, China will stay firmly committed to safeguarding the international system with the UN at its core,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun last week.</p><p>The UN itself appears to be offended by Trump’s scheme.</p><p>“The UN Security Council stands alone in its Charter-mandated authority to act on behalf of all Member States on matters of peace and security,” wrote UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on social media on Monday, January 26.</p><p>“No other body or ad-hoc coalition can legally require all Member States to comply with decisions on peace and security,” he wrote.</p><p>Guterres was calling for a reform that would strengthen the legitimacy of the UN Security Council by better reflecting the balance of power in the world as it is, 81 years after the body was formed. But his statement can also be read as a veiled criticism of Trump’s version of the Board of Peace.</p><p>Transparency and governance are problematic, too.</p><p>Trump is appointing himself chairman of the board, with power to overrule all members. He gets to appoint the board’s executive, and makes financial transparency optional, saying the board “may authorise the establishment of accounts as necessary.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Our border is closed – totally closed – and America is respected all over the world,” Trump said in the speech.</p><p>Trump delivered his speech amid a growing backlash to his immigration crackdown in neighbouring Minnesota, warning that a Democratic Party victory in November’s midterm elections would lead to “very bad things”.</p><p>“If we lose the midterms, you’ll lose so many of the things that we’re talking about, so many of the assets that we’re talking about, so many of the tax cuts that we’re talking about,” Trump said.</p><p>He pointed to the strong performance of the US stock market, which is at a record high, as evidence for the success of his tax cuts and tariffs. He also touted a $70m investment by farm-equipment maker Deere &amp; Co in the state of North Carolina.</p><p>“I made a lot of people rich that I don’t even like… I’ve doubled their net worth,” the president said.</p><p>Trump also rebuffed criticism that his administration had failed to properly address cost-of-living concerns, accusing Democrats of inflating the issue for political reasons.</p><p>“It’s a word that they came up with: ‘affordability’. Every time you hear the word, remember, they are the ones who caused the problem,” Trump said, falsely claiming that his administration had brought down grocery prices and had inherited the highest inflation in history.</p><p>Trump’s speech and his pitch to voters come amid signs of widespread disillusionment with his handling of the economy, one of his strongest issues in the 2024 election campaign.</p><p>In a New York Times/Siena poll released last week, just 32 percent of Americans rated the economy as better than it was a year ago.</p><p>While the US economy has outperformed the expectations of many analysts over the past year, economists say the headline figures obscure signs of weakness buried within the economic data.</p><p>Gross domestic product (GDP) grew an annualised 4.3 percent in the final quarter of 2025, the strongest performance in two years and well ahead of other advanced economies.</p><p>But much of the economic gains have gone to wealthy Americans, with the top 10 percent of earners accounting for roughly half of all spending, according to estimates by Moody’s Analytics.</p></div></div></body></html>"
