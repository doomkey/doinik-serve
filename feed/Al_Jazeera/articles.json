Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated,” the central bank said in its release announcing the decision.</p><p>Wednesday’s decision was widely expected. CME FedWatch, a tool that tracks expectations for monetary policy, forecast a more than 97 percent chance that the central bank would hold rates steady.</p><p>The tracker also expects two rate cuts in 2026, with the highest probability for the first cut occurring in June at the earliest.</p><p>“Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained low, and the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization,” the central bank said.</p><p>The decision comes amid signs of stabilisation in the US labour market. The US economy added 584,000 jobs in 2025, marking the lowest annual job growth since 2003. Payrolls rose by 64,000 jobs in October and 50,000 in December. While job growth remains weak, December’s figure represents a modest rebound from October, when the economy lost 105,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>There are indications that the labour market may cool further in the months ahead. This week, both Amazon and UPS announced tens of thousands of job cuts, some of which were driven by a push towards increasing the use of artificial intelligence in the workplace.</p><p>Another threat to the US economy and the job market comes in the form of a looming government shutdown. That can happen as early as Saturday, and depending on its duration, it could slow spending as federal workers are temporarily left without paycheques.</p><h2 id=\"political-tensions\">Political tensions</h2><p>The decision to hold interest rates steady comes despite Trump’s increased pressure on the central bank to cut rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has long stressed the Federal Reserve’s independence, and Wednesday’s decision is the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first since</a> Powell’s rebuke of a criminal Department of Justice investigation into him. The central bank chair, whose term expires in May, called the inquiry a “pretext” to pressure him.</p><p>“The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” Powell said in remarks in early January in response to a subpoena. On Wednesday, in the news conference that followed the rate decision, Powell, in response to a question on what advice would he give to his successor said, “stay out of elected politics”.</p><p>Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case examining whether Trump has the legal <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/us-supreme-court-appears-reluctant-to-let-trump-fire-feds-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">authority to remove</a> Fed Governor Lisa Cook amid allegations of mortgage fraud, a hearing that Powell attended in a more public show of support for Cook than he previously had. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had criticised Powell’s plans ahead of the hearing, calling it “political”.</p><p>In response to another question in the news conference on why he attended the court hearing, Powell said he thought it through and came to the conclusion that “that case is perhaps the most important legal case in Fed’s 113 year history and I thought about it and went.” He added that</p><p>Paul Volcker had gone to a Supreme Court hearing when he was the Fed chair in the mid 1980s “so it’s precedented and I did it”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fed Governor Stephan Miran’s term is set to expire this week. Trump picked Miran to temporarily <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/7/trump-to-nominate-loyalist-stephen-miran-to-the-federal-reserve-board\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fill the seat</a> vacated by Adriana Kugler in August while seeking a more permanent replacement.</p><p>Miran was one of two central bank governors who voted to lower interest rates alongside Christopher Waller.</p><p>The developments come as Trump searches for a new Fed chair. He has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/trump-says-anyone-who-disagrees-with-him-will-never-head-federal-reserve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explicitly called</a> for further interest rate cuts and for a chairman who shares his views.</p><p>“Anybody that disagrees with me will never be the Fed Chairman!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social in December.</p><p>The political pressure has caught the attention of global central banks as well.</p><p>“The Federal Reserve is the biggest, most important central bank in the world, and we all need it to work well. A loss of independence of the Fed would affect us all,” Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said on Wednesday. Canada’s central bank held rates steady ahead of the US central bank’s decision.</p><p>Macklem was one of the central bank heads who earlier this month issued a joint statement backing Powell. Last September, Macklem said Trump’s attempts to pressure the Fed were starting to hit markets.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flat, as is the Nasdaq, and the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.1 in midday trading.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israeli forces retrieved the body of Ran Gvili, an Israeli man, who died on October 7, 2023, from a Palestinian graveyard in northern Gaza. Israeli TV showed Israeli soldiers singing a Hebrew song at the site. Western media spoke about the importance of the operation and this “<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-retrieves-remains-last-gaza-hostage-military-says-2026-01-26/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">moment of national healing</a>”.</p><p>Here in Gaza, the Israeli operation to retrieve the body spread fear, pain and death. Israeli soldiers killed four Palestinians near the graveyard and desecrated hundreds of Palestinian graves. Hundreds of Palestinian families now have to search for and gather the remains of their loved ones, and four families have had to dig new graves.</p><p>What was presented to the rest of the world as a “standard military operation”, was in reality, a serious crime under international law. Grave desecration constitutes a violation of a key provision of the Geneva Convention, which stipulates that dead bodies and graves must be respected.</p><p>In the Palestinian context, the attack on cemeteries is yet another form of collective punishment. It sends a clear message: that the Palestinian people will be denied dignity even in death.</p><p>This is, of course, not the first time Israel has committed crimes against the Palestinian dead.</p><p>Throughout the war, Israel has been attacking, bulldozing and digging up graveyards across the Gaza Strip. By January 2024, CNN reported that at least 16 Palestinian cemeteries in Gaza had been desecrated. Israel justified its actions by claiming that Hamas was using the cemeteries for “military purposes”. Satellite imagery and footage revealed that entire cemeteries were levelled, with Israeli troops converting some into military positions.</p><p>The excuse that Palestinian graveyards are desecrated only out of military necessity does not hold, however. Palestinian burial sites in the occupied West Bank are also regularly attacked. Just earlier this month, Israeli civilians <a href=\"https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/165890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stormed</a> a Muslim cemetery in Jerusalem and destroyed graves. In January 2023, a <a href=\"/news/2023/1/4/archbishop-says-desecration-of-jerusalem-cemetery-a-hate\">Christian cemetery</a>, where a lot of senior Christian leaders were buried, was also defaced in Jerusalem.</p><p>And it is not just resting places for the dead that Israel is ravaging. Even Palestinian dead bodies themselves are a target. Last year, the Israeli army sent <a href=\"/gallery/2025/10/23/gaza-funerals-held-for-unidentified-palestinians-bodies-returned-by-israel\">hundreds of bodies</a> of Palestinians to Gaza. Many of them had clear signs of torture; others were so mutilated that they could not be recognised, forcing the local authorities to bury them in mass graves.</p><p>In other cases, the Israeli authorities have <a href=\"/features/2017/8/10/why-does-israel-keep-the-bodies-of-palestinians\">withheld</a> Palestinian dead bodies from their families as yet another form of collective punishment. Currently, Israel holds the bodies of Palestinians who died as far back as the 1967 war. In 2019, the Israeli Supreme Court officially allowed the Israeli state to hold bodies for the purpose of “<a href=\"https://www.btselem.org/routine_founded_on_violence/20191022_hcj_greenlights_holding_palestinian_bodies_as_bargaining_chips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negotiations</a>”.</p><p>All of this – the desecration, the exhumation, the mutilation, the withholding of dead Palestinians and its legalisation – is meant to wipe out the memory of the deceased and prevent their loved ones from mourning them and having closure. It is meant to punish; it is meant to humiliate. Even in death, Palestinians cannot have safety and peace.</p><p>All of these crimes against the Palestinian dead have not received even a fraction of the media attention that the burial of the dead Israeli captives released from Gaza did. The humanising stories, the extensive photoshoots, the reports on official ceremonies were not afforded to Palestinian victims, whose bodies Israel has dug out and desecrated.</p><p>There were no reports on the Palestinian families who went to the graveyard and experienced the horror of seeing the remains of the graves of their loved ones scattered. There was no global sympathy for their suffering and pain.</p><p>By now, we have seen and experienced all kinds of unimaginable crimes committed by Israel. What has made them that much worse has been the global silence about them.</p><p>It is tragic that we should have to remind the world that graves are sacred and protected spaces under international law, including Palestinian ones.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A working group was also formed, tasked with ensuring the increased flow of essential goods, particularly food.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The governors have been given authority to import goods without using foreign currency, engage in bartering and allow sailors to bring in products under simplified customs rules, according to the government-run IRNA news agency.</p><p>“In addition to importing essential goods, governors now have the authority to bring in all goods that are directly linked with the livelihoods of the people and the needs of the market in order to balance the market and prevent hoarding,” Pezeshkian was quoted as saying at the meeting.</p><p>“Through enforcing this policy, a considerable part of the pressures resulting from the cruel sanctions are neutralised,” he said in reference to harsh restrictions imposed by the US as well as United Nations sanctions <a href=\"/news/2025/9/19/un-security-council-rejects-resolution-to-extend-iran-sanctions-relief\">reimposed in September</a>, which the Iranian government blames for the economic crisis the country is going through.</p><p>But while the government resorts to focusing on the basics, nearly all of Iran’s 90 million people and all sectors of the country’s beleaguered economy continue to suffer from an unprecedented internet shutdown.</p><p>The digital blackout was imposed by the theocratic state on January 8 as nationwide protests reached a boiling point, followed by the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">killings of thousands of Iranians</a>.</p><p>The intranet set up to offer some basic services during the state-imposed shutdown is slow and has failed to shore up online businesses. Traditional shops are also struggling to bring in customers.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"economic-trouble-persists\">Economic trouble persists</h2><p>Amid a large deployment of armed security personnel, most shops are now open in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar – where the protests against the poor economic conditions started on December 28 – and other downtown business districts.</p><p>But a shopkeeper at the Grand Bazaar told Al Jazeera that business activity is a fraction of what it was several weeks ago.</p><p>“There’s not much life and energy in the markets these days,” he said on the condition of anonymity. “The worst thing is that everything is still so unpredictable. You can see that in the currency rate too.”</p><p>Iran’s rial <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/irans-currency-drops-to-record-low-against-dollar-as-tensions\">has been in freefall</a> after markets partially reopened this week, degrading trust in the national currency.</p><p>The rial hit a new all-time low of about 1.6 million per US dollar on Wednesday. Each greenback had changed hands for about 700,000 rials a year ago and about 900,000 in mid-2025.</p><p>However, Central Bank of Iran chief Abdolnasser Hemmati said at the meeting with the governors in Tehran that the currency market was “following its natural course”.</p><p>He said $2.25bn worth of foreign currency deals have in recent weeks been registered in a state-run market set up to manage imports and exports, which he described as an “acceptable and considerable figure”.</p><p>The comments from Hemmati – who was also the Central Bank chief from 2018 to 2021 and was impeached as economy minister in March – immediately drew fire from the ultraconservative Keyhan newspaper, whose editor-in-chief is directly appointed by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.</p><p>The newspaper said his comments run counter to the reality in the tumultuous currency market as well as Hemmati’s promises of price stability for essential goods when he re-emerged as the Central Bank governor last month.</p><p>While dealing with foreign pressure, Pezeshkian’s government has also been hounded by hardliners at home who have demanded immediate changes to his relatively moderate cabinet.</p><p>The infighting became so serious that the supreme leader publicly intervened, telling lawmakers in parliament and other officials during a speech last week that they are “forbidden” from “insulting” the president at a time when the country must focus on providing essential goods to the people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"subsidy-scheme\">Subsidy scheme</h2><p>For his part, Pezeshkian has kept his rhetoric focused solely on “combating corruption” through an initiative that has eliminated a subsidised currency rate used for imports of certain goods, including food.</p><p>Pezeshkian’s government argued the subsidised allocated currency was being misused by state-linked organisations. The scheme was supposed to deliver cheaper imported food, but that has not been the case.</p><p>The money freed up by the initiative has been distributed as electronic coupons among Iranians to buy food from select stores at prices set by the government.</p><p>But each citizen will get only 10 million rials per month for four months. That figure amounted to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/iran-warns-protesters-foreign-foes-as-unrest-persists\">just over $7</a> when it was announced during the protests early this month, but it is now worth closer to $6 as the fall of the national currency further erodes purchasing power.</p><p>To add insult to injury, the announcement of the subsidy scheme contributed to an abrupt tripling or quadrupling of prices for some essential goods, including cooking oil and eggs. Iran’s annual inflation rate remains untamed at nearly 50 percent and has been on a rising trajectory in recent months.</p><p>The top two state-run carmakers, which hold a large monopoly in Iran’s auto industry, have also been positioning themselves for yet another price hike as the end of the Iranian calendar year approaches in March.</p><p>One of the firms, Iran Khodro, said on Tuesday that it would increase prices by up to 60 percent while local media reported that the other, Saipa, was expected to follow suit. The government has reportedly intervened to delay or slow the price hikes.</p><p>TEDPIX, the main index of the Tehran Stock Exchange, continued its recent decline on Wednesday, losing 30,000 points to stand at 3,980,000. The index was at an all-time high of 4,500,000 last week, having made gains in early January.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He listed Venezuela’s alleged ties to Iran, Russia and Cuba.</p><p>“[Having Maduro in power] was an enormous strategic risk for the United States, not halfway around the world, not in another continent, but in the hemisphere in which we all live, and it was having dramatic impacts on us, but also on Colombia and on the Caribbean Basin and all sorts of other places,” he told lawmakers.</p><p>“It was an untenable situation, and it had to be addressed, and now the question becomes what happens moving forward,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rubio said the US had three objectives in the South American country, the culmination being “a phase of transition where we are left with a friendly, stable, prosperous Venezuela – and democratic”.</p><p>In that, Rubio defended the decision of US President Donald Trump to continue working with the government surrounding Maduro, including interim President Delcy Rodriguez, while not initially supporting an opposition takeover.</p><p>Rubio said the first objective was avoiding civil war in Venezuela and aiming to “establish direct, honest, respectful, but very direct and honest conversations with the people who today control the elements of that nation”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He said the second objection aims for “period of recovery … and that is the phase in which you want to see a normalised oil industry”.</p><p>Speaking before Rubio, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate, focused little on the wider international law implications of the Trump administration’s approach to Venezuela.</p><p>Instead, she emphasised the cost, noting that the military operation and ongoing naval blockade have been estimated by some outside analysts to cost $1bn.</p><p>“So it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?”</p><p>Senator Rand Paul, a Republican, was more direct, asking Rubio is the operation against Maduro constituted an act of war.</p><p>“We just don’t believe that this operation comes anywhere close to the constitutional definition of war,” Rubio responded, arguing that Maduro’s election in 2024 had been contested and that he had been indicted on US drug trafficking charges.</p><p>Paul, who has been a vocal advocate of passing legislation asserting congressional oversight over future actions in Venezuela, described the arguments as “empty”.</p><h2 id=\"emphasis-on-oil\">Emphasis on oil</h2><p>During his testimony, Rubio appeared to downplay the prospect of future attacks on Venezuela, even as a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers remains in effect and US military assets remain surged to the region.</p><p>“We are not postured and do not expect to take military action,” Rubio said. Still, he declined to rule out future strikes to protect US interests.</p><p>The secretary of state also laid out plans for Venezuela’s oil industry, which has been a key emphasis of the Trump administration.</p><p>He said Washington and Caracas reached an agreement that “on the oil that is sanctioned and quarantined, we will allow you to move it to market … In return, the funds from that will be deposited into an account that we will have oversight over, and you will spend that money for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.”</p><p>He called the plan a “short-term mechanism”.</p><p>“And so we have created that, we hope to do is transition to a mechanism that allows that to be sold in a normal way, a normal oil industry, not one dominated by cronies, not one dominated by graft and corruption,” Rubio added.</p><p>He further hailed a law passed by Venezuela’s legislature that allows for more international access to the country’s oil industry.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly appealed for more access for US companies in the wake of Maduro’s abduction.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Also writing at the time, the UK’s former Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticised Israel’s tactics of siege and starvation, describing the conditions that Israel had imposed upon northern Gaza as “dire” and urging for aid to be allowed in.</p><p>Responding to the news of Corsight’s involvement in the UK police scheme, Amnesty International’s UK Crisis Response Manager, Kristyan Benedict, said, “The UK government has clear legal obligations to help prevent and punish genocide and is still scandalously failing to meet its responsibilities.”</p><p>“The government must ban investments in companies and financial institutions contributing to maintaining Israel’s genocide, unlawful occupation, and system of apartheid, including companies involved in weapons production, surveillance, and policing equipment or technology,” Benedict added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch criticised the UK’s wider push to incorporate facial recognition technology into policing, calling it “sacrificing human rights on a countrywide scale”.</p><p>“It’s mass violation of privacy and non-discrimination rights, and also puts at risk the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly,” said Anna Bacciarelli, Senior AI Researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Meanwhile private tech companies will benefit from the UK’s increased mass surveillance.”</p><p>“Surveillance and profiling tech used in law enforcement is often developed and tested on the battlefield, and it’s vital that UK government agencies conduct human rights due diligence in their procurement processes to ensure that the companies and products have not caused or contributed to human rights abuses,” Bacciarelli added. “Taxpayer money should not be spent contracting companies that are facilitating human rights abuses anywhere.”</p><p>Al Jazeera has written to the UK home secretary to ask what, if any, due diligence was carried out in selecting partners for their rollout of facial recognition technology, but has yet to receive a response.</p><p>Questioned by Al Jazeera, a Home Office Spokesperson declined to comment on what they described as “operational matters”. Numerous attempts to contact Corsight and Digital Barriers have also gone unanswered.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Their ties go back to the Cold War when the Soviet Union provided extensive military and other types of support to the Baathist regime in Damascus, led first by Hafez al-Assad and then his son Bashar.</p><p>Moscow had been worried about the possibility of a “populist anti-Russia” government emerging in Damascus when Bashar al-Assad was overthrown, Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the London-based RUSI think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They feared he [al-Sharaa] would squeeze them out, but the Russians have been pleasantly surprised, even if they’ve had to downgrade their ties from before,” Ramani added.</p><h2 id=\"pragmatic-approach\">Pragmatic approach</h2><p>Al-Sharaa has taken a pragmatic approach, Ramani said, seeking to build his own relations with extra-regional powers as a hedge against possible political swings in the United States.</p><p>“The Republicans are lenient towards Syria engaging Russia as long as they keep Iran out,” Ramani said, “whereas the Democrats have been more sceptical overall and have wanted to move slower on the removal of sanctions and other issues.”</p><p>“Al-Sharaa also needs Russia, and that is why he is engaging,” he said.</p><p>Al-Sharaa played down Russia’s role in Syria’s war and sought to strike a friendlier tone during his <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/syria-seeks-to-redefine-russia-ties-al-sharaa-tells-putin-in-moscow\">first visit</a> to Moscow in October despite Russia providing refuge to Bashar al-Assad and his wife, who fled the country in December 2024 as al-Sharaa-led opposition fighters <a href=\"/news/2024/12/8/syrias-bashar-al-assad-the-president-who-lost-his-homeland\">advanced towards Damascus</a>.</p><p>Al-Sharaa has requested al-Assad’s extradition and said at an event last month that there would be justice for Syrians who were victims of the former president’s repression.</p><p>Putin will be especially eager to maintain Russia’s presence in Syria, having lost another ally this month when the US sent special forces to <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abduct</a> Venezuelan President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/remote-coercion-what-has-us-approach-been-since-abduction-of-maduro\">Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>On Tuesday, Russian Defence Minister Andrey Removich Belousov said after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart that Moscow was closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela and with Iran, which has close ties with Russia and has been facing threats of attack from the US in recent weeks.</p><p>Syria’s new leaders have reoriented the country’s foreign policy away from Russia and have said they’re seeking to build a strategic relationship with the US, which has been reciprocated by the Trump administration.</p><p>The US appeared not to follow through with warnings to the Syrian government against engaging the Kurdish-led, US-supported Syrian Democratic Forces this month but later helped broker a truce to end the <a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/syrian-army-offensive-overjoys-some-leaves-others-with-existential-fear\">fighting</a>.</p><p>A fragile ceasefire is now in place and has been largely holding.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has since backed down from this threat.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"china-s-renewed-sales-pitch\">China’s renewed sales pitch</h2><p>While China has long sought to present itself as a viable alternative to the post-war US-led international order, its sales pitch took on renewed energy at the <a href=\"/economy/2017/1/17/chinas-xi-defends-free-trade-in-speech-at-davos\">World Economic Forum</a>‘s (WEF) annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this month.</p><p>As Trump told world leaders that the US had become “the hottest country, anywhere in the world” thanks to surging investment and tariff revenues, and Europe would “do much better” to follow the US lead, Chinese Vice Premier Li Hefeng’s speech emphasised China’s ongoing support for multilateralism and free trade.</p><p>“While economic globalisation is not perfect and may cause some problems, we cannot completely reject it and retreat to self-imposed isolation,” Li said.</p><p>“The right approach should be, and can only be, to find solutions together through dialogue.”</p><p>Li also criticised the “unilateral acts and trade deals of certain countries” – a reference to Trump’s trade war – that “clearly violate the fundamental principles and principles of the [World Trade Organization] and severely impact the global economic and trade order”.</p><p>Li also told the WEF that “every country is entitled to defend its legitimate rights and interests”, a point that could be understood to apply as much to China’s claims over places like Taiwan as to Denmark’s dominion over Greenland.</p><p>“In many ways, China has chosen to cast itself in the role of a stable and responsible global actor in the midst of the disruption that we are seeing from the US. Reiterating its support for the United Nations system and global rules has often been quite enough to bolster China’s standing, especially among countries of the Global South,” Bjorn Cappelin, an analyst at the Swedish National China Centre, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"the-west-is-listening\">The West is listening</h2><p>John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told Al Jazeera that the recent series of trips by European leaders to China shows that the Global North is listening, too. Other notable signs include the UK’s approval of a Chinese “mega embassy” in London, Gong said, and progress in a years-long trade <a href=\"/economy/2024/10/30/eu-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-prompting-rebuke-from-beijing\">dispute</a> over Chinese exports of electric vehicles (EVs) to Europe.</p><p>Starmer is also expected to pursue more trade and investment deals with Beijing this week, according to UK media.</p><p>“A series of events happening in Europe seems to suggest an adjustment of Europe’s China policy – for the better, of course – against the backdrop of what is emanating from Washington against Europe,” Gong told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The shifting diplomatic calculations are also clear in Canada, which has shown a renewed willingness to deepen economic ties with China after several spats with Trump over the past year.</p><p>Carney’s is the first visit to Beijing by a Canadian prime minister since Justin Trudeau went in 2017, and he came away with a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/16/canada-china-strike-trade-deals-to-slash-tariffs-on-evs-canola\">deal</a> that saw Beijing agree to ease tariffs on Canadian agricultural exports and Ottawa to ease tariffs on Chinese EVs.</p><p>Trump lashed out at news of the deal, threatening 100 percent trade tariffs on Canada if the deal goes ahead.</p><p>In a statement last weekend on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that Carney was “sorely mistaken” if he thought Canada could become a “‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States”.</p><p>The meeting between Carney and Xi this month also thawed years of frosty relations after Canada arrested Huawei executive <a href=\"/news/2018/12/7/anger-in-china-over-arrest-of-huaweis-meng-wanzhou-in-canada\">Meng Wanzhou</a> in late 2018 at the behest of the US. Beijing subsequently arrested two Canadians in a move that was widely seen as retaliation. They were released in 2021 after Meng reached a deferred agreement with prosecutors in New York.</p><p>In Davos, Carney told world leaders that there had been a “rupture in the world order” in a clear reference to Trump, followed by remarks this week to the Canadian House of Commons that “almost nothing was normal now” in the US, according to the CBC.</p><p>Carney also said this week in a call with Trump that Ottawa should continue to diversify its trade deals with countries beyond the US, although it had no plans in place yet for a free-trade agreement with China.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271260\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271260\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271260\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-24T161140Z_1324184165_RC212JA8ZUQ0_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TARIFFS-CANADA-1769601253.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C550&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Carney Beijing\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Canadian PM Carney, left, meets President Xi in Beijing, China, on January 16, 2026 [Sean Kilpatrick/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"filling-the-void\">Filling the void</h2><p>Hanscom Smith, a former US diplomat and senior fellow at Yale’s Jackson School of International Affairs, told Al Jazeera that Beijing’s appeal could be tempered by other factors, however.</p><p>“When the United States becomes more transactional, that creates a vacuum, and it’s not clear the extent to which China or Russia, or any other power, is going to be able to fill the void. It’s not necessarily a zero-sum game,” he told Al Jazeera. “Many countries want to have a good relationship with both the United States and China, and don’t want to choose.”</p><p>One glaring concern with China, despite its offer of more reliable business dealings, is its <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/how-did-chinas-trade-surplus-hit-1-trillion\">massive global trade surplus</a>, which surged to $1.2 trillion last year.</p><p>Much of this was gained in the fallout from Trump’s trade war as China’s manufacturers – facing a slew of tariffs from the US and declining demand at home – expanded their supply chains into places like Southeast Asia and found new markets beyond the US.</p><p>China’s record trade surplus has alarmed some European leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, who, in Davos, called for more foreign direct investment from China but not its “massive excess capacities and distortive practices” in the form of export dumping.</p><p>Li tried to address such concerns head-on in his Davos speech. “We never seek trade surplus; on top of being the world’s factory, we hope to be the world’s market too. However, in many cases, when China wants to buy, others don’t want to sell. Trade issues often become security hurdles,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on January 11.</p><p>“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,” Trump added.</p><p>Trump did not elaborate on his suggested deal, but US officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks.</p><p>However, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has rejected talks. “We have always been willing to maintain serious and responsible dialogue with the various US administrations, including the current one, on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect and the principles of international law,” Diaz-Canel said.</p><h2 id=\"what-to-know-about-trump-s-growing-rhetoric-against-cuba\">What to know about Trump’s growing rhetoric against Cuba</h2><p>Following the US attack on Venezuela, the Trump administration has escalated its rhetoric against Cuba, which has been under strict US economic sanctions for decades.</p><p>Last week, the US-based Wall Street Journal reported that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/trump-seeking-regime-change-in-cuba-by-end-of-the-year-us-media-report\">Trump aims to remove Cuba’s leadership</a> and is actively seeking government insiders in Havana who are willing to make a deal with Washington to “push out the Communist regime”.</p><p>Trump on Tuesday said that Cuba is on the brink of collapse. “Cuba is really a nation that’s very close to failing,” he said during a visit to the US state of Iowa.</p><p>The US president said that Cuba no longer receives oil and money from Venezuela, a close ally of Havana since the days of former socialist President Hugo Chavez.</p><p>Last week, a Cuban diplomat based in Bogota<a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/cuban-official-accuses-us-of-piracy-against-sanctioned-caribbean-island\"> accused the US of “international piracy”</a> over Washington’s blockade of Venezuelan oil.</p><p>“The US is carrying out international piracy in the Caribbean Sea that is restricting and blocking the arrival of oil to Cuba,” Carlos de Cespedes, Cuba’s ambassador to Colombia, told Al Jazeera on Saturday, adding that Havana is facing more powerful US threats than it has in the 67 years since the revolution.</p><p>Earlier, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is of Cuban descent and is believed to orchestrate policies towards Venezuela and Cuba, has described the government in Havana as a “huge problem”.</p><p>About a week after Maduro’s abduction, Trump urged Cuba to make a deal “before it is too late,” without specifying what kind of agreement he was referring to.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump suggested Rubio could become the president of Cuba. “Sounds good to me!” he said.</p><p>Relations between Havana and Washington have been tense for decades. The ties were normalised in 2014 under former President Barack Obama, in a major foreign policy shift. But Trump, who succeeded Obama, reversed the decision and reimposed sanctions during his first term.</p><p>In 2019, Trump banned cruise ships from visiting Cuba, one of the most popular forms of travel to the island, which earns much-needed revenue from tourism.</p><p>Mexico faces its own pressure from Washington, as Trump has threatened to take military action against Mexican drug cartels. Last week, the country transferred dozens of suspected cartel members to the US amid pressure from the Trump administration.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to power in January last year, the war on drugs has been at the top of his administration’s agenda. The US said its action against Maduro was justified, based on claims that Venezuela sent drugs to the US. But Caracas is not the main source of drugs coming into US territory.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-us-policy-affected-cuba\">How has the US policy affected Cuba?</h2><p>Cuba is enduring its worst economic crisis since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, as fuel shortages have caused prolonged power cuts, water and food supply disruptions.</p><p>Analysts say the Cuban economy could collapse completely as Mexican and Venezuelan oil supplies dry up.</p><p>A total blockade on oil imports to Cuba is part of possible new tactics by the Trump administration to drive leadership change in the Caribbean country, according to the US-based Politico site.</p><p>Al Jazeera could not confirm Politico’s report.</p><p>Rising geopolitical tensions with the US have also driven tourists away from Cuba, with the number of visitors dropping by nearly 70 percent since 2018.</p><p>For decades, tourism – a source of livelihood for millions of Cubans – generated up to $3bn a year for Cuba. Some 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba last year, significantly lower than the 4.8 million in 2018 and the 4.2 million in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p><p>Havana classic car driver Aldama recalled that he would sometimes work until 9pm. Nowadays, he’s lucky if he takes one or two tourists for a spin in a day.</p><p>He used to charge $50 for a drive around the capital. Now, given the lack of demand, he has lowered his price to $25 and even $20 if a tourist insists on bartering.</p><p>“The day that we run out of fuel, we’ll stop driving and look for another job,” Aldama told The Associated Press. “There’s no other choice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
