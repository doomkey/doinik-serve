A month later, a Waymo reportedly crushed a dog.</p><p>Amid the pictures of the cat, a visitor had placed a poster that said, “save the cat, kill the car”. That’s when Zeidan knew Kit Kat, his bodega cat, had become the face of the simmering discontent over San Francisco’s growing number of self-driving cars.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Two years since it got approved to ply its driverless cars, Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, has become a part of San Francisco’s landscape.</p><p>Residents became increasingly comfortable riding one, costumed Halloween parade goers clambered on its rooftops and danced, and pedestrians occasionally banged its bonnet to get it to give way to them.</p><p>In November, Waymo got approvals for its biggest expansions so far – to ply on the Bay Area’s freeways and pick up passengers from San Jose International Airport. Waymo also started, or is about to start, services in Dallas, Houston, Orlando, Miami and Washington, DC, in the last few weeks.</p><p>But the expansion comes with heightened safety concerns and new competition. Amazon’s Zoox driverless vehicle has begun running in the Mission, too. And Zeidan says the Kit Kat incident opened pent-up resentment over the melding of the new entrants into the city’s hilly, colourful streets.</p><p>Around Kit Kat’s memorials is a poster with a barcode to sign a petition, moved by Jackie Fielder, the area’s representative to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, that autonomous vehicles should have oversight from city authorities and not just state authorities.</p><p>“Waymo is operating in something of a laissez-faire environment right now,” says California State Senator Dave Cortese, who chairs the state assembly’s transportation committee and whose district encompasses San Jose and other Silicon Valley cities where Waymo services recently began.</p><p>Currently, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) regulate the testing and approval process for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>“My sense is that Waymo’s ability to grow without legislation will not last too long. I just hope it doesn’t take a tragedy for it to happen,” says Cortese, who had also tabled a bill in the California State Assembly to bring autonomous vehicles under the ambit of local authorities, including firefighters and police.</p><p>Waymo’s website says its vehicles have been in 91 percent fewer accidents, and 92 percent less accidents involving pedestrian injuries than vehicles driven by people. Waymo did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Kit Kat, Waymo said in a statement at the time of the cat’s death, “darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away. We send our deepest sympathies to the cat’s owner and the community who knew and loved him.”</p><p>Steve Larson, a former executive director of the CPUC, says Waymo’s stellar safety record and successful rollout is at least partly because regulators “gave Waymo good advice and [the two organisations] took their time in getting things right”.</p><p>Karl Brauer, an automation writer and analyst with iSeeCars.com, says he was “sceptical” that before the end of the decade, self-driving cars would be as widespread as they are now. Better sensors and an improved ability to process information from videos have led to the success of Waymo, in particular, Brauer says.</p><p>But Waymo’s biggest expansion so far will be tested as more autonomous vehicles hit the road and Waymo itself drives further afield into uncharted territory.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4160735\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4160735\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25317007727959-1765216564.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4160735\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25317007727959-1765216564.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Waymo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4160735\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Waymo is allowed to ply on the Bay Area’s freeways and pick up passengers from San Jose International Airport [File: Godofredo A Vasquez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"no-driver-to-scream-at\">‘No driver to scream at’</h2><p>Zeidan had kept Kit Kat in his grocery store, Randa’s Market, for six years. “He recognised regular customers and followed them around,” Zeidan recalled. “They rubbed his tummy.” From his bed, Kit Kat kept an eye on the store’s entryway on busy 16th Street, with its independent movie theatre, bars and restaurants. He became known as “mayor of 16th Street”.</p><p>“I would rub his butt and his tail would go up,” recalled one regular customer, at Randa’s to buy beer on credit. “He would affectionately paw at us.”</p><p>On October 27, Zeidan got a call a little before midnight from a bartender at a neighbourhood bar saying Kit Kat had been in an accident. A Waymo had stopped outside his closed store and Kit Kat had crouched under it. A lady nearby spotted Kit Kat and called her to come out, but she didn’t. She tapped the car so it would not move.</p><p>“There was no driver to scream at,” Zeidan says. Soon, the car moved, crushing the cat underneath. On Thursday, Zeidan released security footage confirming how Kit Kat had died.</p><p>Scott Moura, professor and director of the Energy, Controls, &amp; Applications Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, says the Kit Kat accident represents a challenge for autonomous vehicle software development.</p><p>“Perception, prediction and planning are the key aspects of this software, and the bodega cat incident is indicative of perception since the car could not make out the cat was there,” Moura says.</p><p>“The hardest part, though, might be predicting what to do when it does know.”</p><p>This may have been the case with the dog, since it was said to be unleashed and may have run onto the street, according to media reports, which said the dog had died.</p><p>Waymo said in a public statement, “Unfortunately, a Waymo vehicle made contact with a small, unleashed dog in the roadway. We are dedicated to learning from this situation and how we show up for our community as we continue improving road safety in the cities we serve.”</p><h2 id=\"driving-is-social\">‘Driving is social’</h2><p>Moura expects perception and prediction issues to come up more as more autonomous vehicles come onto city streets and freeways and more cities with different weather.</p><p>Brauer of iSeeCars.com says that while Waymo has been in San Francisco and expanded mostly to warmer cities such as Dallas and Miami, being in cities with snow could clog its sensors and make perception hard. “Weather will be a big factor for Waymo sensors and its expansion plans,” he says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4151447\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4151447\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-2.43.11-AM-2-1764914212.jpeg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4151447\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-2.43.11-AM-2-1764914212.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"kitkat\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4151447\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The death of Kit Kat has revealed the pent-up anger against self-driving cars and how they are changing San Francisco’s streets [Saumya Roy/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>As for prediction, “driving is social”, Moura says, noting, “we want cars to anticipate and act accordingly”.</p><p>He has looked at what kinds of signals autonomous vehicles can give people, leading to better coordination between the two. This could include LED lights or voice announcements that the car is turning or dropping off passengers – signals that Moura found to be valuable.</p><p>This could lead self-driving cars to look and feel quite different from conventional cars. Some such unique features have been included in the Amazon-backed Zoox vehicle that is also running in a few San Francisco areas, including the Mission, since November. There is a waitlist of customers to try it. Zoox, which does not resemble a traditional car, does not have a steering wheel and can seamlessly move forward and backward.</p><p>Waymo is also adding custom-made vehicles from Zeekr, a Chinese carmaker, and Hyundai, along with its more than 1,500-car-strong fleet from Jaguar.</p><h2 id=\"cuts-to-public-transport\">Cuts to public transport</h2><p>But the entry of Zoox, along with the expansion of Waymo, has also raised concerns about the nature of San Francisco streets and the city itself.</p><p>“All the issues we’ve had will now be exacerbated,” says Claire Amable, director of advocacy at the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, which pushes for the city to encourage sustainable transport.</p><p>In 2023, she wrote to the CPUC after an incident when she was leading a children’s cycling trip and a Waymo came up close to the children at the back of the group. The organisers had to bang on the roof of the car to stop it before it hit the children.</p><p>Even as self-driving cars become more common, public transport is underfunded and needs to be prioritised, Amable told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In August, for instance, city authorities allowed autonomous cars and ride-hailing services on Market Street, the city’s commercial hub, after three years of it being car free. At the same time, bus services have been reduced on the street due to budget cuts.</p><p>A  spokesperson for the city’s transit authority declined a request to comment for this story.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4160742\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4160742\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25322506981765-1765216885.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4160742\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25322506981765-1765216885.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zoox\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4160742\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amazon’s Zoox self-driving vehicle is posing some competition to Waymo [File: John Locher/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>Amable and others have pushed for a phased rollout of self-driving cars. But easy availability of Robotaxis may in fact hurt an already underfunded public transit system as well as sustainable transportation such as cycling.</p><p>Joel Smith had always cycled to work at a well-known city grocery store. But when he sent his bike for repairs last month, Smith downloaded the Waymo app and took his first ride. “It was such a comfortable ride and the best thing is I could play whatever music I want, at the volume I want.” He plans to mix Waymo rides with biking now that his bike is back.</p><p>Brauer says the rapid development of artificial intelligence to quickly process not just language but video in real time has led to the faster-than-expected success of self-driving cars. It meant Waymo could see incoming traffic or people very well and drive accordingly without mishaps. Cruise autonomous vehicles from General Motors – cars that launched along with Waymo – had been in an accident with a pedestrian in 2023 , and have since discontinued service. But Waymo’s safety record allowed it to expand, and it has done so in a measured way.</p><p>“They may be safer, but that doesn’t mean the government should not do its job,” says Senator Cortese, who is considering bringing back a version of a previous bill asking for more local regulation for Robotaxis. “Regulation helps companies to develop products safely and reduce liability.”</p><p>Brauer believes that constant improvement in the ability to see and process input from the road means that by 2028-2030, “we will be surprised to see the number of non-human cars across the US”, and “this will be the inflexion point where this became possible”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zeidan has made baseball caps and T-shirts that say #Remembering Kit Kat to sell at his store. He believes the merchandise memorialises Kit Kat but also brings together the city’s bubbling opposition to the rapid growth of self-driving cars.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”</p><p>Her departure is the latest setback for the administration of President Donald Trump, which has clashed with the judicial branch of government as it seeks to expand executive power.</p><p>But even as Habba announced her departure, the Trump administration warned it would continue its efforts to overturn the court’s ruling.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1998102734680318084\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, Attorney General Pam Bondi hinted that Habba could still be restored to the high-level post, even as she accepted the prosecutor’s resignation.</p><p>“The Department of Justice will seek further review of this decision, and we are confident it will be reversed,” Bondi wrote.</p><p>“Alina intends to return to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey if this occurs.”</p><h2 id=\"from-personal-lawyer-to-prosecutor\">From personal lawyer to prosecutor</h2><p>The controversy over Habba’s appointment stretches back to the first months of Trump’s second term, when the Republican leader began naming some of his close associates to high-level roles in the Department of Justice.</p><p>US attorneys serve as the top law enforcement officers in a given district, prosecuting cases on behalf of the federal government.</p><p>They also oversee vast networks of prosecutors. In the case of the New Jersey district, there are approximately 170 lawyers under the local US attorney’s command.</p><p>Normally, the post is filled once the US Senate approves a candidate. But Habba has been serving in an interim capacity. She has no previous prosecutorial experience.</p><p>She was, however, employed as a personal lawyer to Trump between his terms in office, representing him in various civil matters.</p><p>Those cases ranged from a <a href=\"/news/2023/9/26/trump-found-liable-for-deceiving-businesses-banks-in-new-york-fraud-suit\">civil fraud complaint</a> brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James to <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/us-court-upholds-sexual-assault-defamation-order-against-trump\">a defamation lawsuit</a> brought by the writer E Jean Carroll. Trump lost both cases and has since appealed.</p><p>Nevertheless, Habba was one of several personal lawyers Trump handpicked to join the Justice Department.</p><p>They included <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/why-critics-fear-emil-boves-confirmation-will-start-a-maga-judicial-shift\">Emil Bove</a>, who defended Trump against <a href=\"/news/2023/8/1/trump-charged-in-federal-election-probe-his-third-criminal-indictment\">two federal indictments</a> from 2023 to 2024. Trump named Bove acting deputy attorney general in the Justice Department before successfully nominating him to a lifelong position on the Third Circuit Court.</p><p>Another example is Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer who represented Trump in legal actions against the seizure of classified documents from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p><p>Halligan herself was appointed as an acting US attorney, serving in the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>But last month, Halligan too found herself in legal jeopardy, after a federal judge found <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/us-judge-dismisses-criminal-charges-against-james-comey-letitia-james\">she had been illegally appointed</a>.</p><p>The judge also tossed the criminal charges Halligan had filed against two prominent Trump critics: Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, and James Comey, a former director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p><h2 id=\"political-prosecutions\">Political prosecutions?</h2><p>Habba had similarly overseen controversial prosecutions during her time as acting US attorney, feeding criticism that the Justice Department has been carrying out Trump’s political vendettas.</p><p>In March, she was sworn into office. By April, she had announced on the TV network Fox News that she was opening a probe into New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin, both Democrats.</p><p>She accused them of trying to “get in the way” of federal immigration enforcement operations.</p><p>Then, on May 9, she <a href=\"/news/2025/5/9/newark-mayor-ras-baraka-arrested-during-ice-detention-centre-protest\">decided to charge</a> Newark Mayor Ras Baraka with trespassing after he was involved in a protest in front of a local immigration detention facility.</p><p>By May 19, Habba <a href=\"https://x.com/USAttyHabba/status/1924610971919622210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had reversed course</a>, dropping the charges against Baraka. But in the same statement, she announced new charges against another participant in the protest, US Congress member LaMonica McIver.</p><p>Both McIver and Baraka are Democrats, and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/3/malicious-new-jersey-mayor-ras-baraka-sues-us-attorney-after-arrest\">they alleged</a> that their prosecutions were politically motivated. McIver’s case remains ongoing.</p><p>Still, Judge Andre Espinosa scolded Habba’s office for its short-lived prosecution against Baraka, calling it a “worrisome misstep” and “hasty”.</p><p>“Your role is not to secure convictions at all costs, nor to satisfy public clamour, nor to advance political agendas,” Espinosa told a federal prosecutor representing Habba’s office in May.</p><p>By July, Habba had reached the end of her legal mandate. According to the <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:28%20section:546%20edition:prelim)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US Code</a>, interim US attorneys are limited to a 120-day period, after which time the matter of temporary staffing goes to the district courts to decide.</p><p>On July 22, a panel of federal judges in New Jersey <a href=\"/news/2025/8/21/judge-rules-trump-lawyer-alina-habba-is-unlawfully-serving-as-us-attorney\">ruled not to extend Habba’s term</a>.

He currently lives in Paraguay.</p><p>But in a <a href=\"https://x.com/Lenin/status/1996709391513588083\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> posted to social media, Moreno denounced the prosecution’s case, which began in 2023.</p><p>“I have presented all the evidence to the attorney general’s office, and they have not been able to prove that I received a single cent,” Moreno said. “Let’s not allow such a great injustice to be committed.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to prosecutors, the illegal actions began while Moreno was vice president, from 2007 to 2013.</p><p>They accuse Moreno of using his sway to ensure the Chinese firm Sinohydro received government contracts to construct the Coca Codo Sinclair power plant, which began operations in 2016.</p><p>In return, prosecutors allege that Sinohydro doled out bribes worth about $76m between 2009 and 2018.</p><p>According to Ecuador’s former Attorney General Diana Salazar, Moreno’s family had business connections to Sinohydro, and they formed a “corruption network” that had “interstate and transnational reach”.</p><p>She has accused Moreno and his family of engineering “a false image of consulting and representation services” to channel bribes through “gifts, checks and transfers”.</p><p>Since its opening, the Coca Codo Sinclair plant has struggled with technical issues, including cracks in its construction.</p><p>The hydroelectric dam has also drawn scrutiny for the circumstances of its construction: Ecuador took out loans from China worth nearly $19bn for Coca Codo Sinclair and other projects.</p><p>As of 2024, the country’s total gross domestic product (GDP) was only around $124.7bn, according to the World Bank.</p><p>Moreno became vice president under left-wing leader <a href=\"/news/2022/4/22/ecuador-begins-effort-to-extradite-rafael-correa-from-belgium\">Rafael Correa</a>, who inspired a loyal political movement in Ecuador known as “correismo”.</p><p>By 2017, Correa had completed three terms and was limited by law from running again.</p><p>Moreno ran instead as the representative for Correa’s PAIS Alliance and won — but he ultimately faced backlash for pursuing centre-right economic reforms that deviated from his predecessor’s platform. The two leaders have since turned into prominent critics of one another.</p><p>In the wake of the bribery charges, Moreno has said that he is the victim of “terrible persecution” led by the forces of “correismo”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It leads the field with nine nominations overall.</p><p>Anderson was not the only cinematic “auteur” to receive laurels from the Golden Globe Foundation.</p><p>Chloe Zhao’s historical tear-jerker Hamnet — based on the relationship between playwright William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes — nabbed six nominations in various drama categories.</p><p>And Ryan Coogler’s springtime crowd-pleaser Sinners — a vampire film and cultural commentary, wrapped in one — scored seven nods, including Best Drama, Best Director and Best Cinematic Achievement.</p><p>While the Golden Globes are often seen as a cozy, champagne-clacking affair for Hollywood titans, this year’s nominations also suggest an ever-more international scope for its honourees.</p><p>The meditative Norwegian drama Sentimental Value scooped up eight nominations, and the French nominee It Was Just an Accident, by Iranian director Jafar Panahi, earned four.</p><p>South Korea and Brazil also broke free from the Non-English Language Film category, scoring nominations in the acting, songwriting and animation competitions for films like KPop Demon Hunters, No Other Choice and The Secret Agent.</p><p>Some pieces of award bait, meanwhile, failed to deliver on their potential. Director Luca Guadagnino’s slippery, post-MeToo drama After the Hunt, for example, only scored a single nomination for star Julia Roberts.</p><p>Likewise, the musical film Wicked: For Good — the sequel to last year’s award-season juggernaut — disappointed its expectations.

Yamen and his parents moved to the Abbasiyyin neighbourhood of Damascus, where he continued his studies and dreamed of moving to Spain.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>At around midnight on December 8, 2024, the 20-year-old Yamen was on his phone as news poured in that the regime might be on its last legs. A rebel operation from the north of Syria had overtaken Aleppo, Hama and Homs, and word was that they were on their way to Syria’s capital city.</p><p>Yamen told a few friends and joined them in the streets of Damascus. His house was between two police stations, Abbasiyyin and Jobar, staffed with police who he said were corrupt and would regularly harass people.</p><p>But that evening, they were nowhere to be found. Instead, they found the uniforms of defected soldiers lying on the ground.</p><p>His phone died while he was out on the streets, so the news did not come in by phone, but the sound of gunfire echoed through the night sky.</p><p>“There was a lot of gunfire from jubilant people,” he said on Monday, a day before the first anniversary, seated in a hotel courtyard.</p><p>He looked out over the courtyard and played with a ring on his left hand as he spoke.</p><p>He described the scene that day as a kind of joy-filled chaos, until rebel forces arrived from Deraa, in southern Syria, and later fighters, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, poured into the capital from the north.</p><p>“This was an indescribable joy, honestly,” he said. But his first thoughts were for other people suffering oppression.</p><p>“At that moment, I thought that God willing, it will happen soon for the people of Palestine, and we will celebrate in Palestine, at Al-Aqsa Mosque.”</p><p>Soon after, Yamen saw on television that al-Sharaa was entering the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus’s Old City. He jumped on his scooter and made a beeline for the mosque. When he arrived, he saw Syria’s future president emerging from the historic mosque.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"because-of-this-liberation-i-have-hope\">‘Because of this liberation, I have hope’</h2><p>Al Jazeera first met Yamen a few days later, outside that same mosque on the first Friday after the liberation of Damascus.</p><p>“Because of this liberation, I have hope,” <a href=\"/features/2024/12/30/syria-end-of-fear-assad-damascus-aleppo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/features/2024/12/30/syria-end-of-fear-assad-damascus-aleppo\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">he said at the time</a>.</p><p>On December 7, 2025, Yamen was still filled with positivity on the eve of the anniversary of the liberation of Damascus. At 21 years old, his face was fuller than a year ago, and he spoke calmly with an intellectual air.</p><p>He listed a number of things that he felt had been improved by the new government, led by al-Sharaa.</p><p>The streets had been upgraded, infrastructure had been repaired, the exchange rate had improved, the health sector was getting better, and employees’ salaries had been raised, he said.</p><p>“What I have mentioned is just the tip of the iceberg, so there’s still more to improve, God willing, much more.”</p><p>He also pointed to the issue of freedom of expression. Under al-Assad, any criticism of the regime could end in imprisonment.</p><p>Many Syrians told Al Jazeera that having dollars or even speaking the word aloud on a mobile phone could result in punishment or imprisonment.</p><p>“The issue of freedom of expression is one of the issues that has made the most difference,” he said.</p><p>He pointed out recent antigovernment protests in <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/syria-extends-homs-curfew-as-killings-threaten-to-inflame-sectarian-tension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/news/2025/11/24/syria-extends-homs-curfew-as-killings-threaten-to-inflame-sectarian-tension\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Homs</a> and the Syrian coast, where troops affiliated with the new government contributed to <a href=\"/features/2025/3/20/dont-trust-anyone-are-syrias-alawis-losing-faith-in-the-new-government\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/features/2025/3/20/dont-trust-anyone-are-syrias-alawis-losing-faith-in-the-new-government\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">widespread sectarian violence</a> in March.</p><p>“Right now, we are sitting here. For example, you might disagree with me on a political opinion. But under the old regime, you were careful with every word,” Yamen said.</p><p>On the actual anniversary, the next day, Yamen headed down to Umayyad Square to take part in the celebrations and the collective euphoria and joy.</p><p>Tens of thousands were expected to attend. By 3pm (12:00 GMT), fireworks burst overhead as helicopters and powered paragliders flew through the sky, while below the square was already full of people waving the green, black and white Syrian flag.</p><p>People continued to pour in for the processions, which the government said would start at 8pm (17:00 GMT).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"i-can-help-this-country\">‘I can help this country’</h2><p>Jobar is still destroyed, and rebuilding will take years. Yamen compared the destruction of the area with the destruction Israel has unleashed on Gaza.</p><p>Under the Assad regime, dozens of areas were obliterated through barrel bombs, air raids, and siege. The World Bank has estimated the reconstruction costs in Syria will require between $140bn and $345bn.</p><p>“I will never forget the time of our forced displacement,” he said. “Our region, our people, our families in Ghouta and Jobar were displaced.”</p><p>Still, Yamen no longer dreams of Spain.</p><p>“There are things that make me want to challenge everything and stay, I mean, this is something that’s not about me,” he said. He is in his final year studying law and hopes to find work upon his graduation.</p><p>“I am ultimately a member of society. Before, corruption in the legal field filled me with doubt about working here,” Yamen said.</p><p>“But today, if I find a good opportunity after graduation, either in the private sector or working with the state, I will take it so that I can help this country.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
