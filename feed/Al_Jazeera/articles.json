It’s the first time Washington has ever sounded the alarm on Mexico for terrorism risk.</p><p data-start=\"441\" data-end=\"736\">The advisory paints a grim picture: soaring rates of homicide, kidnapping, carjacking and robbery, alongside a new warning of possible terrorist attacks and terrorist violence.</p><p data-start=\"441\" data-end=\"736\">“There is a risk of terrorist violence, including attacks and related activities,” it warned, urging Americans to take precautions. The travel alert was raised to Level 2 – “exercise increased caution” on a scale of four levels.</p><h2 id=\"which-places-did-the-us-warn-about-and-why\">Which places did the US warn about and why?</h2><p data-start=\"71\" data-end=\"280\">The alert warns Americans not to travel to Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas provinces due to “terrorism, violent crime, and kidnapping.” These states are marked red on the map and classified as Level 4 — the most unsafe, per the US.</p><p data-start=\"282\" data-end=\"470\">Travellers are advised to reconsider visiting Baja California, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, and Sonora for the same reasons; these appear in orange and are rated Level 3, or marginally safer.</p><p data-start=\"472\" data-end=\"761\">Another 16 states – including Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Quintana Roo, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Morelos, Aguascalientes, Baja California Sur, Durango, Hidalgo, Nayarit, Nuevo Leon, Puebla, Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz – fall under “exercise increased caution”. While there are no outright travel bans, the advisory notes that both violent and non-violent crimes are common. These areas are shown in yellow and are listed under Level 2.</p><p data-start=\"763\" data-end=\"861\">Only Yucatan and Campeche remain at Level 1, the lowest risk level, highlighted in blue.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888144\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Mexico_Travel_Advisory_August14_2025-02-1755160351.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Mexico_Travel_Advisory_August14_2025-02-1755160351\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-backdrop-for-this-advisory\">What is the backdrop for this advisory?</h2><p data-start=\"92\" data-end=\"226\">According to experts, these actions follow <a href=\"/news/2025/8/12/mexico-expels-26-alleged-cartel-members-in-latest-deal-with-us\">increased pressure from Trump</a>, which has prompted the Mexican government to take a range of measures.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"228\" data-end=\"438\">Earlier this week, Mexico extradited 26 alleged cartel members to the US, in what appeared to be an effort to ease Trump’s demands for stronger action against fentanyl smuggling and organised crime.</p><p data-start=\"440\" data-end=\"632\">In a statement, the US embassy said those extradited included key figures from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel, Mexico’s two most powerful organised crime groups.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"97\" data-end=\"298\">This marks the second mass transfer of the year; in February, Mexican authorities sent 29 alleged cartel leaders to the US, a move that stirred debate over its political and legal merits.</p><p data-start=\"300\" data-end=\"440\">Among them was Caro Quintero, a founding member of the Guadalajara Cartel, accused of murdering DEA agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena in 1985.</p><p data-start=\"442\" data-end=\"636\">US officials had requested the extraditions, pledging not to seek the death penalty. Mexico described the suspects as high-risk criminals tied to drug trafficking and other serious offences.</p><p data-start=\"638\" data-end=\"779\">While extraditions are not uncommon, they are typically carried out in ones and twos. But this year alone, Mexico has already handed over 55 people.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"182\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The transfers follow months of US pressure, reinforced by tariff threats, and reports that Trump directed the Pentagon to consider military action against Latin American cartels.</p><p data-start=\"812\" data-end=\"1179\">According to those reports, the order would permit direct military operations on foreign soil and in corresponding territorial waters against organised criminal groups. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has said the US and Mexico are close to finalising a security agreement to boost cooperation against cartels, but she has firmly rejected the idea of unilateral US military operations on Mexican soil.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-mexico-responded-to-the-new-alert\" data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"182\">How has Mexico responded to the new alert?</h2><p data-start=\"153\" data-end=\"463\">Sheinbaum downplayed the updated travel advisory. She argued the change stems from Washington’s decision to label cartels as terrorist organisations  – done through an executive order earlier this year – rather than from any new security reality.</p><p data-start=\"465\" data-end=\"761\">Sheinbaum stressed that Mexico remains the top destination for US travellers, with about a million Americans living in the country, and noted that popular areas such as the Southeast, Baja California Peninsula, Pacific coast, and Mexico City continue to attract visitors despite the warning.</p><h2 id=\"how-bad-is-mexico-s-violence-problem\">How bad is Mexico’s violence problem?</h2><p>Bad, but it’s improving.</p><p data-start=\"60\" data-end=\"225\">According to a 2024 report from Human Rights Watch, violent crime in Mexico <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/mexico\">has risen sharply</a> since the government began its “war” on organised crime in 2006.</p><p data-start=\"60\" data-end=\"225\">However, this year, Sheinbaum can report a 25.3 percent <a href=\"https://ground.news/article/sesnsp-intentional-homicide-in-mexico-has-decreased-by-253-in-nine-months\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drop in daily homicides</a> over her first 11 months in office, from 86.9 per day in September 2023 to 64.9 now – the lowest monthly figures since 2015.</p><p data-start=\"60\" data-end=\"225\">While Mexico remains one of the world’s most violent countries, the decline is seen as a significant improvement, credited to her administration’s security strategy, but also US pressure.</p><p data-start=\"66\" data-end=\"340\">When Trump took office, he quickly warned Mexico that it had to show real progress in stopping the flow of fentanyl, a drug that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, or face steep trade tariffs. He promised to push Mexico harder to curb drug trafficking and illegal migration, making it clear there would be serious economic consequences if it didn’t act.</p><p data-start=\"342\" data-end=\"757\">In Sheinbaum’s first year in office, authorities have seized more than 3.5 million fentanyl pills and arrested at least 29,000 suspects, including high-level cartel leaders with local and national reach. Security chief Omar Garcia Harfuch credited the success to the crucial work of specialised intelligence and investigative units.</p><p data-start=\"60\" data-end=\"225\">However, in places like Sinaloa, the bloodshed escalated sharply after the arrests of major figures, including <a href=\"/news/2024/8/10/i-was-ambushed-sinaloa-drug-cartel-leader-el-mayo-details-capture\">Ismael Zambada</a>, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, in August 2024.</p><p data-start=\"360\" data-end=\"546\">During the first six months of this year, authorities recorded 883 homicides in the state, up from just 224 in the same period last year, with most killings concentrated in Culiacan.</p><p data-start=\"548\" data-end=\"835\">The violence may be only part of the toll. Since Zambada’s arrest, more than 1,500 people have gone missing in Sinaloa. Security officials believe criminal groups are behind many of these disappearances, suggesting the real cost of the crackdown could be even higher.</p><p>Zambada, one of Mexico’s most notorious accused drug lords, was captured at an airfield near El Paso, Texas, alongside Ovidio Guzman, a son of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman – the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel who is serving a life sentence in a US prison. Zambada claims Guzman Lopez kidnapped him and handed him over to US authorities.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"243\" data-end=\"969\">Israel has imposed man-made starvation on the population of Gaza since the aggression against the enclave began in October 2023. This campaign intensified drastically after March 2025, when the Zionist occupation implemented even harsher restrictions on the already scarce aid allowed into Gaza. Since then, hundreds of men, women, and children have died from severe malnutrition. Doctors survive on meagre crumbs of bread and oil each day, often resorting to seawater to ingest much-needed electrolytes. Journalists have become too weak to carry out their duties, and men are too frail to risk their lives at GHF sites. The population now resembles skin stretched taut over bones.</p><p data-start=\"971\" data-end=\"1578\">Such severe malnutrition has, unfortunately, been witnessed throughout history, and its effects on the human body are well documented. Systems shut down one by one, fatigue envelops the victims, and the body begins to consume itself to death. Chilling accounts between 1920 and 1940 in the Soviet Union paint a similar picture. Performers collapsed mid-performance, dying where they stood. People dropped dead in the streets as if simply falling asleep. Desperation reached such extremes that court records tell of a mother dismembering her unconscious husband, believing him dead, to feed their children.</p><p data-start=\"1580\" data-end=\"2315\">What is often overlooked, however, is that recovery from starvation can be just as devastating. Ironically, one of the earliest recorded accounts of this phenomenon comes from the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. For five months, under the command of Titus, son of Emperor Vespasian, the Roman army cut off all aid to the then-holy Jewish city. Like Gaza’s population today, Jerusalem’s citizens were wasted, disease-ridden, and forced to eat leather. After the Romans breached the gates and captured the city, Flavius Josephus, a Jewish commander who defected to the Romans, reported that many survivors died soon after eating. Malnourished citizens would gorge themselves on food to the point of vomiting, with many dying within hours.</p><p data-start=\"2317\" data-end=\"2964\">Following World War II, similar accounts emerged involving Japanese prisoners of war. Malnourished soldiers liberated from captivity in the Philippines, New Guinea, and elsewhere gorged themselves on calorically rich food provided by their liberators. Approximately one in five of these prisoners died because of this refeeding process. Medical examinations revealed shrunken organs, heart failure, and other severe complications. Comparable observations have been reported repeatedly in starved civilian populations after famine relief, among post-operative patients, individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa, and chronic alcoholics.</p><p data-start=\"2966\" data-end=\"3679\">Now commonly known as refeeding syndrome, this condition describes a dangerously rapid metabolic shift from a catabolic to an anabolic state. In starvation, the body suppresses insulin and relies on breaking down muscle and fat, depleting essential intracellular ions. Once feeding resumes, insulin surges, causing glucose and electrolytes to flood into cells. This sudden cellular shift sharply lowers blood levels of phosphate, potassium, and magnesium. Insulin also promotes sodium and water retention in the bloodstream, leading to fluid overload. If untreated, these changes can cause catastrophic damage to the heart, lungs, nerves, and blood, resulting in arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and death.</p><p data-start=\"3681\" data-end=\"4225\">It is important to emphasise that refeeding syndrome is not simply “too many calories too quickly”; it is a metabolic shock. Controlled eating alone is insufficient. Patients require carefully planned treatment, beginning with electrolyte and vitamin supplementation before feeding starts. A skilled, multidisciplinary team and routine laboratory testing are essential to ensure recovery proceeds safely. Pharmacists, psychiatrists, lab technicians, and other specialists must work in concert to nurse the malnourished back to health.</p><p data-start=\"4227\" data-end=\"4776\">In the context of the genocide in Gaza, imagining such care is heartbreaking. The medical infrastructure there has collapsed. Doctors treat only urgent cases. Anaesthetics have all but run out, and vinegar, if found, is used to clean wounds. Children’s limbs are amputated while they are fully conscious and in pain. This is not a system remotely capable of rehabilitating two million starved people. Israel deliberately ensures this by enforcing a blockade on medical supplies and brutally targeting health workers, ambulances, and hospitals.</p><p data-start=\"4778\" data-end=\"5259\">Tragically, we cannot rely on starving individuals to control their own refeeding. Hunger twists the mind, making a person obsessively fixated on food. The thought “this may be your only chance to eat, so eat as much as possible” becomes overpowering. In the follow up of Ancel Keys’ malnutrition experiments, it was noted that several recovered participants went on to work in the food and restaurant industry.

Most crucially, they must stop targeting health workers and health facilities. This is nearly as vital as the entry of aid itself. Western governments possess a range of tools to compel Israel to halt its genocidal aggression and permit humanitarian and medical assistance, but they choose not to use them. They are complicit in one of the most horrendous genocides of modern times. Global citizens must press their governments to act.

Once the proposal appears in the Federal Register – the daily public report containing notices of proposed federal rule changes – the plan will become subject to a formal public comment period. It could be finalised within months, although it is likely to face legal challenges.</p><p>Joseph Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, told The New York Times in July that H-1B visas should favour companies that plan to pay foreign workers higher wages. The proposal Bloomberg Law described was in line with that goal.</p><p>PolitiFact did not see a copy of the proposal, and the White House did not respond to our questions. But the Department of Homeland Security submitted the proposed rule to a Trump administration office in July, the Greenberg Traurig law firm wrote.</p><p>Trump sought to reform the H-1B program during his first term but made limited progress. In January 2021, near the end of Trump’s term, the Department of Homeland Security published a final rule similar to the current proposal, but the Biden administration did not implement it.</p><p>Work visas were not a central part of Trump’s 2024 immigration platform, but it was a point of <a href=\"/news/2024/12/29/why-are-us-republicans-debating-the-future-of-h-1b-high-skill-work-visas\">debate</a> in the weeks before he took office, with billionaire businessman Elon Musk – a megadonor to Trump who would briefly serve in his administration – speaking in favour of them.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-h-1b-visas\">What are H-1B visas?</h2><p>The H-1B visa programme lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty fields, with about two-thirds working in computer-related jobs, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most H-1B visa holders come from India, followed by China.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Currently, prospective H-1B employers must attest that they will pay the H-1B worker actual wages paid to similar employees or the prevailing wages for that occupation – whichever would result in the highest pay.</p><p>To qualify for the non-immigrant visa, the employee must hold a specialised degree, license or training required by the occupation. The status is generally valid for up to three years and renewable for another three years, but it can be extended if the employer sponsors the worker for permanent residency, which includes permission to work and live in the US.</p><p>Leopold said that the proposed change goes beyond the law’s current wage mandate.</p><p>“This statutory mechanism is designed to prevent employers from paying H-1B workers less than their American counterparts, thereby protecting US workers from displacement,” Leopold said.</p><p>Congress caps new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees. The government approved 400,000 H-1B applications, including renewals, in 2024, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.</p><p>Amazon has led the nation’s employers since 2020 in its number of H-1B workers, Pew found.</p><p>The New York metro area received more H-1B application approvals than any other metro area; College Station, Texas had the highest concentration of approvals.</p><h2 id=\"what-could-change-with-h1-b-visas\">What could change with H1-B visas?</h2><p>The proposed policy favours higher-paid employees, experts said.</p><p>Malcolm Goeschl, a San Francisco-based lawyer, said the rule will likely benefit tech companies, including many specialising in artificial intelligence. Such companies pay high salaries, including for entry-level positions. He said it will harm traditional tech companies’ programmes for new graduates.</p><p>“There will likely be plenty of lottery numbers available at the top of the prevailing wage scale, but very few or none at the bottom,” Goeschl said. “You may see young graduates shy away from the US labour market early on because of this. Or you could see companies just pay entry-level workers from other countries much higher salaries to get a chance in the lottery, leading to the perverse situation where the foreign workers are making a lot more money than similarly situated US workers.”</p><p>The prevailing wage requirements are designed to protect US jobs from being undercut by lower paid foreign workers.</p><p>David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the change would likely make it nearly impossible for recent immigrant college graduates, who tend to earn lower wages, to launch their careers in the United States on an H-1B visa.</p><p>“The short-term benefit would be the people who get selected are more productive, but the long-term cost might be to permanently redirect future skilled immigration to other countries,” Bier said. “It would also effectively prohibit the H-1B for many industries that rely on it. K-12 schools in rural areas seeking bilingual teachers, for instance, will have no chance under this system.”</p><p>Amid a nationwide teacher shortage, some school districts have hired H-1B visa holders, including smaller districts such as Jackson, Mississippi, and larger districts, including Dallas, Texas. Language immersion schools also often employ teachers from other countries using this visa programme.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-there-a-debate-about-h-1b-visas\">Why is there a debate about H-1B visas?</h2><p>The debate around H-1B visas does not neatly fall along partisan lines.</p><p>Proponents say the existing visa programme allows American employers to fill gaps, compete with other countries and recruit the “best minds”. Critics point to instances of fraud or abuse and say they favour policies that incentivise hiring Americans.</p><p>In December, high-profile Republicans debated the visa programme on social media.</p><p>MAGA influencer Laura Loomer denounced the programme and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called it a “scam”. On the other side, billionaire Elon Musk, a former H-1B visa holder whose companies employ such visa holders, called for the programme’s reform but defended it as an important talent recruitment mechanism.</p><p>Trump sided with Musk.</p><p>“I have many H-1B visas on my properties,” Trump told the New York Post in late December. “I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great programme.”</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders disputed Musk, saying corporations abuse the programme as a way to get richer and should recruit American workers first.</p><p>Such visa debates have continued.</p><p>When US Representative Greg Murphy, a urologist, argued on X August 8 that the visas “are critical for helping alleviate the severe physician shortage”, thousands replied. Christina Pushaw, a Republican who works for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, pushed back: “Why not figure out the causes of the domestic physician shortage and try to pass legislation to address those?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Across the Sumy and Kharkiv regions, Russia controls about 400 sq km (154 sq miles) of territory. In Dnipropetrovsk, Russia has taken a tiny area near the border.</p><p>Russia controls about 46,570 sq km (17,981 sq miles), or 88 percent, of the territory known as Donbas, made up of the Luhansk and Donbas regions.

The siege of Mariupol was one of the deadliest and most destructive battles of the war. Ukrainian officials estimated tens of thousands of civilian deaths.</p><p>By March 2022, Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest in Europe, and by April of that year, Russia controlled 27 percent of Ukraine.</p><p>By late 2022, Ukraine had turned the tide with major counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson, with Kyiv reclaiming 54 percent of the land Russia had captured since the beginning of the war, according to ISW data, reducing Russian-occupied land to just 18 percent of the country.</p><p>In August 2024, Ukraine launched a significant incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, marking a notable escalation in the conflict. This offensive saw Ukrainian forces advancing approximately 10km (6 miles) into Russian territory, seizing control over an estimated 250 sq km (96.5 sq miles), all of which has since been retaken by Russia.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888045\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Russias-war-on-Ukraine-AUG-12-2025-copy-1755156382.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Russia’s war on Ukraine-AUG 12, 2025 copy-1755156382\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>By late 2024 and into 2025, the war had settled into a grinding impasse, with both sides suffering heavy losses.

I think the difference comes from OpenAI not understanding that this is not a tool, but a companion that people are interacting with,” Mary, who described herself as a 25-year-old woman living in North America, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“If you change the way a companion behaves, it will obviously raise red flags. Just like if a human started behaving differently suddenly.”</p><p>Beyond potential psychological ramifications, there are also privacy concerns.</p><p>Cathy Hackl, a self-described “futurist” and external partner at Boston Consulting Group, said ChatGPT users may forget that they are sharing some of their most intimate thoughts and feelings with a corporation that is not bound by the same laws as a certified therapist.</p><p>AI relationships also lack the tension that underpins human relationships, Hackl said, something she experienced during a recent experiment “dating” ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and other AI models.</p><p>“There’s no risk/reward here,” Hackl told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Partners make the conscious act to choose to be with someone. It’s a choice. It’s a human act. The messiness of being human will remain that,” she said.</p><p>Despite these reservations, Hackl said the reliance some users have on ChatGPT and other generative-AI chatbots is a phenomenon that is here to stay – regardless of any upgrades.</p><p>“I’m seeing a shift happening in moving away from the ‘attention economy’ of the social media days of likes and shares and retweets and all these sorts of things, to more of what I call the ‘intimacy economy,”” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3888137\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3888137\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888137\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-07-21T173823Z_1051411548_RC2LU7A5UGD4_RTRMADP_3_OPENAI-UK-1-1755159986.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C470&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"OA\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3888137\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An OpenAI logo is pictured on May 20, 2024 [File: Dado Ruvic/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Research on the long-term effects of AI relationships remains limited, however, thanks to the fast pace of AI development, said Keith Sakata, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has treated patients presenting with what he calls “AI psychosis”.</p><p>“These [AI] models are changing so quickly from season to season – and soon it’s going to be month to month – that we really can’t keep up. Any study we do is going to be obsolete by the time the next model comes out,” Sakata told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Given the limited data, Sakata said doctors are often unsure what to tell their patients about AI. He said AI relationships do not appear to be inherently harmful, but they still come with risks.</p><p>“When someone has a relationship with AI, I think there is something that they’re trying to get that they’re not getting in society. Adults can be adults; everyone should be free to do what they want to do, but I think where it becomes a problem is if it causes dysfunction and distress,” Sakata said.</p><p>“If that person who is having a relationship with AI starts to isolate themselves, they lose the ability to form meaningful connections with human beings, maybe they get fired from their job… I think that becomes a problem,” he added.</p><p>Like many of those who say they are in a relationship with AI, Jane openly acknowledges the limitations of her companion.</p><p>“Most people are aware that their partners are not sentient but made of code and trained on human behaviour.

He has claimed credit for ceasefires between India and Pakistan in May and Israel and Iran in June, and helped mediate truce pacts between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.

They are typically paid by those who buy the materials they forage, depending on the quality and quantity they can find and sort.</p><p>As a result, they have no stable income and their work is hazardous, particularly in the summer months.</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58693-5#Sec17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> published in the scientific journal Nature, the temperature at these landfill sites varies based on the size of the dump. The temperature from dumps exceeding 50 metres (164 feet) in height generally lies between 60 and 70C (158F) in the summer. This “heat-island effect” is caused by the decomposition of organic waste, which not only generates heat but also releases hazardous gases.</p><p>“These landfills are gas chambers in the making,” says Anant Bhan, a public health researcher who has specialised in global health, health policy and bioethics for 20 years. “Waste pickers work in extreme heat, surrounded by toxic gases. This leads to long-term health complications,” he explains.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Additionally, they are exposed to several gases, like the highly flammable methane, which causes irritation to their respiratory system. The rotting waste also leads to skin-related complications among the waste pickers.”</p><p>Ghazipur, which now towers at least 65 metres (213 ft) high – equivalent to a 20-storey building – has become a potent symbol of Delhi’s climate crisis.</p><p>Begum’s eye started swelling up in the intense heat last year. “I went to the doctor and he suggested surgery to treat my eye, which would cost me around 30,000 rupees ($350) but I don’t have that kind of money,” she says.</p><p>Like other waste pickers, Begum says she is reluctant to visit the government hospital, where she could receive free treatment, as it can take six months to receive a diagnosis there. “It is a waste of time to stand in queue for long hours at the cost of work days, and the diagnosis takes months to come through,” she explains. “I prefer going to the Mohalla Clinic; they check the Aadhaar Card [a form of identification] and instantly give medicines.”</p><p>The Mohalla Clinics, an initiative started by former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, offer free primary healthcare, medicines and diagnostic tests to residents in low-income areas.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tanzila-1754650725.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi garbage pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tanzila, 32, who works as a waste picker at the Ghazipur landfill site in New Delhi, fainted in the scorching sun last year, and now works mostly at night [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-ticking-time-bomb\">A ticking time bomb</h2><p>On a blazing summer day in July as temperatures reach 40C (104F), Tanzila, 32, who also lives in the slum next to the landfill site, is preparing for her night shift of waste picking. “It’s just too hot now,” she says. Tanzila, a mother of three children aged eight to 16, who has done this job for 12 years, says she passed out from dehydration while working under the sun last year. “Now I only go at night. During the day, it feels like being baked alive.”</p><p>Slender and dressed in a full-sleeve red, floral kurta with a headscarf, Tanzila appears exhausted and weary. She explains that when she did work during the day. “I would go early in the morning, come back around 9am, then again go around 4pm and come back around 7pm. But for the past two years, I have been going with other women only at night during summers because it has become harder to work during the day in this weather.”</p><p>Sheikh Akbar Ali, cofounder of Basti Suraksha Manch and a former door-to-door waste picker, has been campaigning for the rights of waste pickers across 52 sites in Delhi for the past 20 years. He explains that the conditions can be more dangerous at night than during the day.</p><p>“There are many vehicles like the tractors and JCBs operating on the landfills at night, and the waste pickers who work at night wear torchlights on their head, which indicates their visibility on the landfill. However, waste and gas leaks are more visible during the day.” This is because fires and smoke can more easily be seen in the daylight.</p><p>Despite the government’s repeated <a href=\"https://m.economictimes.com/news/india/govt-plans-to-remove-all-three-landfill-sites-in-delhi-in-next-two-years-minister-gahlot/articleshow/98903415.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assurances</a> that these rubbish mountains will be cleared, little has changed on the ground. In the latest assurance made in May 2025, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Delhi’s environment minister, claimed that the “garbage mountains” would be completely cleared by 2028, contradicting his own statement from April 2025, in which he had said that they would “disappear like dinosaurs” in five years.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878451\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878451\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878451\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-entrance-of-Ghazipur-landfill-from-where-all-the-trucks-carrying-the-citys-garbage-enter-1754650885-rotated.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1027&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878451\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The entrance to the Ghazipur landfill, through which all the trucks carrying the city’s waste enter [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>As the summer heat accelerates the decomposition of organic waste, the release of hazardous gases has worsened the air quality in Delhi, something environmentalists and public health experts have sounded the alarm over.</p><p>According to a report from AQI, an open-source air quality monitoring platform based in New Delhi, since 2020, satellites have detected 124 significant methane leaks across the city, including a particularly large one in Ghazipur in 2021, which leaked 156 tonnes of methane per hour.</p><p>Even though the same work which puts food on the table also makes them ill, waste pickers like Begum and Tanzila say they have little choice other than to continue with their work. “Garbage is gold to us. We don’t get bothered by the smell of waste. It feeds our families, and why would we leave?” asks Tanzila.</p><p>Their labour, unrecognised as a profession by the government, comes with few protections, no health insurance and no stable income. Rubbish pickers must fashion their own safety gear from whatever they can afford – such as used disposable masks which can be bought in the market for 5 to 10 rupees (6 to 11 cents) – but nothing is particularly effective at keeping workers free from hazards.</p><p>“They don’t wear gloves because the heat makes their hands sweat easily and they aren’t able to hold waste properly. Even the masks are a total waste because all the sweat gets collected in the mask, which makes it difficult for them to breathe,” adds Akbar.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878457\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878457\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878457\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Shah-Alam2-1754651002.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘The garbage grows, and we keep working.’ Shah Alam, a Delhi waste picker who also drives an electric rickshaw [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"when-climate-change-and-waste-mismanagement-meet\">When climate change and waste mismanagement meet</h2><p>New Delhi’s civic bodies, which are under pressure from environmental and health activists to demonstrate some visible progress in tackling the city’s waste and <a href=\"/features/2024/11/29/death-in-the-air-how-is-life-different-in-worlds-most-polluted-city\">pollution problems</a>, have largely responded with quick fixes, most notably plans to build four incinerator plants in Okhla, Narela, Tenkhand and Ghazipur. But experts warn that such infrastructure-centric solutions only mask deeper problems and could also cause further environmental damage.</p><p>Incinerators often release various harmful pollutants such as dioxins, furans, mercury contamination and particulate matter into the air, which pose serious health risks, they say.</p><p>According to a 2010 report by the World Health Organization, dioxins are “highly toxic and can cause reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also cause cancer”.</p><p>Furthermore, if incineration plants replace landfill-based recycling, many fear the erasure of their livelihoods altogether.</p><p>“Delhi’s shift to incinerators has completely excluded informal waste pickers, particularly women,” says Bharati Chaturvedi, founder of Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group. “It threatens their livelihoods and pushes them into deeper poverty. It is an environmental disaster in the making. Incinerators emit toxic fumes and undermine recycling efforts.”</p><p>“Beyond just closing landfills or building incinerators, we need to ensure that waste pickers have alternative livelihoods and are part of the formal waste management system,” says Chaturvedi.</p><p>“This is not just about clearing garbage,” she argues. “It’s about including waste pickers in the formal economy. It’s about creating decentralised, community-level waste management systems. And it’s about acknowledging that climate change and poverty are deeply interconnected.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878462\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878462\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878462\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/A-look-at-the-Ghazipur-landfill-from-its-entrance-1754651191.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Delhi waste pickers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A view of the Ghazipur landfill site from its entrance [Poorvi Gupta/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Activists and public health professionals advocate for the creation of a decentralised waste system, one that includes segregating waste into separate places according to type, ward-level composting (processing organic waste locally to avoid transportation), and robust recycling systems.</p><p>Formalising the role of waste pickers by offering legal recognition, fair wages, protective gear and access to welfare schemes would not only empower one of the city’s most vulnerable communities, but it would also help build a climate-resilient waste management model, say environment activists.</p><p>Back at the Ghazipur landfill, the reality remains grim. Fires break out with increasing frequency, and the acrid air clings to nearby homes.

The garbage grows, and we keep working,” says Shah Alam, Tanzila’s husband, who used to work solely as a waste picker but now also drives an electric rickshaw to earn a living. “During summers, more people fall sick, and we lose workdays. But what other option do we have?”</p></div></div></body></html>"
