However, when the Assad regime fell on December 8, 2024, Israel began attacking Syrian military infrastructure and pushed their troops into the demilitarised zone that is Syrian territory.</p><p>Syria and Israel have been engaging in intermittent negotiations over the last year to find a security agreement that would stop Israel’s repeat aggression against Syrians and Syrian territory.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about these talks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-mechanism\">What is the mechanism?</h2><p>“The mechanism will serve as a platform to address any disputes promptly and work to prevent misunderstandings,” a joint statement released by the two countries said after the agreement on Tuesday.</p><p>The idea is to have a body that will deal with grievances and resolve disputes between Israel and Syria, ideally in a way that brings Israeli attacks on Syrian land and people to an end. Both sides may also hope it can pave the way to a renewed security agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-syria-want\">What does Syria want?</h2><p>A government source told state media SANA, that the focus for Syria is to reactivate “the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, with the aim of ensuring the withdrawal of Israeli forces to the lines in place prior to Dec. 8, 2024 within a reciprocal security agreement that prioritizes full Syrian sovereignty and guarantees the prevention of any form of interference in Syria’s internal affairs.”</p><p>The Syrian government, led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, will want Israel to respect Syrian sovereignty by pulling back its forces and stopping attacks but also to stop meddling in domestic affairs.</p><p>The Washington Post reported that Israel has supported figures opposed to Syria’s new government, including Suwayda’s Hikmat al Hijri. Israel has previously said they want to protect Syria’s minority Druze community.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>What does Israel want?</strong></p><p>Three things mainly, according to Al Jazeera’s senior correspondent Resul Serdar.</p><p>“For Israel, it’s about more land, patronage of minorities, and long term leverage,” he said.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/israels-netanyahu-says-deal-with-syria-possible-but-demands-buffer-zone\">Israel</a> has tried to paint the new government in Syria as extremist and a threat to its security. It has called for the area south of Damascus to be demilitarised, while also trying to build relations with Syrian minorities, particularly the Druze in Suwayda.</p><p>Analysts believe this could be part of a strategy by Israel to keep its <a href=\"/features/2025/4/9/israel-pushes-on-with-strategy-to-keep-neighbours-weak-in-lebanon-and-syria\">neighbours weak</a>.</p><p>Israel has come to the table at least partially due to US leverage and influence. US President Donald Trump and his Special Envoy Tom Barrack have both built warm relations with al-Sharaa.</p><p>But Israel may also want to counter <a href=\"/features/2025/9/21/is-turkiye-israel-next-target-middle-east\">Turkish influence</a> in Syria. Israel has <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/4/11/why-does-syria-matter-to-israel-and-turkiye\">previously accused</a> Turkiye of turning Syria into its protectorate.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>What does the US want?</strong></p><p>“For Washington the priority is containment,” Serdar said.</p><p>The US also sees Damascus as a crucial partner in the <a href=\"/features/2025/12/27/analysis-isil-attacks-could-undermine-us-syria-security-collaboration\">fight against ISIL</a>. Stability in Syria, particularly under a central government in Damascus, could mean pulling US troops out of eastern Syria.</p><p>But the US also wants a strong Syria to avoid the return of Iranian influence in the country and to avoid any wider regional violence.</p><p>For his part, Trump is eager to expand the Abraham Accords that sees Arab and Muslim countries sign normalisation agreements with Israel and has said he hopes Syria will do so. Syria, however, has said they do not intend to sign the Abraham Accords.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-the-mechanism-work\">Will the mechanism work?</h2><p>There are doubts.</p><p>A Syrian official told Reuters news agency that his country isn’t willing to move forward on “strategic files” without an enforced timeline over Israel’s withdrawal from Syrian territory taken after December 2024.</p><p>In addition to moving into Syrian territory, Israel has conducted numerous attacks on Damascus, including on the Syrian Ministry of Defense building.</p><p>A similar mechanism between Israel and Lebanon was created after the November 2024 ceasefire there, with France and the United States involved to enforce the deal. However, the mechanism has not stopped near-daily attacks by Israel on Lebanese territory, nor has it led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from five occupied points in Lebanon.</p><p>For the mechanism to work, the United States will have to do something it has rarely done in recent years: hold Israel accountable.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-about-the-golan-heights\">What about the Golan Heights?</h2><p>Israel has illegally occupied areas of the Syrian Golan Heights since 1967.</p><p>Israeli officials have indicated they are not willing to return the Golan Heights to the new Syrian government.</p><p>After the fall of the Assad regime, Israel expanded into Syrian territory and seized the strategic outlook of Jabal al-Sheikh, a mountain that lies between Syria, Lebanon and Israel.</p><p>For now, Syria appears to be focused on getting Israel out of the areas it occupied since December 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, his military career was upended by the 1994 civil war, in which northern forces under then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh crushed the southern separatist movement.</p><p>Al-Zubaidi fought on the losing side and was forced into exile in Djibouti.</p><p>He returned to Yemen in 1996 to found Haq Taqreer al-Maseer (HTM), which means the Movement of Right to Self-Determination, an armed group that carried out assassinations against northern military officials.

In recognition of his influence on the ground, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi appointed him governor of Aden in December 2015.</p><p>However, the alliance was short-lived. Tensions between Hadi’s government and southern separatists boiled over, leading to al-Zubaidi’s dismissal in April 2017.</p><p>Less than a month later, al-Zubaidi formed the Southern Transitional Council (STC), declaring it the legitimate representative of the southern people. Backed by the United Arab Emirates, the STC built a formidable paramilitary force that frequently clashed with government troops, eventually seizing control of Aden.</p><p>In April 2022, in a bid to unify the anti-Houthi front, al-Zubaidi was appointed to the eight-member Presidential Leadership Council (PLC).</p><h2 id=\"a-vision-of-south-arabia\">A vision of ‘South Arabia’</h2><p>Despite joining the unity government, al-Zubaidi never abandoned his ultimate goal: the restoration of the pre-1990 southern state.</p><p>In interviews with international media, including United Arab Emirates state-run newspaper <em>The National</em> and <em>Al Hurra</em>, al-Zubaidi outlined a vision for a federal “State of South Arabia”.

In this visual explainer, Al Jazeera illustrates what cultural and historical reasons led to this difference in Christmas celebrations.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-there-two-christmases\">Why are there two Christmases?</h2><p>The reason some Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7 is not because they believe Jesus was born on a different day, but because they are using a different calendar.</p><p>The difference in the timing of Christmas stretches back to 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII ruled that the Catholic Church should follow a new calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, to replace the less accurate Julian calendar.</p><p>The Julian calendar, which was introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, overestimated the solar year by 11 minutes, causing the seasons to eventually drift out of place.</p><p>Where the Julian calendar loses one day every 128 years, the Gregorian calendar loses one day every 3,236 years, making it a much more accurate approximation of a true solar year.</p><p>To get back on track, the world had to essentially skip 10 days to make up for the missing time that had accumulated over the 15 centuries.</p><p>While most of the world adopted the new Gregorian calendar, many Orthodox and Eastern Christian churches have stayed with the Julian calendar to maintain their traditions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4220741\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4220741\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4220741\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-Why-are-there-two-Christmases-1767760193.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Why are there two Christmases-1767760193\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4220741\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>Fast forward to today, and the Julian calendar is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar.

Bulgaria followed suit later, officially moving its church celebrations to the 25th in 1968.</p><p>In Belarus and Moldova, Christmas is celebrated as a national holiday on both December 25 and January 7, accommodating various Christian denominations.

But for women like Mariam*, the horror of war followed her even as she tried to flee.</p><p>Attempting to escape from Gezira State to Khartoum early last year, Mariam’s vehicle was stopped by armed men. She was the only passenger singled out.</p><p>“We were coming from Gezira State… They stopped us on the street and forced us down,” Mariam told Al Jazeera Arabic’s correspondent Asma Mohammed.</p><p>“They said they wanted to search us. Two of them consulted with each other, then called me over,” she recounted, her voice trembling. “They took me to a place… It was an empty room with a mattress. They told me to lie down, and then they raped me.”</p><p>Mariam returned to her family in the waiting car, shattered.</p><p>“She told us immediately what happened… How many of them there were,” her aunt told Al Jazeera. “Of course, they were from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).”</p><h2><strong>‘Is there a girl in this house?’</strong></h2><p>Mariam’s story is not unique. In el-Fasher, the tragedy repeats itself with even greater brutality.</p><p>Um Kulthum*, a medical student, told Al Jazeera she was forced to witness mass rape and murder before becoming a victim herself.</p><p>“The RSF forces entered … and besieged the area,” Um Kulthum said. “They killed my uncle, the one who raised me … right in front of us.</p><p>“We were four girls, along with our neighbour’s daughter. The RSF forces then gang-raped us in a brutal manner.”</p><p>These exclusive accounts align with a harrowing new report released last November by the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA), which documented nearly 1,300 cases of sexual and gender-based violence across 14 states since the war began in April 2023.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera in November, Hala Al-Karib, the regional director of SIHA, explained that these are not random acts, but a strategy rooted in viewing women as “property”.</p><p>“Kidnappings often occur at the beginning of an invasion… When homes are entered, there is a specific question asked: ‘Is there a girl in this house? Are there young women?'” Al-Karib said.</p><p>“We have heard from many witnesses who were told by RSF soldiers: ‘I am coming to take this girl.'”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>Sexual slavery and trafficking</strong></h2><p>The violence extends beyond immediate assault to long-term captivity. Al-Karib described a terrifying reality of “sexual slavery” and forced labour.</p><p>“Women are kidnapped for ‘sexual slavery’, specifically young, middle-aged women, and also to serve the soldiers – forced labour, washing clothes, cooking,” Al-Karib told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Even more disturbingly, she revealed that the exploitation has crossed international lines.</p><p>“Women are also kidnapped for the purpose of enslavement and sale in markets,” Al-Karib said. “They are transported across the border to African countries neighbouring Sudan.”</p><p>She added that women’s bodies are being used “as weapons in this war … to defeat communities”, leaving survivors crushed by stigma and often refusing to return to their families out of shame.</p><h2><strong>Punishing the Masalit</strong></h2><p>The systematic nature of these crimes was further confirmed by Arnold Tsunga, a lawyer and former Africa director for the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), who led a fact-finding mission to eastern Chad to interview refugees fleeing the violence.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera Arabic from Harare, Tsunga described his mission to Adre and Geneina as “heartbreaking”.</p><p>“The RSF are the ones who attacked the Masalit group… They were the majority of those subjected to sexual violence and rape,” Tsunga said.</p><p>“It is sad to see that violence is now being used systematically as a means and weapon of war … to forcibly remove people from their land and to punish Masalit men who tried to defend their land.”</p><p>Tsunga warned that the collapse of the rule of law has created an “absolute environment” for these crimes.</p><p>“The RSF are now the responsible authority in these areas… There are no justice institutions working,” he explained. “Impunity leads to more impunity … and this problem is related to rewarding criminals.”</p><h2><strong>Targeting infants</strong></h2><p>The scale of the violence has overwhelmed local hospitals. At the Omdurman Maternity Hospital, the director general described a pattern of atrocities that spares no one – not even babies.</p><p>“The rapes are in very large numbers, far more than what is recorded,” Imad al-Din Abdullah al-Siddiq told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“More than 14 female infants less than the age of two were raped. An infant! This is documented by NGOs,” he said.</p><p>Al-Siddiq noted that the hospital received a flood of victims aged 11 to 23, mostly unmarried girls. “They come as a result of pregnancy… Abortions were performed for those less than three months… For those more than three months, we didn’t have a licence to abort, so the pregnancy continued, and births took place here.”</p><p>UNICEF has confirmed more than 200 cases of sexual assault on children since the start of 2024, some less than the age of five.</p><h2><strong>A systematic pattern</strong></h2><p>The SIHA report outlines a calculated three-stage pattern accompanying RSF advances: Initial home invasions and looting accompanied by rape, followed by attacks in public spaces, and finally long-term detention.</p><p>This violence occurs against a backdrop of worsening famine. The United Nations’ World Food Programme warned it will cut rations in Sudan from January due to severe funding gaps, leaving millions at risk of starvation.</p><p>Meanwhile, international pressure is mounting. The United Kingdom recently sanctioned four senior RSF commanders over alleged mass killings and sexual violence.</p><p>But for survivors like Mariam and Um Kulthum, the diplomatic moves offer little solace. As Al-Karib noted, the international investment in reintegrating these women remains “very, very small”.</p><p><em>*Names have been changed to protect the identity of survivors.</em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Israeli military said that the attacks had hit targets associated with the Lebanese group Hezbollah and the Palestinian group Hamas.</p><p>Then, on Tuesday, Israel conducted more attacks in southern Lebanon, saying that it was targeting Hezbollah operatives.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"weakened-hezbollah\">Weakened Hezbollah</h2><p>Israel has killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon since October 2023, as part of its war with Hezbollah.</p><p>Most of the dead were killed between September and November 2024, when more than 1.2 million people were displaced by Israel’s evacuation warnings.</p><p>The World Bank estimates that Israel left Lebanon with approximately $11bn in needs for reconstruction and recovery.</p><p>The war also deeply diminished Hezbollah’s power in the country. Much of its military leadership was killed during the intensification, including its longtime leader <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>. In the war’s aftermath, the group is being pressured to give up the weapons that have long defined its identity as a “resistance” group to Israel.</p><p>In August 2025, the Lebanese government <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/hezbollah-to-treat-lebanons-disarmament-decision-as-if-it-does-not-exist\">approved a plan</a> to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm Hezbollah. The decision was domestically popular outside of Hezbollah’s support base as a way of strengthening the Lebanese state, but also came as a result of increasing pressure from the US and Israel.</p><p>For its part, Hezbollah has repeatedly rejected calls for disarmament. The group says that Israel has not abided by its side of the ceasefire.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“To demand exclusive arms control while Israel is committing aggression and the United States is imposing its will on Lebanon…means that you are not working in Lebanon’s interest but rather in the interest of what Israel wants,” Nasrallah’s successor, Naim Qassem, said in a speech on January 3, 2026.</p><p>“We call for equipping the Lebanese Army to enable it to be an army for the country that protects against enemies, in addition to the other tasks it is doing in the face of drug and theft gangs, all spies and those who tamper with the country’s security.”</p><h2 id=\"internal-confrontation-in-lebanon\">Internal confrontation in Lebanon?</h2><p>Still, Hezbollah has largely been disarmed south of the Litani River, according to Lebanese Army and government officials. Lebanese military officials have said the only places they were unable to operate in removing Hezbollah weapons and infrastructure were near the Israeli-occupied five points.</p><p>The deadline to disarm below the Litani was the end of 2025. Lebanon’s cabinet is set to meet on Thursday to discuss “phase two” of the disarmament plan, which would entail disarming Hezbollah and Palestinian militias from the area between the Litani River, situated about 30km (19 miles) from the Israeli border and running along southern Lebanon, to the Awali River, which runs just north of Sidon. There are about 40km (25 miles) of territory between the Litani and Awali.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam wrote on social media that his government was focused on ending Israeli attacks, removing Israeli troops from the five points in south Lebanon and returning Lebanese detainees held by Israel.</p><p>“We promise to continue together the path of reform and the extension of state authority,” he wrote.</p><p>Salam and others in the Lebanese government admit that the LAF are not strong enough to confront Israel directly. In turn, they have tried to appeal to regional allies and the international community.</p><p>“Appealing to the international community to pressure Israel is a necessary but limited strategy,” Imad Salamey, a political scientist at Lebanese American University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“While diplomatic engagement can help restrain the scale of Israeli operations and preserve space for negotiations, it is unlikely on its own to halt attacks unless paired with clear, verifiable progress on disarmament and credible security guarantees. In practice, international actors tend to place greater pressure on Lebanon to deliver results on the ground than on Israel to exercise restraint, which reduces the effectiveness of this approach unless Lebanon can anchor it to a concrete bargain linking implementation to measurable Israeli de-escalation.”</p><p>The Lebanese government is in a difficult position, without many cards to play. Hezbollah has largely not impeded the Lebanese Army’s work south of the Litani. But should Israeli attacks continue, analysts believe the group won’t be as accommodating going forward.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese political analyst close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera that for the group to begin discussions of disarmament, Israel must first stop attacking Lebanon and release prisoners, and the Lebanese state must begin reconstructing the damage done by Israel during and since the war.</p><p>“Only then can the future of weapons be discussed,” he said.</p><p>Kassir warned that failure to address those issues before implementing the second phase of the disarmament plan will spark tensions.</p><p>“Otherwise, we will face a confrontation.”</p><h2 id=\"hezbollah-battered-but-not-defeated\">Hezbollah battered but not defeated</h2><p>The Lebanese government, meanwhile, is caught between increasing pressure from the US and Israel, and Hezbollah’s refusal to disarm.</p><p>“As long as Israeli strikes continue, Hezbollah and its constituency can plausibly argue that disarmament beyond the south exposes them to greater vulnerability,” Salamey said.</p><p>“Israeli strikes function not only as military actions, but also as strategic messaging, aimed at undermining Lebanon’s claim that it has restored state authority and completed disarmament south of the Litani.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Israel has meanwhile tried to argue that Hezbollah is <a href=\"/features/2025/9/28/after-war-with-israel-how-is-lebanons-hezbollah-regrouping\">regrouping in the south</a>, despite counterclaims by the UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL, and has said the Lebanese Army is moving too slowly in its disarmament mission.</p><p>“If Israel continues its attacks while the LAF proceeds with phase two disarmament north of the Litani River, the repercussions could be severe,” Salamey said. “Israel may interpret any disruption or delay as justification to broaden its target set, thereby deepening instability and raising the risk of a wider confrontation at a moment when Lebanon is least able to absorb it.”</p><p>Should the Lebanese Army proceed with the second phase while Israel continues striking targets in Lebanon, analysts believe Hezbollah could feel threatened and respond aggressively.</p><p>And while foreign diplomats and analysts say that Hezbollah was greatly weakened by Israel’s war on Lebanon in 2024, they still believe the group is strong enough to confront any domestic challenges.</p><p>“Consequently, phase two risks evolving from a technical security measure into a broader political confrontation over sequencing, guarantees, and internal stability in Lebanon,” Salamey said.</p><p>“The LAF may face internal friction and localized resistance, placing strain on civil–military relations and national cohesion,” Salamey added. “Hezbollah, even if avoiding direct confrontation with the army, could respond through political obstruction or calibrated escalation with Israel, increasing the risk of miscalculation.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

All of these countries are significantly below the US military in all metrics, including the number of active personnel, military aircraft, combat tanks, naval assets and their military budgets.</p><p>In a standard war involving tanks, planes and naval power, the US maintains overwhelming superiority.</p><p>The only notable metric that these countries have over the US is their paramilitary forces, which operate alongside the regular armed forces, often using asymmetrical warfare and unconventional tactics against conventional military strategies.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4218984\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4218984\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4218984\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-Latin-America-military-capabilities-JAN6-2026-1767695033.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Latin America military capabilities - JAN6, 2026-1767695033\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4218984\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"paramilitaries-across-latin-america\">Paramilitaries across Latin America</h2><p>Several Latin American countries have long histories of paramilitary and irregular armed groups that have often played a role in the internal security of these countries. These groups are typically armed, organised and politically influential but operate outside the regular military chain of command.</p><p>Cuba has the world’s third largest paramilitary force, made up of more than 1.14 million members, as reported by Global Firepower. These groups include state-controlled militias and neighbourhood defence committees. The largest of these, the Territorial Troops Militia, serves as a civilian reserve aimed at assisting the regular army against external threats or during internal crises.</p><p>In Venezuela, members of pro-government armed civilian groups known as “colectivos” have been accused of enforcing political control and intimidating opponents. Although not formally part of the armed forces, they are widely seen as operating with state tolerance or support, particularly during periods of unrest under Maduro.</p><p>In Colombia, right-wing paramilitary groups emerged in the 1980s to fight left-wing rebels. Although officially demobilised in the mid-2000s, many later re-emerged as criminal or neo-paramilitary organisations, remaining active in rural areas. The earliest groups were organised with the involvement of the Colombian military following guidance from US counterinsurgency advisers during the Cold War.</p><p>In Mexico, heavily armed drug cartels function as de facto paramilitary forces. Groups such as the Zetas, originally formed by former soldiers, possess military-grade weapons and exercise territorial control, often outgunning local police and challenging the state’s authority. The Mexican military has increasingly been deployed in law enforcement roles in response.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"history-of-us-interference-in-latin-america\">History of US interference in Latin America</h2><p>Over the past two centuries, the US has repeatedly<a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/a-timeline-of-cia-operations-in-latin-america\"> interfered in Latin America</a>.</p><p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the so-called Banana Wars saw US forces deployed across Central America to protect corporate interests.</p><p>In 1934, President Franklin D Roosevelt introduced the “Good Neighbor Policy”, pledging nonintervention.</p><p>Yet during the Cold War, the US financed operations to overthrow elected governments, often coordinated by the CIA, founded in 1947.</p><p>Panama is the only Latin American country the US has formally invaded, which occurred in 1989 under President George HW Bush. “Operation Just Cause” ostensibly was aimed at removing President Manuel Noriega, who was later convicted of drug trafficking and other offences.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

The oil companies are ready to go.”</p><p>But are they? It is less certain than Trump makes it sound.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>When reporters sought concrete details about the investments, Trump declined to offer them. Speaking on ABC’s This Week on January 4, Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed Trump, saying he expects “dramatic interest from Western companies”, without offering specifics.</p><p>When contacted for comment, the White House told PolitiFact that the administration has had <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/5/trump-administration-sets-meetings-with-oil-companies-on-venezuela-report\">conversations with multiple oil companies</a>, without naming any of them.</p><p>“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.</p><p>The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry’s leading trade association in the US, said in a statement to PolitiFact that the group is “closely watching” the developments.</p><p>“Globally, energy companies make investment decisions based on stability, the rule of law, market forces, and long-term operational considerations,” the statement said.</p><p>A ConocoPhillips spokesperson gave a similar response, according to media reports, saying the company “is monitoring developments”, but that it would be “premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.”</p><p>Experts told PolitiFact that there is ample reason for caution about a surge of new private investment in Venezuelan oil infrastructure. While Venezuela’s oil reserves are the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">world’s largest</a>, obstacles include the high up-front costs for building infrastructure, limited profit potential amid today’s low oil prices and continuing concerns about political stability.</p><p>“I do not see a compelling business case for any US-based company to invest billions of dollars over years to decades to try to turn a profit in Venezuelan oil,” said Hugh Daigle, a professor with the University of Texas at Austin’s petroleum and geo-systems engineering department.</p><p>Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis with GasBuddy, a gasoline price app, said the uncertainty over Venezuela’s governance is likely to worry oil companies.</p><p>“Oil companies probably aren’t chomping at the bit to invest billions of dollars and take their chances until there’s clarity in the Venezuelan regime,” De Haan said. “I don’t believe there will be, beyond a negligible impact from the situation, potentially for years, and even then, only if things go very right.”</p><h2><strong>What would be the upsides of oil industry investment in Venezuela?</strong></h2><p>US companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips exited Venezuela after Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s predecessor, moved to nationalise the oil industry in 2007. Chevron is the only major US oil company that has been consistently producing oil in Venezuela in recent years.</p><p>How Venezuela’s nationalised, and in some cases internationally sanctioned, oil resources are opened will determine who benefits, said Kenneth Gillingham, a Yale University professor of environmental and energy economics.</p><p>If the market were opened only to the biggest US oil corporations, those companies would <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye\">mainly benefit</a>, but their gains would be more limited if the market also were opened to companies based outside the US, Gillingham said. US motorists could benefit from increased production pushing prices lower, but those gains would depend heavily on global market factors.</p><p>Some oil companies could be attracted to Venezuela because it would allow them to diversify their investments, said Skip York, a fellow at Rice University’s Centre for Energy Studies.</p><p>Compared with crude oil in many countries, Venezuelan crude is relatively heavy. That means it takes longer to extract, but once the wells are in place, they can keep producing for longer periods of time.</p><p>The US generally doesn’t produce heavy crude from its own deposits, but a portion of the US refinery sector is specifically built to handle it. So having a steady supply of heavy Venezuelan crude could keep these refineries operational. Rubio cited this opportunity on This Week.</p><p>If Venezuela returns to political and economic stability, York said, “one could expect returns of 15 percent to 20 percent, which could be competitive with other development opportunities.”</p><h2><strong>Obstacles remain for US oil companies </strong></h2><p>Oil experts cited several challenges to achieving large profits from Venezuelan reserves:</p><p><strong>The up-front cost of improving infrastructure will be significant.</strong> “The Venezuelan oil industry has been nationalised for many decades now and has suffered from a lack of investment, both foreign and domestic,” Daigle said. New investment would be needed to keep facilities and operations up to date, with no certainty of payback.</p><p><strong>Venezuela’s political situation remains unsettled.</strong> “Not many companies are going to rush to go into an environment where there’s not stability,” Ali Moshiri, who headed Chevron’s operations in Venezuela until 2017 and now runs a private oil company with interests there, told The New York Times.</p><p>At a minimum, Venezuela would need a new petroleum law framework, York said. Even after all the legal and financial issues have been resolved, he said, it would take “years to refurbish infrastructure and drill new wells”.</p><p><strong>Oil prices are low.</strong> High up-front infrastructure costs and risks from political instability could be justified financially if oil prices were high enough. But prices are relatively low. Since Trump became president, crude oil’s price per barrel has fallen by about one-quarter.</p><p>“With oil (prices) near multi-year lows, oil companies likely won’t be running to spend money in Venezuela that could further erode oil prices,” De Haan said.</p><p>The reluctance to spend significantly to expand production can already be seen domestically in declining industry efforts to drill new US wells. A weekly count of oil rigs in use in the US shows a 16 percent decline since their most recent peak in April. If companies aren’t eager to spend on drilling in the US, with its established infrastructure and relative political stability, it’s not clear that they would go all in on Venezuela.</p><p><strong>The long-term importance of oil depends on the future of electric vehicles. </strong>“If we continue using lots of oil and oil prices stay high, then it is likely that new entrants in Venezuela would recoup their investments over time,” Gillingham said. “However, if electric vehicles continue to come down in price and really take off, in the US and globally, this will keep a lid on oil prices and make it less likely that the investment costs will be recouped.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US launched a war against Mexico in 1846 that saw US troops occupy Mexico City and annex enormous swaths of territory, including modern-day California, Nevada, and New Mexico.</p><p>Later, during the Mexican Revolution, from 1910 to 1920, US Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson worked with conservative forces in Mexico to overthrow the country’s pro-reform president.</p><p>US forces also bombed the port city of Veracruz in 1914 and sent forces into northern Mexico to hunt down revolutionary leader Pancho Villa.</p><p>“These are seen as important moments in Mexican history,” said Piccato.</p><p>“There is a quote attributed to Mexican President Porfirio Diaz, ‘Poor Mexico. So far from God, so close to the United States.'”</p><p>In recent statements, Trump has linked the US’s history in the region to his present-day agenda. While announcing Saturday’s strike, he cited the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century policy that the US has used to assert primacy over the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>“The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot. They now call it the ‘Donroe Doctrine’,” Trump said.</p><p>On Monday, the US State Department also <a href=\"https://x.com/StateDept/status/2008221563888292207?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared</a> an image of Trump on social media with the caption: “This is OUR hemisphere.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"balancing-on-a-thin-wire\">‘Balancing on a thin wire’</h2><p>Sheinbaum’s insistence on Mexican sovereignty has not prevented her from offering concessions to Trump on key priorities, such as migration, security and commerce.</p><p>When faced with Trump’s threats of 25 percent tariffs last February, Sheinbaum <a href=\"https://x.com/Claudiashein/status/1886434747238514776\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agreed</a> to deploy 10,000 Mexican National Guard troops to her country’s border with the US, to help limit irregular immigration and drug-trafficking.</p><p>Mexico has also maintained close security ties with the US and cooperated in its operations against criminal groups<strong>,</strong> including through the extradition of some drug traffickers.</p><p>In February, for instance, Sheinbaum’s government extradited 29 criminal suspects that the US accused of drug trafficking and other charges. In August, it sent another 26 suspects to the US, earning a statement of gratitude from the Trump administration.</p><p>Washington has historically pressured Mexico to take a hardline stance towards combating drugs, leading to policies that some Mexicans blame for increasing violence and insecurity in their country.</p><p>Still, while Sheinbaum has received praise for managing relations with Trump, she has consistently said that unilateral US military action on Mexican territory would be a red line.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Experts say Sheinbaum’s willingness to cooperate should be an incentive for the US government not to launch attacks on Mexican soil.</p><p>“Sheinbaum has gone out of her way to cooperate with the US,” said Stephanie Brewer, the director of the Mexico programme at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a US-based research group. “There would be no rational reason to break this bilateral relationship by crossing the one red line Mexico has set out.”</p><p>But the strikes on Venezuela have also underscored the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive posture towards Latin America.</p><p>“I don’t think US strikes on Mexican territory are any more or less likely than they were before the attacks in Venezuela,” said Brewer. “But they do make it abundantly clear that the Trump administration’s threats need to be taken seriously, and that the US is willing to violate international law in its use of military force.”</p><p>“Sheinbaum is doing a balancing act on an increasingly thin wire,” she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They also noted they had increased their investments in Arctic security, and offered to do more in consultation with the US and other NATO allies.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also warned that threats against a NATO member undermined the alliance’s credibility. “No member should attack or threaten another ‌member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.

That’ll be key to assessing the significance of this,” Finley told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“In a month, that’s essentially all Venezuelan output. In a year, it’s pretty small.”</p><p>Scott Montgomery, an expert on the global energy sector at the University of Washington, said Trump’s comments about controlling oil revenues only added to the uncertainty surrounding his administration’s plans.</p><p>“I have no real idea about how Trump might distribute the cash. There’s not much of a precedent for this kind of thing, to say the least, at least not in the US,” Montgomery told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Analysts say restoring Venezuela’s production to anything close to its 1990s peak of more than three million bpd would require massive investment and could take years.</p><p>Venezuela’s oil sector would need capital investment of about $110bn to return to output of about two million bpd, according to an estimate by Rystad Energy, a Norway-based consultancy.</p><p>“A significant amount of upfront scientific and engineering work has to be done to understand the condition of the productive reservoirs – these have changed over time, with key properties altered,” Montgomery said.</p><p>Some market watchers are sceptical that US companies will commit to large investments in the country, given their experiences of asset seizures under Chavez and the glut of oil in the global market.</p><p>ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were awarded $1.6bn and $8.7bn, respectively, in international arbitration following the Chavez government’s nationalisation of the country’s last privately-operated oil fields in 2007. Venezuela’s government did not pay out in either case.</p><p>Chevron is the only major US oil company still operating in Venezuela, producing about 150,000 bpd.</p><p>Venezuela once ranked among the world’s top oil producers, but US sanctions and years of underinvestment, mismanagement, and corruption under Maduro and Chavez reduced the sector to a shadow of its former self.</p><p>While the Latin American country holds the largest known oil reserves, its current output accounts for less than 1 percent of global supply.</p></div></div></body></html>"
