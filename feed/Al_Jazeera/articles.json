rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> on Thursday that the new initiative involves a clean cooking project in Myanmar, which distributes efficient cookstoves that reduce pressure on local forests. Implemented in partnership with a South Korean company, the project will generate credits that will count towards the climate targets of South Korea and Myanmar.</p><p>“Over two billion people globally are without access to clean cooking, which kills millions every year. Clean cooking protects health, saves forests, cuts emissions and helps empower women and girls, who are typically hardest hit by household air pollution,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said in a statement.</p><p>The new mechanism “can support solutions that make a big difference in people’s daily lives, as well as channelling finance to where it delivers real-life benefits on the ground”, Stiell added.</p><p>But some critics fear that, if set up poorly, such schemes can undermine the world’s efforts to curb global warming by allowing countries or companies to greenwash – or overstate – their emissions reductions.</p><p>The UN climate agency said the credited emissions reductions are 40 percent lower than under a previous scheme, as more conservative calculations are applied under the new Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM).</p><p>“Our focus is on building confidence in this market from the outset, and this first issuance shows that the system is working as intended,” Jacqui Ruesga, vice chair of the UN body supervising the PACM, said in a statement.</p><p>The stoves in the Myanmar project burn woody biomass more efficiently, meaning they need less fuel and emit far less smoke inside the home. But at current rates, only 78 percent of the population is expected to have access to clean cooking by 2030, the World Health Organization said.</p><p>The 2015 Paris Agreement, which commits the world to <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/world-very-likely-to-exceed-1-5c-climate-goal-in-next-decade-un\">limiting warming to well below 2C (3.6F)</a> and ideally at 1.5C (2.7F), also envisaged that countries could take part in cross-border trade of carbon reductions.</p><p>New rules were agreed at the UN’s COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan in 2024 for the carbon market mechanism. At the time, Greenpeace said the agreement left loopholes that would allow fossil fuel companies to continue polluting. But other environmentalists said that, while not perfect, it provided some clarity that was absent from global efforts to regulate carbon credits.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

from Myanmar has been found dead in Buffalo, New York, days after the United States Border Patrol left him miles away from his home following his release from a county jail, authorities said.</p><p>The body of Nurul Amin Shah Alam, 56, was located by police officers in the city in upstate New York on Tuesday evening, a Buffalo Police Department spokesperson said on Wednesday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of

Sean Ryan, a Democrat, said in a statement on Wednesday that Shah Alam’s death was preventable and the result of “inhumane” decision-making by federal immigration authorities.</p><p>“A vulnerable man – nearly blind and unable to speak English – was left alone on a cold winter night ‌with no known attempt to leave him in a safe, secure location,” Ryan said.</p><p>“That decision from US Customs and Border Protection was unprofessional and inhumane,” he added.</p><p>Several US representatives called for an investigation into the circumstances of Shah Alam’s death on Wednesday, including Grace Meng, a Democrat representing areas of New York City, who described a “shocking breach of responsibility and basic humanity by federal enforcement”.</p><p></p><p>Mohamad Faisal, one of Shah Alam’s children, said nobody had told his family or their lawyer where their father had been left by authorities after his release from prison, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Faisal said the family were Rohingya refugees from Arakan state, officially known as Rakhine state, in Myanmar, and that his father could not read, write or use electronic devices.</p><p>He said his father’s arrest a year ago was due to a misunderstanding after police were called when Shah Alam wandered onto private property, while carrying a curtain rod he had purchased as a walking stick due to his impaired vision.</p><p>His father had not understood when police, speaking in English, told him to drop the curtain rod, and he was held in jail for close to one year, before being released following a misdemeanour plea deal, Faisal said.</p><p>His father had only wanted to “eat home-cooked food” and “be united with the rest of [his] family”, he added.</p><p>In a statement to Investigative Post, a Buffalo-based news outlet, a US Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson said agents dropped Shah Alam off at a coffee shop after agents determined he had entered the country as a refugee and could not be deported.</p><p>“Border Patrol agents offered him a courtesy ride, which he chose to accept to a coffee shop, determined to be a warm, safe location near his last known address, rather than be released directly from the Border Patrol station,” the agency said.</p><p>“He showed no signs of distress, mobility issues or disabilities requiring special assistance,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>Temperatures in Buffalo, a city near the Canadian border, were below freezing last weekend.</p><p>The death is being investigated by homicide detectives, the spokesperson from the Buffalo Police Department said, according to Reuters.</p><p>Shah Alam’s death comes as an immigration crackdown enforced by the administration of US President Donald Trump is facing increased scrutiny.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/us-witnessed-many-ice-related-deaths-in-2026-here-are-their-stories\">At least six immigrants</a> have died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)

In another incident, the report added, three Israeli military vehicles temporarily penetrated the Abu Madharah farm.</p><p>Syria’s southern regions, including Quneitra, have long witnessed Israeli territorial violations, sowing fear, detaining civilians, erecting checkpoints and gates and destroying farmland.</p><p>But since the toppling of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, those have become more brazen, violent and frequent. Israel has launched multiple bombing raids on the country and also intervened last summer in an eruption of violence in Syria’s restive Suwayda.</p><p>According to a tally by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), Israel launched an average of two attacks a day for a total of more than 600 air, drone or artillery attacks across Syria throughout 2025.</p><p>The ⁠Syrian ⁠government and Druze factions carried out their first ⁠prisoner swap in Suwayda on Thursday since those deadly clashes in July, the Syrian government’s ⁠Suwayda media office said.</p><p>The exchange involved Damascus releasing 61 prisoners from the Druze factions detained in Adra Central Prison near the capital, in ‌return for the Druze’s National Guard Forces freeing 25 Syrian government personnel, the media office said. The operation took place under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p><p>Violence in Suwayda erupted on July 13 between Bedouin tribal fighters and Druze factions. Government forces were sent in to quell the fighting, but the bloodshed worsened, and Israel carried out strikes on Syrian troops, and also <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/ceasefire-collapses-in-syrias-suwayda-as-israel-threatens-escalation\">bombed the heart of the capital Damascus</a>, under the pretext of protecting the Druze.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Quneitra is located in the Golan Heights, which the UN recognises as part of Syria. Israel seized 1,200sq km (463sq miles) of the western part of that region in the Six-Day War in 1967. During the <a href=\"/features/2018/10/8/the-october-arab-israeli-war-of-1973-what-happened\">1973 Arab-Israeli War</a>, Syria attempted to take back the Golan Heights but failed.</p><p>The conflict ended with a disengagement agreement in 1974 that saw the establishment of a UN buffer zone, which separates Israeli-occupied territory from the remaining part that is still under Syria’s control. Part of the Quneitra province lies inside the buffer zone.</p><p>Once the al-Assad regime fell, Israel pushed deeper into Syrian territory, occupying the buffer zone and saying the 1974 deal with Syria had collapsed. It also <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/israel-launches-fresh-raids-in-syrias-quneitra-establishes-checkpoints\">advanced into the Quneitra area</a>, setting up two military checkpoints last year in the villages of Ain Ziwan and al-Ajraf.</p><p>The government in Damascus has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the agreement, saying that continued Israeli violations hinder efforts to restore stability in the region.</p><p>Syria and Israel have been conducting intermittent talks to reach a security agreement. That culminated in early January with the two countries agreeing to set up a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/israel-syria-agree-to-dedicated-communication-line-in-us-brokered-talks\">joint mechanism</a> for sharing intelligence and coordinating military de-escalation under US supervision.</p><p>Still, Syrian officials maintain that any durable deal will be difficult until Israel produces a clear and enforceable timeline for the pullout of its troops from Syrian territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The number has since declined, with some countries repatriating their citizens.</p><p>Al-Baba said Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in contact with the governments of third-country citizens to discuss the next steps regarding them.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For example, 18K gold will typically have a stamp of 750, signifying that it is 75 percent pure.</p><p>It’s worth noting that different Islamic schools of thought differentiate between gold used as wearable jewellery and gold stored as an investment when determining whether it is subject to zakat.</p><h3>To calculate zakat on gold jewellery, you can follow this formula:</h3><ol>\n<li>Pure weight (24k)  = (Total weight of your gold item in grammes x karats)/24</li>\n<li>Gold price (g) = Current price of gold(in troy ounces)/31.1035</li>\n<li>Zakat amount = (Pure weight (24k) in grammes x gold price in grammes) x 0.025</li>\n</ol><p>For example, if you own an 18-karat necklace that weighs 40g:</p><ol>\n<li>Pure weight (24k) = (18 x 40)/24 = 30g</li>\n<li>Gold price (g) = $5,100/31.1035 = $164</li>\n<li>Zakat amount = (30 x 164)x0.025 = $123</li>\n</ol><p>If the necklace is your only savings, you would be below the nisab threshold.

It is an obligation requiring Muslims whose wealth exceeds the nisab threshold to donate 2.5 percent of their assets annually.</p><p><strong>Zakat al-fitr</strong> is a mandatory charitable donation of food before the Eid prayer, marking the end of Ramadan. It is given to help those in need to celebrate Eid. The amount is generally equivalent to the cost of one meal for a person.</p><h2 id=\"what-assets-are-zakatable\">What assets are zakatable?</h2><p>Zakat must be paid on assets and savings, kept to resell or profit from, including:</p><ul>\n<li>Saving and cash</li>\n<li>Gold and silver</li>\n<li>Business assets and profits</li>\n<li>Investments</li>\n<li>Agricultural produce and livestock</li>\n</ul><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3597010\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-ZAKATABLE-ASSETS-ZAKAT-MARCH-23-2025-1742716732.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C535&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-ZAKATABLE ASSETS-ZAKAT-MARCH 23, 2025-1742716732\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Zakat is<strong> not required</strong> on assets in use for daily life, such as:</p><ul>\n<li>The house you live in</li>\n<li>Your car</li>\n<li>Essential property like clothing, furniture and appliances</li>\n</ul><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3596998\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-NON-ZAKAT-ASSETS-ZAKAT-MARCH-23-2025-1742716644.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C262&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-NON ZAKAT ASSETS-ZAKAT-MARCH 23, 2025-1742716644\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"who-can-receive-zakat\">Who can receive zakat?</h2><p>Zakat is designed to help alleviate poverty and support the less fortunate. So it must be given to Muslims who meet the criteria of need and lack of wealth. The Quran specifies eight categories of people eligible to receive zakat:</p><ol>\n<li><strong>The poor</strong> – those with little or no income</li>\n<li><strong>The needy</strong> – those who have some resources but not enough for a stable life</li>\n<li><strong>Zakat administrators</strong> – individuals or organisations responsible for collecting and distributing zakat</li>\n<li><strong>New Muslims</strong> – converts or those inclined towards Islam who need financial support</li>\n<li><strong>People in debt</strong> – those burdened by debts they cannot repay</li>\n<li><strong>Stranded travellers</strong> – those who lack financial support while away from home</li>\n<li><strong>People working in welfare</strong> – individuals engaged in religious, educational, or humanitarian efforts</li>\n<li><strong>Captives and slaves</strong> – historically used to free enslaved people; now applied to modern equivalents like bonded labour.</li>\n</ol><p>Zakat cannot be given to immediate family members who are considered one’s financial responsibility (like parents, children or spouses). It cannot be given to those who have wealth above the nisab threshold, either.</p><h2 id=\"when-should-zakat-be-paid\">When should zakat be paid?</h2><p>Once a Muslim’s wealth surpasses the nisab threshold, they are required to pay zakat, provided they have had possession of this wealth for a full lunar year (known as hawl).</p><p>So, if someone’s wealth remains above the nisab threshold for an entire year, they are obligated to pay zakat.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3597004\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-WHEN-CAN-YOU-GIVE-ZAKAT-ZAKAT-MARCH-23-2025-1742716670.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHEN CAN YOU GIVE ZAKAT-ZAKAT-MARCH 23, 2025-1742716670\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>However, if wealth drops below the nisab during the year, there is no need to pay zakat.</p><p>For example, if someone’s wealth exceeds the nisab for several months but then drops below it before completing a full year, they are not required to pay zakat.

While it is encouraged to help those nearby, it can also be given internationally where there is a greater need.</p><p>By requiring wealthy individuals to give a portion of their assets, zakat prevents wealth from accumulating in the hands of a few and encourages a more equitable distribution of resources, promoting economic balance and reducing income inequality.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Children in traditional clothing roam the streets singing Ramadan songs, in a scene that revives longstanding customs.</p><p>“This gathering of children revives Mosuli and Iraqi heritage and teaches them the values of sharing and celebrating the holy month,” said Yasser Goyani, 31, a member of the Bytna Foundation for Culture, Arts and Heritage</p><p>Tarawih prayers, performed at night during Ramadan, have also returned to the Grand al-Nuri Mosque and its iconic leaning minaret, al-Hadba, for the first time in nearly nine years, just before the bombing of the mosque in 2017 by ISIL (ISIS) fighters at the peak of an Iraqi government campaign against the group that had taken control of the city.</p><p>“I feel great joy performing prayers again in the mosque after its restoration and reopening, which reflects its spiritual and historical importance,” adds Goyani.</p><p>The traditional storyteller, or hakawati, has also re-emerged during Ramadan evenings, recounting stories from Mosul’s past.</p><p>“The hakawati represents a link between the past and the present. We narrate stories about how life in Mosul used to be, especially during the holy month of Ramadan. Despite technological development, people still love returning to their old memories,” explained Abeer al-Ghanem, 52, who plays the storyteller.</p><p>Meanwhile, the musaharati – the traditional predawn caller who wakes people up for a small meal to help them cope with the daylong fast – still walks through neighbourhoods in the Old City of Mosul before dawn.</p><p>Ghufran Thamer, 34, who performs the role, says, “The musaharati reminds people of authentic Ramadan rituals and keeps the nights of Ramadan alive, despite the changes in modern life.”</p><p>Traditional games remain a key part of the Ramadan atmosphere.</p><p>“We have been playing the siniya game since the 1980s. It is closely associated with Ramadan and creates a warm and joyful atmosphere among participants during the nights,” said Fahad Mohammed Kashmoula, 55.</p><p>Mosul’s markets, particularly the historic Bab al-Saray, come alive during Ramadan as residents flock to buy seasonal staples. Dates are especially in demand, providing a quick source of energy for those fasting. Khalil Mahmoud, 65, who has been selling dates in Bab al-Saray for nearly 40 years, says date sales increase significantly during Ramadan, especially in this market.</p><p>“Dates are highly sought after by those fasting, because they help compensate for the sugar lost during the day,” he said</p><p>Raisin juice, another Ramadan drink, is also popular across the city.</p><p>“The juice is prepared from high-quality raisins and fresh mint from the mountains of Kurdistan. The raisins are soaked, strained, crushed and strained again before being poured into bags for sale. Shops become crowded as people seek to replenish their energy after fasting,” said Hussein Muwaffaq, a raisin juice maker.</p><p>Alongside religious and cultural activities, the city also sees growing humanitarian initiatives during Ramadan, including paying off the debts of people in need, distributing food baskets, setting up free iftar meals, and promoting the values of social solidarity.</p></div></div></body></html>"

name in the UK, notorious for his anti-Muslim rhetoric and multiple prison terms. He was also a cofounder of the now-defunct far-right English Defence League – a street protest movement.</p><p>US State Department official Joe Rittenhouse, who is a senior adviser for the department’s Consular Affairs bureau, said he met with Robinson, calling him a “free speech warrior”.</p><p>“Honored to have free speech warrior @TRobinsonNewEra at Department of State today. The World and the West is a better place when we fight for freedom of speech and no one has been on the front lines more than Tommy.

href=\"/news/2026/2/9/hong-kong-media-mogul-jimmy-lai-faces-sentencing-in-national-security-trial\">jailing</a> for 20 years on a separate national security charge.</p><p>The ruling by the Court of First Instance on Thursday said that it allowed the appeal from Lai and ⁠another defendant in the case to proceed as a lower court judge had “erred”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

quash the convictions and set aside the sentences,” the judges wrote.</p><p>The conviction that was overturned was from an earlier fraud case in which prosecutors alleged that a consultancy firm operated by Lai, 78, for his personal use had taken up office space that his now defunct media business – Apple Daily – rented for publication and printing purposes.</p><p>This was in breach of the terms of the lease Apple Daily signed with a government company and amounted to fraud, prosecutors said.</p><p>Lai had been sentenced to five years and nine months in prison in 2022 on the two fraud charges.</p><p>Former Apple Daily executive Wong Wai-keung was also charged in the same case and jailed for 21 months.</p><p>Judges at the Court of Appeal wrote in their judgement that while Apple Daily Printing had breached the lease terms by allowing the firm to use part of the space, it didn’t owe a duty to disclose its breach. They said even if it had owed and breached that duty, the same could not be attributed to Lai and Wong as a matter of law.</p><p>The trial judges’ “reasoning in concluding that the applicants were liable for the concealment as the prosecution contended is unsupportable”, they said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Neither defendant appeared in court.</p><p>The ruling would slightly reduce Lai’s total prison time. The judges handling Lai’s national security case allowed the two sentences to be served concurrently for only two years, with the other 18 years to be added after the fraud sentence.</p><p>The lengthy sentence – over ‌two counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and one for publishing seditious materials – has raised concerns that he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p><p>Lai’s children have expressed hopes that a visit by United States President Donald Trump to Beijing could help secure the release of their father, a British citizen. The White House has confirmed that Trump will travel to China on March 31 through April 2 to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p><p>United Kingdom Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said Lai was sentenced for exercising his right to freedom of expression and called on the Hong Kong authorities to release him on humanitarian grounds.</p><p>Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have defended Lai’s sentencing in the national security case, saying it reflected the spirit of the rule of law. They also insisted the security law is necessary for the city’s stability.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">In a separate ruling on Thursday, a Hong Kong court sentenced the father of a wanted pro-democracy activist to eight months in prison under the city’s national security law for attempting to withdraw funds belonging to an “absconder”.</p><p>Kwok Yin-sang, 69, was found guilty on February 11 for “attempting to deal with, directly or indirectly, any funds or other financial assets or economic resources” after he tried to terminate his daughter Anna Kwok’s insurance policy and withdraw the funds.</p><p>He is the first person in the city to be charged and convicted of the offence.</p><p>He had pleaded not guilty and did not testify at the trial.</p></div></div></body></html>"

missiles, capable of targeting South Korea, according to KCNA.</p><p>He also said the accelerated development of Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes in recent years had “permanently cemented” the country’s status as a nuclear-armed state.</p><p>“Our status as a nuclear-armed country plays an important role in deterring enemies’ potential threats and maintaining regional stability,” Kim said, calling the country’s nuclear weapons “a guarantee and safety device” of its security and interests.</p><p>According to South Korea’s official Yonhap News Agency, the once <a

But since the US abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last month and took control of the country’s oil exports, Caracas’s supply to Cuba has ceased.</p><p>Mexico, which had emerged as an alternate supplier, also halted shipments to the Caribbean island after the US threatened tariffs on countries that send oil to Cuba. The US blockade has worsened an energy crisis in Cuba that is hitting power generation and fuel for vehicles, houses and aviation.</p><p>The shift in US policy came as Caribbean leaders gathering in Saint Kitts and Nevis expressed alarm at the impacts of the blockade on the island nation of some 10.9 million people. Speaking to Caribbean leaders during a meeting of the regional political group CARICOM on Tuesday, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness affirmed solidarity with Cuba.</p><p></p><p>“Humanitarian suffering serves no one,” Holness said at the meeting. “A prolonged crisis in Cuba will not remain confined to Cuba.”</p><p>The Caribbean summit’s host, Saint Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Terrance Drew, who <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/why-is-the-us-targeting-cubas-global-medical-missions\">studied in Cuba to be a doctor</a>, said friends have told him of food scarcity and rubbish strewn in the streets.</p><p>“A destabilised Cuba will destabilise all of us,” Drew said.</p><p>But addressing the meeting in Saint Kitts and Nevis on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed that the humanitarian crisis had been caused by the Cuban government’s policies, not Washington’s blockade.</p><p>Rubio, whose parents migrated to the US from Cuba in 1956, warned that the sanctions would be snapped back if the oil winds up going to the government or military.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Cuba needs to change. It needs to change dramatically because it is the only chance that it has to improve the quality of life for its people,” Rubio told reporters.</p><p>It is “a system that’s in collapse, and they need to make dramatic reforms”, he said.</p><p>Rubio went on to blame economic mismanagement and the lack of a vibrant private sector for the dire situation in Cuba, which has been under communist rule since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution.</p><p>“This is the worst economic climate Cuba has faced. And it is the authorities there, and that government, who are responsible for that,” Rubio said.</p><p>The US pressure on Venezuela and Cuba ⁠has left several fuel cargoes undelivered since December, according to the Reuters news agency, contributing to the island’s inability to keep the lights on and cars circulating. A Cuba-related vessel that loaded Venezuelan gasoline in early February at a port operated by state-run company PDVSA remained this week anchored in Venezuelan waters waiting for authorisation to set sail.</p><p>Mexico and Canada have meanwhile announced they would be sending aid to Cuba, and Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak also said his government was discussing the possibility of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/russia-considers-fuel-support-for-cuba-as-canada-pledges-food-aid\">providing fuel</a> to the island.</p><p>Separately on Wednesday, Cuba’s Ministry of the Interior announced <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/cuban-border-agents-fire-upon-florida-tagged-speedboat-killing-four\">killing four people</a> and wounding six others on board a Florida-registered speedboat that it said entered Cuban waters.</p><p>Rubio told reporters it was not a US operation and that no US government personnel were involved.</p><p>“Suffice it to say, it is highly unusual to see shootouts in open sea like that,” he said. “ It’s not something that happens every day. It’s something frankly that hasn’t happened with Cuba in a very long time.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its leaders claimed broad public backing and strong electoral prospects, even hinting at forming a future government.</p><p>But reality soon set in. Despite the momentum and widespread support the student leaders enjoyed during the uprising, the NCP could not organise itself into a grassroots organisation capable enough for an electoral race to the parliament on its own. Opinion polls in the lead-up to the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/like-eid-bangladeshis-hail-landmark-election-many-vote-after-17-years\">February 12 election</a> suggested the party’s support hovered in low single digits.</p><p>Eventually, the NCP struck a deal with the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/what-is-bangladeshs-jamaat-e-islami-party-could-it-lead-the-country-next\">Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami</a> party as a junior coalition partner, contesting just 30 of the 300 parliamentary seats and winning six. A coalition led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) swept the polls, winning a landslide 212 seats, while the Jamaat-led alliance secured 77.</p><p>But the victory of an established party has not dented Amin’s spirits.</p><p>“We did well this election as a new party,” he told Al Jazeera from the Kushtia district in western Bangladesh. “We have only begun. In the next few election cycles, the NCP will emerge as the new big thing.”</p><h2 id=\"from-uprising-to-parliament\">From uprising to parliament</h2><p>Several NCP leaders, who rose to prominence during the <a href=\"/features/2026/2/13/what-does-bnps-landslide-mean-for-bangladeshs-post-uprising-order\">2024 uprising</a>, are now members of parliament.</p><p>For their supporters, six seats represent an unlikely breakthrough for a nascent political party. For critics, however, the party’s performance underscores the structural limits of a protest movement transitioning into formal politics.</p><p>NCP spokesman Asif Mahmud, who headed the party’s election steering committee, described the poll outcome as encouraging.</p><p>“For a party that is only 11 months old, it was a very good performance,” he told Al Jazeera. “Of course, it could have been better. We expected more. But considering the circumstances, we are happy.”</p><p>Mahmud argued that the NCP may have lost two or three additional seats by narrow margins due to alleged vote-counting irregularities. When pressed about evidence, he said the party had already registered its concerns during the election process.</p><p>Still, he acknowledged that entering the electoral race required compromise. Initially, he said, the NCP had preferred to contest independently. “But given the political structure, to ensure representation and survival, we had to enter into an alliance,” he said.</p><p>That alliance – with the Jamaat – has become the defining tension of the NCP’s post-election future.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4308992\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4308992\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4308992\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/epa_698dfdc0a065-1770913216.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C436&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"epa12731464 A group of young women take a selfie and show their inked thumbs after casting their votes at a polling centre at Dania College, at Dhaka Government Muslim High School in Dhaka, Bangladesh, 12 February 2026.

Despite the party’s more recent commitments to stick to the country’s inclusive, secular constitution – it even had a <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/6/if-jamaat-comes-to-power-bangladeshi-hindus-will-be-safe-i-am-the-proof\">Hindu candidate</a> in the elections for the first time – the decision to ally with the Jamaat triggered internal rifts within the NCP.</p><p>More than a dozen senior party leaders resigned within a week of the announcement of the alliance because they felt that a coalition with the Jamaat was fundamentally incompatible with the NCP’s ideology as well as the inclusive values that shaped the 2024 uprising. They feared the alliance would undermine the party’s credibility and its centrist base.</p><p>But Mahmud rejected such fears. “We are not doing shadow politics,” he told Al Jazeera. “If you observe our statements, they are not identical to Jamaat’s.”</p><p>Mahmud stressed that the arrangement with the Jamaat was an electoral alliance, “not a political merger”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>For now, the NCP says it is preparing to contest upcoming local government elections independently, though the leadership has not entirely ruled out another arrangement with Jamaat.</p><p>SM Suza Uddin, an NCP leader who contested the February 12 election from Bandarban, a border district with Myanmar, and lost, told Al Jazeera the party had “limited alternatives” at the time and described the alliance with the Jamaat as political pragmatism.</p><p>He claimed the NCP was a “generational corrective” to what he called a wider leadership crisis across all political parties. “Young politicians in many parties feel frustrated. People are hungry for change. Everywhere we went, we saw that desire,” he said.</p><p>“NCP is the hope, NCP is the alternative,” he added, arguing that having six parliamentarians provides the institutional experience to build upon.</p><p>But not everyone is convinced.</p><p>Anik Roy, a former NCP leader who resigned last year – before the Jamaat alliance was announced – believes the alliance has structurally tethered the party to the Jamaat.</p><p>“I don’t see any practical way for NCP to leave Jamaat now,” he said, noting that the role of the opposition parties inside parliament is already organised along alliance lines.</p><p>“The real test will be the local government elections,” Roy added. “If they again align with Jamaat, that will show their direction.”</p><p>He also questioned the party’s ideological clarity. “If they claim to be centrist, what does that mean? Centre-right or centre-left?” he asked. “In Bangladesh, those distinctions matter. But NCP has not yet clarified its values.”</p><p>Without the Jamaat’s backing, Roy argued, the party would likely have won no seats at all. “The foundation is fragile,” he told Al Jazeera. “They [NCP] risk becoming a proxy that strengthens Jamaat.”</p><p>Spokesman Mahmud disputes the notion that the party’s grassroots base is weak. “There is a tendency to assume that the BNP comes first in grassroots organisation, followed by Jamaat and then comes the NCP,” he said. “But the reality varies district by district.”</p><p>In some constituencies, he argued, NCP candidates outperformed expectations by focusing on local issues. He pointed to seats where long-term community engagement, rather than traditional patronage networks, delivered victories – even against the efforts of major parties.</p><p>“This is the model we want to expand,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"can-a-third-force-take-root\">Can a third force take root?</h2><p>Much of the NCP’s political capital stems from the 2024 uprising – the student-led movement that briefly united diverse opposition forces. At that time, leaders like <a href=\"/features/2026/2/11/nahid-islam-and-the-uneasy-alliance-that-could-shape-bangladeshs-vote\">Nahid Islam</a> and Mahmud enjoyed broad cross-party appeal. Islam, one of the most prominent faces of the July 2024 uprising, is now the NCP’s convener. He has been elected as a member of parliament from a Dhaka constituency and currently serves as the chief whip of the opposition alliance.</p><p>“Comparing the uprising period with party politics is not fair,” said Mahmud. “Once you enter partisan politics, clashes are inevitable.”</p><p>He noted that during the antigovernment protests in 2024, figures from BNP, Jamaat and other parties were part of a broader movement aimed at restoring democracy in Bangladesh. But after forming a party, the NCP turned into a political competitor – and therefore a target.</p><p>Asif Bin Ali, a geopolitical analyst and doctoral fellow at Georgia State University in the United States, sees that transition as decisive.</p><p>“In practice, the NCP has shown very little interest in becoming an autonomous third force,” he told Al Jazeera. “Since the election, it has not articulated any agenda distinct from Jamaat-e-Islami and seems quite comfortable operating under Jamaat’s umbrella.”</p><p>In his view, the party’s tactics increasingly resemble those of the established actors. “It is a traditional party with younger faces,” he said.</p><p>Political scientist Abdul Latif Masum, a retired professor of government and politics at Jahangirnagar University, believes the window for the NCP’s independent growth is narrow, although he called the party’s entry to parliament “a positive beginning”.</p><p>“The possibility of NCP developing into a strong, independent third force is limited,” he said, citing organisational weakness and internal divisions.</p><p>Still, he acknowledged that the emotional legitimacy of the 2024 upheaval has not entirely faded. If the party can consolidate and clarify its direction, “there remains some potential”.</p><p>For now, experts believe the NCP occupies an ambiguous space. It is formally present in parliament, symbolically tied to a historic mass uprising, and yet navigating alliances within a deeply polarised political system.</p><p>Spokesman Mahmud insists the party’s leadership should be judged by the work it does. The landmark February 12 election, he said, was a test – and the NCP has now “officially appeared as Bangladesh’s third force”.</p><p>But whether six seats translate into a third force will depend on what happens next, analysts say. Can the party expand beyond alliance politics, build deeper grassroots networks, and articulate a clearer ideological coherence?</p><p>Amin remains hopeful. For him, having six seats in parliament is not an endpoint, but proof that a student-led experiment can survive in Bangladesh’s hard-edged political terrain.</p><p>“We started on the streets. Now we are in parliament. We are not going back,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If they try to rebuild a nuclear weapon, that causes problems for us,” he told reporters at the White House. “In fact, we’ve seen evidence that they have tried to do exactly that.”</p><p>Vance went on to say that US President Donald Trump wanted to address “that problem diplomatically” but “has other options as well”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Tehran on Vance’s comments.</p><p>The status of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure remains unclear. Trump has claimed that US attacks on Iran last year “obliterated” the programme, but the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have not been permitted to verify what, if anything, remains at the targeted sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.</p><h2 id=\"big-big-problem\">‘Big, big problem’</h2><p>A day earlier, Trump, in his State of the Union address, appeared to lay the groundwork for another potential military confrontation, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/trump-says-preference-is-to-solve-iran-tensions-through-diplomacy\">accusing</a> Iran of harbouring “sinister nuclear ambitions” and developing missiles capable of striking the US – claims that Iranian officials flatly rejected.</p><p>“Whatever they’re alleging in regards to Iran’s nuclear program, Iran’s ballistic missiles, and the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/iran-rejects-fictional-narratives-power-grab-after-protest-killings\">number of casualties</a> during January’s unrest is simply the repetition of ‘big lies’,” Esmaeil Baghaei, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, wrote on X.</p><p>He went on to compare the Trump administration’s approach to the propaganda tactics of Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler’s minister of information.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking in Saint Kitts and Nevis, said the talks in Geneva would focus primarily on Iran’s nuclear programme and reiterated Washington’s concern about Iranian ballistic missiles, which he said it was attempting to develop into intercontinental-range weapons.</p><p>Iranian insistence on excluding the missile programme from negotiations, he said, was “a big, big problem”.</p><p>Araghchi said earlier that Iran’s missiles were of a “defence nature”.</p><p>“They are only to build deterrence and help us to defend ourselves,” he told the India Today news outlet.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from Tehran, said the two sides appear far apart on the core issues.</p><p>These include disagreements over Iranian uranium enrichment as well as non-nuclear issues “related to foreign assistance, ballistic missiles, defence capabilities, as well as regional activities of the country”.</p><p>“The bottom line is gaps obviously exist,” Asadi said. “And it remains to be seen whether diplomatic engagement could pave the way for a final solution between Washington and Tehran. Until then and for the time being, if anything is certain, that is uncertainty.”</p><p>The negotiations on Thursday are being led on the US side by Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. The first round was held in Oman on February 6, followed by a second session in Geneva on February 17.</p><p>Araghchi said afterwards that the two sides had reached a tentative understanding on the broad principles that would guide further discussions, though no substantive agreement had been reached.</p><h2 id=\"us-imposes-new-sanctions\">US imposes new sanctions</h2><p>Iran has warned that any US strike would prompt retaliatory attacks on American military bases throughout the Middle East, where tens of thousands of troops are deployed. Tehran has also threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway through which a significant share of the world’s oil supply passes.</p><p>Iran’s parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, summarised Tehran’s stance bluntly.</p><p>“If you choose the table of diplomacy – a diplomacy in which the dignity of the Iranian nation and mutual interests are respected – we will also be at that table,” he said on Wednesday, according to the semiofficial Student News Network. “But if you decide to repeat past experiences through deception, lies, flawed analysis and false information, and launch an attack in the midst of negotiations, you will undoubtedly taste the firm blow of the Iranian nation.”</p><p>US Central Command spokesman Tim Hawkins said Washington remained ready to respond to any escalation.</p><p>“Deterrence from our perspective comes through a show of strength,” he said on Wednesday.</p><p>“During a time of heightened tensions, we are going to make sure that we have the forces in place to protect our troops; that’s what you’re seeing. Additionally, with respect to Iran … our focus remains on ensuring we have the right forces in place to protect our troops, and that’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The US has assembled its biggest deployment of aircraft and warships to the Middle East in decades.</p><p>The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has been stationed in the Arabian Sea since late January, while Trump has ordered the USS Gerald R Ford – the world’s largest aircraft carrier – along with three destroyers and more than 5,000 additional military personnel to the region.</p><p>The build-up extends to air power.</p><p>Dozens of fighter jets, including F-35s, F-22s, F-15s and F-16s, have been tracked flying to the Middle East from bases in the US and Europe, according to the Military Air Tracking Alliance, a team of open-source analysts that monitors military flight activity.</p><p>Separately on Wednesday, the Department of the Treasury also announced <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/us-issues-new-sanctions-as-it-dials-up-pressure-on-iran\">sanctions</a> against more than 30 individuals, entities and vessels it said had helped finance Iran’s oil sales, ballistic missile programme and weapons production.</p><p>“Iran exploits financial systems to sell illicit oil, launder the proceeds, procure components for its nuclear and conventional weapons programs, and support its ‌terrorist proxies,” ‌Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said in a statement.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, said the US was seeking to increase its leverage with the military buildup as well as the latest sanctions.</p><p>“The hope is that Iran will come to an agreement to limit its uranium enrichment programme, and also that there can be room for negotiations later on, regarding not only its support for proxies in the region, but limiting its ballistic missile programme,” Halkett said. “The US is promising, should those concessions be made, it will provide the economic relief that Iran’s economy needs.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

She was considered an up-and-coming member of the left-wing Socialism and Liberty Party.</p><p>A Black woman from the favelas — Brazil’s densely populated, low-income neighbourhoods — Franco was best known for campaigning for the rights of LGBTQ people, racial minorities and women.</p><p>She had also used her platform to denounce excessive police violence in the favelas, as well as illicit land appropriations on the part of local authorities.</p><p>On March 14, 2018, after an evening debate in Rio de Janeiro, a car pulled alongside the vehicle carrying Franco and Gomes.</p><p>The assailant fired 13 bullets into their vehicle. Franco and Gomes were killed, and an aide also travelling in the vehicle was injured.</p><p>Prosecutors have called the attack an assassination, designed to silence Franco and prevent her from pushing back against powerful interests.</p><p>In Wednesday’s ruling, the Supreme Court justices found that former Congress member Chiquinho Brazao and his brother Domingos Brazao – a councillor on Rio’s state audit court – conspired to have Franco murdered in response to her efforts to end illegal land grabs.</p><p>The two brothers had profited from efforts to claim public lands in Rio de Janeiro for private development. Previously, they were considered among the most powerful politicians in the city.</p><p>They were arrested in 2024, and both were sentenced to 76 years in prison as part of Wednesday’s decision.</p><p>Lengthy prison terms were also handed to three of their co-defendants.

Masigan said what is happening in the Philippines is a consequence of an electorate choosing the “entitled son of a dictator” over a more competent candidate.</p><p>“[Marcos Jr] campaigned under the slogan and promise of unity. Economists and political pundits all assumed that there was a plan behind it. We’ve been waiting, and it has been three years. No such thing exists,” he said.</p><p>“His plan was to be president. It was a self-serving plan. It’s a presidency about Bongbong Marcos for Bongbong Marcos,” he added.</p><p>“He just wanted the opportunity to whitewash <a href=\"/news/2022/5/10/philippines-marcos-tells-world-not-to-judge-by-familys-past\">the tainted Marcos name</a>,” he added.</p><p>As president, Marcos Jr has “squandered” the demographic advantage of the Philippines, Masigan continued, pointing to the country’s youth, who make up almost half of the population. Given such a youthful and dynamic society, the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/22/as-philippiness-marcos-addresses-nation-economy-duterte-rift-loom-large\">country’s economy</a> should have been growing 7 to 8 percent annually by now, Masigan said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Instead, the economy posted a sluggish 4.4 percent growth in 2025, well below the government target of 5.5-6.5 percent, he added.</p><p>Susan Kurdli, an assistant professor at De La Salle University in Manila, said the first three years of Marcos Jr’s six-year term were “indeed a period of missed opportunities”.</p><p>Kurdli said the “vague direction” the Philippines is heading was only to be expected, “as Marcos Jr never ran on a clear policy ticket”.</p><p>“He won the election largely by relying on the tried and tested tactics of tribalism, name recognition and alliance building,” she said.</p><p>Foreign investment has also declined by half from $9.42bn in 2024 to $4.7bn in 2025, its sharpest fall in five years, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).</p><p>Unemployment rose at the same time from 3.8 percent in 2024 to 4.2 percent in 2025, PSA data showed. In 2025, only 172,000 jobs were added to the overall labour market, making it the fifth-worst year in job creation in 25 years, according to the think tank IBON Foundation.</p><p>A lack of economic opportunity and unemployment are the top risks for the Philippines in the next two years, the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 Global Risks Report notes.</p><p>If the weak economic figures have left Filipinos disgruntled, allegations of corruption have left them seething with anger.</p><p>“The scandal allegations surrounding him and his family have particularly hit a nerve with voters,” Kurdli of De La Salle University told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They have definitely impacted the perceived legitimacy of Marcos Jr as a national leader.”</p><p>The latest corruption perceptions index conducted by Transparency International (TI) reflects that assessment.</p><p>According to the anticorruption body’s latest report, the Philippines has slipped six notches lower, ranking 120th out of 182 territories covered.</p><p>In response to the TI report, presidential spokesperson Claire Castro said Marcos Jr “has not lost interest” in fighting <a href=\"/video/101-east/2025/11/29/the-human-cost-of-the-philippines-flood-control-corruption-scandal\">corruption</a>, and is working to strengthen government institutions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4317843\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4317843\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4317843\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20250728__682T8ZQ__v1__MidRes__PhilippinesPolitics-1771252381.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos delivers his speech in front of Senate President Chiz Escudero (L) and Speaker of the House Martin Romualdez (R) during the State of the Nation Address at the House of Representatives in Manila on July 28, 2025.

An investigation by a Philippine news website also linked him to multimillion-dollar homes in the Philippines and the United States that are allegedly not listed in his government disclosure forms. He has since relinquished his post but has not been called to account despite <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/enormous-evil-thousands-rally-in-the-philippines-over-corruption-scandal\">massive protests</a> and political pressure.</p><p>Also accused of cornering millions of dollars in public funds for pet projects were the president’s sister, Senator Maria Imelda Marcos, and his son, Ferdinand Alexander Marcos, a congressman.</p><p>Combined, the three Marcos relatives secured government projects worth at least $560m in the last three years, according to public works department data and the National Expenditure Program listed in the budget. They have all denied wrongdoing related to the awarding of the lucrative projects.</p><p>Private contractors and government bureaucrats were also linked to the scandal.</p><p>Some were reported by the news media to have spent their newfound wealth on Bentley and Rolls-Royce vehicles and gambling sprees. One mid-ranking official, whose monthly salary was the equivalent of $1,250, admitted during a congressional inquiry that he owned a GMC Denali SUV worth $200,000, a Lamborghini Urus worth between $500,000 and $700,000 and a Ferrari estimated at $1m.</p><p>Further investigations revealed several nonexistent government infrastructure initiatives, described as “ghost projects”, worth millions of dollars. Marcos Jr himself discovered an abandoned flood control project estimated to be about $1m in Baliwag, a city just north of Metro Manila.</p><p>In Quezon City in Metro Manila, the local government reported that 35 flood control projects were missing out of the 331 listed, with a total budget of almost $300m.</p><p>According to estimates by the Department of Finance, alleged corruption in flood control projects cost taxpayers approximately $2bn between 2023 and 2025.</p><p>The scale of the corruption allegations has reminded some Filipinos of the time when Marcos Sr and his wife, Imelda, ruled the country in what historians have described as a “conjugal dictatorship”.</p><p>During their two decades in power, the Marcos couple were accused of emptying the Philippine treasury of <a href=\"/news/2018/11/9/former-philippine-first-lady-imelda-marcos-faces-jail-over-fraud\">up to $10bn</a>.</p><p>Masigan, the political analyst and economist, said despite all efforts to distance himself from the ongoing scandal, it is difficult for the current president to do so.</p><p>“The three budgets were authored, presided over and approved by the president himself. He signed it,” Masigan said.</p><p>“Everything leads to him.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"give-marcos-some-credit\">‘Give Marcos some credit’</h2><p>Jan Credo, political science professor at Silliman University in Dumaguete City, Philippines, said despite the fierce criticism of the president, Marcos Jr should still get some credit for his role in highlighting the massive corruption scandal during his annual <a href=\"/news/2024/7/22/marcos-says-philippines-cannot-yield-in-south-china-sea-dispute\">State of the Nation Address last year</a>.</p><p>“President Marcos, in fact, started the expose when he chastised members of Congress and told them, ‘Shame on you’, for their involvement in the alleged massive bribery,” Credo told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“What this has generated is the consciousness among the public about the issue that led to the crystallisation of the social movement against corruption,” he said.</p><p>“If you ask me, Marcos Jr does not have anything to do” with the corruption, Credo said, blaming his close allies instead.</p><p>Credo also did not believe that the ongoing <a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/thousands-rally-in-philippines-demanding-marcos-resign-over-graft-scandal\">scandal</a> would cost Marcos Jr the support of one of the country’s most powerful institutions, the military. Over the last four decades, two Philippine presidents, including Marcos Sr, were forced out of office in popular revolts backed by the military. Two other presidents faced coup attempts.</p><p>“Marcos Jr may be in survival mode now. But he is also fortunate to have a military that is highly professionalised and no longer politicised,” Credo said.</p><p>“The recent calls by retired military officers to withdraw support from Marcos Jr have not gained traction, because we have learned their lesson,” he explained.</p><p>Political analyst Masigan agreed, saying a move by the military was “out of the question”, noting that while there were some whispers for Marcos Jr’s removal, “nothing is being seriously considered”.</p><p>“As far as the military is concerned, they are loyal to the constitution; there is no movement to oust the president and have a caretaker government,” he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4318045\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4318045\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4318045\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20241101__36LB3MH__v1__MidRes__PhilippinesReligionAllSaintsDay-1771261349.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos (top R) stands with his mother, former first lady Imelda Marcos, as they visit the tomb of former president Ferdinand Marcos Sr after a mass to commemorate All Saints' Day at the Heroes Cemetery in Manila on November 1, 2024.

At least eight other senators have close family members in the House.</p><p><a href=\"/opinions/2022/5/12/the-marcos-counterrevolution\">President Marcos Jr</a> comes from a dynasty himself. He has one sibling in the Senate, a son and two cousins in the House, and several relatives elected as town and provincial executives.</p><p>Vice President Duterte, who is the daughter of <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/icc-charges-ex-philippine-president-duterte-with-crimes-against-humanity\">former President Rodrigo Duterte</a>, is no different. Her brother, nephew and a cousin are serving in Congress. Another brother serves as the mayor of the Duterte stronghold, Davao City, while a nephew serves as the vice mayor.</p><p>While political dynasties are prohibited under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, Congress has failed to pass a supplementary law that spells out what a ban should look like.</p><p>For Credo, getting the antipolitical dynasty law passed is “a tall order” for Marcos Jr, given that a vast majority of legislators come from dynasties, guaranteeing fierce resistance.</p><p>“But if he can get it done, that would be a major achievement on his part. He will be able to secure his place in the history books,” Credo added.</p><p>Masigan said, given the Marcos family history, it is really up to the Filipino citizenry to keep the pressure on and demand real reforms from the government.</p><p>“I’ve seen how the Marcoses operate since the 1970s. They are fond of creating a semblance of reforms and giving people hope. But it will never come to fruition,” Masigan said.</p><p>“I hope this time it’s different. But I am not holding my breath.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
