On February 3, the states of New York and New Jersey announced they were suing the Trump administration to release the funds.</p><p>“After four months of covering costs with limited operating funds, the states warn that construction will be forced to completely shut down as soon as February 6 unless federal funding resumes,” attorneys general Letitia James of New York and Jennifer Davenport of New Jersey said in a <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-trump-administration-freezing-gateway-programs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> at the time.</p><p>Three days later, as the states hit that February 6 deadline, a US district judge ordered the funds to be released, citing the potential for irreparable harm to the project.</p><p>The ruling required more than $200m in reimbursement funds to be paid out to the states.</p><p>Over the last week, the federal government responded by releasing $30m, in addition to the $77m announced on Tuesday. But officials said it was still not enough.</p><p>At Tuesday’s news conference, union leader Gary LaBarbera emphasised that new construction was a necessity.</p><p>“Let me tell you: The existing tunnels, the trans-Hudson tunnels, are over a hundred years old. Their structural integrity has failed,” he said.</p><p>He added that the issue of maintaining safe transportation should be nonpartisan</p><p>“This isn’t a Republican tunnel or a Democratic tunnel, right? This should not be a political tug of war,” he said.</p><p>Governor Hochul, meanwhile, used part of her speech to address the president. “ Let’s stop the chaos. Let’s stop the insanity. Let them work, Mr President,” she said, in a gesture to the workers around her.</p><p>But this week, on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump doubled down on his opposition to the project.</p><p>“I am opposed to the future boondoggle known as ‘Gateway,’ in New York/New Jersey, because it will cost many BILLIONS OF DOLLARS more than projected or anticipated,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116086782319939311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>“It is a disaster! Gateway will likewise be financially catastrophic for the region, unless hard work and proper planning is done, NOW, to avoid insurmountable future cost overruns.”</p><p>He also denounced reports that he would un-freeze the funding in exchange for renaming New York’s Penn Station after him, as well as Washington’s Dulles airport.</p><p>“IT IS JUST MORE FAKE NEWS,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116081535267965046\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, adding that such a proposal was “brought up by certain politicians and construction union heads”, not him.</p><p>Still, his White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to confirm the reports last week during a news briefing.</p><p>“Why not?” she told a reporter. “It was something the president floated in his conversation with [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer.”</p><p>On Tuesday, reports emerged that the Trump Organization had filed trademark claims for any airports bearing the president’s name.</p><p>Republicans in Florida’s legislature have already sought to rename the international airport in Palm Beach for Trump, citing his nearby golf courses and residence at Mar-a-Lago.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Zogby would later found the AAI.</p><p>Jackson’s campaign also actively courted Arab Americans and amplified calls for Palestinian self-determination in an era when unquestioning support for Israel was the default position in US politics.</p><p>Berry said Jackson always rejected pressure to disassociate from Arab Americans who view Palestine as a focal issue.</p><p>“He understood that the fight for justice was one that had to be done when it was both hard and easy. Our country has lost a giant,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-party-platform\">The party platform</h2><p>Jackson launched a second campaign for president in 1988, winning 13 states, including Michigan and much of the South, in the Democratic primary.</p><p>He ultimately lost the nomination to then-Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Still, Jackson’s campaign catapulted Palestinian rights into the national discourse.</p><p>Zogby and other Jackson delegates at the Democratic National Convention rallied to include support for Palestinian statehood in the party’s platform that year.</p><p>While the push eventually fell short at the national level, 11 state parties adopted platforms expressing support for “the rights of the Palestinian people to safety, self-determination and an independent state”.</p><p>Jackson’s relative success in the primary also led to the appointment of an Arab-American activist, Texan Ruth Ann Skaff, to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the party’s executive board.</p><p>At the time, Skaff faced unfounded accusations of anti-Semitism for her pro-Palestinian stance, not to mention calls to be removed from the committee.</p><p>But in an interview with Al Jazeera, she said she was just a local organiser from Houston, Texas, not a high-level political operative.</p><p>She explained that Jackson’s embrace of the Arab-American community rang <span>“true to his message of wanting to empower those who do not have power or who are excluded”.</span></p><p>She also recalled him being humorous and approachable.</p><p>“We were learning how to organise, how to spread the message and then take it to the next step of being active politically at the very local level. And he guided us and inspired us the entire way,” Skaff said.</p><p>Born in South Carolina in 1941, under the racial segregation of the <a href=\"/features/2015/8/15/know-your-history-understanding-racism-in-the-us\">Jim Crow laws</a>, Jackson was dedicated to civil rights from a young age.</p><p>He was considered a talented public speaker, and as a pre-teen, he became a protege of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>A central part of his national platform was to stress the need for a broad coalition of communities to come together and demand equal rights.</p><p>Jackson moved to Chicago in 1965, where he founded the civil rights and community empowerment movement that became known as the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.</p><p>Even after his presidential run, Jackson remained close with the Arab community.</p><p>Hatem Abudayyeh, the executive director of the Arab American Action Network (AAAN) in Illinois, praised Jackson as “a tried-and-true Chicagoan, one of us, who opened the doors to Rainbow/PUSH for Palestinians and Arabs in Chicagoland”.</p><p>“Under his leadership, Black, Latino, Asian, Arab and so many other communities worked together for racial, economic, and social justice,” Abudayyeh told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>“He never shied away from solid and principled solidarity with our Palestinian and Arab communities,” he added. “We mourn today with our friends in the Black community, and with all those who will carry on his fight.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"support-for-gaza-protesters\">Support for Gaza protesters</h2><p>Nabih Ayad, the founder of the Arab American Civil Rights League (ACRL), said Jackson was one of the first leaders to shine light on the plight of Palestinians at the national stage.</p><p>He also worked on other issues related to the Arab community. In 2015, for instance, Jackson lobbied for the admission and resettlement of Syrian refugees, despite opposition from Republican governors.</p><p>The ACRL, based in the Michigan suburb of Dearborn, hosted Jackson on a panel to highlight the refugees’ plight. Ayad said Jackson’s message was that “justice is universal”.</p><p>“It was an honour to cross his path and be able to see a giant like Jesse Jackson really caring about the little people, the small guys, about injustice wherever it happens, no matter where it is around the world,” Ayad told Al Jazeera.</p><p>This drive to address injustice drove Jackson to speak up for Palestinians even when it may have cost him politically, according to Ayad.</p><p>Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition organised an emergency summit in 2024 to call for a ceasefire during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Later that year, he voiced support for pro-Palestine protests on college campuses, writing in the University of Chicago’s newspaper, The Chicago Maroon, that the student leaders “represent the best of our nation”.</p><p>Matthew Jaber Stiffler, the director of the Center for Arab Narratives, a research institution, said Jackson helped the Arab community feel “seen”. He, too, highlighted the political costs of championing Palestinian rights.</p><p>“Even just saying, ‘I support the rights for Palestinians to exist in the national political sphere,’ could get you branded as a radical, could get you pushed to the margins,” Stiffler told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Mainstream candidates didn’t – and still don’t – really want that plank in their platform. And I think that’s why there was such love for Jesse Jackson and what he stood for, because he was not afraid.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"work-that-has-to-be-done\">‘Work that has to be done’</h2><p>In the decades since Jackson’s presidential campaigns, Palestine has become less of a taboo subject in US politics. <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/rashida-tlaib-introduces-us-congress-resolution-to-recognise-gaza-genocide\">Congress members</a>, mayors and celebrities have become vocal in criticising Israeli abuses.</p><p>Still, the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties have avoided publicly supporting Palestinian rights. During the 2024 presidential race, for instance, both major parties adopted staunchly pro-Israel platforms.</p><p>The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris even refused to allow a Palestinian speaker at the party’s <a href=\"/news/2024/8/22/they-want-to-erase-us-how-dnc-rejected-demand-for-palestinian-speaker\">convention that year</a>.</p><p>The flow of US money and weapons to Israel has also continued uninterrupted, despite the <a href=\"/news/longform/2024/4/30/we-didnt-expect-to-find-bones-inside-one-gaza-familys-nightmare\">horrific atrocities</a> in Gaza.</p><p>Furthermore, since taking office in January 2025, the administration of President Donald Trump has led a <span>crackdown on Palestinian rights advocates, threatening foreign-born activists with deportation and other penalties.</span></p><p>Berry said that while the current conditions are challenging, Jackson taught the community to overcome barriers and build its power.</p><p>“I think that the lessons and the legacy of someone like Reverend Jackson teaches us that this is work that has to be done,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>For her part, Skaff said Jackson wanted Arab Americans to stand up and let their message be known.</p><p>“We’re stronger when we’re united and when we exercise our rights and responsibilities as American citizens: to stand up, to speak out, to run for office, to vote, vote, vote, vote,” she told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But he was also a visible member of the campus’s activist community, founding a Palestinian student society alongside fellow student Mahmoud Khalil.</p><p>Columbia became a hub for pro-Palestinian protests in 2024, and Trump campaigned for re-election, in part, on cracking down on the demonstrations.</p><p>Khalil became the first student protester to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March of last year, less than three months into Trump’s second term.</p><p>Then, on April 14, Mahdawi was arrested at a meeting set up by the government, allegedly to process his citizenship application.</p><p>ICE detained him in “direct retaliation for his advocacy of Palestinian rights”, the ACLU said in a statement at the time.</p><p>The Trump administration attempted to transfer Mahdawi out of state to Louisiana, but a court order ultimately blocked it from doing so.</p><p>Mahdawi was ultimately released on April 30, after US Judge Geoffrey Crawford accused the Trump administration of doing “great harm” to someone who had committed no crime.</p><p>Human rights advocates have described the Trump administration’s attempts to deport foreign-born student activists as a campaign to chill free speech.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>After his release last year, <a href=\"/news/2025/4/30/columbia-protest-leader-mohsen-mahdawi-released-from-us-custody\">Mahdawi walked out of the court</a> with both hands in the air, flashing peace signs as supporters greeted him with cheers.</p><p>As he spoke, he shared a message for Trump. “I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said to Trump.</p><p>He also addressed the people of Palestine and sought to dispel perceptions that the student protest movement was anything but peaceful.</p><p>“We are pro-peace and antiwar,” Mahdawi explained. “To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering, and I see freedom, and it is very soon.”</p><p>Mahdawi’s arrest comes as part of a wider push by the Trump administration to target visa holders and permanent residents for their pro-Palestine advocacy.</p><p>Trump has also pressured top universities to crack down on pro-Palestine protests in the name of combating anti-Semitism. In some cases, the Trump administration has opened investigations into campuses where pro-Palestinian protests were prominent, accusing them of civil rights violations.</p><p>Last July, Columbia University entered into a $200m settlement with the Trump administration, with a further $21m given to end a probe into allegations of religious-based harassment.</p><p>The university, however, did not admit to wrongdoing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Many people have been fighting against racism in football; Vinicius is one of them. I’m proud of him and his great game.”</p><p>The Associated Press news agency reported that television cameras picked up Vinicius Junior telling the referee that Prestianni had called him a “monkey”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Benfica began the game on the front foot, but the visitors gradually assumed control while the hosts appeared content to counterattack, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois producing a stunning one-handed save to keep out a 25th-minute strike from Fredrik Aursnes.</p><p class=\"p1\">Real finished the first half strongly, and only goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin’s brilliance kept ⁠the score goalless at the break as he produced stunning saves to deny Kylian ⁠Mbappe and Arda Guler.</p><p class=\"p1\">The breakthrough came five minutes after the restart. Mbappe burst forward and fed Vinicius on the left.

Real’s players threatened to leave the pitch as tensions flared, before play eventually resumed 11 minutes later.</p><p class=\"p1\">The atmosphere turned hostile, with Vinicius loudly booed whenever he touched the ball, and the broadcast camera appeared to show an outraged Mbappe calling Prestianni “a bloody racist” to ‌his face several times after the game resumed.</p><p class=\"p1\">Tempers flared again in the 85th minute, when Vinicius fouled Richard Rios.

He also shared multiple photos of himself and Jackson together at social events.</p><p data-start=\"851\" data-end=\"969\">“He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and ‘street smarts.’ He was very gregarious – Someone who truly loved people!” the president said.</p><p data-start=\"851\" data-end=\"969\">In the <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116086206069142759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">post</a>, Trump also used his acquaintance with Jackson to defend himself against allegations of racism, after he shared a video depicting Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president, as an ape earlier this month.</p><h3 id=\"barack-obama\">Barack Obama</h3><p>Obama released a statement explaining that he is “deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant”.</p><p>He said that he and his wife, Michelle, were directly inspired by Jackson, writing: “Michelle got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons’ kitchen table when she was a teenager.</p><p>“And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"joe-biden-former-us-president\">Joe Biden, former US president</h3><p>Biden remembered the civil rights activist as “determined and tenacious”.</p><p>“I’ve seen how Reverend Jackson has helped lead our Nation forward through tumult and triumph. He’s done it with optimism, and a relentless insistence on what is right and just,” he shared on a post in X.</p><p>“Whether through impassioned words on the campaign trail, or moments of quiet courage, Reverend Jackson influenced generations of Americans, and countless elected leaders, including Presidents.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"kamala-harris-former-us-vice-president\">Kamala Harris, former US vice president</h3><p>Harris, who ran as the Democratic nominee in the 2024 presidential election, shared her own tribute on social media.</p><p>“His presidential runs in 1984 and 1988 electrified millions of Americans and showed them what could be possible,” she wrote.</p><p>“From Washington, DC to the Bay Area, from the Mississippi Delta to Appalachia, from South Africa to the South Side of Chicago, Reverend Jackson gave a voice to people who were removed from power and politics.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"bill-and-hillary-clinton-former-us-president-and-former-secretary-of-state\">Bill and Hillary Clinton, former US president and former secretary of state</h3><p>In a social media statement, the Clintons said they became friends with Jackson after meeting him in 1977, during events marking the 20th anniversary of the integration of Little Rock Central High School.</p><p>That effort was seen as a pivotal moment in the US civil rights movement.</p><p>Nine Black students, later known as the Little Rock Nine, had enrolled at the previously all-white high school during the country’s desegregation, but their arrival at the school faced such heated opposition that then-President Dwight Eisenhower deployed the Arkansas National Guard.</p><p>The Clintons said that after meeting Jackson at the anniversary event, they continued to maintain a relationship with him for nearly 50 years.</p><p>They remembered him as someone who “championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives”.</p><p></p><h3>Cyril Ramaphosa, South African president</h3><p>Ramaphosa expressed his condolences and described Jackson as a “global moral authority” who stood firm in the fight for justice and equality.</p><p>“Rev Jesse Jackson’s irrepressible campaigns against apartheid and his support for the liberation struggle was a towering contribution to the global anti-apartheid cause,” Ramaphosa wrote.</p><p>“He has fought a good fight and run the race which his Baptist ministry inspired him to run. He made the world a better place but he has also influenced us to maintain his good fight in places where injustice and inequality persist.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"david-lammy-uk-deputy-prime-minister\">David Lammy, UK deputy prime minister</h3><p>Lammy, a Labour Party politician, currently serves as deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, and the secretary of state for justice in the United Kingdom.</p><p>He is the first Black man to hold these roles, and in Tuesday’s remembrances, he cited Jackson as a source of support.</p><p>Lammy began his post with a reference to the wave of protests and violence that erupted in 2011 after the death of a mixed-race man in north London. Lammy was a member of parliament at the time, representing the Tottenham area, where the killing took place.</p><p>“Jesse Jackson was one of the first people to call after the riots of 2011,” Lammy wrote. “It was a privilege to share such precious time with him in Chicago and London over the years.”</p><p>“May his legacy live on.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"reverend-al-sharpton-us-civil-rights-and-social-justice-activist\">Reverend Al Sharpton, US civil rights and social justice activist</h3><p>Sharpton also paid tribute to Jackson on X. Their history together stretches back to the 1960s, when a 12-year-old Sharpton would meet Jackson for the first time.</p><p>He would later serve as a youth coordinator for Jackson’s Operation Breadbasket, and the two would continue to collaborate over the course of their careers as civil rights leaders.</p><p>“The Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson was not simply a civil rights leader; he was a movement unto himself. He carried history in his footsteps and hope in his voice. One of the greatest honors of my life was learning at his side,” Sharpton wrote.</p><p>“He reminded me that faith without action is just noise. He taught me that protest must have purpose, that faith must have feet, and that justice is not seasonal, it is daily work.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"diane-abbott-the-first-black-woman-to-be-a-british-member-of-parliament\">Diane Abbott, the first Black woman to be a UK member of parliament</h3><p>On social media, Abbott praised Jackson for the support he gave when she was first elected to the UK’s Parliament.</p><p>“He was very smart, warm and hugely charismatic. A direct connection to the great era of civil rights,” Abbott wrote on X.</p><p>Separately, in an interview with The Guardian, Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said that Jackson’s legacy was his uncompromising commitment to addressing racism.</p><p>She contrasted his fearless approach to the UK’s current leadership.</p><p>“Labour party and Keir Starmer don’t talk about racial equality at all,” she said.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"hakeem-jeffries-top-democrat-and-house-minority-leader\">Hakeem Jeffries, top Democrat and House Minority Leader</h3><p>Jeffries, the House of Representatives minority leader for the Democratic Party, called Jackson “a legendary voice for the voiceless, powerful civil rights champion and trailblazer extraordinaire”.</p><p>“For decades, while laboring in the vineyards of the community, he inspired us to keep hope alive in the struggle for liberty and justice for all,” he said.</p><h3>JB Pritzker, governor of Illinois</h3><p>Pritzker, a Democrat, called Jackson a “giant of the civil rights movement”.</p><p>Illinois, Pritzker’s state, had served as a base of operations for Jackson for decades, and it is where the civil rights leader died on Tuesday. Pritzker acknowledged his contribution to Illinois – and the US as a whole – in a social media post.</p><p>“He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive,” Pritzker wrote. “Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service.”</p><p>He ordered flags to fly half-staff across Illinois in honour of Jackson.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"bernice-king-the-daughter-of-martin-luther-king-jr\">Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr</h3><p>King posted a photo of Jackson with her late father, Martin Luther King Jr. The two men were both icons of the US civil rights movement.</p><p>“Both now ancestors,” she wrote on social media.</p><p>Martin Luther King Jr and Jackson worked together as part of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and it was with King’s backing that Jackson went on to lead programmes like Operation Breadbasket.</p><p>Jackson was also present at Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination in 1968.</p><p>In a separate post, Bernice paid tribute to those deep family ties: “My family shares a long and meaningful history with him, rooted in a shared commitment to justice and love. As we grieve, we give thanks for a life that pushed hope into weary places.”</p><p></p><h3>Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple</h3><p>Cook shared a post on X paying tribute to Jackson and recalling one of his quotes:</p><p>“Never look down on anybody unless you’re helping them up.”</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

These include: <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appointing Bari Weiss</a>, a conservative opinion writer with no television experience, to lead the storied broadcast network; appointing a former Trump appointee to oversee and address allegations of bias, and settling a lawsuit with Trump amid allegations that the network’s news magazine programme, 60 Minutes, doctored an interview with then-Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris.</p><p>On Monday, CBS late-night show host Stephen Colbert claimed that the network also barred him from airing an interview with Texas Democratic State Representative James Talarico, who is currently running for the Democratic nomination to represent the state in the US Senate.</p><p>“Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV,” Colbert said on Monday’s broadcast of The Late Show.</p><p>The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission said last month that daytime and late-night television talk shows are no longer considered “bona fide” news programmes, exempt from equal time rules that require them to give airtime to the views of opposing candidates.</p><p>A merger between Warner Bros and Paramount “would also put CNN and CBS under the same parent company, along with dozens of additional TV stations, and that consolidation creates serious concerns about the types of content we will see in a more traditional TV format going forward,” Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, an economic think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount’s revised offer, which included a personal guarantee on $40bn in equity from Oracle founder Larry Ellison, father to Paramount’s CEO, was turned down in early January. Larry Ellison has been a long-time supporter of Trump.</p><p>Congressional leaders have raised concerns about both deals.</p><p>“With either merger, another corporation will have that increased control over what we see, what we hear and what news we consume,” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in a US Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing earlier this month.</p><p>“I will not be surprised if this gets thwarted,” Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who also chairs the committee, told the outlet Semafor in December.</p><p>The Writers Guild raised concerns about the <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\">Netflix deal in December</a>, when the potential merger was originally announced.</p><p>“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the guild said in a statement. “This merger must be blocked.”</p><p>“I think what I am seeing lost in the excitement around this bidding war and who is going to emerge victorious is that all of the parties seem to be vastly underestimating the regulatory risk,” Hepner said.</p><p>On Wall Street, Paramount Skydance stock is surging in midday trading. It is up 7.4 percent since the market opened. Netflix is also up slightly by 0.4 percent and Warner Bros Discovery is up 3.4 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s racist. It’s un-American.”</p><p>The Trump administration has been rolling back TPS protections, including for <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/trump-administration-nixes-temporary-immigration-protections-for-haitians\">Haiti</a>, which has been suffering from widespread gang violence.</p><p>However, some of Noem’s moves to nix immigration protections have been successfully challenged by the courts.

They’re very scared. They’re very concerned. They don’t know what lies ahead.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

JFB builds commercial and residential properties, including multifamily communities and shopping centres.</p><p>Xtend touts its drones as “low cost per kill”, which has appealed to the US Department of Defense. In November, the firm said it had solidified a multimillion-dollar contract with the Pentagon but did not disclose the contract’s value.</p><p>This month, Xtend was among 25 companies selected to participate in the Defense Department’s Drone Dominance Program, an acquisition reform effort designed to rapidly field low-cost, attack drones at scale.</p><p>Xtend also secured contracts with the Pentagon before Trump’s second term, including an $8.8m deal in December 2024.</p><p>“I am incredibly proud to invest in companies I believe in. Drones are clearly the wave of the future. Xtend has unbelievable potential,” Eric Trump said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“By pairing XTEND’s operating system and advanced AI capabilities with JFB’s execution, infrastructure and buildout expertise, we see a clear opportunity to accelerate US manufacturing, scale production responsibly, and support a next-generation defense technology platform built in America and ready for the public markets,” Joseph F Basile III, chief executive officer of JFB, said in the news release.</p><p>JFB did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about the connection between its existing portfolio, which includes primarily commercial properties like a Courtyard by Marriott Hotel in Florida and an escape room in Indiana, and a defence contractor.</p><p>“By combining our platform with JFB, we are acquiring the resources we need to scale our manufacturing capabilities in the US and gaining access to the US public markets,” Xtend CEO Aviv Shapira said in the news release.</p><p>Xtend did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><h2 id=\"renewed-conflict-of-interest-concerns\">Renewed conflict-of-interest concerns</h2><p>The deal is the latest in a series of conflict-of-interest concerns surrounding the Trump family’s personal investments and whether its members are using the Trump presidency to advance their own financial interests, according to ethics experts.</p><p>“The first thing that comes to mind is another example of the president’s family appearing to profit from the presidency,” said Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.</p><p>“In the past, a president would avoid even the appearance that the family was benefitting from the office, and if that couldn’t be completely avoided, the president would make statements to reassure the public that there was no special treatment provided to the family that could lead to this benefit. Now, you don’t see anything like that.” Payne told Al Jazeera.</p><p>JFB Construction also appointed Stefan Passantino, a former White House attorney, to its board of directors amid the merger.</p><p>The investment comes even as the Trump family company has filed to trademark the use of the president’s name on airports but said it doesn’t plan on charging a fee at least for a proposed renaming of one near his Florida home, The Associated Press news agency reported.</p><p>Josh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who uncovered the filings over the weekend, said the applications were the first of their kind he’s ever seen.</p><p>“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honor, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote on his blog. “I should be very clear: these are trademark filings that are completely unprecedented.”</p><p>During former President Joe Biden’s term, Republicans rallied against his son Hunter Biden for using his connections with the White House to advance his personal business interests.</p><p>“When he [Hunter Biden] got a board position with a company overseas, there were concerns that he was using his name to secure a high-profile job. There were no ties to government contracts, but even the appearance that he had a position based on his name was controversial,” Payne said.</p><p>The Oversight Committee in the US House of Representatives alleged that the Bidens “participated or benefited from the business schemes” in a committee hearing in March 2024 about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.</p><p>“We have learned that Joe Biden has taken action after action to further his family’s plans to get rich,” James Comer, the committee’s then-chairman, said at the time.</p><p>Comer did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about whether he shared the same concerns about the Trump family.</p><p>“We’re talking about something far more extreme: a child receiving benefits from government contracts, at least indirectly through a company he owns, including lucrative contracts with the Defense Department. That’s something we haven’t seen since Halliburton and Vice President [Dick] Cheney,” Payne said.</p><p>The White House and Trump Organization representatives did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"
