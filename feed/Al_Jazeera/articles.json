During that time, more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/fields-of-operation/iraq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">179 British soldiers</a> and more than 4,000 US soldiers were killed.</p><p>In 2020, the ICC ended its own inquiries into British war crimes in Iraq.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the role Blair played in keeping UK war crimes out of the public eye.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4209706\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209706\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4209706\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-828708068-1767356358.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C471&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Blair Iraq\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209706\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair addresses troops in Basra, Iraq, in 2003 [Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-do-newly-released-documents-show\">What do newly released documents show?</h2><p>On December 30, the UK Cabinet Office released more than 600 documents to the National Archives at Kew. According to the UK’s Public Records Act 1958, the government is required to release records of historical value to the National Archives after 20 years.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/news/more-than-600-government-files-released-under-20-year-rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to</a> the National Archives website, most of the newly added documents relate to the policies implemented by the Blair government between 2004 and 2005, from domestic decisions to ensure the UK would not break up by delegating power to Wales and Scotland, to foreign policy decisions on Iraq and other countries.</p><p>According to UK media reports, the declassified files record that Blair told Antony Phillipson, his private secretary for foreign affairs at the time, that it was “essential” that civil courts did not prosecute British soldiers accused of abusing Iraqi civilians in their custody during the war in Iraq.</p><p>“We have, in effect, to be in a position where the ICC is not involved and neither is CPS (UK Crown Prosecution Service),” he said in a written memo. “That is essential.”<strong> </strong></p><p>According to UK media reports, Blair’s comments followed a written memo Phillipson sent him in July 2005 about a meeting between the country’s attorney general at the time and two former UK military chiefs. He wrote that they had discussed the case of British soldiers who were accused of beating an Iraqi hotel receptionist, <a href=\"/news/2011/9/8/abuse-of-iraqi-by-british-army-appalling\">Baha Mousa</a>, to death.</p><p>Mousa, who was killed in September 2003 in Basra, Iraq, had been in the custody of UK troops.</p><p>According to records among the newly declassified documents, Phillipson told Blair that the case would be one which would end with a court martial. But he added that “if the Attorney General felt that the case was better dealt with in a civil court, he could direct accordingly”.</p><p>“It must not,” Blair stressed.</p><p>Christopher Featherstone, associate lecturer at the Department of Politics, University of York, said: “Blair didn’t want prosecution through international law, and wanted military justice – he saw this as less punitive in the punishments – and he didn’t want the perception that the military couldn’t operate effectively in war zones.”</p><p>Featherstone told Al Jazeera that the Iraq war has become synonymous in UK politics with Blair and his legacy.</p><p>“He [Blair] was convinced that he could persuade the British public of the rightness of the Iraq war, both morally and strategically. However, this became more and more difficult to achieve. As such, he was very concerned about potential prosecution for UK soldiers as this would only amplify opposition to the war, at home and abroad,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4209715\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209715\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4209715\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-828597092-1767356664.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C595&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Blair Iraq\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209715\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Protesters against the war in Iraq gather outside the Houses of Parliament in London, UK, in January 2003 [File: Michael Stephens/PA Images via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-was-the-uk-s-role-in-the-iraq-war\">What was the UK’s role in the Iraq war?</h2><p>The Blair government justified the UK’s decision to support the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 using now-debunked claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The UK said its aim was to eliminate these and to liberate the people of Iraq from the rule of then-President Saddam Hussein.</p><p>In 2003, the US sent more than 100,000 soldiers, the UK sent about 46,000, Australia sent 2,000, and Poland sent about 194 special forces members.</p><p>But there was a great deal of public debate in the UK about the legality of going to war in Iraq on the basis of what was suspected to be flawed evidence about weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>Featherstone, who wrote the book The Road to War in Iraq: Comparative Foreign Policy Analysis, said Blair was “frustrated” by worries from officials about the legality of going to war in Iraq.</p><p>“From the interviews I carried out for my book research, senior military and civil servants were worried about the legality and asked for reassurance from the attorney general. However, Blair was frustrated at all the discussion of the legality of the invasion,” he said.</p><p>“Blair saw the UK role as showing the international support for the US war on terror, and saw his personal role as building the case for the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam,” he added.</p><p>Speaking to the media in July 2016 after the release of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-iraq-inquiry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chilcot report</a> – a British public inquiry into the UK’s role in the Iraq war – Blair said joining the invasion had been “the hardest decision” he had ever taken during his tenure as prime minister.</p><p>The <a href=\"/opinions/2016/7/14/chilcot-report-and-the-delusions-of-western-democracy\">Chilcot report</a> concluded that there had been no “imminent threat” from Saddam Hussein and said the intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was “not justified”.</p><p>Blair acknowledged that the intelligence was wrong but said invading Iraq was nevertheless the “right decision” at the time, as Saddam Hussein was a “threat to world peace”.</p><p>“The world was and is, in my judgement, a better place without Saddam Hussein,” Blair told journalists in reply to the findings of the Chilcot report.</p><p>However, he apologised to families who were bereaved during the war and said that “no words can properly convey the grief and sorrow of those who lost ones they loved in Iraq – whether our armed forces, the armed forces of other nations or Iraqis”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"did-uk-soldiers-abuse-iraqis-during-the-war\">Did UK soldiers abuse Iraqis during the war?</h2><p>There is a large amount of evidence showing that they did.</p><p>Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), have documented cases of UK soldiers abusing hundreds of Iraqi civilians in their custody during the war.</p><p>“Their testimonies [Iraqi civilians] show a pattern of violent beatings, sleep and sensory deprivation, ‘stress positions’, deprivation of food and water, sexual and religious humiliation, and, in some cases, sexual abuse,” the ECCHR <a href=\"https://www.ecchr.eu/en/case/war-crimes-by-uk-forces-in-iraq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in a report in 2020.</p><p>In 2005, three UK soldiers were tried by court martial at a British military base in northern Germany, where photographs showing evidence of the abuses they engaged in had been produced. The soldiers denied the charges but were found guilty of abusing Iraqi civilians during the war and were <a href=\"/news/2005/2/23/british-soldiers-convicted-of-iraq-abuse\">dismissed</a> from the army.</p><p>In 2007, Corporal Donald Payne became the first British soldier to be sentenced. He went to prison for a year after being court-martialled by the army for mistreating Iraqi prisoners during the war.</p><p>Payne was involved in the death of the Iraqi civilian and hotel receptionist Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 after enduring 93 beatings.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-the-icc-intervened\">Has the ICC intervened?</h2><p>In 2005, the ICC <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/iraq#:~:text=The%20Preliminary%20Examination%20into%20Iraq/UK%20was%20initially%20terminated%20on,other%20forms%20of%20ill%2Dtreatment.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">opened</a> an inquiry into the UK’s role in the Iraq war, but closed it in February 2006 when ICC judges agreed that the case did not fall into the top court’s jurisdiction.</p><p>However, the inquiry was reopened in May 2014 by ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda after rights groups submitted evidence of UK soldiers’ systematic abuse, including murder and torture, of Iraqi civilians during the war.</p><p>But in December 2020, Bensouda abandoned the inquiry, saying that while there was “reasonable basis to believe” that “members of the British armed forces committed the war crimes of wilful killing, torture, inhuman/cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and/or other forms of sexual violence”, the UK government had not tried to block investigations into the case.</p><p>In a 184-page report, Bensouda’s office <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-prosecutor-fatou-bensouda-conclusion-preliminary-examination-situation-iraq/united\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in December 2020: “If shielding had been made out, an investigation by my Office would have been warranted. Following a detailed inquiry, and despite the concerns expressed in its report, the office [of the prosecutor] could not substantiate allegations that the UK investigative and prosecutorial bodies had engaged in shielding [ie, blocking inquiries], based on a careful scrutiny of the information before it.</p><p>“Having exhausted reasonable lines of enquiry arising from the information available, I therefore determined that the only professionally appropriate decision at this stage is to close the preliminary examination and to inform the senders of communications. My decision is without prejudice to a reconsideration based on new facts or evidence,” she added.</p><p>The prosecutor’s decision has been condemned by rights groups.</p><p>“The UK government has repeatedly shown precious little interest in investigating and prosecuting atrocities committed abroad by British troops,” Clive Baldwin, senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch said in a statement in December 2020.</p><p>“The prosecutor’s decision to close her UK inquiry will doubtless fuel perceptions of an ugly double standard in justice, with one approach for powerful states and quite another for those with less clout,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-blair-say-about-the-icc\">What did Blair say about the ICC?</h2><p>Tuesday’s declassified documents have revealed that Blair was confident the ICC would not prosecute UK soldiers.</p><p>According to the documents, in June 2002, a month before the ICC statute entered into force and about a year before the UK joined the Iraq war, Blair had told John Howard, the Australian prime minister at the time, that countries like the UK had no reason to fear the ICC.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/2024-05/Rome-Statute-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Rome Statue</a> of the ICC is the top court’s main treaty which states that the ICC has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for serious crimes including crimes against humanity and engaging in committing a genocide.</p><p>Blair wrote to Howard after officials in Australia expressed fears about the ICC’s jurisdiction, as Australia had also joined the US and UK in the Iraq war.</p><p>But Blair reassured Howard in his letter that the top court “acts only in the case of failed states or where judicial processes have broken down”.</p><p>“We believe that responsible democratic states, where the rule of law is respected, have nothing to fear from the ICC,” he wrote.</p><p>According to UK media reports, Blair’s administration had agreed to sign the ICC’s Rome Statute in 1998 after the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office negotiated with the court that “the court [ICC] may only act when national legal systems are unable or unwilling to do so”.</p><p>“It’s certainly true that the ICC has historically been accused of being biased in terms of where it has focused its attention and effort in investigating and prosecuting cases,” Featherstone said.</p><p>“However, there are some reasons for this around resources for investigating, the ability to bring the cases to fruition, and the relative power of those being accused,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

I take the larger one, but I’ve done it for years, and what it does do is it causes bruising.”</p><p>Trump told the newspaper that he has been taking the larger dose of aspirin for 25 years.</p><p>Trump is the second oldest person to serve as US president after Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left office in January and pulled out of his re-election campaign in 2024 amid rising concerns about his health.</p><p>Concerns about Trump’s health have also arisen after bruises were spotted on his hands in the summer.</p><p>In July, Trump was diagnosed with <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/what-is-chronic-venous-insufficiency-how-serious-is-trumps-condition\">chronic venous insufficiency</a>, which White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt described as a “benign and common condition” in which damaged veins prevent blood from flowing properly.</p><p>Leavitt said the bruises were “consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen”.</p><p>Additionally, in October, it was reported that Trump had undergone an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. The White House said the MRI was “preventative”.</p><p>The WSJ report, however, stated that Trump and his doctor said he had received a CT (computed tomography) scan, not an MRI.</p><p>“It was less than that. It was a scan,” Trump said.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-aspirin\">What is aspirin?</h2><p>Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It has antiplatelet, or blood-thinning, properties.</p><p>It can be bought over the counter or prescribed by a doctor. It is usually prescribed for pain, fever and inflammation caused by immune responses to infections.</p><p>Additionally, low doses are prescribed to people at risk of heart attacks and strokes because it helps prevent blood clots from forming. It does this by inhibiting the production of a substance called thromboxane A2 within platelets, which are the blood cells responsible for clotting.</p><p>Thromboxane signals the platelets to clump together. When there is less thromboxane in the system, there is a lower chance of blood clots and a lower chance of heart attacks or strokes, which happen when blood flow is blocked to the heart and brain, respectively, by clots.</p><h2 id=\"does-aspirin-produce-side-effects\">Does aspirin produce side effects?</h2><p>Common side effects of aspirin use include mild indigestion and bleeding more than usual, according to the website for the National Health Service (NHS), the United Kingdom’s publicly funded healthcare system.</p><p>The website recommends contacting a doctor in case of serious side effects, such as coughing up blood or the whites of the eyes turning yellow.</p><p>Aspirin can also cause ulcers in the stomach or gut if it is taken for a long time or in high doses, according to the NHS.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-normal-daily-dose-of-aspirin\">What is the ‘normal’ daily dose of aspirin?</h2><p>According to the NHS, aspirin is usually available in 300mg tablets and the usual dosage for headaches and other pain or fever is one or two tablets, taken every four to six hours.</p><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that adults aged 40 to 59 at risk of cardiovascular disease start treatment with a much lower dose of aspirin of 81mg per day.</p><p><span>The USPSTF is an independent panel of experts that reviews medical evidence and issues recommendations on preventive health services, such as screenings, counselling and medicines.</span></p><p>The panel says the cardiovascular benefit of taking aspirin diminishes in older adults as the risk of excessive bleeding increases with age.</p><p>“For patients who are eligible and choose to start taking aspirin, the benefits become smaller with advancing age, and data suggest that clinicians and patients should consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years,” the USPSTF says.</p><p>The health information website Healthline states that doctors may recommend a daily dose of 81mg to 325mg for people who have had or are at risk of conditions that include heart attacks and strokes.</p><h2 id=\"can-you-take-too-much-aspirin\">Can you take too much aspirin?</h2><p>A Healthline article reviewed by clinical pharmacist Dr Alan Carter states that people can experience aspirin poisoning if they take more aspirin than their body can clear.</p><p>There can be mild, moderate or severe forms of this, depending on the amount of aspirin and a person’s body weight.</p><p>Mild poisoning can take place if a person has taken less than 300mg of aspirin per kilogramme of body weight in one go.</p><p>Moderate poisoning takes place if a person has ingested 300mg to 500mg of aspirin per kilogramme of body weight in one go. Severe poisoning takes place when the aspirin exceeds 500mg per kilogramme of body weight.</p><p>Based on these numbers, if a man weighing 90kg took 45,000mg of aspirin in a single dose, it would likely be life-threatening.</p><p>However, “chronic” toxicity can also occur in someone who regularly takes aspirin for a long period of time, depending on how well their kidneys and liver are able to process it.</p><p>Symptoms of aspirin overdose include burning throat pain, decreased urination, double vision, drowsiness, fever, hallucinations, nervousness, restlessness, ringing in the ears or inability to hear, seizures, stomach pain, uncontrollable shaking and vomiting.</p><p>An aspirin overdose can cause death within one day.  An overdose can make blood dangerously acidic, disrupting the body’s regular functioning. It can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, making it hard to breathe. It can increase body temperature and cause the heart, kidneys and other organs to fail.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We clung to any thread of hope, even though deep inside we feared believing it. For two years, we had become accustomed to hearing about “ceasefires” that never lasted.</p><p>When the announcement was finally made, the streets erupted with ululations and cheers. Yet, fear crept into my heart that this calm might just be a pause before another round of attacks.</p><p>My fears were justified. Israel’s daily deadly attacks have continued; more than 400 people have been killed so far by its army. Many others have died in circumstances caused by Israel’s decimation of the Strip.</p><p>And yet the level of global attention began to decline. In November, I noticed that engagement with what I wrote about Gaza started to diminish, whether on social media or media outlets – something other Palestinian journalists and writers also observed. The world’s interest waned because the global public was easily convinced that the war had ended.</p><p>It became clear to me that the real goal of the ceasefire was not to stop the violence or death, nor to protect people or limit bloodshed and genocide. The real goal was to stop the world from talking about Gaza, about the crimes being committed there, and about the daily suffering of people.</p><p>Gaza has now become mostly invisible, as other news and other “hot spots” have taken the global media spotlight.</p><p>Meanwhile, mass death continues.</p><p>A little more than two weeks after the ceasefire was announced, on October 28, the Israeli army carried out a huge bombing campaign, killing 104 people. The overwhelming fear for the future and for my loved ones returned.</p><p>On November 20, Israel struck closer to my heart. The Israeli army attacked the home of the Abu Shawish family in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. My friend Batoul Abu Shawish lost her whole family – her sisters Habiba, 11, and Tima, 16; her brothers Youssef, 14, and Mohammed, 18; and her mum, Sahar, 43, and dad, Rami, 50. They were massacred despite the fact that the family had no political affiliation; they were all civilians. Batoul now has to face the genocide alone.</p><p>The Israeli attacks continue, and so does mass death by other means: Collapsed buildings, unexploded bombs, floods, hypothermia, starvation and illness – all creations of the Israeli genocidal strategy. We continue to struggle with no proper shelter or food, no heating, electricity or potable water.</p><p>The situation is so bad that winter itself is killing people.</p><p>We just had <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/tents-flooded-by-heavy-rains-in-gaza-amid-calls-for-israel-to-let-in-aid\">another storm</a>. Tents were flooded and blown off again. Thirty-year-old Alaa Juha was killed by a wall that the rain collapsed onto her. Two-month-old baby Arkan Musleh died from hypothermia. In total, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/gaza-storm-kills-palestinian-woman-as-israeli-curbs-on-aid-compoun\">15 have died</a> from the cold weather this month. My family’s tent was flooded again; it is hard to describe the feeling of helplessness that overwhelms you when you can find no escape from the water and the freezing cold.</p><p>Israel continues to violate the ceasefire not only with its attacks but with its refusal to comply with its obligation to allow in the negotiated number of aid trucks, a full supply of necessary medicines and tents, shelter materials and mobile homes.</p><p>Israel is also curbing access to international organisations that try to provide some relief for the people of Gaza. New rules are making it hard for NGOs to register, including some as big as Save the Children. This, along with Israel’s continuous denial of requests to bring in aid by NGOs, is stifling international efforts to provide some relief to us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Palestinian organisations that try to ease our suffering are facing a collapse of donations. For example, the Samir Project, a donations-based initiative that provides material support for impoverished families and students, has lost a large number of individual donors and followers after the ceasefire was announced. Dr Ezzedine al-Lulu, the project’s director, confirmed to me that the decreased flow of donations has hindered their ability to provide essential assistance.</p><p>Israel is also keeping the Rafah border closed. There is no opportunity to travel outside unless you pay an exorbitant amount of money to <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/16/israel-cant-fly-us-all-out-to-south-africa\">Israeli-linked war profiteers</a> and agree to never return. More than 16,000 people who urgently need medical evacuation are prevented by Israel from leaving; more than 1,000 have died waiting to be allowed to leave.</p><p>Gaza has entered a new stage of genocide – low-grade mass killing which does not make headlines because it is not as explosive as carpet-bombing campaigns. But the ultimate result is the same: The extermination of Palestinian life in Gaza. It is no wonder that Israeli politicians have not stopped talking about colonising our land. They still see Gaza free of Palestinians as a very real possibility that is within reach.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

I carry scars that won’t heal without justice, without accountability.</p><p>I learned it in Guantanamo, when the only thing I could control was my own body.</p><p>We were disappeared. Isolated. Forced into silence. Our words were redacted. Our letters were stamped secret. Lawyers were blocked. Time stretched and rotted. No court dates were given. No real charges were made.</p><p>I was reduced to a number in an orange uniform, locked in a metal cage. The US government had already named me. “The worst of the worst.” “Terrorist.” “Enemy combatant.” Labels designed to make torture sound necessary.</p><p>And torture came. Day and night. Relentless. Mechanical. Meant to break the mind first, then the body. So I stopped eating. Not as a gesture. Not as a plea. I stopped because everything else had been taken from me. My body was the only territory this foreign state hadn’t yet occupied.</p><p>A hunger strike is not symbolic. It is not dramatic. That’s a lie sold by the media, by people who have never watched a body collapse from the inside, who turn slow death into headlines and panels and clean sentences.</p><p>A hunger strike is a slow, painful journey towards death. It dismantles you piece by piece. Muscles shrink. Vision fades. The heart falters. Organs begin to fail. Every beat is a warning. Every hour drags you closer to death, whether you want it or not.</p><p>A hunger strike begins when every other door is slammed shut. When the system makes it clear your life has no value, as long as you stay quiet and obedient. When it looks straight at you and tells you you’re already dead.</p><p>So you answer with your body.</p><p>At least <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/pro-palestine-activists-target-uk-labour-offices-over-hunger-strikers\">eight imprisoned pro-Palestine activists</a> in the UK have refused food. One has been on hunger strike for more than two months. Others have passed 50 days without eating. Some have already been taken to hospital. They are scattered across prisons, cut off from each other, torn from their families, buried under the word “terrorist” so cruelty can be dressed up as law.</p><p>They are <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/heba-muraisi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heba Muraisi</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/qesser-zuhrah/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qesser Zurah</a>, <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/31/live-israels-ban-on-aid-organisations-in-gaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amu Gib</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/teuta-hoxha/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Teuta Hoxha</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/kamran-ahmed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kamran Ahmed</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/lewie-chiaramello/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lewie Chiaramello</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/jon-cink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jon Cink</a>, and <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/umer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Umer Khalid.</a></p><figure id=\"attachment_4209607\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209607\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4209607\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/photo_2025-12-25_10-46-11-1767352273.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A room with poster with photos of 8 Palestine Action hunger strikers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209607\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos of the eight Pal Action hunger strikers are displayed during an event in Rome, Italy on December 13, 2025 [Courtesy of Mansoor Adayfi]</figcaption></figure><p>United Nations human rights experts have expressed grave concern for hunger strikers’ lives. They warned the activists face heightened risks of organ failure, neurological damage, and death without proper medical care and called on the UK government to ensure timely emergency care, to engage with the activists’ demands and to address rights issues linked to prolonged pretrial detention and restrictions on protest activity.</p><p>I have been inside this story before. Violent words are meant to strip you of your humanity so the public doesn’t have to feel the sting of your suffering.</p><p>When Jeremy Corbyn raised the hunger strike in Parliament, some MPs laughed. Laughed. Not whispers. Not quiet discomfort. But open mockery. Smirks from padded seats while people’s bodies were breaking down in cells. While people were collapsing, being dragged to hospital wards, organs failing. This is untouchable power.</p><p>David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, has dodged meeting the families of the hunger strikers. He has avoided even the barest human gesture of listening. Cowardice wrapped in protocol. This is deliberate contempt.</p><p>In 1981, during the Irish hunger strike, men were dying in prison cells while politicians dismissed them as criminals, attention-seekers, terrorists. The mockery came first. The jokes. The coldness. The refusal to engage. Then came the funerals. Power always laughs before it kills. Humour becomes a shield for cowardice.</p><p>Nothing has changed. The accents are different. The suits are better tailored. The cruelty is the same.</p><p>This is not democracy. This is rot at the centre of the state.</p><p>We were held for years in Guantanamo without charges, without evidence, without a path to release. In the UK today, people are kept on extended remand, sometimes for years, while trial dates are pushed further away. Time itself becomes the punishment. Time becomes a weapon. A weapon against prisoners and their families.</p><p>Isolation comes next.</p><p>In Guantanamo, isolation was designed to break us. Months, sometimes years, without meaningful human contact. Silence so heavy it pressed against your skull. A silence meant to erase you. <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In UK prisons, hunger strikers</a> are separated. Transferred. Harassed. Stripped of routine, stripped of connection. Isolation is framed as safety. It is not. It is punishment. It is control.</p><p>Then comes censorship. Letters delayed. Phone calls cut short. Visits restricted. Information filtered. Families left in the dark. Lawyers forced to fight for the barest access. At Guantanamo, every word leaving the camp was monitored. In the UK, the same instinct survives. Control the narrative. Control the person.</p><p>Then comes medical coercion. In Guantanamo, hunger strike was met with force. Shackles. Restraint chairs. Tubes forced through noses into stomachs while guards pinned our limbs. They called it medical care. It was violence. Pure, deliberate, crushing violence designed to make resistance unbearable.</p><p>The UK likes to pretend Guantanamo was an American mistake. Something distant. Something finished. It was not. It was a laboratory. The experiments were exported. Absorbed. Normalised. And now, they are applied inside their prisons.</p><p>You see it in the extended remand.</p><p>You see it in the proscription laws twisted to criminalise protest.</p><p>You see it in prisons used as warehouses, places to store people indefinitely while the state takes its time building a case.</p><p>And you see it in the quiet cooperation between systems. Guantanamo fed the black sites. Black sites fed domestic counterterror policing. The same logic shows up again and again. In places like Alligator Alcatraz in Florida. In British prisons holding political activists under terrorism laws. Different flags. Same playbook.</p><p>Abuse travels faster than accountability.</p><p>I have watched governments study each other. Share techniques. Refine the language. Learn how to cage people legally. How to stretch the law without snapping it. How to crush dissent while calling it order.</p><p>This is not about agreeing with the politics of the prisoners. This is about whether a state is allowed to disappear people before trial, isolate them, censor them, then punish them for refusing to cooperate with their own erasure. If the UK wants to claim it is nothing like Guantanamo, then it has to prove it with action.</p><p>End prolonged remand without trial.</p><p>End isolation as a response to protest.</p><p>Restore full access to lawyers and families.</p><p>Provide medical care that protects life, not policies that quietly endanger it.</p><p>Listen to the hunger strikers. Meet their families face to face.</p><p>Abolish the terror laws used to criminalise dissent, stretch guilt by association, and disappear people behind language instead of evidence.</p><p>Force members of parliament to step out of silence and take responsibility.</p><p>These are not radical demands. They are the bare minimum. The floor, not the ceiling, for any society that claims to respect human rights.</p><p>I am not writing this as an observer. I am writing as someone who has already lived the ending. I am telling you plainly, without euphemism and without distance. Systems like this do not correct themselves. They do not slow down out of shame. They only stop when they are confronted, directly and without fear. Now.</p><p>I refuse to be silent. I am joining this hunger strike in solidarity. I do this because I recognise the system at work. I do this because I know Guantanamo did not end, it spread. It embedded itself in other prisons, other laws, other governments that tell themselves they are better. I do this because standing with the oppressed against the oppressor is not symbolic for me. It is a responsibility earned through survival. I do this because I am able to, and because doing nothing would make me complicit.</p><p>This hunger strike is not about food. It is about dignity. It is about justice. It is about remand used as punishment, silence used as policy, and a state that believes if it waits long enough, people will break and disappear. It believes silence will protect it, shield it, absolve it. It will not.</p><p>I stand with the hunger strikers. I will not look away. I will not soften this. I will not be polite about slow death carried out in clean buildings and legal language.</p><p>And I will not let them be erased. Free the hungers strikers!</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Their chants echoed past murals that do not merely decorate the city, but testify to its troubled past.</p><p data-start=\"1148\" data-end=\"1509\">Along the Falls Road, Irish republican murals sit beside Palestinian ones. The International Wall, once a rolling canvas of global struggles, has become known as the Palestinian wall. Poems by the late Palestinian writer Refaat Alareer, killed in an Israeli air strike in December 2023, run across its length. Images sent by Palestinian artists have been painted by local hands.</p><p data-start=\"1511\" data-end=\"1884\">More recently, new words have appeared on Belfast’s famed walls. “Blessed are those who hunger for justice.” Painted alongside long-familiar images of Irish republican prisoners like Bobby Sands are new names now written into the city’s political conscience: the four pro-Palestinian activists currently on hunger strike in British prisons, their bodies weakening as the days stretch on.</p><p data-start=\"1886\" data-end=\"2100\">“This is not a city that will ever accept any attempt to silence our voice or our right to protest or our right to stand up for human rights,” said Patricia McKeown, a trade union activist who spoke at the protest.</p><p data-start=\"2102\" data-end=\"2353\">“These young people are being held unjustly and in ridiculous conditions – and they have taken the ultimate decision to express their views … and most particularly on what’s happening to people in Palestine – why would we not support that?” she asked.</p><h2 id=\"a-hunger-strike-reaches-belfast\">A hunger strike reaches Belfast</h2><p data-start=\"2392\" data-end=\"2852\">The protest in Belfast is part of a growing international campaign urging the British government to intervene as the health of four detainees deteriorates behind prison walls. All are affiliated with Palestine Action and are being held on remand while awaiting trial, a process campaigners say could keep them imprisoned for more than a year before their cases are heard. With legal avenues exhausted, supporters say the hunger strike has become a last resort.</p><p>The Palestine Action members are being held over their <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/palestine-action-what-has-the-group-done-as-it-faces-a-ban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleged involvement in break-ins</a> at the United Kingdom subsidiary of Elbit Systems in Filton near Bristol, where equipment was reportedly damaged, and at a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, where two military aircraft were sprayed with red paint. The prisoners deny the charges against them, which include burglary and violent disorder.</p><p data-start=\"2854\" data-end=\"3050\"><a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/who-are-the-palestine-action-hunger-strikers\">The prisoners</a> are demanding release on bail, an end to what they describe as interference with their mail and reading materials, access to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action. In July, the British government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer banned Palestine Action under a controversial anti-terrorism law.</p><p data-start=\"3052\" data-end=\"3359\">Heba Muraisi is on day 61 without food. Teuta Hoxha is on day 55. Kamran Ahmed on day 54. Lewie Chiaramello on day 41. Hoxha and Ahmed have already been hospitalised. Campaigners describe it as the largest hunger strike in Britain since 1981, one they say is explicitly inspired by the Irish hunger strikes.</p><p data-start=\"3361\" data-end=\"3739\">In 1981, Irish Republican Army and other republican prisoners went on hunger strike in Northern Ireland, demanding the restoration of their political status. Ten men died, including their leader, Bobby Sands, who was elected to the British parliament during the strike. Margaret Thatcher took a hardline public stance, but behind the scenes, the government ultimately sought a way out as public opinion shifted.</p><p data-start=\"3741\" data-end=\"3918\">One prisoner, 29-year-old Martin Hurson, died on the 46th day. Others, including Raymond McCreesh, Francis Hughes, Michael Devine and Joe McDonnell, died between days 59 and 61. Sands died after 66 days on a hunger strike.</p><p data-start=\"3920\" data-end=\"4002\">Sue Pentel, a member of Jews for Palestine Ireland, remembers that period vividly.</p><p data-start=\"4004\" data-end=\"4224\">“I was here during the hunger strike,” she said. “I went through the hunger strikes, marched, demonstrated, held meetings, protested, so I remember the callous brutality of the British government letting 10 hungers die.”</p><p data-start=\"4226\" data-end=\"4444\">“The words of Bobby Sands, which are ‘Our revenge will be the laughter of our children’. And we raised our families here, and they’re the same people, this new generation who are standing in solidarity with Palestine.”</p><h2 id=\"if-this-continues-some-will-die\">‘If this continues, some will die’</h2><p data-start=\"4486\" data-end=\"4680\">Standing beneath a mural of Bobby Sands, Pat Sheehan fears history is edging dangerously close to repeating itself. He spent 55 days on a hunger strike before it was called off on October 3, 1981.</p><p data-start=\"4682\" data-end=\"4819\">“I was the longest on that hunger strike when it came to an end in 1981, so in theory I would have been the next person to die,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"4821\" data-end=\"4918\">By that stage, he said, his liver was failing. His eyesight had gone. He vomited bile constantly.</p><p data-start=\"4920\" data-end=\"5105\">“Once you pass 40 days, you’re entering the danger zone,” Sheehan said. “Physically, the hunger strikers must be very weak now for those who have been on hunger strike for over 50 days.”</p><p data-start=\"5107\" data-end=\"5266\">“Mentally, if they have prepared properly to go on hunger strike, their psychological strength will increase the longer the hunger strike goes on.”</p><p data-start=\"5268\" data-end=\"5349\">“I think if it continues, inevitably some of the hunger strikers are going to die.”</p><p data-start=\"5351\" data-end=\"5581\">Sheehan, who now represents West Belfast as an MLA for Sinn Fein, believes that Palestine Action-linked hunger strikers are political prisoners, adding that people in Ireland understand Palestine in a way few Western countries do.</p><p data-start=\"5583\" data-end=\"5791\">“Ireland is probably the one country in Western Europe where there’s almost absolute support for the Palestinian cause,” he said. “Because we have a similar history of colonisation; of genocide and detention.”</p><p data-start=\"5793\" data-end=\"5890\">“So when Irish people see on their TV screens what’s happening in Gaza, there’s massive empathy.”</p><h2 id=\"ireland-s-stance\">Ireland’s stance</h2><p data-start=\"5914\" data-end=\"6160\">That empathy has increasingly translated into political action. Ireland formally recognised the state of Palestine in 2024 and has joined South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice, alleging genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denies.</p><p data-start=\"6162\" data-end=\"6400\">The Irish government has also taken steps to restrict the sale of Israeli bonds, while Ireland has boycotted the Eurovision Song Contest over Israel’s participation and called for its national football team to be suspended from international competition.</p><p data-start=\"6162\" data-end=\"6400\">But many campaigners say the government’s actions have not gone far enough. They argue that the Occupied Territories Bill, which seeks to ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements, has been stalled since 2018, and express anger that United States military aircraft transporting weapons to Israel are still permitted to pass through Ireland’s <a href=\"https://www.ontheditch.com/state-admits/\">Shannon Airport</a>.</p><p data-start=\"6402\" data-end=\"6506\">Meanwhile, in the northern part of Ireland that remains part of Britain, the war in Gaza has dominated domestic politics.</p><p data-start=\"6508\" data-end=\"6788\">The Stormont Assembly was thrown into crisis after Democratic Unionist Party education minister Paul Givan travelled to Jerusalem on a trip paid for by the Israeli government, prompting a no-confidence vote amid fierce criticism from Irish republican, nationalist, left-wing and unaligned political groups.</p><p data-start=\"6790\" data-end=\"6941\">Belfast City Hall’s decision last month to fly a Palestinian flag was also fervently opposed by unionist councillors before it was eventually approved.</p><p data-start=\"6943\" data-end=\"7120\">For some loyalist and unionist groups, support for Israel has become entwined with loyalty to Britain, with Israeli flags also flying in traditionally loyalist parts of Belfast.</p><p data-start=\"7122\" data-end=\"7262\">With a legacy of identity rooted along sectarian lines, the genocide in Gaza has at times been recast along the old fault lines of division.</p><h2 id=\"solidarity-reaches-palestine\">‘Solidarity reaches Palestine’</h2><p data-start=\"7300\" data-end=\"7418\">Yet on the streets of Belfast, protesters insist their solidarity is not rooted in national identity, but in humanity.</p><p data-start=\"7420\" data-end=\"7574\">Damien Quinn, 33, a member of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, said hunger strikes had always carried a particular weight in Ireland.</p><p data-start=\"7576\" data-end=\"7741\">“We are here today to support the hunger strikers in Britain. But we are also here for the Palestinian people for those being slaughtered every single day,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"7743\" data-end=\"7877\">Palestine Action, he said, “made it very clear they have tried signing petitions, they have tried lobbying, they’ve tried everything”.</p><p data-start=\"7879\" data-end=\"7991\">“So when I see the way they are being treated in prison, for standing up against genocide, that’s heartbreaking.”</p><p data-start=\"7993\" data-end=\"8111\">For Rita Aburahma, 25, a Palestinian who has found a home in Belfast, the hunger strike carries a painful familiarity.</p><p data-start=\"8113\" data-end=\"8213\">“My people don’t have the luxury of speaking out, being in Palestine – solidarity matters,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"8215\" data-end=\"8434\">“I find the hunger strikers are really brave – it’s always been a form of resistance. It does concern me, and many other people, how long it has taken the government to pay attention to them, or take action in any form.</p><p data-start=\"8436\" data-end=\"8673\">“Nothing will save those people if the government doesn’t do something about them. So it is shocking in a way, but not that surprising because the same government has been watching the genocide unfold and escalate without doing anything.</p><p data-start=\"8675\" data-end=\"8734\">“Every form of solidarity reaches the people in Palestine.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

All the UAVs were destroyed by the air defence systems of the Russian Armed Forces,” said Lavrov in a statement.</p><p>He did not say whether Putin was in residence at the time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Lavrov’s Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, quickly <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/kyiv-rejects-russias-claim-of-ukrainian-strike-on-putins-residence\">dismissed the claim</a>. “Almost a day passed and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine’s alleged ‘attack on Putin’s residence’. And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened,” Sybiha said.</p><p>Russia produced photographs of drone debris lying in the snow two days later, but the drone’s location, manufacture and the time of its downing could not be corroborated from them.</p><p>“The attack on Putin’s Valdai residence is presumably a Kremlin fake,” wrote the opposition outlet Sota. “Residents of Valdai, where Putin’s ‘Dinner’ residence is located, told Sota that last night they did not hear the work of the air defence, which would have shot down 91 drones.”</p><p>Sota also pointed out that drones attacking Valdai “necessarily cross a specially protected airspace with objects of the Strategic Missile Forces, East Kazakhstan region, military aviation, closed administrative units such as Solnechny, Lake, etc.</p><p>“A drone crossing the territory of these facilities can fly to the Dinner residence only by miracle,” Sota said.</p><p>Lavrov’s claim also appeared at odds with an earlier announcement from the Russian Ministry of Defence that only 41 drones had been downed in the Novgorod region on the night of December 28-29.</p><p>Russia’s Defence Ministry later issued an update, saying another 49 drones had been shot down over Bryansk and one over Smolensk “flying in the direction of Novgorod region”.</p><p>Ukraine observers pointed out that Bryansk and Smolensk are hundreds of kilometres from Valdai.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, stated that none of the usual evidence of Ukrainian strikes accompanied the alleged attack, such as footage, heat signatures, statements from local officials, or local media reports.</p><p>For example, a successful Ukrainian attack against an oil depot in Rybinsk on December 31 was well-documented on social media. So was an attack on the Novoshakhtinsk refinery in Rostov a week earlier, as well as a number of other strikes during the week.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206837\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206837\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206837\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1767190282.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1767190282\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206837\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-really-happened\">What really happened?</h2><p>News of the alleged attack came a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded successful talks with United States President Donald Trump in Florida, garnering a promise that US forces would participate in Ukraine’s security following any peace agreement with Russia.</p><p>It was the first time the US had agreed to such security guarantees, and it appeared to make Polish Premier Donald Tusk optimistic that the war in Ukraine could end early in 2026.</p><p>“Peace is on the horizon,” he told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.</p><p>“The key result of recent days is the American declaration… (of) willingness to participate in security guarantees for Ukraine after a peace agreement, including the presence of American troops, for example, on the border or on the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia,” Tusk said.</p><p>Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s allies, known as the Coalition of the Willing, were scheduled to meet in Kyiv on January 3 and in France three days later.</p><p>Lavrov’s announcement cast a pall on this optimism when he said, “Russia’s negotiating position will be reviewed.” On the same day, Putin ordered his forces in southern Ukraine to continue efforts to seize the unoccupied remainder of the southern Ukrainian region of Zaporizhia. Moscow controls three-quarters of the region.</p><p>Zelenskyy said Russia was “looking for a pretext” to escalate hostilities and avoid engaging in peace talks, following his successful meeting with Trump.</p><p>“Russia is at it again, using dangerous statements to undermine all achievements of our shared diplomatic efforts with President Trump’s team,” he wrote on social media.</p><p>Russia has repeatedly dashed Trump’s hopes for peace, refusing to cede occupied territory or to accept US and European forces on Ukrainian soil.</p><p>Yet Trump appeared to believe Moscow’s allegations.</p><p>“I don’t like it. It’s not good,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “It’s one thing to be offensive… It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it.”</p><p>Other US officials were not convinced. US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker expressed scepticism, telling an interviewer on Monday, “It’s unclear whether it actually happened.” On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence had determined that Ukraine did not target Putin’s residence.</p><p>Moscow’s messaging appeared to bookend Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump, targeting the US president.</p><p>Putin held staged meetings with his General Staff on Saturday, December 27, and Monday, just before and after Zelenskyy’s meeting with Trump, during which commander-in-chief Valery Gerasimov broadcast exaggerated claims of success.</p><p>He said Russian forces had occupied 6,640 square kilometres (2,564 square miles) of Ukrainian territory and seized 334 Ukrainian settlements in 2025. The ISW said it had “observed evidence indicating a Russian presence in 4,952 square kilometres (1912 sq miles)” and 245 settlements.</p><p>Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii said territory amounting to 0.8 percent of Ukraine’s 603,550sq km (233,032sq miles) had been lost. at the cost of almost 420,000 dead and wounded Russians.</p><p>Ukraine’s General Staff estimated total Russian casualties for the war at more than 1.2 million, almost 11,500 tanks and 24,000 armoured fighting vehicles, more than 37,000 artillery systems, 781 aircraft and well in excess of 4,000 missiles.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>By the end of 2025, Russian forces had still not taken Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, the eastern Ukrainian towns in Donetsk that they had been fighting to capture for five months. They held 55 percent of Hulyaipole in the southern Zaporizhia region, despite claiming to have seized it. Even Russian military reporters admitted Russian forces were being squeezed out of Kupiansk in the northern Kharkiv region, despite claiming also to have seized that.</p><p>“Due to inaccurate reports on the situation to higher authorities, reserves that were ‘not needed’ for the capture and clearing of Kupiansk were redeployed to other areas,” wrote one Kremlin-friendly outlet, citing “systematic exaggeration of successes”.</p><p>While it remained doubtful whether Ukraine did target Valdai, Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian cities were documented. During the last week of the year, Russia launched just more than 1,000 drones and 33 missiles at Ukraine’s cities. Ukraine’s Air Force said it intercepted 86 percent of the drones and 30 of the missiles.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4206833\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206833\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206833\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-EASTERN-UKRAINE-copy-1767190250.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN EASTERN UKRAINE copy-1767190250\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><figure id=\"attachment_4206835\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4206835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4206835\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1767190261.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1767190261\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4206835\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Dressed in a black hoodie and blue jeans, Campbell is well-spoken but shows her disdain for Cape Town’s colonial past, often erupting in harsh language for those she blames for its consequences.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“This castle speaks to the first economic explosion in Cape Town,” she says at the beginning of her five-stop tour of the city. “It’s an architectural crime scene.”</p><p>Campbell refuses to enter the 17th-century castle, which she sees as a symbol of the violence and dispossession that the colonial era brought to South Africa’s second biggest city.</p><p>“That is where they used to hang people,” she says, pointing to one of the castle’s five bastions. It was built by the settlers of the Dutch East India Company, commonly known by its Dutch acronym, VOC. The VOC built the fortress as part of its efforts to establish a refreshment post between the Netherlands and other trade destinations in the East. The castle is now run by the South African military.</p><p>Campbell, an accredited tour guide, has been giving privately run tours like this for 17 years, starting at the castle and offering a scathing critique of the city’s monuments and museums for dozens of people each year.</p><p>She says most official tributes, such as the Slave Memorial erected in 2008 in Church Square, fail to do justice to the enslaved people who contributed to the construction of Cape Town and often neglect to acknowledge the Indigenous population that lived here for hundreds of years before the Dutch arrived in 1652, displacing them and introducing slavery to the Cape.</p><p>Campbell can still see clear echoes in the city of the “genocide” and dispossession of the Khoi people, the Indigenous herders who lived on this land for thousands of years. She remembers her mother’s stories about how this history personally affected her family, who are descendants of the famously wealthy Hessequa, a subset of the Khoi. The Hessequa lost their land and livestock to the Dutch.</p><p>Known as “the people of the trees”, the Hessequa lived for centuries in the farming area now known as Swellendam, about 220km (137 miles) east of Cape Town. The arrival of European settlers transformed them from land and cattle owners to peasant workers employed by white people, conditions that in many places persist to this day.</p><p>Land ownership in Cape Town and South Africa as a whole remains overwhelmingly in the hands of the white minority. Rights groups have also accused white farmers of sometimes abusing predominantly mixed-race agricultural workers and evicting them on a whim, a practice that has carried on since the colonial era.</p><p>“Many of them have worked there for <a href=\"/features/2024/5/30/forgotten-citizens-south-africas-farm-workers-threatened-with-eviction\">generations</a>, and they are just being evicted,” Campbell says. “There’s no pension. There’s nothing. So the ailments of the past [continue].”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203679\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203679\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203679\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-11-01T124013Z_2101072344_RC2BKHA45MB3_RTRMADP_3_TRAVEL-CM-CAPE-TOWN-1767093696.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Castle of Good Hope\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Visitors enter Cape Town’s Castle of Good Hope, one of South Africa’s oldest surviving colonial buildings [Esa Alexander/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-coloniality-of-the-museum\">The coloniality of the museum</h2><p>With a resume that includes posts ranging from trade union administrator and mechanic’s assistant to historian, Campbell started her tours after working at the Groot Constantia estate of the VOC colonial Governor Simon van der Stel, now a museum. This is where she got her first taste for history.</p><p>When she started working on the estate as an information officer in 1998, she found that the history of enslaved and Indigenous people was largely erased on the property, including the “tot” system, the use of wine as payments to workers that dates back centuries and was still in use on some Cape Town farms years after the fall of apartheid in 1994.</p><p>Alarmed by this erasure of her ancestors at the estate, Campbell resigned and pursued a degree in history. Armed with a postgraduate degree specialising in the history of slavery in the Cape,<strong> </strong>Campbell established Transcending History Tours in 2008.</p><p>Her academic research uncovered the inherently colonial nature of museums globally. She discovered that human remains were held in museums, universities and in private ownership, especially in Europe. The South African Museum, founded in 1825, housed human remains that were used in studies that sought to reinforce racist ideologies, such as seeking to prove that non-Europeans were racially inferior. Even though these studies have been halted, the remains continued to be housed by these institutions.</p><p>Campbell would prefer that the museums she tours be decentralised and relocated to the <a href=\"/features/2024/4/10/thirty-years-waiting-for-a-house-south-africas-backyard-dwellers\">Cape Flats</a>, a mainly nonwhite working-class area where Campbell and most descendants of the Khoi and enslaved people live. She argues this would make the museums more accessible to these communities, bringing them closer to their personal histories and demonstrating that their current difficult living conditions and marginalisation are not natural or inevitable, but rather the result of a cruel past.</p><p>“At night, this place is filled with homeless people,” she says on a sunny morning in September as the tour leaves the castle.</p><p>A few steps away, past two lions perched on pillars at the castle’s entrance and a moat filled with fish and pondweed, a barefoot man is asleep on the sidewalk while a woman in a bra and camouflage pants scrounges for food in the shrubs. Like most of the unhoused on the wealthy city’s streets, they are people of colour.</p><p>The tour passes the Grand Parade, the city’s public square and oldest urban open space, where the mud and wood predecessor to the existing castle stood. For many years, it served as a training ground for the colonial garrison before becoming a marketplace, surrounded by striking buildings, such as the Edwardian City Hall.</p><p>The parade’s most famous moment in modern South African history was as the setting of Nelson Mandela’s first public speech after his release from prison in 1990.

Campbell also dislikes the commonly used image of Krotoa on the plaque, which she says is fabricated.</p><p>“The Krotoa that I know, she’s a trailblazer. She’s an interpreter. She’s a negotiator,” Campbell says.</p><p>The niece of the Khoi chief Autshumato, Krotoa joined the household of the first Dutch governor in the Cape, Jan van Riebeeck, at about the age of 12. As one of the first Indigenous interpreters, she became a mediator between the Dutch and the Khoi, playing a key role in the cattle trade, which was vital to the settlers’ survival at the Cape. She also negotiated in the conflict that arose between locals and the settlers.</p><p>Krotoa’s influence in van Riebeeck’s government eventually led to her becoming the first Indigenous person to be baptised as a Christian in 1662 and adopting the name Eva. She married a Danish soldier, who was later appointed as the VOC surgeon, Pieter van Meerhof, in 1664, and the couple became the Cape’s first recorded interracial marriage.</p><p>In the end, though, Krotoa was a controversial figure: Khoi leaders criticised her for adopting colonial ways, and both they and Dutch officials accused her of being a spy for the other side.</p><p>“She went right into the kitchens of the Dutch,” Campbell says. “She used to tell them, ‘I know you. I know who you are. You can’t do anything for yourself. Slaves have to do everything for you.’”</p><p>Campbell says Krotoa was instrumental as a mediator in the first Khoi-Dutch war, which lasted from 1659 to 1660 and was sparked by a campaign led by local Khoi leader Nommoa, or Doman, to reclaim the Cape Peninsula. The Dutch were victorious against the two Khoi groups, the Gorinhaiqua and the Gorachouqua, and expelled them from the peninsula to mountain outposts about 70km (44 miles) away.</p><p>Asked what she would consider a fitting memorial for Krotoa, Campbell says: “Monuments are Eurocentric and hierarchic. Where her memorial should be, I am not sure. What I know is that her story and her memory should be a popular memory and part of our learning in schools and in other tertiary learning. She and her Danish husband van Meerhof were sent to Robben Island. She also spent lots of time at the first castle, which is today’s Golden Acre [shopping mall], and her so-called plaque in Castle Street is a humiliation of the contributions she made in resisting the colony in favour of her people.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203676\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203676\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203676\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2019-07-25T100739Z_1921176509_RC1D5A69FC80_RTRMADP_3_AFRICA-SLAVERY-ARTEFACTS-1767093665.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C571&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A seal from the Registrar of Slaves and Deeds is seen on display at the Slave Lodge Museum in Cape Town\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203676\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A seal from the Registrar of Slaves and Deeds is seen on display at the Slave Lodge Museum in Cape Town [File: Mike Hutchings/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"profits-over-people\">Profits over people</h2><p>Around the corner from Krotoa’s memorial in Castle Street, Campbell stops at another VOC landmark – the cobbled walkway featuring the VOC’s bronze emblem framed by an outline of the castle’s five ramparts.</p><p>“I want you to see how the VOC is embedded right in the fabric of the city,” she says, pointing to the insignia emblazoned in the street.</p><p>Then she directs her tour’s attention to nearby skyscrapers, which she views as symbols of wealth rooted in VOC exploitation.</p><p>As she speaks, workers on their lunch breaks walk by while others sell beaded jewellery, paintings, leather handbags and other wares in stalls dotted along the mall. Most of these workers live in overcrowded townships far outside the city, which is famed for its French Riviera-like lifestyle and has often been voted one of the world’s top tourist destinations.</p><p>“For me, it’s important to speak of that company, the first company that came here,” Campbell says, explaining the origin of capitalism in the region.</p><p>“It comes from there – profits before people. It comes from history. … The VOC is alive and kicking in the city.”</p><h2 id=\"restoring-memory\">Restoring memory</h2><p>The most haunting stop on the tour comes next: the Slave Lodge. It stands on the doorstep of the parliament precinct and the gardens that the VOC established to provide fresh produce to ships journeying between the East and the Netherlands.</p><p>Thousands of enslaved people from as far away as Angola, Benin, Indonesia, India and Madagascar were housed here from 1679 to 1811. Converted into a museum, it contains artefacts, including shackles and the reconstructed hull of a slave ship as well as a plinth recording the names of the enslaved people – names assigned to them by slave owners when they arrived at the Cape.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203684\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203684\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203684\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Slave_Lodge_museum-1767093721.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Slave Lodge museum in Cape Town\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Slave Lodge in Cape Town housed thousands of enslaved people from 1679 to 1811 [Creative Commons]</figcaption></figure><p>Campbell objects to the pristine exhibits, saying they are in stark contrast to the building’s dark history as a place of suffering and violence. One of the most horrific aspects of life there was the sexual violence inflicted by soldiers on women, including rape and coercion into sex work, often with payments made to the VOC.</p><p>This violent culture has had lasting effects, contributing to today’s high levels of sexual crimes and domestic violence on the Cape Flats, according to Campbell.</p><p>“The Slave Lodge does not get the reflection that it should get,” Campbell tells her tour. “It is very much veneered and made palatable to the visitors. It doesn’t bring the voices of the women in.”</p><p>The tour ends in the street behind the Slave Lodge, where Campbell shows the tourists a macabre landmark they might otherwise miss. On a traffic island in the middle of Spin Street is the spot where the city’s slave auctions were once held. A tree that marked the spot was chopped down in 1916. In its place, a slab of stone was installed in 1953, inscribed with a fading and barely legible message about its historical significance.</p><p>“It looks like a drain,” Campbell says, noting the sharp contrast between this neglected memorial and the bronze statue of Afrikaner leader Jan Smuts, oddly situated in front of the Slave Lodge, where the plaque bearing his name has been restored to a brilliant gleam.</p><p>In 2008, the city tried to rectify this oversight at the auction site, unveiling a commemorative art installation designed by prominent artists Gavin Younge and Wilma Cruise across the street. It consists of 11 granite blocks, roughly at knee height, inscribed with the assigned names of enslaved people and words that recall their tortured reality: “Suicide, infanticide, abscond, escape, flee.”</p><p>Activists have criticised the installation for being too cold and failing to convey the deep wounds left by nearly 200 years of slavery.</p><p>“Birds s*** on it, people sit on it, but they don’t know what it is,” Campbell says. “They have the names of the slaves that were held at the Slave Lodge, but there’s no story. … It’s a monument that only serves the master, at the end of the day, because it doesn’t bring out the pain of the people.</p><p>“I would have loved to see a high rise to bring out the memory of the people, … something more visible.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4203622\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4203622\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4203622\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250903_140515-1767091018.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Lucy Campbell\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4203622\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Historian Lucy Campbell, third from right, poses with American students at the end of her tour through historic sites that tell the story of slavery and colonialism in Cape Town [Gershwin Wanneburg/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

India has accused Pakistan of sponsoring “terrorism” on its soil for decades – and in recent times, Pakistan has reciprocated those allegations, accusing New Delhi of backing separatists against Islamabad.</p><p>Each side rejects the other’s accusations, though Pakistan has, at times, accepted that the perpetrators of some of the biggest attacks on Indian soil in recent years – such as in Mumbai in 2008 – did come from Pakistan.</p><p>If there were to be any diplomatic breakthrough between India and Pakistan, Bangladesh would be an unlikely setting: Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan as its eastern wing, before it achieved independence in 1971, with India’s help, after Pakistani troops surrendered and thousands of its soldiers were taken as prisoners of war.</p><p>“Whatever prompted it [the handshake] is good for the region, but there are many ifs and buts down the road,” Khan said.</p><p>Rezaul Hasan Laskar, foreign affairs editor at India’s Hindustan Times newspaper, played down the significance of the interaction.</p><p>“The two happened to be in the same room and did what senior leaders of two countries would do when they find themselves in such a situation. They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries,” Laskar told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He said it was “significant” that all photographs of the encounter emerged from Bangladeshi and Pakistani official social media accounts – rather than from India.</p><p>Laskar noted that India and Pakistan have not held sustained official dialogue since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when gunmen linked to Pakistan killed 166 people.</p><p>“It is hard to see the two sides coming together in any way, given the growing trust deficit,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"hydro-politics\">Hydro politics</h2><p>Arguably, the most consequential fallout of the May conflict was India’s decision to put the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance.</p><p>Pakistan says the move poses an existential threat to its population, which depends heavily on the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, all of which flow from India or Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>Khan, the former diplomat, said that if India were to rethink its position and return to the IWT, it would “be a big confidence-building measure and a harbinger for a semblance of rapprochement”.</p><p>But Laskar wasn’t optimistic.</p><p>“For anyone following India-Pakistan tensions in recent years, the suspension of the IWT should not have come as a surprise,” he said.</p><p>“This has the potential for becoming a new permanent hurdle between the two sides, especially since there are virtually no official contacts between them.”</p><h2 id=\"uncertain-thaw\">Uncertain thaw</h2><p>The past year has seen Pakistan’s geopolitical standing rise, with analysts arguing it is the first time in decades the country has been viewed as a major international player.</p><p>In South Asia, following the ouster of Indian ally Sheikh Hasina, the former Bangladesh prime minister, it has <a href=\"/news/2025/9/2/why-pakistan-is-rushing-to-mend-fences-with-bangladesh\">revived its ties</a> with Bangladesh as well, with several high-profile visits between the two countries.</p><p>Islamabad has also deepened ties with the US, China and Middle Eastern states. Trump, in fact, has on several occasions publicly praised Pakistani leadership and recently called Pakistan’s army chief Asim Munir his “<a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-pakistans-asim-munir-became-trumps-favourite-field-marshal\">favourite field marshal</a>”.</p><p>Pakistan is expected to be part of a controversial US-led international <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/can-pakistan-join-the-gaza-stabilisation-force-without-facing-backlash\">stabilisation force</a> proposed to oversee security in Gaza, and it also signed a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/watershed-how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-reshapes-regions-geopolitics\">defence agreement</a> with Saudi Arabia in September.</p><p>India, meanwhile, has faced diplomatic pressure from Washington. Trump has repeatedly referred to the May conflict and appeared to endorse Pakistani claims of shooting down several Indian fighter jets.</p><p>The US president has also <a href=\"/economy/2025/9/16/how-us-tariffs-are-unraveling-indias-textile-industry\">imposed tariffs</a> of nearly 50 percent on India, while Pakistan received a lower rate of 19 percent.</p><p>With Pakistan seemingly enjoying diplomatic momentum, could 2026 bring a detente between New Delhi and Islamabad?</p><p>Sayed, the foreign policy analyst, said it was in the “national interest” of both countries to maintain at least minimal engagement.</p><p>“They can have a very basic, minimal agenda, in which they should define the rules, red lines and set guardrails. Once that is done, they can have a basic level of dialogue that is agreed upon with consent of both, and bring it to the table,” he said.</p><p>But Khan was sceptical, given the bitterness of the May conflict.</p><p>Laskar said India has steadily escalated its responses to attacks since 2019 and that the May 2025 conflict showed how far both sides were prepared to go.</p><p>As a result, he said, reviving back-channel contacts between India’s national security adviser and Pakistani intelligence officials was essential, as the mechanism had worked in the past.</p><p>“The consolidation of power by Field Marshal Asim Munir, his ability to strike a personal rapport with US President Donald Trump and the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia mutual defence pact are all factors that have implications for the region, which will be factored into New Delhi’s approach,” Laskar said.</p><p>Sayed agreed, saying a “pre-determined and mutually agreed mechanism” to handle incidents of violence, rather than immediate blame, would be a significant step forward.</p><p>“I think India has also understood that it cannot get away with not acknowledging Pakistan’s existence or pretending that it is not there,” he said.</p><p>“Pakistan has emerged as a very important regional player, and India is now compelled to have a bare-minimum level of engagement.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the STC also seeks to carve out a separate nation in southern Yemen, and in December, expanded its military operations in Hadramout and al-Mahra provinces that border Saudi Arabia, setting off a rapid escalation in tensions.</p><p>Saudi Arabia has accused the United Arab Emirates – also a part of the anti-Houthi coalition – of arming the STC and of encouraging the separatist group to expand into Hadramout and al-Mahra, which Riyadh has said threatens its national security. The UAE has denied those allegations, insisting that it supports Saudi Arabia’s security.</p><p>However, while the UAE has since agreed to demands from Yemen’s Riyadh-backed Presidential Leadership Council and Saudi Arabia to withdraw its troops from Yemen, the STC has refused to pull back from Hadramout and al-Mahra.</p><p>On Thursday, the STC-aligned Transport Ministry within the internationally recognised government claimed that the stoppage at the airport was a result of Saudi Arabia imposing new requirements mandating that flights to and from Aden airport undergo inspection in Jeddah.</p><p>The ministry said it was “shocked” by the move, adding that Saudi authorities later clarified the restriction only applied to flights operating between Aden and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>A Saudi source denied to the Reuters news agency that it was involved in restricting flights, saying Yemen’s internationally recognised government, led by the Presidential Leadership Council, was behind the requirement for UAE-bound flights.</p><p>Yemeni presidential adviser, Thabet al-Ahmadi, confirmed to Al Jazeera that it had imposed a requirement that applied to one flight route departing from Aden airport. He said the move was meant to prevent STC money smuggling.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al-Ahmadi said the government did not support a complete halt to flights, adding it wanted to ensure air traffic continued unimpeded.</p><p>Earlier this week, the UAE announced it was voluntarily withdrawing its remaining “counterterrorism” forces from Yemen. That came after Riyadh <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-yemeni-port-over-unauthorised-weapons-shipment\">struck</a> what it claimed to be a UAE-linked weapons shipment in the southern port city of Mukalla.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Wednesday, Rashad al-Alimi, the head of the internationally recognised government in Yemen, warned that any moves by the STC to further entrench their position in the provinces would have severe consequences.</p><p>The STC has, however, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/yemens-separatist-stc-refuses-to-withdraw-from-provinces-near-saudi-arabia\">remained defiant</a>, saying it would remain in the provinces.</p><p>However, STC spokesperson Mohammed al-Naqeeb said the group was coordinating its movements with the Homeland Shield forces, which had been the main security force in the provinces prior to the STC offensive. The Homeland Shield is affiliated with the Yemeni government and the Saudi-led coalition.</p><p>Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war since Houthi forces took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014. The group continues to control large swaths of the country’s northwest, with the STC and government contesting the southern and eastern flanks.</p></div></div></body></html>"
