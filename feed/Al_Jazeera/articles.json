China and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it.”</p><p>Trump added that “the National Security of the United States, and the World at large, is at stake.”</p><p>Trump wrote that starting on February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will be charged a 10 percent tariff on all their exports to the US.</p><p>On June 1, the tariff is to be increased to 25 percent, he said. “This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump wrote.</p><p>Trump additionally wrote: “The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years. Many Presidents have tried, and for good reason, but Denmark has always refused.”</p><h2 id=\"is-trump-the-first-us-president-to-seek-control-of-greenland\">Is Trump the first US president to seek control of Greenland?</h2><p>Leaders in Denmark and Greenland have consistently insisted that Greenland is not for sale. In the past few days, Greenlanders have been protesting against Trump’s wishes to acquire Greenland. Yet Trump has pushed for acquiring the Arctic territory since his first term, and he is not the first US president to pursue such a purchase.</p><p>After buying Alaska from Russia in 1867, then-Secretary of State William H Seward unsuccessfully sought to buy Greenland. During World War II, the US occupied Greenland after Germany’s invasion of Denmark and built military and radio facilities there. It maintains a permanent presence today at the Pituffik Space Base in the northwest.</p><p>In 1946, while Greenland was still a Danish colony, President Harry S Truman secretly offered Denmark $100m for the island, but Copenhagen refused. The proposal became public only in 1991.</p><p>American citizens do not support Washington acquiring Greenland, polls have indicated. This week, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of US residents showed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigations/how-americans-view-trumps-ambitions-greenland-2026-01-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">less than one in five respondents</a> support the idea of acquiring Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-trump-want-greenland\">Why does Trump want Greenland?</h2><p>The location and natural resources of the island make it strategically important for Washington.</p><p>Greenland is geographically part of North America, located between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. It is home to 56,000 residents, mostly <a href=\"/program/witness/2021/6/17/the-fight-for-greenland-a-new-generation-speaks\">Indigenous Inuit people</a>.</p><p>Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, is closer to New York City – about 2,900km (1,800 miles) away – than the Danish capital, Copenhagen, located 3,500km (2,174 miles) to the east.</p><p>It is a NATO territory through Denmark and an EU-associated overseas territory with residents holding EU citizenship.</p><p>Its location offers the shortest air and sea routes between North America and Europe, making it strategically vital for US military operations and missile early-warning systems. Washington has also sought more radar coverage around the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap to monitor Russian and Chinese movements.</p><p>Greenland is rich in minerals, including most of the EU’s listed “critical raw materials”, but there is no oil and gas extraction, and many Indigenous residents oppose large-scale mining. The economy mainly depends on fishing.</p><p>As climate change opens up more of the Arctic, major powers such as the US, Canada, China and Russia are increasingly interested in its untapped resources.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-europe-responded-to-trump-s-tariff-threats\">How has Europe responded to Trump’s tariff threats?</h2><p>All 27 members of the EU will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss their response to Trump’s threat.</p><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer responded in a post on X on Saturday, saying: “Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” Starmer wrote.</p><p>“Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”</p><p></p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also responded in an X post, saying: “The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland. Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the US.</p><p>“Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty.”</p><p></p><p>European Council President Antonio Costa shared a post identical to von der Leyen’s on his own X account.</p><p></p><p>EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X: “China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among Allies.”</p><p>Kallas added: “Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.”</p><p>David van Weel, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, said during an interview on Dutch television on Sunday: “It’s blackmail what he’s doing, … and it’s not necessary. It doesn’t help the alliance [NATO], and it also doesn’t help Greenland.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

This body holds the purse strings and sets the strategic vision. It is chaired by President Trump, who retains veto power.</p><p>The lineup of Executive Board members is:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio:</strong> Rubio is one of the most pro-Israel officials in the Trump administration. He has said that those who criticise Israel will not be granted US visas. He has also criticised the move by several Western countries to recognise Palestinian statehood as a “reckless decision” that “only serves Hamas propaganda”.</li>\n<li><strong>US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff:</strong> Witkoff is a New York-based real estate developer and investor close to Trump. He was tasked with ceasefire talks in Gaza. Witkoff was accused of reneging on Gaza talks after he accused Hamas of blocking a deal last July. Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim accused him of “serving the Israeli position”.</li>\n<li><strong>Jared Kushner:</strong> Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. is also a staunch supporter of Israel who previously suggested that Palestinians are incapable of self-governance. He has described Gaza as having “very valuable waterfront property”. Kushner was also the driving force of the so-called Abraham Accords, a series of deals that formalised ties between several Arab countries and Israel.</li>\n<li><strong>Billionaire businessman Marc Rowan:</strong> Rowan is a co-founder of Apollo Global Management, which is one of the world’s largest investment firms. He has run philanthropic activities in Israel and has funded pro-Israel advocacy groups in the United States, according to media reports. He has also supported the Israeli-American Council, which works to strengthen Israeli and American Jewish communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Ajay Banga:</strong> Banga is currently the president of the World Bank. He was nominated to the post by President Trump. Banga has previously served as vice chairman at equity firm General Atlantic and chief executive at Mastercard.</li>\n<li><strong>Former British PM Tony Blair:</strong> Blair, who served as British prime minister from 1997 to 2007, supported the US-led so-called “war on terror” in the early 2000s, and joined then-US President George W Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. He is seen as a polarising figure in the region.</li>\n<li><strong>Robert Gabriel Jr: </strong>Gabriel is deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration.</li>\n</ul><p>Trump has invited the leaders of Egypt, Turkiye and Jordan to join his “Board of Peace” to oversee the post-war transition in Gaza, according to authorities in Ankara, Cairo and Amman.</p><p>Trump has also invited a number of world leaders, including Argentina’s President Javier Milei and Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney, to be part of a Board of Peace. Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that the Trump administration has asked countries to contribute at least $1bn to become permanent members. A non-permanent membership would remain free.</p><p><a href=\"https://aje.news/7l2lt1\">Mladenov</a>, who championed the Abraham Accords as UN Middle East envoy in 2015-2020, will serve as the “on-the-ground link” between the Board of Peace and the NCAG.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"34\">The White House appointed two “strategic advisers” with controversial records to the Board of Peace:</p><p data-path-to-node=\"34\"><strong>Aryeh Lightstone:</strong> A key figure in the Abraham Accords and the controversial aid organisation the “<a href=\"https://aje.io/prynms\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a>” (GHF), which faced severe accusations regarding aid mismanagement and coordination failures that led to the killing of hundreds of Palestinians seeking food.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"34\"><strong>Josh Gruenbaum:</strong> Associated with previous plans to turn Gaza into a “Middle East Riviera,” prioritising real estate potential over refugee rights.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"34\">Iyad al-Qarra, a Gaza-based political analyst, told Al Jazeera that this top-heavy structure reflects a “corporate takeover” of the Palestinian cause.</p><p>“Trump treats Gaza not as a homeland, but as a bankrupt company in need of a new board of directors,” al-Qarra said. “He has placed the strategic decision-making in the hands of investors and foreign politicians, turning sovereignty into a commercial venture.”</p><h2 id=\"the-gaza-executive-board\">The ‘Gaza Executive Board’</h2><p>Below the founding council sits the “Gaza Executive Board,” tasked with regional coordination.</p><ul>\n<li>Steve Witkoff</li>\n<li>Jared Kushner</li>\n<li>Turkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan</li>\n<li>Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi</li>\n<li>Egyptian General Intelligence Director General Hassan Rashad</li>\n<li>Tony Blair</li>\n<li>Marc Rowan</li>\n<li>UAE Minister of State for International Cooperation Reem Al-Hashimy</li>\n<li>Nickolay Mladenov</li>\n<li>Israeli-Cypriot real estate tycoon Yakir Gabay. whose presence on a board with Arab and Turkish diplomats raises questions about the normalisation of economic ties under the guise of reconstruction</li>\n<li>Sigrid Kaag, a Dutch politician and United Nations coordinator in Gaza</li>\n</ul><p>The Executive Board, which has representation from Arab countries, has been tasked with helping to “support effective governance” in Gaza.</p><p>“The Board will help support effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza,” the White House said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"the-israeli-criticism\">The Israeli criticism</h2><p>Despite the US-led nature of the <a href=\"https://aje.news/cz38yq\">plan</a>, the inclusion of representatives from Turkiye and Qatar has faced opposition from Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office stated on Sunday that the formation of this executive committee “was not coordinated with Israel”.</p><p>According to Israeli media, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for a return to “full war” and “voluntary migration” rather than handing Gaza to a board involving Turkiye. Meanwhile, former National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror told Israeli radio that allowing “Turkiye – led by a government sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood – into Gaza is a strategic error that would strengthen Hamas”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"24\">However, al-Qarra dismisses this “anger” as largely theatrical. “Netanyahu’s objection is tactical,” al-Qarra noted. “Ultimately, this board outsources the heavy lifting of managing Gaza’s misery to international donors, while Israel retains security control without paying the price.”</p><h2 id=\"the-national-committee-for-the-administration-of-gaza\">The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"26\">At the bottom of the hierarchy lies the only Palestinian component: NCAG</p><p data-path-to-node=\"27\">In an interview with Egyptian Media, Committee Chairman Ali Shaath confirmed the official lineup. The 12-member team is comprised entirely of professionals tasked with managing specific service sectors:</p><ul>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,0,0\"><strong>Economy &amp; Trade:</strong> Engineer Aed Abu Ramadan</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,1,0\"><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Abdel Karim Ashour</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,2,0\"><strong>Health:</strong> Dr Aed Yaghi</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,3,0\"><strong>Housing &amp; Lands:</strong> Engineer Osama al-Saadawi</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,4,0\"><strong>Justice:</strong> Adnan Abu Warda</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,5,0\"><strong>Interior &amp; Internal Security:</strong> Major General Sami Nasman</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,6,0\"><strong>Municipalities &amp; Water:</strong> Ali Barhoum</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,7,0\"><strong>Finance:</strong> Bashir Al-Rayyes</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,8,0\"><strong>Social Affairs:</strong> Hana Tarazi</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,9,0\"><strong>Education:</strong> Jabr Al-Daour</li>\n<li data-path-to-node=\"28,10,0\"><strong>Telecommunications:</strong> Engineer Omar Al-Shamali</li>\n</ul><p data-path-to-node=\"29\">The appointment of Major General Sami Nasman to the interior sector places a veteran figure in charge of internal policing. However, questions remain about his authority given the parallel presence of US-led forces.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"33\">Critics argue that relegating Palestinians to this tier strips them of political agency. Wissam Afifa, a writer and analyst in Gaza, told Al Jazeera that this structure confirms the fears of a “new mandate.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"34\">“The Palestinians have been reduced to municipal employees,” Afifa said. “They are tasked with cleaning up the sewage and rebuilding schools, but they have zero say in the political future of their land. It is a sovereignty-minus model where the ‘National Committee’ takes orders from the ‘High Representative,’ who takes orders from the White House.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"34\">However, Afifa added that people who have witnessed a genocide are desperate for things to change. “Speaking not as an analyst but as a citizen living through the catastrophe, people see this committee as a potential lifeline,” Afifa said. “There are high hopes that it might finally restore some semblance of life to a zone Israel has made uninhabitable.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"37\">Afifa emphasised that while the technocratic administration members are “highly professional”, the real challenge lies elsewhere. “This is not a test for the committee – it is a test for Trump,” he explained.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"37\">He questioned whether the new administration will bring in “a ‘Marshall Plan’ level of support” and whether it will “fail to restrain Israeli arrogance”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"37\">“The fear,” Afifa said, “is that we will face humanitarian blackmail, where aid is conditioned on security concessions.”</p><h2 id=\"international-stabilisation-force\" data-path-to-node=\"31\">International Stabilisation Force</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"39\">Operating alongside these tiers is the military pillar, led by US General Jasper Jeffers as commander of the “International Stabilisation Force”. His mandate includes “permanent disarmament”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"40\">Afifa warns that this clause shifts the premise from relief to an Israeli security priority, potentially setting the stage for conflict.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"40\">“The core issue is that this force is tasked with enforcing an Israeli agenda – disarmament – without a political settlement,” Afifa warned. “Most countries are hesitating because they refuse to act as security contractors for Israel. This isn’t a recipe for stability; it’s a recipe for an internationalised civil war.”</p><h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"46\">The “Board of Peace” creates a clear hierarchy: The US and business moguls decide, the region pays and coordinates, and the Palestinians implement service delivery.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"47\">“This is the ultimate marginalisation,” Afifa concluded. “By separating the ‘service’ file from the ‘political’ file, the plan attempts to bury the Palestinian national project.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"48\">Al-Qarra added that the structure treats the symptoms while ignoring the disease.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"48\">“The true test will be on the ground,” al-Qarra told Al Jazeera. “The people of Gaza want national, Palestinian governance, not American trusteeship. Anybody who fails to address the occupation is simply managing the crisis, not solving it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Last week, just as Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip intensified, United States presidential envoy Steven Witkoff announced on social media that the “ceasefire” is entering its second stage. In the following days, the administration of US President Donald Trump unveiled the makeup of a foreign executive committee and a peace board that will oversee the provisional administration of Gaza composed of Palestinian technocrats.</p><p>This setup reflects the wishes of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that neither Hamas nor the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority (PA) would be involved in Gaza’s future. Although the latter is mentioned in Trump’s “peace plan”, it supposedly first has to carry out a set of unnamed reforms to have any role in Gaza.</p><p>What this means in reality is that Fatah, too, can easily be blocked from returning to govern the Gaza Strip with the excuse that these vague reforms have not been carried out.</p><p>The problem with the present setup and Israel’s insistence on “no Hamas, no Fatah” is that they reflect a profound ignorance of the fabric of Palestinian society, its politics and history. The idea that a Palestinian political entity can be created by outside forces and fully integrated into the occupation to manage Palestinian affairs is unrealistic.</p><p>Over the past 77 years, various Palestinian national movements and revolutions have emerged, united by a single common denominator: the rejection of Israeli colonial presence. No Palestinian collective, regardless of its form, has ever publicly agreed to integration into the Israeli colonial project.</p><p>Within the framework of resistance, the collective Palestinian consciousness was forged, political parties were born, and the trajectory of public opinion was defined.</p><p>While the tools and methods adopted by different segments of Palestinian society and political factions may vary, they all share a common commitment to the Palestinian cause and to Palestinian rights.</p><p>Fatah and Hamas remain the two most prominent political components of Palestinian society. Fatah emerged as the dominant national liberation movement before its political trajectory shifted following the Oslo Accords, while Hamas has maintained its commitment to resistance since its inception. Between these two currents and other smaller factions, the Palestinian social fabric naturally rejects any leadership or entity that operates outside the framework of national independence or accepts foreign guardianship.</p><p>Israel has decided to ignore this deeply rooted reality, attempting to bypass it by imposing artificial facts on the ground. Consequently, it has continuously sought “local alternatives” for governance in Gaza.</p><p>Throughout the war, Israel attempted to empower and arm certain individuals and groups, hoping they could have a role in the postwar era. Many of them were people who were socially marginalised before the war, and some have extensive criminal records. One example is <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/7/abu-shababs-death-signals-the-inevitable-failure-of-israels-plan-for-gaza\">Yasser Abu Shabab</a>, a member of the Tarabin tribe, who was imprisoned for many years on drug-related charges and who during the war received substantial Israeli backing to create his own militia.</p><p>He looted humanitarian aid and collaborated with the occupation in a variety of ways in Rafah, including securing passage for Israeli troops. After he <a href=\"/features/2025/12/4/who-was-yasser-abu-shabab-israel-backed-militia-leader-killed-in-gaza\">was killed</a> on December 4, there were celebrations in Gaza; his own tribe issued a statement denouncing him. Israeli attempts to engage with other clans and empower them have also ended badly.</p><p>Prominent families and clans have repeatedly condemned in public statements the actions of individual members who have decided to collaborate with Israel. They have withdrawn protection and ostracised the collaborators, while affirming that Palestinian clans remain firmly committed to the Palestinian national struggle.</p><p>This rejection reflects the failure of Israeli policy to create any local extension aligned with its project. It also confirms Israel’s inability to erase Palestinian national memory or break the collective will, despite genocide, starvation, and displacement.</p><p>The situation is similar in the West Bank. There, for three decades, the Fatah-dominated PA has collaborated on security with the occupation. As a result, its legitimacy today is extremely low. According to <a href=\"https://www.pcpsr.org/en/node/1000\">a recent poll</a>, the PA has an approval rating of just 23 percent in the West Bank, while its president, Mahmoud Abbas, has 16 percent.</p><p>It is important to note here that despite the PA’s close security ties to the occupation, it has failed to stem out Palestinian resistance in the West Bank. In the years preceding the war of genocide, the West Bank witnessed the rise of armed formations that were independent of the traditional factions Fatah and Hamas, such as Areen al-Usud (Lions’ Den) in Nablus and the Jenin Brigades.</p><p>These groups were organised by youth and enjoyed broad popular support. Their resistance campaigns reflected the continuity of the armed struggle approach outside traditional structures and the support it enjoys among the Palestinian people.</p><p>What Israel and its Western allies who are trying to create a new governance mechanism for Gaza fail to understand is that in the Palestinian context, legitimacy matters. It is something that cannot be created by foreign councils or Israeli-funded militias. That is because legitimacy in Palestine is derived from resistance, which ties national history and identity together.</p><p>Any attempt to bypass this reality is doomed to failure, as it would only turn Gaza into a zone of permanent chaos, internal conflicts, and comprehensive security collapse. It would also shatter Trump’s legacy as a dealmaker and expose the present arrangement as nothing more than a political spectacle to cover up the fallout of an Israeli-executed genocide.</p><p>The only solution that can guarantee stability is full Palestinian administrative independence, based exclusively on the will of the Palestinian people in all their diversity and affiliations, with a clear path toward the establishment of a fully sovereign Palestinian state.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The army and the SDF had been clashing over strategic posts and oilfields along the Euphrates River.</p><p>Speaking in Damascus, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said that the agreement will see Syrian state institutions move into three eastern and northern governorates – al-Hasakah, Deir Az Zor, and Raqqa – previously controlled by the SDF.</p><p>“We advise our Arab tribes to remain calm and allow for the implementation of the agreement’s terms,” al-Sharaa said.</p><p>The agreement stipulates that the SDF administration in charge of ISIL (ISIS) detainees and camps, and the forces guarding the facilities, will be integrated into the country’s state structure, now giving the government full legal and security responsibility.</p><p>Additionally, the SDF will propose a list of leaders to fill senior military, security, and civilian posts within the central government, ensuring national partnership.</p><p>Al-Sharaa made the announcement after he met United States Special Envoy to Syria Tom Barrack in Damascus. SDF chief Mazloum Abdi was supposed to be at the meeting, but al-Sharaa said that weather conditions meant that his trip would be postponed until Monday.</p><p>But Barrack welcomed the ceasefire and wrote in a post on X that it was a “pivotal inflection point, where former adversaries embrace partnership over division”.</p><p>“President al-Sharaa has affirmed that the Kurds are an integral part of Syria, and the United States looks forward to the seamless integration of our historic partner in the fight against ISIS with the Global Coalition’s newest member, as we press forward in the enduring battle against terrorism,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"victory\">‘Victory’</h2><p>Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna, reporting from the Syrian capital, said the ceasefire can be seen as a “victory for Damascus and its ally Turkiye”.</p><p>“Turkiye sees the SDF as the Syrian branch of the PKK, an organisation that Turkiye has been at war with since 1984, and now, as part of the ceasefire agreement, it says that the SDF will expel PKK elements from outside of Syria’s borders,” he said.</p><p>“Now cities like Raqqa and Hasakah and Deir Az Zor will be under full government control with civil institutions under Damascus rule, which is really what Damascus was hoping for, and it’s played out very well for them indeed,” Oghanna added.</p><p>Syrian state media says that the agreement will see the military handover of the SDF-controlled governorates and the takeover of civilian institutions.</p><p>The Syrian government will also take over “all border crossings and oil and gas fields”.</p><p>A previous agreement in March that included the integration of SDF forces into the Syrian military was not implemented, and fighting has periodically broken out between the two sides in recent months, increasing in ferocity this month.</p><p>But on Saturday, the Syrian army continued its advance into towns in the SDF-held territory.</p><p>According to state media, the army had taken the northern city of Tabqa and its adjacent dam, as well as the major Freedom dam, formerly known as the Baath, west of Raqqa.</p><p>Moreover, the army seized the Omar oilfield, the country’s largest, and the Conoco gas field in Deir Az Zor, in a major blow to the SDF. Last week, al-Sharaa said it was unacceptable for the SDF to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and other commodity resources.</p><p>According to Gamal Mansour, a lecturer in political science at the University of Toronto, the SDF had become isolated politically, explaining their rapid retreat.</p><p>“Sometimes you have arms, but your political situation, the lack of backing, the strategic and regional background in which you’re operating … therein lies the problem that SDF has,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Iraqi Kurdistan read the regional image and the strategic posture of the SDF in a way that had them go to the SDF and tell them ‘you need to … [cooperate] with the Americans so that you can have a peaceful relationship with the Syrian government’”, he said, adding that the US has also told the SDF as much.</p><p>Mansour explained that the success of the Syrian government’s rapid advance was also driven largely by Arab tribes in SDF-controlled areas, whose loyalty to the SDF was already fragile amid discontent with their rule, Kurdish nationalist dominance and a lack of economic investment.</p><p>The ceasefire agreement also outlined that the SDF had committed to the removal of all non-Syrian Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) leaders and members from the territory to ensure sovereignty and regional stability.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For more than a year, US President Donald Trump has openly threatened to “take” the world’s largest island, Greenland, which is currently a semi-autonomous entity within the Kingdom of Denmark. The threats seem to intensify by the hour, and the situation may well have worsened by the time you read this.</p><p>I am a member of the Danish parliament, the Folketing, and the foreign affairs spokesperson for Enhedslisten, the left-wing Red-Green Alliance within it. Our concern as a party is in no way over the future of continued “Danish rule” in Greenland. The 57,000 Greenlanders have an obvious right to self-determination, and we support their right to shape their own future and decide their alliances.</p><p>As the former colonial power, Denmark carries a heavy burden of historical guilt and responsibility to assist the Greenlanders in developing their own democracy, sustainable economy and vision for statehood.</p><p>Denmark must stand with Greenland against external aggression and domination. It is the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark that is being threatened, and the right to self-determination of the people of Greenland that is being undermined. Trump is not on a path to liberate the Palestinians, the Venezuelans or the Greenlanders. He is on a path of self-interest and control.</p><p>Trump’s intervention in Venezuela highlighted his complete disrespect for international law and state sovereignty. Silence on such blatant violations is bound to pave the way for the next illegal quest driven by his or other autocratic leaders’ appetite to conquer other countries.</p><p>The bullies of this world do not respect bootlicking and appeasement. And Trump is a bully. His actions should be met with a clear “no” from any political leader who is committed to maintaining a rules-based global order.</p><p>What the world witnessed in Caracas does not bode well for other states that lie in any superpower’s self-declared sphere of interest. Trump, obviously, views both Venezuela and Greenland as part of his “backyard”, which he is going to dominate, rule, and “run” — because he can.</p><p>The US has no legitimacy or right to take over other countries. The fact that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s regime presided over a severe economic crisis and was responsible for widespread poverty, oppression, and electoral fraud does not in any shape or form legitimise Trump’s actions. Those who applaud and welcome the kidnapping of Maduro contribute to further undermining the international rules-based order and invite Trump and other cynical strongmen to do the same — including in Greenland.</p><p>The rules-based global order that we used to know was based on containing power with legal means, ensuring the sovereignty of states, and protecting people from state abuse and oppression. If these established rules for international peaceful coexistence are not defended and respected, they become irrelevant — with incalculable consequences for peace and stability. Yet we know that Western countries have enforced them rather selectively. Israel’s colonisation and genocide in Palestine is a stark example.</p><p>Washington’s new National Security Strategy clearly states that the United States has the right to assert its overwhelming political, economic, and military power in the world in general and the Western Hemisphere in particular. At his Mar-a-Lago press conference on January 3, Trump proudly referred to the “Donroe Doctrine” and outlined an approach to foreign policy aimed at protecting US dominance from any conceivable challenge. We, and the Greenlanders, have reason to fear the consequences.</p><p>Only dominant and autocratic powers with imperial ambitions, who eye other countries and their resources greedily, will benefit from the kind of world order that is now evolving in front of our eyes. Those powers want more land to show how big and powerful they are. They take other countries and their natural resources by force because they can — and because we let them.</p><p>The result is lawlessness – a world ruled by the law of the jungle where “might is right” and where all peoples in small and medium-sized countries face increasing insecurity.</p><p>The former Danish colony of Greenland is a democratic country today with a completely legitimate political leadership in the form of a government, Naalakkersuisut, and parliament, Inatsisartut.</p><p>Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen has repeatedly emphasised that he, his government, and the vast majority of Greenlanders have no desire to become US citizens or in any way part of the US.</p><p>As <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/we-choose-denmark-over-joining-us-says-greenland-pm-nielsen\">he said</a> at a press conference in Copenhagen on January 13, “If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark”.</p><p>This is understandable, given the fact that the US has no universal healthcare system and no higher education that is free of charge, as Greenland has. The Greenlanders have, no doubt, also taken note of the US’s dismal record when it comes to the rights and dignity of Indigenous peoples such as the Native Americans or the Inuits of Alaska.</p><p>All of this will not stop Trump from “getting” Greenland through a combination of military, political, and economic threats and brutal coercion.</p><p>The security situation in Europe and in Greenland is far past the point where it makes sense to walk on eggshells or try to flatter Trump. That is why the Kingdom of Denmark, the other Nordic countries, and any country in Europe and elsewhere that values the rules-based global order will have to reboot their approach and understand the need for strategic autonomy or independence from the US.</p><p>This involves a consistent policy of not procuring American arms, including fighter jets, which, unfortunately, Denmark purchased once again in 2025. It also means cutting ties when it comes to intelligence cooperation and developing internet platforms and media that can act independently of the US tech giants that are currently more or less under Trump’s control. We have to protect our democracies.</p><p>Our party calls on all progressive forces in Europe and around the world to unite and mobilise in a joint struggle for the right to self-determination and against the US’s and other major powers’ imperial and neocolonial ambitions of reshaping the world.</p><p>We need to put pressure on political leaders around the world to move away from appeasement and acquiescence towards the United States and to insist consistently on international law, the United Nations Charter, and the right to self-determination.</p><p>This is the struggle of our time.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The Deir Az Zor governorate has announced the closure of all public institutions for the safety of residents as fighting continues to rage.</p><p>Syrian Ministry of Interior spokesman Noureddine al-Baba told Al Jazeera that police have secured all areas captured by Syrian soldiers after the rapid territorial gains over the past few days.</p><p>On Saturday, the SDF withdrew from Deir Hafer and some surrounding villages in Aleppo governorate that are home to predominantly Arab populations, after which Syrian forces moved in, triggering celebrations. Deir Hafer is about 50km (30 miles) east of Aleppo city.</p><p>“It happened with the least amount of losses,” Hussein al-Khalaf, a resident of Deir Hafer, told Reuters. “There’s been enough blood in this country, Syria. We have sacrificed and lost enough. People are tired of it.”</p><p>The Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, affiliated with the SDF, on Saturday accused the Syrian government of violating a withdrawal agreement, saying it “attacked our forces on multiple fronts since yesterday morning”. The SDF also warned that the attacks on Raqqa might threaten security as the city hosts thousands of ISIL (ISIS) detainees.</p><p>The US-backed SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, was formed in 2015, nearly four years after the armed uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began. Al-Assad remained in power until he was ousted in December 2024 by Syrian opposition fighters led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is now interim president.</p><p>The US envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, will meet SDF leader Mazloum Abdi (also known as Mazloum Kobani) and al-Sharaa on Sunday in Damascus, according to the Syrian Ministry of Information.</p><p>The renewed fighting has widened the rift between al-Sharaa’s government, which has pledged to reunify Syria after 14 years of war, and wary Kurdish authorities who distrust the new administration. On Friday al-Sharaa <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">issued a decree</a> declaring Kurdish a “national language” and granting the minority group official recognition.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4249028\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4249028\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4249028\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-SYRIAcontrol-map-January-18-2026_Control-Map-1768738675.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-SYRIA_control map - January 18 2026_Control Map-1768738675\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4249028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-significant-is-the-control-of-raqqa\">How significant is the control of Raqqa?</h2><p>Raqqa is an Arab-majority governorate in northern Syria and has some of the country’s largest oil- and gasfields.</p><p>Kurdish anxieties have been sharpened by sectarian bloodshed last year when almost 1,500 Alawites were killed by pro-government forces in western Syria and hundreds of Druze were killed in clashes in the south.</p><p>When the Syrian army seized these regions, Arab civilians took to the streets to celebrate.</p><p>“This indicated the social and demographic fragility of the SDF. Now the question is, will the SDF see this reality and agree to demands by Damascus to integrate into the Syrian state,” Omer Ozkizilcik from the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs said.</p><p>Omar Abu Layla, a Syrian affairs analyst, told Al Jazeera Barrack tried on several occasions to bring the SDF to the negotiating table with the authorities in Damascus but “they didn’t listen to him.”</p><p>Abu Layla said the central government made many overtures to the group but the SDF “wasted time”, assuming the authorities in Damascus were weak and allowing nearly a year to pass since an <a href=\"/features/2025/12/23/clashes-in-aleppo-as-deadline-for-sdfs-integration-into-army-approaches\">agreement in March</a> that would have seen the SDF’s forces integrated into the regular army.</p><p>“What [we] are witnessing now in the region is the end of the SDF,” he argued.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-march-agreement-between-the-syrian-army-and-sdf\">What was the March agreement between the Syrian army and SDF?</h2><p>On March 10, <a href=\"/news/2025/1/29/syrias-ahmed-al-sharaa-named-president-for-transitional-period\">al-Sharaa</a> reached an agreement with Abdi.</p><p>The agreement emphasised the unity of Syria and stipulated that “all civil and military institutions in northeastern Syria” be merged “into the administration of the Syrian state, including border crossings, the airport and oil and gas fields”.</p><p>The agreement also included affirmation that the Kurdish people are integral to Syria and have a right to citizenship and guaranteed constitutional rights.</p><p>After a breakdown of this deal, heavy fighting between the SDF and Syrian army resumed in the Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh neighbourhoods of Aleppo city last month. A US-brokered ceasefire took effect on January 10.</p><p>The SDF’s secular Kurdish leadership is linked to the Kurdish nationalist Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which fought a decades-old rebellion against the Turkish state until last year. Although the PKK announced in May that it would lay down its arms and disband, it is still listed as a “terrorist” group by Turkiye, the European Union and the US.</p><p>Despite this, the US backed the SDF because it was an effective partner against ISIL, which the SDF and a US-led coalition defeated in northeastern Syria by 2019.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-us-reacted\">How has the US reacted?</h2><p>Washington has urged the Syrian army to stop advancing into Kurdish-held territory.</p><p>Admiral Brad Cooper, who is in charge of US Central Command, which oversees the US military’s Middle East operations, wrote in a statement published on X that the Syrian army should “cease any offensive actions in areas” between Aleppo city and Tabqa.</p><p>Aleppo is roughly 160km (100 miles) west of Tabqa.</p><p>“Aggressively pursuing ISIS and relentlessly applying military pressure requires teamwork among Syrian partners in coordination with US and coalition forces,” Cooper said. “A Syria at peace with itself and its neighbors is essential to peace and stability across the region.”</p><p>William Laurence, a professor at American University in Washington, DC, and a former US diplomat, said “it’s going to be very difficult” for the US to resolve the political impasse between Syria’s government and the SDF.</p><p>“[US President Donald] Trump wants the quick fix, and he wants Tom Barrack to sort of wave a magic wand and get what he wants. But that’s not really how things work,” Laurence told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Sustainable solutions rely on trust-building, and we’ve had very little of that.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-has-al-sharaa-said\">What has al-Sharaa said?</h2><p>After fierce clashes earlier this month, al-Sharaa issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree</a> on Friday formally recognising Kurdish as a “national language” and restoring citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians.</p><p>At least 22 people were killed and 173 wounded in Aleppo after fighting broke out there on January 6.</p><p>The decree for the first time grants Kurdish Syrians rights, including recognition of their Kurdish identity as part of Syria’s national fabric. It designates Kurdish as a national language alongside Arabic and allows schools to teach it.</p><p>It also abolishes measures dating to a 1962 census in Hasakah province that stripped many Kurds of Syrian nationality and grants citizenship to all affected residents, including those previously registered as stateless.</p><p>The decree declares Newroz, the Kurdish New Year festival, a paid national holiday. It bans ethnic or linguistic discrimination, requires state institutions to adopt inclusive national messaging and sets penalties for incitement to ethnic strife.</p><p>Reacting to the decree, the Kurdish administration in Syria’s north and northeast said the decree was “a first step, however it does not satisfy the aspirations and hopes of the Syrian people”.</p><p>It added that “rights are not protected by temporary decrees, but… through permanent constitutions that express the will of the people and all components” of a society.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Neither has heard from family or friends in Iran since the <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/iran-in-limbo-whats-next-for-country-under-internet-blackout\">internet was shut down</a> on January 8 during nationwide antigovernment protests.</p><p>Both came to the UK separately: Maya, a graduate student from near the capital, Tehran, six years ago and Daniel, a support worker from Sine in northwestern Iran, three years back. Both have family still in Iran.</p><p>Maya has yet to hear from her elderly parents on the outskirts of Karasht near Tehran. How Daniel’s father, who is sick with cancer, is coping remains unknown.</p><p>There is still no confirmed death toll for the latest round of unrest to have engulfed Iran since the national currency, the rial, crashed on December 28, leading traders of Tehran’s bazaar to take to the streets to voice their anger in a protest that spread across the country and evolved into a serious challenge to the government.</p><p>Speaking on Saturday, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/irans-khamenei-says-us-israel-links-behind-thousands-killed-in-protests\">acknowledged</a> that “several thousand” people had been killed in the unrest, which he accused the United States and Israel of fuelling. The government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/irans-pezeshkian-pledges-economic-overhaul-amid-spiralling-protests\">has recognised</a> the protesters’ hardships, pledging to address mounting economic grievances, but also said the demonstrations that saw government buildings attacked were later hijacked by “terrorists” and elements trained and armed by outside powers.</p><p>“I have a lot of stress,” Daniel said, his measured voice showing some degree of the tension that he and Maya have been living through. Before the communications shutdown, Daniel, who at university had been detained for his pro-democracy activism, learned that a number of his friends had been arrested.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Both Maya and Daniel lived through previous bouts of unrest but believe the demonstrations of recent weeks may mark a sea change in Iran’s direction. “I believe it’s not like before … because the economy’s collapsed,” Maya said.</p><p>She went on to describe those she calls the “losers” of Iranian society – the people, she said, “who can’t provide a meal for their family. They are tired, you know, fed up of being ashamed in front of their own family, to not be able to provide for them. And if they don’t die in the street, they will die from starving maybe the next year or next six months.”</p><p>The inflation rate in Iran is among the highest in the world. Even before the recent collapse of the rial, inflation was about 40 percent as the cost of chronic economic mismanagement and years of crippling Western sanctions conspired to hollow out what was left of Iran’s economy.</p><p>Maya spoke of those she used to pass in the metro on her way into Tehran, hawking whatever they could to feed themselves and their families. She recalled one older lady, shaking in humiliation at where she had found herself before overhearing her daughter reassure her. “And I realised that was the first time that lady, that middle-aged lady with a teenage girl, has had to do that, and she was ashamed,” Maya said.</p><p>Both speak to friends and family members in the United States and Canada. Daniel has one friend in Erbil, the capital of northern Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region, who has been able to talk to people in Iran for a few minutes every morning.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>They have both heard unverified rumours, including militias patrolling the streets of Iran’s towns and authorities charging family members $3,000 – the price, they allege, of a bullet – before allowing them to recover relatives’ bodies.</p><p>They have also heard of the the desire of <a href=\"/features/2026/1/12/who-is-reza-pahlavi-the-exiled-prince-urging-iranians-to-seize\">Reza Pahlavi</a> – the son of Iran’s last shah who was toppled by the Islamic revolution of 1979 – to return to Iran before dismissing the royal claimant as simply past rubbish that the country had already thrown away.</p><p>“Day and night are connected for us,” Maya said, describing how time loses all meaning in the absence of news from home.</p><p>Mornings no longer feel like the start of a new day so much as the continuation of the past night, she said. “It’s a continuous morning because you’re waiting for your parents, or you’re waiting for news because I don’t know what will happen,” she added.</p><p>Maya described the uncertainty as a permanent presence, like a looming deadline, that refuses to shift despite the temporary distractions of friends or socialising. “You might have the best ever meal, but you don’t enjoy it fully because in the back of your head, you’re worried about things.”</p><p>Daniel leaned forward, his voice breaking, “I stop everything, you know. … Every time I am on the phone and try to ring to Iran, and I try. … Life is up to me, and my job is going very, very badly. … Every time I’m unconscious that, yeah, when I sleep, I have a very, very bad dream, and yeah, everything is very bad.”</p><p>Neither Maya nor Daniel knows how things will pan out. Even if the government falls, the economic conditions would remain desperate. There are also too many factions, both domestic and international, interested in gaining power.</p><p>Current events are like a fever, Maya said.</p><p>“When you have a high fever, [you] can’t function, so revolution is like a fever which burns even after revolution. It’s going to burn everything together and only … the more powerful one or more brutal one will survive.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the United States military and the subsequent threats by Washington to intervene in Iran during its recent upheaval have generated a tide of enthusiasm in hawkish pro-Ukraine circles in the West. If Moscow’s allies are weakened, then Russia also gets weaker, the simplistic logic goes.</p><p>Although he criticised US interventionism in the past, US President Donald Trump is newly infected with the regime change fever once spread by his Democratic predecessors.</p><p>What it reminds one of most is the export of revolution – a short-lived policy of Soviet Russia spearheaded by the father of the Red Army, Leon Trotsky. It resulted in several pro-Bolshevik governments emerging across Europe – in Hungary, Bavaria and Latvia. None of them lasted long.</p><p>One of the Bolsheviks’ lesser-known revolutionary projects was the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic, which existed in 1920-21 in Iran’s Gilan province on the Caspian Sea. The idea was to try to spread the proletarian revolution all the way to India, but eventually the Red Army had to retreat, and its local allies were quickly overthrown.</p><p>Fast-forward a century, and Iran again finds itself as a destination for revolutionary export, only now with American and Israeli hawks behind the attempt to foment something along the lines of Ukraine’s Maidan. Iran’s theocratic regime is hardly palatable, and resistance to it is organic, but the constant threat of US and Israeli intervention appears to be its strongest pillar and the source of immunity against domestic unrest. Iranians know better than to risk having their country transformed into another Syria or Libya.</p><p>Iran’s entire 20th-century history is that of constant resistance to subjugation by outside powers, including Russia or the USSR. Iran was also the place where Soviet and Western interests often converged – as in the 1953 coup d’etat against Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, in their shared opposition to the Iranian revolution of 1979 and in their support for the Iraqi side in the Iran-Iraq War.</p><p>It is only in the later years of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule that Tehran and Moscow formed a tentative alliance, which grew much tighter when Iran helped Russia with crucial drone technology at the beginning of the Russian all-out invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>There is an important similarity in the historical trajectories of Iran, Russia, as well as China. These are three of the very few long-existing states that Western powers tried but failed to colonise at various stages in history. The authoritarian instincts in all three could be fairly explained by the constant need to mobilise against the Western threat.</p><p>But Russia’s role in this triad is the most ambiguous, given that – despite its conflict with the West – it was also one of those European powers which tried to colonise chunks of both Iran and China.</p><p>That explains Moscow’s extremely Europe-centric attitude to Iran’s current predicament. Putin’s government is single-mindedly focused on one project – winning the war in Ukraine, which it sees as a proxy conflict with the West. Russian military expeditions in the Middle East and Africa are only important for Putin insofar as they help to stretch the West’s resources, creating additional leverage and trade-offs for the Kremlin. Russia’s situational alliances with regimes in Iran, Venezuela and North Korea fall into the same category.</p><p>Regime ideologues in Moscow like to repeat the apocryphal phrase attributed to Tsar Aleksandr III: “Russia has only two allies – the army and the navy”. In this worldview, Russia’s allies and client regimes are little more than expendable chess pieces in the nuclear superpowers’ global game.</p><p>All of Putin’s military adventures outside the former Soviet space began after the start of the war in Ukraine in 2014 and as a reaction to Western support of the Ukrainian authorities, which he sees as a puppet government installed through a “coup”, as he describes the Maidan revolution.</p><p>Russia intervened in Syria as well as in Libya and went on to expand its zone of influence in Central and Western Africa, mostly at the expense of the French.</p><p>Did it help Russia to set up a global neo-empire? No, a few initial successes were often followed by setbacks, most prominently when the regime of Moscow’s Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, fell in 2024. But a global empire has never been the point. The point is that Putin is very close to ending the war in Ukraine on his terms, and his efforts in other regions helped to bring about what most Russians will see as an outright victory in a conflict with the West’s mighty war machine.</p><p>Russia’s brutally inhumane air strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure are gradually rendering large population centres, like Kyiv, uninhabitable in midwinter. Ukraine’s European allies appear powerless to change that predicament.</p><p>But while Putin is entirely focused on a single chessboard, Trump is performing a simultaneous match with a plethora of players, bizarrely including the US’s traditional European NATO allies.</p><p>The Trump administration’s obsession with regime change in Iran, Venezuela, and especially in Greenland does not undermine Putin – it is a godsend. The situation, when the US is bogged down in several absurd and dangerous geopolitical projects while attempting to play a quasi-neutral peacemaker in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, is ideal for Moscow.</p><p>But despite outward absurdity, there might be a logic behind what Trump is doing. It is about the natural human tendency to choose an easier path. A painstaking chess match with Putin, which Trump indeed did not start himself, is infinitely harder and fraught with embarrassing defeat. Venezuela and Iran are both easier targets.</p><p>But as the latest events show, even in these countries, the goal of proper regime change might appear a bit too arduous for the current US leader to follow through. All Trump cares about is an instant, cost-free PR boost, so he needs the softest of targets to achieve that. Maduro proved to be one, but who could be next?</p><p>Iran and Greenland interventions are risky, Cuba not so much. But – as far as regime change efforts go – there is also one leader who annoys Trump to no end, who can be removed without military intervention and who stands in the way of the US president’s goal of being seen as the world’s greatest peacekeeper: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>It is no wonder that on Wednesday, Trump abruptly returned to undermining Ukraine by saying its leader, rather than Putin, was the main obstacle to peace.</p><p>Mired in a huge corruption scandal, deadlocked politically and militarily, Zelenskyy comes across as the softest of potential targets, the very opposite of his archrival Putin. It is not hard to predict how the US president’s political instincts might play out.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
