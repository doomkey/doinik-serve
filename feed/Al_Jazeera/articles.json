having influence “far beyond Gaza”, fuelling concerns that Trump is trying to sideline the UN and enshrine his own “imperial agenda”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"annexation-fears\">Annexation fears</h2><p>Many Arab and Muslim-majority countries had requested that the Security Council address the Gaza “ceasefire” and Israel’s new illegal settlement project, ahead of Trump’s Board of Peace meeting.</p><p>Asked what he hoped to see from the back-to-back events, <span>Palestine’s Ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, said he expected “the international community to stop Israel and end their illegal effort against annexation, whether in Washington or in New York”.</span></p><p>Earlier this week, Mansour was joined by dozens of other UN diplomats as he read out a statement <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/over-80-un-member-states-condemn-israels-de-facto-annexation-of-west-bank\">on behalf of 80 countries</a> that called on Israel to reverse its latest actions in the West Bank and outlined their “strong opposition to any form of annexation”.</p><p>On February 8, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/palestine-urges-powerful-partner-to-stop-west-bank-annexation-by-israel\">Israel’s security cabinet greenlit measures</a> making it easier for Israelis to seize Palestinian land and directly buy property in the West Bank, while expanding Israel’s military control in the area, home to roughly 3.4 million Palestinians.</p><p>Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the measures amount to “de facto sovereignty” that will block the establishment of a Palestinian state while Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowed to also “encourage” Palestinian “emigration” out of the territory.</p><p>The push comes as Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have faced a wave of intensified attacks by Israeli troops and settlers in the shadow of the country’s genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>On Wednesday, four Palestinians were wounded – two of them with live ammunition – during a settler attack in the village of Mukhmas, near occupied East Jerusalem.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-gaza-plan\">Trump’s Gaza plan</h2><p>Several diplomats addressed the Security Council on Wednesday, stressing the need for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinians in Gaza, who continue to face Israeli attacks.</p><p>More than 600 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since a US-brokered “ceasefire” came into effect in the enclave in October, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.</p><p>Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, said during the Security Council meeting that the “ceasefire” has reduced hostilities while “the scope and the scale of humanitarian assistance” is growing daily.</p><p>While aspects of the Trump-backed plan for Gaza have moved forward, including Hamas releasing all the Israeli captives it was holding and increased amounts of humanitarian supplies getting into the territory, the UN says the level of aid remains insufficient.</p><p>A new technocratic committee also has been appointed to administer Gaza’s daily affairs.</p><p>But the most challenging steps lie ahead, including the deployment of an international security force, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/hamas-rejects-netanyahu-aides-60-day-ultimatum-for-group-to-disarm\">the disarmament of Hamas</a>, and rebuilding Gaza.</p><p>Trump said this week that the “Board of Peace” members have pledged $5bn toward Gaza reconstruction and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilisation and police forces for the territory.</p><p>Indonesia’s military says up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission.</p><p>“We call on all parties to support the Board of Peace,” Waltz said at the UN meeting on Wednesday. “Tomorrow, the Board of Peace will host its inaugural meeting in Washington, with a focus on bringing peace and security.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Mourners spread flower petals, lit candles and somberly clapped in solidarity with the families.</p><p>At a ceremony on Tuesday to honour 19-year-old Sepehr Shokri, his father told gathered crowds, “Don’t talk of death, but of life and happiness”, as he said his son had laid down his life for his country.</p><p>The father had captured hearts last month after releasing an excruciating 12-minute video of himself searching for his son among numerous bodies of killed protesters laid out in the open at the courtyards and warehouses of the Kahrizak medical examiner’s office, on the outskirts of Tehran.</p><p>Some of the commemoration events took place in smaller cities and villages, like Abdanan in the western province of Ilam, where thousands had participated in protests last month. Multiple videos circulating online on Tuesday showed mourners running away in panic from the cemetery of the city as the sound of bullets rang out.</p><p>In the village of Chenar in the Asadabad area of western Hamadan province, people could be seen chanting “death to the dictator” as they marched to pay respects to a father and his 13-year-old son who were gunned down during the protests. Local reports said security forces deployed to the area with armoured vehicles, but officials have not commented.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threats-to-students-and-teachers\">‘Threats to students and teachers’</h2><p>The Coordinating Council of Iranian Teachers’ Trade Associations, a non-governmental body, said on Wednesday that its call for school strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday had been backed by large numbers of teachers and students.</p><p>It said schools in the cities and towns of Shahr-e Rey, Baharestan, Pakdasht, Varamin, and Eslamshahr near Tehran were effectively shut due to the absence of students on Wednesday, while high school students in the town of Andisheh did not attend classes as a way to honour fellow students killed in the protests.</p><p>“These strikes occurred despite threats to students and teachers against striking from school principals, who themselves have been pressured by the Ministry of Education,” the group said, adding that at least 230 children and teenagers were killed last month.</p><p>Iran’s Justice Minister Amin Hossein Rahimi confirmed to state media on Wednesday that some of the children and teenagers arrested during the protests remain incarcerated. He said “many” minors have been released without saying how many were arrested.</p><p>Ehsan Azimirad, the spokesman of the parliament’s education commission, said that 17 percent of the participants in the nationwide protests were teenagers, many of them students.</p><p>“I have even heard that in some schools, an entire class had participated in the riots,” he said, adding that in some provinces, up to 45 percent of protesters were under 20 years old. Officials have previously said that most of the protesters across the country were in their 20s.</p><p>This comes amid widespread reports, also disseminated by some local media outlets, of a heavy presence of security forces near or inside schools in the aftermath of the protests. Some families have been concerned about sending their children to school.</p><p>Universities and dormitories have also become focus points for security forces, with reports indicating that some people have had their phones searched while others have been summoned for questioning. University students have also been among the large number of people arrested from their homes since last month. Iranian authorities have not released overall arrest figures.</p><p>A number of Tehran University students peacefully demonstrated on campus on Wednesday to observe the 40th day since the height of the protest killings.</p><p>Last month, members of the Basij – an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) paramilitary force – hung up a banner reading “Either death or Khamenei” at one of the entrances of the university, in support of 86-year-old Supreme Leader <a href=\"/news/2026/2/17/irans-khamenei-maintains-tough-rhetoric-with-us-despite-nuclear-talks\">Ali Khamenei</a>. Iranian authorities have also displayed a vehicle burned by “rioters” near another entrance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"clashing-versions-of-events\">Clashing versions of events</h2><p>The Iranian government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">claims 3,117 people were killed</a> during the unrest, saying that “terrorists” and “rioters” were behind the violence, and were armed and funded by the United States and Israel, which organised an ultimately failed “coup”.</p><p>A list of victims published by the government last month said 690 of those killed were “terrorists”, with others either civilians or security forces. But it did not say who was classified under which category, or exactly where, how, when or by whom they were killed.</p><p>The United Nations and international human rights organisations have blamed state forces for the widespread use of lethal force against protesters, and have called for the release of those arrested, including doctors and nurses who tried to help wounded protesters. The UN Human Rights Council adopted a censure resolution against Iran’s establishment last month.</p><p>The US-based <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">Human Rights Activists News Agency</a> says it has verified 7,015 deaths during the unrest and is investigating more than 11,700 other cases. Mai Sato, the UN special rapporteur on Iran, said last month that more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed as information remains limited amid access constraints.</p><p>The Iranian government on Tuesday and Wednesday held its own version of the 40th day ceremonies at the Grand Mosalla of Tehran, a huge mosque in the downtown part of the capital. A number of officials, including government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani, were in attendance.</p><p>On Tuesday, Iran’s supreme leader outlined his classification of the thousands killed during the nationwide protests, and divided them into several groups.</p><p>According to Khamenei, the first group are security forces, recognised as “the greatest of martyrs”.</p><p>The second were “passerby” civilians, he said. “Wherever this bullet [that killed them] may have come from, this incident occurred in the enemy’s sedition, and they are martyrs”.</p><p>“The third group are those who were deceived, who acted naively, who were inexperienced and went along with the seditionists,” Khamenei said, adding, “We ask forgiveness for them; they made mistakes”.</p><p>Outside of those three groups, however, were “corrupt individuals, seditionists, and coup plotters”, who Khamenei said “were consigned to hell”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The rise of Donald Trump and the surge of political rhetoric have created new dangers for the city’s new arrivals, who must navigate unprecedented challenges just to survive and find stability in a place they once believed would offer refuge.</p><p>Within this tense environment, communities of immigrants themselves are strained. New arrivals escaping conflicts in other countries now encounter friction with members of their own communities, as fear, suspicion, and competition over limited resources create divisions where solidarity once prevailed. Kelly, a woman fleeing Colombia, arrives in New York and confronts both a labyrinthine bureaucracy and the harsh realities of a city that has changed. Randall, a native-born son of immigrants, represents a contrasting vision: aligned with conservative politics, he sees New York’s evolving demographic as a challenge, embodying the tension between established residents and the newcomers.</p><p>Amid these struggles, Howard, Nuala, and Evelyn dedicate themselves to preserving the spaces that keep the city alive and accessible to everyone. Through community initiatives, mutual aid, and grassroots organising, they work to sustain what makes New York a true sanctuary, even as political and social pressures threaten to fragment the city.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 18 Feb 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">18 Feb 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

Havana has used its medical missions worldwide as a tool for international diplomacy.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>So why are some countries withdrawing from the programme that helps the host countries?</p><h2 id=\"why-is-guatemala-phasing-out-cuban-doctors\">Why is Guatemala phasing out Cuban doctors?</h2><p>Guatemala’s health ministry said in a statement<strong> </strong>that it would begin a “gradual termination” over this year.</p><p>“The phased withdrawal of the Cuban Medical Brigade stems from an analysis of the mission’s completion of its cycles,” the statement, originally in Spanish, said on February 13.</p><p>The statement added that the Cuban medical mission was meant to support Guatemala through the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, which devastated parts of Central America, overwhelmed local hospitals and left rural communities with almost no access to medical care.</p><p>“The Ministry of Health is developing a phased strategic replacement plan that includes hiring national personnel, strengthening incentives for hard-to-reach positions, strategic redistribution of human resources, and specialized technical support,” the statement said.</p><p>The Cuban mission in Guatemala comprises 412 medical workers, including 333 doctors.</p><p>The Central American country’s decision comes amid growing pressure from the United States, which wants to stop Cuban doctors from serving abroad.</p><p>The move aims to starve Cuba of much-needed revenue as a major share of the incomes earned by doctors goes to government coffers. Cuba has been facing severe power, food and medical shortages amid an oil blockade imposed by the Trump administration since January.</p><p>Guatemala is just one country which benefits from Cuban medical missions.</p><p>Over the past decades, Cuba has sent medical missions around the world, from Latin America to Africa and beyond. It began sending these missions shortly after the 1959 Cuban revolution brought Fidel Castro to power.</p><p>Castro’s communist government reversed many of the pro-business policies of Fulgencio Batista, the dictator backed by the US. The revolution ruptured ties between the two countries, with the US spy agency CIA trying several times unsuccessfully to topple Castro’s government.</p><p>Guatemala has moved closer to the US since the election of <a href=\"/news/2024/1/15/guatemalas-arevalo-becomes-president-on-anticorruption-plank-amid-chaos\">Bernardo Arevalo </a>as the president in January 2024. He has cooperated with US President Donald Trump’s administration. Last year, Guatemala <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/guatemala-agrees-to-increase-number-of-us-deportation-flights-it-accepts\">agreed to ramp up</a> the number of deportation flights it receives from the US. The US has deported thousands of immigrants without following due process to third countries such as Guatemala and El Salvador, which are headed by pro-Trump leaders.</p><p>In November 2018, shortly after Brazil elected Jair Bolsonaro as president, Cuba announced its withdrawal from the country’s Cuba “Mais Medicos” (More Doctors) programme. Bolsonaro, who is known as Brazil’s Trump, had criticised the medical mission, deeming it “slave labour”. Bolsonaro is serving a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/brazils-supreme-court-orders-jair-bolsonaro-to-begin-prison-sentence\">27-year prison sentence</a> after he was convicted in September 2025 of plotting to stage a coup in order to retain power after his defeat in the 2022 presidential election.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-us-targeting-cuba-s-global-medical-missions\">Why is the US targeting Cuba’s global medical missions?</h2><p>The US has deemed Cuba’s foreign medical missions a form of “forced labour” and human trafficking, without any evidence, and has a goal of restricting the Cuban government’s access to its largest source of foreign income.</p><p>US efforts to curb Cuba’s medical missions are not new. Just last year, Washington imposed visa restrictions aimed at discouraging foreign governments from entering into medical cooperation agreements with Cuba.</p><p>In February last year, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US would restrict visas targeting “forced labor linked to the Cuban labor export program”.</p><p>“This expanded policy applies to current or former Cuban government officials, and other individuals, including foreign government officials, who are believed to be responsible for, or involved in, the Cuban labor export program, particularly Cuba’s overseas medical missions,” a statement on the US State Department’s website said.</p><p>Rubio, who is of Cuban origin, has been a vocal critic of Havana, and has pushed US policies in Latin America, including the military operation to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio/\">abduct</a> Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3. Under Trump, Washington has pushed its focus on Latin America as part of its Western Hemisphere pivot, which seeks to restore Washington’s preeminence in the region.</p><p>Since Maduro’s abduction, the US focus has turned towards Cuba. Senior US officials, particularly Rubio, hinted that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-abduction-shows-influence-limits-of-us-secretary-of-state-rubio/\">Havana could be the next target</a> of Washington’s pressure campaign.</p><p>The US, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/trump-says-no-more-venezuelan-oil-or-money-to-go-to-cuba-and-demands-deal\">in effect, cut off Venezuelan oil</a> shipments to Cuba as part of a new oil blockade. Havana has faced sweeping US sanctions for decades, and Cuba has since 2000 increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez.</p><p>The blockade has caused a fuel shortage and, in turn, <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/8/from-blackouts-to-food-shortages-how-us-blockade-is-crippling-life-in-cuba\">a severe energy crisis in Cuba</a>. President Miguel Diaz-Canel has imposed harsh emergency restrictions as a response.</p><p>This has renewed US pressure on countries to phase out Cuban medical missions.</p><h2 id=\"how-many-cuban-doctors-are-on-missions-abroad\">How many Cuban doctors are on missions abroad?</h2><p>More than 24,000 Cuban doctors are working in 56 countries worldwide. This includes Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Mexico; Africa, including Angola, Mozambique, Algeria; and the Middle East, including Qatar.</p><p>There have been occasional deployments in other countries. For instance, Italy received Cuban doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic to help overwhelmed hospitals in some of its hardest-hit regions.</p><p>Cuban doctors are crucial for Caribbean countries. They fill a significant gap in medical care amid a lack of trained medical professionals.</p><h2><span>Have countries resisted US pressure in the past?</span></h2><p>Caribbean countries <a href=\"/news/2025/3/15/why-are-caribbean-leaders-fighting-trump-to-keep-cuban-doctors\">hit back</a> in March 2025 against the US threats to restrict visas. “We could not get through the pandemic without the Cuban nurses and the Cuban doctors,” Barbados’s Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a speech to the parliament.</p><p>“Out of the blue now, we have been called human traffickers because we hire technical people who we pay top dollar,” Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Keith Rowley said back then, adding that he was prepared to lose his US visa.</p><p data-start=\"4903\" data-end=\"5051\">“If the Cubans are not there, we may not be able to run the service,” Saint Vincent and the Grenadines then-Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said. “I will prefer to lose my visa than to have 60 poor and working people die.”</p><p>In August 2025, the US announced that it was revoking the visas of Brazilian, African and Caribbean officials over their ties to Cuba’s programme that sends doctors abroad.</p><p>It named Brazilian Ministry of Health officials, Mozart Julio Tabosa Sales and Alberto Kleiman, who had their visas revoked for working on Brazil’s Mais Medicos, or “More Doctors” programme, which was created in 2013.</p><p>Some countries are now finding ways around the pressure from Washington. For instance, this month Guyana announced that it would start paying doctors directly, rather than through the Cuban government.</p></div></div></body></html>"
