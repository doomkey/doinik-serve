They also omitted some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal DOJ memos on charging decisions.</p><p>Meanwhile, a 119-page document titled “Grand Jury-NY”, likely from one of the federal sex trafficking investigations that led to the charges against Epstein in 2019, was entirely blacked out.</p><p>One of Epstein’s victims, Marina Lacerda, reacted angrily to the large number of redactions and unreleased documents.</p><p>“All of us are infuriated by this,” she told the news outlet MS NOW on Saturday. “It’s another slap in the face. We expected way more.”</p><p>Lacerda, who said Epstein abused her when she was 14 years of age, was a crucial witness in the 2019 investigation that led to the filing of sex trafficking charges against the late financier.</p><p>Epstein killed himself in jail that year shortly after his arrest.</p><p>Lacerda told The New York Times in a separate interview that she felt let down.</p><p>“So many of the photos are irrelevant,” she said.</p><p>Another survivor, Jess Michaels, told the news outlet CNN that she spent hours searching through the released files for her victim’s statement and records of her call to an FBI tipline, but found neither.</p><p>“I can’t find any of those,” she said. “Is this the best that the government can do? Even an act of Congress isn’t getting us justice.”</p><p>Marijke Chartouni, who said she was abused by Epstein when she was 20 years old, decried a lack of openness.</p><p>“If everything is redacted, where is the transparency?” she said on Friday in an interview with The New York Times.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Some lawmakers also expressed frustration.</p><p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who helped spearhead the legislative push, accused the White House of failing to comply “with both the spirit and the letter of the law that Donald Trump signed just 30 days ago” in a social media post on Friday.</p><p>That law required the government’s case file to be posted publicly by Friday, constrained only by legal and victim privacy concerns.</p><p>Meanwhile, the unexplained 16 missing files led to speculation online about what was taken down and why the public was not notified, compounding longstanding intrigue about Epstein and the powerful figures who surrounded him.</p><p>Democrats on the House Oversight Committee pointed to the missing image featuring a Trump photo in a post on X, writing: “What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.”</p><p>“If they’re taking this down, just imagine how much more they’re trying to hide,” said senior Democrat Chuck Schumer. “This could be one of the biggest cover-ups in American history.”</p><p>The Trump administration, however, denied that it was not being forthcoming with the released materials. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said during a TV interview with ABC that there was no attempt “to hold anything back” to protect Trump.</p><p>The DOJ also issued a statement on X late on Saturday. “Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information,” it said.</p><p>Separately, celebrities who appeared in photos made available as part of Friday’s release include former President Bill Clinton, late news anchor Walter Cronkite, singers Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, British entrepreneur Richard Branson and the ⁠former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson.</p><p>There were also photos of Epstein with actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey.</p><p>Many of the photos were undated and provided without context, and none of those figures has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.</p><p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor also appears in one photo lying across the laps of several women. The former duke of York, who was stripped of his royal title over his ties to Epstein, has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Notably missing were references to Trump himself, despite his frequent inclusion in previous releases of Epstein-related documents. Trump and Epstein were friends in the 1990s and early 2000s and had a falling out before Epstein’s first conviction in 2008.</p><p>Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing and has denied knowing about Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>Amid the outcry, the DOJ sought to draw attention to Clinton, with two agency spokespeople posting on social media images that they said showed him with Epstein victims.</p><p>Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said in a statement that the White House was attempting to “shield themselves” from scrutiny by focusing on the former president.</p><p>“They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they ‌want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton,” he wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

record 125-million-pound ($166m) move from Newcastle on transfer deadline day.</p><p>Yet in keeping with Isak’s troubled start to life with the Premier League champions, the 26-year-old was unable to fully enjoy his goal as he was forced to come off after being injured by Micky van de Ven’s failed attempt to stop him scoring.</p><p>Hugo Ekitike’s fifth goal in his last four appearances put Liverpool in command before Richarlison’s reply set up a tense finale that came to a head with Tottenham defender Romero’s dismissal in stoppage time.</p><p>Arne Slot’s side are up to fifth place in the Premier League after extending their unbeaten run to six games in all competitions, further distancing them from the miserable run of nine defeats in 12 that plunged them into crisis.</p><p>While Liverpool steadied the ship with a third successive win, Isak’s injury could not have come at a worse time following Mohamed Salah’s departure for the Africa Cup of Nations.</p><p>Slot claimed on Friday that Liverpool had “moved on” from the Salah controversy after his explosive interview two weeks ago in which he said he had been thrown under the bus by the club and no longer had a relationship with the Reds boss.</p><p>He was dropped from the squad for a Champions League game at Inter Milan but returned as a substitute in last week’s victory over Brighton.</p><p>The 33-year-old is now on international duty with Egypt for several weeks, making Isak’s injury an especially painful blow if he is ruled out for a prolonged period.</p><p>Slot will spend Christmas sweating on Isak’s fitness, and Tottenham manager Thomas Frank’s festive period will be even more fraught.</p><p>Last weekend’s limp 3-0 loss at Nottingham Forest sparked debate over the Dane’s future in his rocky first season in charge.</p><p>Tottenham are languishing in 13th place after winning just one of their last eight league games.</p><p>Ange Postecoglou was sacked despite winning the Europa League last season to end Tottenham’s 17-year trophy drought, and Frank is in danger of suffering the same fate as the Australian if results do not improve soon.</p><p>Simons left Tottenham with a mountain to climb in the 33rd minute when he raked his studs down Van Dijk’s calf with an ugly challenge from behind.</p><p>Initially booked for the foul, Simons was shown the red card after a VAR review.</p><p>Slot sent on Isak for the injured Conor Bradley at half-time and it took the Sweden striker just 11 minutes to make an impact as Liverpool broke the deadlock with a goal 300 million pounds ($399m) in the making.</p><p>All three of Liverpool’s costly close-season signings combined as Ekitike picked out Florian Wirtz, and he slipped a perfectly weighted pass to Isak, who timed his run to drill a clinical finish past Guglielmo Vicario from 10 yards.</p><p>Ekitike doubled Liverpool’s lead in the 66th minute.</p><p>Jeremie Frimpong’s deflected cross looped into the six-yard box, where Ekitike out-jumped Romero to thump his header into the top corner.</p><p>Richarlison reduced the deficit with a close-range blast after Reds captain van Dijk miscued a clearance in the 83rd minute.</p><p>But, with the visitors wobbling, Romero’s second booking for kicking Ibrahima Konate let Liverpool off the hook.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They join approximately 200,000 others who had already sought refuge in the country.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Regional officials say more than 400 civilians have been killed in recent violence in the city.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The seizure of Uvira, located directly across Lake Tanganyika from Burundi’s largest city, Bujumbura, has raised fears of broader regional spillover. The city was the last major foothold in South Kivu for the DRC government and the Wazalendo, which are DRC-allied militias, after M23 captured the provincial capital, Bukavu, in February.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Rwanda has consistently denied backing M23, despite assessments by UN experts and the international community. In a February interview with CNN, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said he did not know whether his country’s troops were in the DRC, despite being commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Rwanda implicitly acknowledged a presence in eastern DRC in February 2024, when it rejected a US call to withdraw troops and surface-to-air missile systems, saying it had adjusted its posture for self-defence.</p><p>Rwanda maintains that its security concerns are driven by the presence of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a militia composed largely of Hutus who fled to the DRC after participating in the 1994 genocide that killed approximately 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p><p>Kigali views the group as an existential threat and accuses the DRC government of supporting it.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The broader conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, where more than 100 armed groups operate, has displaced more than seven million people, creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Khan’s family was not allowed access to the court, it said.</p><p>“A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair. It is, in fact, a military Trial.”</p><p>But Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said that Khan and his wife were convicted and sentenced after the court examined solid evidence. He said the couple indulged in corruption, and “the court delivered a fair decision”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Khan, 73, served as Pakistan’s prime minister from 2018 until April 2022, when he was removed in a no-confidence vote. He was imprisoned in August 2023 on various charges of corruption and revealing state secrets, all of which he has denied and claimed to be politically motivated.</p><p>He has been acquitted of some charges.</p><p>Khan’s main political rival, Shehbaz Sharif, is the country’s current prime minister. Since his ouster, Khan has repeatedly alleged that his removal was the result of a United States-backed conspiracy, carried out with the support of Pakistan’s powerful military. The claims have been denied by Washington, the military and his opponents.</p><p>An internationally famous cricket player in the heyday of his sporting career, Khan <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/imran-khans-supporters-rally-in-pakistan-on-two-years-of-imprisonment\">remains popular in Pakistan</a>, with his imprisonment leading to protests throughout the last two years.</p><p>Aleema Khanum, the former prime minister’s sister, told Al Jazeera that the latest case against Khan was fabricated and was part of a broader effort to keep him out of power by his political opponents, whom she accused of “stealing the people’s mandate”.</p><p>“The whole country knows he’s an honest man,” she said. “He is isolated; he is being tortured through solitary confinement – him and his wife. This is the situation for two and a quarter months.”</p><p>“You think Imran is going to spend 10 years in jail for a necklace being underpriced. Seriously? That’s 17 years of conviction?” Khanum asked. “Of course, it is a fraudulent set-up. This is a collapsed judicial system.”</p><p>But Tania Bazai, a high court advocate in Pakistan, disputed the claim that the prosecution’s case is thin on evidence or politically motivated.</p><p>“The legal counsel of Imran Khan hasn’t provided a single document that can be in his defence. So saying this was a weak case on the prosecution’s side, no, it was a very strong case on the prosecution’s side,” said Bazai.</p><p>“One of the main witnesses was the principal secretary of Imran Khan, and the military secretary of Imran Khan at that time, who came with solid evidence. This entire case is based on documented evidence,” she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Displaced families have sought refuge in the shells of partially fallen-down buildings despite the risk of collapse, with 13 buildings caving in across Gaza last week.</p><p>The winter weather and Israel’s blocking of vital aid and mobile homes for shelter have proven deadly for children and babies.</p><p>Late in the evening of December 13, Eman Abu al-Khair, a 34-year-old displaced Palestinian living in al-Mawasi west of Khan Younis, found her sleeping baby Mohammed “cold as ice”, his hands and feet frozen and “his face stiff and yellowish”, she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She and her husband couldn’t find transportation to get to hospital, and intense rain made it impossible to make the trek by foot.</p><p>After rushing Mohammed by animal-drawn cart to Red Crescent Hospital in Khan Younis at dawn, he was admitted to intensive care with a blue face and convulsions. He died two days later.</p><p>“I can still hear his tiny cries in my ears,” Eman said. “I sleep and drift off, unable to believe that his crying and waking me at night will never happen again.”</p><p>Mohammed “had no medical problems,” she added. “His tiny body simply couldn’t withstand the extreme cold inside the tents.”</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Since the October 10 ceasefire took effect, Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/winter-storms-worsen-gaza-humanitarian-crisis-as-un-says-aid-still-blocked\">continued to block the entry of humanitarian aid</a> into the Gaza Strip despite calls from a host of United Nations agencies, international organisations and other states for it to stop.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">The UN has said that Israel has prevented tents and blankets from reaching Palestinians, even as an estimated 55,000 families have seen their belongings and shelters damaged or destroyed in the storm.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Dozens of child-friendly spaces have also been damaged, affecting 30,000 children, according to the UN.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">Natasha Hall, a senior advocate for Refugees International, told Al Jazeera that aid is entering Gaza in a “trickle” in part due to its opaque list of “controlled dual-use items” that has included nappies, bandages, tools, tents and other essentials.</p><p dir=\"LTR\">“It’s unclear how those could be used as weapons or any kind of dual use,” Hall said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

year</a>.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Aghil Keshavarz was put to death on Saturday morning after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction on

27-year-old architecture student was arrested earlier this year in the northwestern city of Urmia after military patrols caught him photographing an army headquarters building.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The execution adds to a growing number of people put to death for espionage since the June conflict, with at least 10 <a

most important spies for Israel in Iran”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In October, Tehran toughened legislation against alleged spies for Israel and the US, making espionage automatically punishable by death and asset confiscation.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">According to the Mizan report, Keshavarz was accused of conducting more than 200 missions for Israeli intelligence services across Tehran, Isfahan, Urmia and Shahroud.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The missions

nuclear scientists, as well as civilians in residential areas, for which Iran retaliated with barrages of missiles and drones. The US also carried out extensive strikes, on Israel’s behalf, on Iranian nuclear sites during the conflict. According to Amnesty International, Israeli attacks on Iran killed at least 1,100 people.</p><p>In response to the June war and protests in recent years over the state of the economy and women’s rights, as well as calls for regime change, Iran has sentenced more people to death.</p></div></div></body></html>"
