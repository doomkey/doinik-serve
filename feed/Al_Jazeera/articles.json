            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On July 10, Thanos Plevris, the Greek minister for migration, announced new legislation that would effectively deny asylum to those who reach the Greek shores following a treacherous journey through the Mediterranean from Africa. “Greece will not tolerate the uncontrolled entry of thousands of irregular migrants from North Africa,” Plevris said during an interview. Reactions against Greece’s new legislation were immediate: Human rights organisations described it as illegal and called for its withdrawal. The Plenary of Greek Bar Associations emphasised that denying the right to asylum is a violation of international and EU legislation.</p><p>On the same day, but on the other side of the continent, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined a “ground-breaking deal” with France, which he said would target small boats and smuggling gangs and send “a clear message that these life-threatening journeys are pointless”. The UK-France deal has been criticised by all sides of the political spectrum. Organisations such as Doctors Without Borders called it “reckless”, “ill-fated” and “dangerous”, while the Migrants’ Rights Network emphasised that the new agreement will not prevent people from trying to cross to the UK.</p><p>Greece and the UK’s new plans to curb migration are set to fail, and the reason is simple: migration deterrence does not work.</p><p>A decade ago, in the summer of 2015, the European Union faced a crisis it did not expect and for which it had not prepared. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS), Syria’s brutal civil war and instability in Afghanistan led thousands of people to seek safety and security in the European Union. The “long summer of migration” marked the beginning of the so-called refugee crisis in the EU. Yet the EU did not have a clear plan; the European Agenda for Migration, which had been agreed upon in May 2015, had not yet been tested.</p><p>Today, the narrative of a crisis continues to shape migration policy across Europe. In Greece, it has served to justify restrictive deterrence measures since 2015, making new crackdowns unsurprising. For Greece’s neoliberal government, migration is a blemish on the narrative of its economic success. In the UK, it is used to fuel far-right sentiment. In both cases, migration policy is crafted not only to deter arrivals but also to satisfy domestic political demands.</p><p>Neither migration plan should be viewed in isolation from the rise of the far right across the continent. The adoption of far-right rhetoric surrounding the illegalisation of migrants has been used in both countries to justify inhumane policies. The justification for Greece’s new policy centres on a questionable narrative of an “invasion” from Africa – a trope the Migration Minister has invoked repeatedly. For Greece’s minister of migration, the Greek border, and by extension the European border, must be reinforced so that only “real refugees” can enjoy the benefits of European protection. For the British government, small boats have the power to “undermine [the country’s] border security”, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, and should therefore be prevented from entering.</p><p>Although each migration plan is the product of different political processes in Greece, the EU and the UK, their design and the narratives used to justify them are similar in several ways. They both conceptualise the migrant and the border in similar terms. For each state, the migrant is seen as a threat to the border, and the border is viewed as in need of protection. The migrant who reaches each country’s shores is criminalised, and the term “illegal migrant” has gained prominence among government officials. The border, in turn, is seen as a security mechanism that must be defended against those trying to reach it. Together, these approaches create an “us versus them” narrative of division. Migrants are reduced to their migratory identity; they are seen as a mass, and their individual experiences no longer matter. As such, migrants become worthy or unworthy of international protection, desirable or undesirable to the Western nation-state. Only those perceived as “real refugees” are deemed deserving of international protection. The “undesirables” are turned into nothing and are expelled by the border. As a result, a narrative of fear is promoted and a crisis is manufactured.</p><p>Although the events at the European border became known as a “refugee crisis”, they were, in fact, a crisis of the European border.</p><p>During the border crisis, the European border regime emerged stronger than ever before, and the EU’s neoliberal imagination of a borderless world collapsed. Walls were erected throughout the continent, new border technologies were deployed to deter and expel the “undesirables”, and pushbacks, human rights violations and violence were normalised. Death continues to loom over the European continent’s borders. The UK-France deal may have been described as ground-breaking, but the EU-Turkiye deal in 2016 paved the way for such “swap” policies. These agreements fail. The EU-Turkiye deal may have reduced the number of people crossing the Aegean Sea in the short term; however, it did not stop them. Instead, it shifted migratory routes, opened new ones, and made migratory journeys more complicated and dangerous.</p><p>The reason for their failure is simple: human movement cannot be controlled. Arguably, it can be prevented or delayed, but it cannot be stopped.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>These policies are rooted in racism and are deliberately designed to create division. Their main aim is to separate human beings and determine who is worthy of living in safety and who should be expelled from Western territory. They should not be viewed in isolation from the EU’s and the UK’s colonial and capitalist pasts. At the same time, the spectacle of the border is fully staged: It produces the illusion of control over a manufactured crisis that cannot truly be controlled. In reality, the essence of migration deterrence is not to succeed but to convince citizens that it is necessary.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The group attacked civilians in both countries from its base in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with researchers noting that its tactics became more violent over the years.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Jamil Mukulu, the group’s founder, was arrested in Tanzania in 2015, leading to internal disruption. Under a new leader, 48-year-old Musa Seka Baluku, the ADF declared allegiance to the global armed network, ISIL, in 2019.</p><p>Although ISIL no longer has the ability to hold ground or control a caliphate in the Middle East, experts say it has devolved its structure, focusing on regional affiliates, particularly in parts of Africa. A UN Experts Group report found that ISIL central financially supports the ADF, whose force of about 1,000 to 1,500 members is usually armed with small arms, mortars, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). The ADF reportedly controls camps with internal security services, clinics, prisons and schools for children.</p><p>“The group intends to advance extreme Islamic ideology,” Nico Minde, an analyst with the Institute for Security Studies, told Al Jazeera. “It is [also] believed that it is seeking revenge for military offensives by the Congolese army, Ugandan forces and MONUSCO peacekeepers,” he said.</p><p>It is unclear how many civilians have died in ADF attacks, but experts agree it likely runs into the hundreds, if not thousands, in its nearly 30 years of existence. The United States, which designated ADF/IS-CA a “terror” organisation in 2021, describes it as “one of the most lethal terrorist groups in Africa” based on the number of civilian deaths linked to its members.</p><p>An earlier reprisal assault by the ADF between July 8 and 9 saw 41 civilians killed in Irumu territory, Ituri, according to MONUSCO. In May, it was North Kivu’s Babili sector that was attacked, with 18 civilians killed. The group also claimed a separate attack in January on the town of Lubero in North Kivu, with 41 people killed and 11 kidnapped.</p><h2 id=\"multiple-armed-groups-in-the-eastern-drc\">Multiple armed groups in the eastern DRC</h2><p>The ADF is one of a multitude of armed groups – some experts say about 100 – operating in the mineral-rich but poorly governed eastern DRC. The region is one of the most complex conflict zones in the world.</p><p>ADF’s attacks in July came as the DRC was enjoying some relief from the M23 rebels, arguably the strongest of all the armed groups. M23, the UN says, is <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/un-experts-cast-blame-on-rwanda-and-uganda-what-are-they-doing-in-drc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backed by Rwanda</a>. Aiming to take power in Kinshasa, it launched lightning offensives in January and seized vast swaths of territory in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu. Thousands died and hundreds of thousands were displaced in the six-month war. In July, the US and Qatar brokered DRC peace efforts with Rwanda and M23, respectively, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/19/dr-congo-m23-rebels-sign-deal-in-qatar-to-end-fighting-in-eastern-congo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leading to a ceasefire.</a></p><p>Minde of the ISS said the ADF is likely taking advantage of the military resources diverted to confront M23, resulting in more frequent attacks since January.</p><p>“Strategically, this allows them to freely move in Ituri and North Kivu while attention remains fixed on the M23 conflict,” he said. The group’s focus on rural communities, Minde added, was to foster fear and dependence, facilitate control over land and illicit resources, and to find more recruits.</p><p>Combined, M23 and the ADF have wrought the most havoc in eastern DRC, with some research suggesting that there might have been a non-aggression pact between the two at some point. The Armed Conflict and Location Event Data Project (ACLED) noted in a June report that M23 and ADF/IS-CA action between January and March 2025 killed 1,600 people, making that quarter the deadliest since 2002, when the DRC was in the throes of a civil war.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3750867\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3750867\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3750867\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/getty_683f17da44-1748965338.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"M23 rebels guard a unit of surrendering Congolese military troops.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3750867\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">M23 rebels guard a unit of surrendering Congolese military soldiers who were to be recruited into the rebel group in Bukavu in February [File: Hugh Kinsella Cunningham/Getty]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"uganda-s-stakes-in-the-adf-battle\">Uganda’s stakes in the ADF battle</h2><p>Uganda poses the main challenge to the ADF.

Kampala’s decision to deploy followed a series of bomb attacks in Uganda that year. Since 2021, two leaders of separate ADF factions – Salim Mohammed and Benjamin Kisokeranio – have been captured.</p><p>However, there are concerns that <a href=\"/news/2025/6/17/are-commercial-interests-driving-ugandas-military-operations-in-dr-congo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uganda is expanding</a> into territory not affected by ADF attacks. Due to the DRC’s civil war history, which saw countries neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda take over Congolese territory and reportedly steal minerals, foreign armies on DRC soil remain a testy subject in Kinshasa.</p><p>In June, the Ugandan army spokesperson, Felix Kulayigye, defended his government’s stance while speaking to Al Jazeera, admitting that the country needed to protect commercial interests in the DRC. Uganda exports goods like palm oil, cement, and refined petroleum to the DRC, and is Kinshasa’s biggest trading partner in the sub-region.</p><p>“Who is consuming Uganda’s products?” Kulayigye asked Al Jazeera at the time. “Can commerce take place where there is instability? If we have commercial interests in eastern DRC, are those protectable or not?”</p><p>Already, Uganda has a negative reputation in the DRC. Kampala allegedly backed the M23 armed group by allowing the group passage into Congolese territory, according to a UN expert group report. President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda’s Paul Kagame are longtime allies. Back in 2022, the Ugandan army chief General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also President Museveni’s son, openly expressed support for M23 on the social media site, X.</p><p>The ADF’s increasing attacks could lead to rising insecurity in the fragile DRC, and across the sub-region, Minde of ISS said.</p><p>“[ADF] might want to take advantage of the pacifist moment following the US and Qatar-brokered peace deal, to remind the world of its existence,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>From the Baltic states to the Black Sea, Central and Eastern European (CEE) governments remain anxious about their security in the face of Russian aggression. Despite NATO’s enduring pledge to Article 5, many officials in countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Romania continue to express concern over a potential US shift in focus towards Asia‑Pacific and the Middle East, creating fears of weakening American vigilance in Europe. This anxiety has heightened in light of Russia’s steady military rebuilding and escalating hybrid threats targeting critical infrastructure across the region.</p><p>To be clear, President Trump has long criticised NATO members for failing to hit defence spending targets and has even suggested the US might withhold protection from countries that do not meet the 2 percent of GDP target. In response, the June 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague marked a turning point: all member states agreed to raise combined defence and related spending to 5 percent of GDP by 2035, including 3.5 percent for core military capabilities and 1.5 percent for broader security measures such as logistics, cyber resilience and support for Ukraine, which was viewed as an “ironclad” commitment to NATO Article 5 and a pledge of continued backing for Ukraine.</p><p>For all the robust signalling, however, the agreement’s gradual timeline – 2035, with a review in 2029 – and its flexible accounting, where spending on Ukraine aid, infrastructure upgrades and cyber projects all count, leave the Eastern flank states uneasy because timely implementation will be essential for credibly deterring Russia.</p><p>Moreover, tensions over US-EU burden sharing remain, as shown recently when, during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump announced that the US would send Patriot air defence systems to Europe “for Ukraine” but insisted that European allies foot the bill by donating the interceptor missiles themselves.</p><p>The breakdown in diplomatic decorum with European partners has been on display for a while, notably during the March Signalgate incident in which Trump’s Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called Europe “pathetic” and suggested European NATO states were “freeloading”, and during the infamous February diplomatic debacle when Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was publicly humiliated during a joint White House news conference with Trump.</p><p>Yet despite the turbulence, CEE capitals cannot afford the luxury of disengagement from the second Trump administration. Indeed, the volatility reinforces the need for these states to remain actively engaged and push for better outcomes. This is for several reasons.</p><p>First, the US military presence has long served as the cornerstone of regional deterrence against Russian expansionism. Even as Washington’s commitment to European security appears uncertain, CEE’s security architecture has been fundamentally anchored in US guarantees since the end of the Cold War. The traumatic historical experience of Western abandonment during critical 20th-century junctures, such as the 1938 Munich Agreement, when Czechoslovakia was handed over to Nazi Germany by Western powers, has left a deep-seated awareness that diplomatic decoupling from Washington often correlates with heightened vulnerability along NATO’s eastern flank. This is why Poland and the Baltic states (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) have for years hosted US troops and air defence systems, alongside NATO battlegroups. NATO’s eastern flank countries have routinely cautioned that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, “they are next.”</p><p>This concern is particularly acute in light of the Trump administration’s active push to broker a flash ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine, reportedly involving territorial concessions to Moscow. President Trump has made clear he wants to be remembered as “a peacemaker and unifier”, a theme he emphasised again in his second inaugural address. His advisers have floated frameworks that would freeze the conflict along current front lines, potentially recognise Russian control over Crimea and parts of Donbas, and block Ukraine’s NATO aspirations. But Ukrainians are not seeking peace at any price, nor should the Europeans. Any deal that cedes Ukrainian territory or is seen as legitimising Russian aggression risks emboldening the Kremlin, weakening NATO’s credibility and undermining Europe’s long-term security architecture.</p><p>Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale incursion, the Kremlin has repeatedly tested NATO’s Article 5 resolve through various provocations along the eastern flank, including airspace violations and missile incidents. For example, in February 2024, Estonia was subjected to electronic warfare from Russian territory that disrupted GPS signals across its eastern border regions, affecting both civilian infrastructure and military communications systems. One month later, a Russian cruise missile entered Polish airspace for 39 seconds before returning to Ukrainian territory. Moreover, in August 2023, Russian fighter jets conducted aggressive intercepts of NATO surveillance aircraft over the Baltic Sea, coming within dangerous proximity and executing unpredictable manoeuvres that risked mid-air collisions.</p><p>Such a status quo can deteriorate quickly should Putin’s aggression, under a Trump-brokered deal, enable Russia to carve out a piece of Ukraine or achieve troop disengagement from Eastern Europe. Russia may also continue its military buildup after the war stops, buying time for later aggressions and compounding the challenge for CEE and Europe.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Against this backdrop, CEE leaders would do well to pursue a dual-track strategy, despite the volatility of current US foreign policy.</p><p>First, the region’s engineering workforce and industrial might have an outsized role to play in rearming Europe in the face of US disengagement and Europe’s stepped-up defence pledges, particularly in partnership with Germany. In Germany, this shift of actively repurposing idle civilian manufacturing facilities into military production hubs is already firmly under way. Its defence firms have been actively converting shuttered or underperforming automotive facilities, such as those in Berlin and Neuss, and rail plants in Gorlitz, to produce Leopard tanks, Puma IFVs and artillery systems, into hybrid military production hubs. This industrial push is enabled by Germany’s domestic reforms, notably Berlin approving a sweeping defence procurement law that simplifies contracting, raises tender thresholds and fast-tracks construction for military infrastructure.</p><p>Such deliberate reallocating of resources from beleaguered civilian industries toward military industrial output holds clear implications for allied production networks in CEE. In addition, CEE countries have been ramping up their own heavy manufacturing capacity, with Poland and Slovakia stepping up joint production of artillery and armoured vehicles, and Czechia’s Czechoslovak Group surging to the forefront of Europe’s munitions supply chain, with a 4-billion-euro ($4.6bn) revenue spike and an 11-billion-euro ($12.7bn) order book anchored in Ukraine bound exports.</p><p>The CEE region, with its faltering car manufacturing competitiveness now worsened by Trump car tariffs, needs to latch onto this opportunity to tackle both its security and economic imperatives. In doing so, it can benefit from the 800-billion-euro ($921.8bn) defence mobilisation plan, coupled with its proposal for 150 billion euros ($172.8bn) in EU-backed loans, approved in Brussels on March 6.</p><p>Second, hedging against US security disengagement through the combination of strategic industrial repositioning and European solidarity must be complemented by persistent efforts to secure better outcomes through diplomatic channels with Washington.</p><p>This remains necessary even as ideological alignment frays, because transactional partnerships can still deliver meaningful security benefits. To that end, the region can leverage some of its unique strategic assets, including Poland’s substantial arms purchases from US manufacturers, Romania’s critical Black Sea security infrastructure and the Baltic states’ sophisticated cybersecurity capabilities, with an administration that prizes transactional diplomacy.</p><p>The path forward requires setting aside both illusions and grievances at a time when security guarantees must be earned rather than assumed. In this emerging reality, Eastern European nations can meaningfully partake in rearming Europe while demonstrating their value as partners, as they navigate the shifting fault lines of post-American Europe.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Since the start of the war on Gaza, the US has provided Israel with billions of dollars in military aid, as well as diplomatic backing at the United Nations.</p><p>Both President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have been uncompromising backers of the Israeli assault on Gaza, which human rights groups have described <a href=\"/news/2024/12/5/amnesty-international-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza\">as a genocide</a>.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Israel has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza, imposed a suffocating siege and flattened most of the enclave, reducing its buildings to rubble.

The United Kingdom and the European Union, however, maintain sanctions against Levi.</p><p>Hathaleen, a resident of Masafer Yatta, had helped create the Academy Award-winning documentary No Other Land, which captured the effects of Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law, and attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank.</p><p>In Tuesday’s news briefing, Bruce appeared to suggest that Hathaleen’s shooting happened in the “war zone” of Gaza, before being corrected.</p><p>Still, she maintained that the Trump administration sought to address violence wherever it occurred.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“It’s the same argument.

Such settlements are in violation of international law and widely seen as a means of displacing Palestinians and seizing their lands.</p><p>But Israeli settlements have continued to spread rapidly in recent years and are seen as a major roadblock to future peace agreements with Palestinian leaders.</p><p>Upon taking office earlier this year, Trump revoked many Biden-era executive orders, including the sanctions against Israeli settlers. The move reportedly came amid pressure from the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>During his term, Biden had been criticised for continuing to funnel aid to Israel amid its war in Gaza, but his administration showed a willingness to take a harder line when it came to settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>“The situation in the West Bank — in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction — has reached intolerable levels,” Biden’s executive order, dated February 2024, said.</p><p>It added that Israeli actions in the West Bank constitute “a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region”.</p><p>Violence on the part of Israeli settlers and military forces has surged since Israel’s war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, with at least <a href=\"/news/2025/7/1/israel-has-killed-1000-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-since-october-7-2023\">1,000 Palestinians</a> killed in the West Bank.</p><p>Rights observers say violent settlers are often protected by the military as they attack Palestinians.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Those killed have included US citizens, most recently <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/the-love-he-gave-family-vows-to-keep-sayfollah-musallets-memory-alive\">Sayfollah Musallet</a>, a 20-year-old resident of Florida, beaten to death while visiting his family’s land in the village of Sinjil.</p><p>In a rare statement condemning Musallet’s killing, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, a vocal supporter of Israeli settlements, called on the country to “aggressively investigate” what he called a “criminal and terrorist act”.</p><p>To date, no one has been arrested or charged in the killing.</p><p>In a statement following Monday’s attack, J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel lobbying group, called on US lawmakers to support legislation that would codify the Biden-era sanctions against settlers like Levi.</p><p>The group explained that its members had “deep, personal ties” to Hathaleen, and said they were “heartbroken and horrified” by his killing.</p><p>In a post on the social media platform X on Tuesday, Congress member Delia Ramirez called Hathaleen’s killing “a painful reminder that our government and Israel continue to enable and condone violence in the West Bank”.</p><p>“We must reinstate the sanctions on West Bank settlers perpetrating violence and hold accountable all those whose extreme and escalating violence continues to rob us of our neighbors — including Trump and Netanyahu,” she wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The corresponding tariff rate for the rest of the world is 3.5 percent, compared with 4.1 percent in April, the IMF said.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has upended global trade by imposing <a href=\"/news/2025/4/5/trumps-10-percent-tariff-takes-effect-raising-fears-of-global-trade-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a universal tariff of 10 percent</a> on nearly all countries since April and threatening even higher duties to kick in on Friday. Far higher tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the US and China were put on hold until August 12, with talks in Stockholm this week potentially leading to a further extension.</p><p>The US has also announced steep duties ranging from 25 percent to <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/4/donald-trumps-50-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs-take-effect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50 percent</a> on automobiles, steel and other metals, with higher duties soon to be announced on pharmaceuticals, lumber, and semiconductor chips.</p><p>Such future tariff increases are not reflected in the IMF numbers, and could raise effective tariff rates further, creating bottlenecks and amplifying the effect of higher tariffs, the IMF said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"shifting-tariffs\">Shifting tariffs</h2><p>Gourinchas said the IMF was evaluating new 15-percent tariff deals reached by the US with the <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/27/us-and-eu-agree-on-trade-tariffs-to-avert-economic-standoff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European Union</a> and Japan over the past week, which came too late to factor into the July forecast, but said the tariff rates were similar to the 17.3 percent rate underlying the IMF’s forecast.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Right now, we are not seeing a major change compared to the effective tariff rate that the US is imposing on other countries,” he said, adding it was not yet clear if these agreements would last.</p><p>“We’ll have to see whether these deals are sticking, whether they’re unravelled, whether they’re followed by other changes in trade policy,” he said.</p><p>Staff simulations showed that global growth in 2025 would be roughly 0.2 percentage point lower if the maximum tariff rates announced in April and July were implemented, the IMF said.</p><p>The IMF said the global economy was proving resilient for now, but uncertainty remained high and current economic activity suggested “distortions from trade, rather than underlying robustness”.</p><p>Gourinchas said the 2025 outlook had been helped by what he called “a tremendous amount” of front-loading as businesses tried to get ahead of the tariffs, but he warned that the stockpiling boost would not last.</p><p>“That is going to fade away,” he said, adding, “That’s going to be a drag on economic activity in the second half of the year and into 2026. There is going to be pay back for that front loading, and that’s one of the risks we face.”</p><p>Tariffs were expected to remain high, he said, pointing to signs that US consumer prices were starting to edge higher.</p><p>“The underlying tariff is much higher than it was back in January, February. If that stays … that will weigh on growth going forward, contributing to a really lackluster global performance.”</p><p>One unusual factor has been a depreciation of the dollar, not seen during previous trade tensions, Gourinchas said, noting that the lower dollar was adding to the tariff shock for other countries, while also helping ease financial conditions.</p><p>US growth was expected to reach 1.9 percent in 2025, up 0.1 percentage point from April’s outlook, edging up to 2 percent in 2026. A new US tax cut and spending law was expected to increase the US fiscal deficit by 1.5 percentage points, with tariff revenues offsetting that by about half, the IMF said.</p><p>It lifted its forecast for the euro area by 0.2 percentage point to 1 percent in 2025, and left the 2026 forecast unchanged at 1.2 percent. The IMF said the upward revision reflected a historically large surge in Irish pharmaceutical exports to the US; without it, the revision would have been half as big.</p><p>China’s outlook got a bigger upgrade of 0.8 percentage point, reflecting stronger-than-expected activity in the first half of the year, and the significant reduction in US-China tariffs after Washington and Beijing declared a temporary truce.</p><p>The IMF increased its forecast for Chinese growth in 2026 by 0.2 percentage point to 4.2 percent.</p><p>Overall, growth is expected to reach 4.1 percent in emerging markets and developing economies in 2025, edging lower to 4 percent in 2026, it said.</p><p>The IMF revised its forecast for world trade up by 0.9 percentage point to 2.6 percent, but cut its forecast for 2026 by 0.6 percentage point to 1.9 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"
