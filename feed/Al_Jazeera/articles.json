This is the amount of money the US government owes to its lenders, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>“In a world where almost every financial activity incorporates credit risk – that of a state, a central bank, an intermediary – gold remains the only asset without a counterparty. It makes no promises, pays no interest, and is not dependent on political decisions. It simply exists. And that is precisely why it provides security,” Diego Franzin, head of portfolio strategies at Plenisfer Investments, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“In a system based on record levels of public and private debt, this characteristic takes on unprecedented value.”</p><p>Another factor driving demand has been purchases by central banks in emerging economies, including China and Turkiye, which have been seeking to lessen their dependence on the dollar.</p><p>On Thursday, gold hit a record peak of almost $5,595 an ounce, while silver hit an all-time high of nearly $122.</p><p>The blistering rally came to a sudden halt on Friday when gold and silver prices plunged about 10 percent and 28 percent, respectively.</p><p>The slide continued into Monday, with gold ending the day about 4.5 percent lower and silver down about 6.5 percent.</p><p>On Tuesday, the precious metals clawed back some of their gains, with gold up about 3.5 percent and silver up about 4.5 percent as of 06:00 GMT.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-gold-and-silver-prices-crash\">Why did gold and silver prices crash?</h2><p>Analysts are not united on the cause of the fall.</p><p>Some have suggested that Trump was responsible for bringing prices back to earth just as he was for driving the surge.</p><p>On Friday, Trump announced he would nominate Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve, a pick that was widely seen as relatively conventional compared with other names on his shortlist.</p><p>The choice of Warsh, a former member of the Fed’s seven-member board of governors, was welcomed by investors who had feared that Trump would tap an ally who would slash interest rates without paying heed to inflation risks. The US president has been pressuring the outgoing Fed chief, Jerome Powell, to cut rates.</p><p>Trump on Friday also expressed hopes that he would reach a deal with Iran, following weeks of threats of military action against the Middle Eastern country.</p><p>Some analysis has suggested that the prospect of more stable economic conditions and a rising dollar led investors to sell off precious metals.</p><p>Many analysts, however, have cast doubt on that explanation, arguing that the drop simply reflected the fact that prices had become overvalued.</p><p>“The more likely explanation is that precious metals prices collapsed simply because they had already gone parabolic in the previous week. Once profit-taking started, it just snowballed,” Mark Matthews, head of research for Asia at Bank Julius Baer, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-to-gold-and-silver-prices-next\">What will happen to gold and silver prices next?</h2><p>Predicting the market is famously a fool’s errand, but some analysts see precious metals continuing to gain over the medium-to-long term.</p><p>In a note on Sunday, JP Morgan analysts said they expected gold to reach $6,300 an ounce – a 30 percent gain from current prices – by the end of 2026.</p><p>“Gold remains a dynamic, multi-faceted portfolio hedge and investor demand has continued to come in stronger than our previous expectations,” Gregory Shearer, Jason Hunter, Ali Ibrahim and Ananyashree Gupta said in the note.</p><p>Bank Julius Baer’s Matthews said investors are likely to pick up their purchases of gold and silver once they believe the market has stabilised.</p><p>“Their two fundamental drivers remain unchanged – namely, the US dollar should continue to depreciate, and central banks should increase their holdings in gold,” Matthews said.</p><p>“The price ascent probably won’t be as steep as it was before, but that’s a good thing.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Then as the RSF, it adopted heavy artillery and eventually drones, allowing it to strike from a distance.</p><p>On April 15, 2023, longstanding tensions between Army Chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF Leader Mohamed Hamdan \"Hemedti\" Dagalo escalated into war. This conflict was primarily ignited by disagreements regarding the integration of the RSF into the regular army, a key step in the planned transition to civilian rule.</p><p>The introduction of drones shifted the balance of power away from the Sudanese army, which used to control the skies with its fighter jets.</p><h2 id=\"what-drones-do-the-saf-and-rsf-have\">What drones do the SAF and RSF have?</h2><p>Sudan’s flat terrain and limited cover make it well-suited to drone strikes and surveillance, according to the open-source intelligence initiative Critical Threats.</p><p>Since the war began, the SAF and RSF have used drones spanning from short-range systems to those with a range of up to 4,000km (2,485 miles), capable of reaching any target in Sudan.</p><p>Sudan measures 1,250km (775 miles) from north to south and 1,390km (865 miles) from east to west, distances easily covered by RSF drones like the Chinese-made Wing Loong II and Turkish Bayraktar TB2.</p><h2 id=\"saf-drones\">SAF drones</h2><p>The Sudanese army’s drones, which it uses for reconnaissance and precision attacks, mainly come from Iran, like the Mohajer-6 combat UAV, which was supplied to the SAF in late 2023.</p><p>It can carry a multispectral surveillance payload and/or up to two precision-guided munitions with a maximum ordnance of up to 40kg (88lb) and a range up to 2,000km (1,243 miles)</p><p>The video below, verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad verification team, shows RSF drones targeting the Sidon fuel depot in Atbara, River Nile State, in April, according to Sudan War Updates.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"rsf-drones\">RSF drones</h2><p>Even though the RSF has no air force, according to a <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2024/07/new-weapons-fuelling-the-sudan-conflict/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2024 Amnesty International report</a>, its allies have armed it with UAVs, including Chinese- and Serbian-manufactured drones.</p><p>One example, according to the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/long-range-kamikaze-drones-seen-near-rsf-base-could-worsen-conflict-sudan-2025-09-12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters news agency</a>, is Chinese kamikaze drones reportedly used in high-profile RSF strikes with a range of up to 2,000km (1,243 miles) and a payload of 40kg (88lb). This long reach allows the RSF to strike as far east as Port Sudan from areas it holds in the west.</p><p>It is also deploying heavier FH-95 drones with a 200kg to 250kg (440lb to 550lb) payload that can drop laser-guided bombs. FH-95s have been spotted by humanitarian organisations at Nyala Airport in South Darfur in late 2024.</p><p>A video published in April appears to document an RSF suicide drone that crashed into a home in al-Dabba in Northern State. The post said it killed six people from one family, including two children.</p><p></p><p>Another weapon in the RSF fleet is a Serbian-made Yugoimport VTOL drone. The four-rotor drone can take off vertically and has reportedly been modified to carry mortar shells as dumb bombs.</p><p>What makes these drones significant is their ability to deliver artillery-level firepower without needing personnel on the ground.</p><p>The TikTok video below appears to show RSF fighters using a quadcopter drone, often made from commercial components and capable of carrying mortar shells.</p><p>These makeshift, lightweight drones with 120mm mortar rounds explode on impact, making them particularly indiscriminate.</p><p> </p><p>Andreas Kreig, associate professor at the School of Security at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera: “On RSF adaptations, yes, there is ingenuity, and it is exactly what you would expect from a decentralised force with external supply options.</p><p>“The RSF appears willing to weaponise commercial quadcopters, repurpose agricultural or logistics drones, and modify platforms beyond their original design.”</p><blockquote>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\tThe tactical logic is pragmatic: Drones are used to harass, distract and strike targets of symbolic or economic value, not necessarily to deliver consistently precise battlefield effects.” \t\t\t</p>\n<p class=\"quote-author\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">by</span> Andreas Kreig, associate professor at the School of Security, King’s College London\t\t\t</p>\n</blockquote><p>“That kind of adaptation thrives in militia structures because approval chains are shorter and the appetite for improvisation is higher.

And how?</h2><p>Most drones in Sudan are smuggled in by a network of foreign backers via land, sea and air, bypassing official embargoes, as foreign states exploit the situation to their advantage.</p><p>The SAF is believed to have drone technology and military support from Egypt, Russia, Iran and Turkiye, using Eritrea as a transit hub to Port Sudan, according to Krieg and Critical Threats, a project established by the American Enterprise Institute to analyse national security threats globally.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/are-iranian-drones-turning-tide-sudans-civil-war-2024-04-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters</a>, the SAF has received Iranian drones and parts with Iranian Mohajer-6s reportedly arriving in late 2023 and 2024, often via cargo flights arriving in Port Sudan, which the army has not confirmed. Turkiye has provided Bayraktar drones via Egypt, according to Critical Threats.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/drones-over-sudan-foreign-powers-in-sudans-civil-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Critical Threats</a> and the <a href=\"https://static.rusi.org/pb-russia-red-sea-final-web-version.pdf\">Royal United Services Institute</a> defence think tank have found that several of the foreign actors supplying drones to the SAF, such as Iran and Russia, have done so in exchange for a regional presence. Iran reportedly hopes to secure a Red Sea naval base while Russia is said to have switched from supporting the RSF via the Kremlin-funded Wagner Group to supporting the SAF in 2024 in exchange for reinstating a 2017 agreement for a Red Sea naval base.<strong> </strong></p><p>The RSF, on the other hand, has reportedly received drone technology and military support from the UAE through various transit points, including eastern Chad, South Sudan, southeastern Libya, northeastern Somalia and the Central African Republic.</p><p>Sudan's UN ambassador, Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed, has repeatedly and publicly accused the UAE at the UN Security Council of arming the RSF. While Abu Dhabi denies these claims, open-source analysis has documented dozens of UAE-operated cargo flights flying into eastern Chad since April 2023. According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/uae-flights-flood-airstrip-un-says-supplies-weapons-sudan-rebels-2024-12-12/#:~:text=At%20least%2086%20flights%20from,corporate%20documents%20reviewed%20by%20Reuters.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters</a>, at least 86 UAE flights suspected of carrying weapons for the RSF landed at Chad’s Amdjarass airstrip.</p><p>“The UAE sits at the hub because it can combine procurement capacity, permissive commercial infrastructure, aviation connectivity and a dense layer of intermediaries that can move dual-use systems without a clear state signature,” Krieg said.</p><p>“From there, the spokes run through jurisdictions that offer cover, weak oversight or useful geography.”</p><p>Krieg said Amdjarass matters because of its proximity to Darfur and its mix of humanitarian and commercial traffic that provides cover.</p><p>According to Reuters, satellite images showed UAE-branded pallets being unloaded near RSF supply routes. From Chad, arms are trucked into Darfur or through areas controlled by eastern Libya military commander Khalifa Haftar. The RSF is also said to operate out of Somalia with Bosaso airport, located in Somalia’s semiautonomous Puntland region, being developed by the UAE. However, the UAE has denied this.</p><p>Eastern Libya is another route, drawing on Haftar-aligned networks already experienced in smuggling and convoy protection. Further afield, hubs like Bosaso and Entebbe, Uganda, are staging points where shipments can be broken down, redocumented and moved onwards in smaller consignments, “preserving plausible deniability”, according to Krieg.</p><p>“The drones themselves rarely need to travel as complete aircraft. The most resilient model is modular transport: airframes, engines, datalinks, optics, batteries, ground control components and munitions moving separately under commercial cover.</p><p>“When you add the commodity layer, especially gold, the network becomes self-financing. The same corridors that move drone parts can move bullion, cash and high-value goods back out [of Sudan],” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Then he paused. “But honestly, what matters more is a healthy job market and recruitment on merit.”</p><p>Rafi was among the wave of young people who joined the 2024 protests that began over a job reservation system many saw as unfair and later spiralled into a nationwide uprising that toppled then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government.</p><p>Now, Bangladesh is heading to an election on February 12.</p><p>With Hasina’s Awami League barred from the ballot, the race is expected to largely revolve around a Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led coalition and a bloc led by the Jamaat-e-Islami, which has courted liberal allies, including the uprising-born National Citizen Party.</p><p>Senior figures from both camps are crisscrossing the country, headlining rallies and stage programmes as campaigning enters its final stretch. From platforms to doorsteps to social media, candidates and party activists are tapping familiar anxieties: jobs, price relief, tax cuts, and an end to corruption and discrimination.</p><p>But analysts and voters say that while many of the promises go to the heart of people’s insecurities, the scale of what is being offered might be difficult for any government to realistically deliver at a time when Bangladesh is grappling with multiple economic challenges.</p><p>“Everyone is promising jobs and social security like it’s a switch they can turn on overnight,” Rafi said.</p><p>The promises land in an economy in which growth has slowed to about 4-5 percent in<a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/04/23/strong-economic-and-fiscal-reforms-will-help-bangladesh-sustain-growth-amid-global-uncertainty\"> recent years</a> – after expanding above 8 percent before the pandemic in 2019 – while food and overall inflation have remained in the high single digits for a prolonged period, squeezing people’s purchasing power and driving up the cost of living.</p><p>Private investment has remained largely stuck at roughly 22–23 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and the nation’s<a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/endpovertyinsouthasia/how-can-bangladesh-increase-domestic-revenues-for-development-?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> tax-to-GDP ratio</a> is still under 7 percent. This is compared with roughly 12 percent in India and 10 percent in Pakistan, and is far short of the roughly 15 percent many economists cite as a minimum for a state to sustainably fund basic services without chronic fiscal stress.</p><p>Hossain Zillur Rahman, an economist and the executive chairman of the Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC), a nonprofit think tank based in Dhaka, said the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus that took over after Hasina’s ouster brought “some measure of immediate stability to macro indicators”.</p><p>But the Yunus administration, he added, has been “extraordinarily inattentive to economic distress at [the] household level” and to “engaging with the business community to jumpstart the economy”.</p><p>“The economic reality at this moment is marked by persistent inflation, poverty reversals, employment emergencies, stagnant wages,” he said, adding that the government has “failed to generate business confidence, which is why the investment rate is at a standstill”.</p><p>Against that backdrop, he added, an election matters because it may end the uncertainty freezing decisions. “Bangladesh urgently needs a restart,” Rahman said. “[The] election opens the possibility of that, but it is unlikely to produce any dramatic improvements.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4284461\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4284461\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4284461\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2024-11-11T072252Z_41946265_RC2S2BADGWT2_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ECONOMY-1770085586.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People purchase groceries from a government-subsidised Open Market Sales (OMS) point in Dhaka, Bangladesh, November 11, 2024.

The parties are yet to release manifestos, but officials from both camps told Al Jazeera that policies unveiled at separate recent high-profile events in Dhaka, and now circulating throughout the campaign, will feature prominently.</p><p>The BNP’s flagship pledge is a “family card” issued in the name of a woman in each household. The party says it would initially cover 4 million households, providing either 2,000 to 2,500 Bangladeshi taka (about $16–$20) a month in cash, usable at designated stores, or an equivalent monthly basket of essentials such as rice, pulses, oil and salt.</p><p>Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, a BNP leader and former minister of commerce, said that if elected, the BNP plans to govern by investing in people, “in health, in education, and upskilling”, and by supporting “artisans, the weavers” and small industries with credit, as well as helping them access international markets, including by helping them with their branding.</p><p>Economists say the challenge lies in scale and delivery. Bangladesh currently spends about 1.16 trillion taka a year (roughly $9.5bn) – about 2 percent of GDP – on social protection across more than 130 programmes, such as old-age allowances and widow benefits.</p><p>The BNP’s family card pledge, if fulfilled nationwide, would cost roughly 1.2 trillion taka (about $9.8bn) a year, assuming 2,500 taka ($20) per card. Bangladesh’s current outlay on social sector protections would effectively need to double to make this work.</p><p>“You cannot ensure quality social security with just 2 percent of GDP,” Towfiqul Islam Khan, additional director (research) at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said.</p><p>For Rahman of the PPRC, social protection pledges amount to an “acid test” for the parties. “The key challenge here is not just extra budget”, he said, “but avoiding leakage and ensuring delivery to the right target groups”.</p><p>The BNP argues its answer lies in shrinking the bureaucracy and digitising services. Khasru described Bangladesh as “an over-regulated country” where layers of permissions raise the “cost of doing business”. Moving services online and eliminating physical contact with officials, he said, would reduce opportunities for corruption.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jamaat’s principal welfare pitch is a “smart social security card”, a unified system the party says would connect the National ID card, health access, taxation, and social safety services.</p><p>Mokarram Hossain, a Swansea University professor who helped coordinate Jamaat’s plan, said the party’s focus rests on “good governance, zero tolerance to corruption, zero tolerance to extortion, and efficiency gains”.</p><p>Hossain said Jamaat’s plan is not to “hand out token cash”, but to build a single system through which people can access services, something he argued would also reduce “leakage” in how benefits are delivered.</p><p>Khan of the CPD said that “if revenue collection improves, these long-term plans [of both coalitions] can be implemented… and they should be”.</p><p>But for the moment, he said, both the BNP and Jamaat have questions to answer.</p><p>“They need to clearly explain how the financing will be arranged, how long implementation will take, through what process it will be done, and how institutional capacity will be strengthened [to enable the execution of these policies],” Khan said.</p><p>Still, there is a reason why these promises, irrespective of how realistic they are, resonate with many voters, said Asif Shahan, a Dhaka University professor and senior research fellow at the BRAC Institute of Governance and Development, a social science research and academic institute in Dhaka.</p><p>“People don’t like complicated messages,” he said. “You have to give people a very simplified message.” This is why the idea of a “family card” and a “social security card” works better than detailed policy blueprints, he said.</p><p>But it is not that the everyday voter is not discerning, he said. Voters are watching to see whether a party will deliver benefits fairly to everyone, or “only give them to party loyalists”, he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4284467\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4284467\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4284467 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2021-07-06T100707Z_1919557652_RC2VEO9WVM1Y_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ECONOMY-EXPORTS-1770085654.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Garment workers come out of a factory during the lunch break as factories remain open despite a countrywide lockdown, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, July 6, 2021.

It has pledged to train 10 million youth within five years, saying it would establish a “youth tech lab” in every sub-district and set up district-level “job banks” to connect people to 5 million jobs within the same period.</p><p>It also promises to create 500,000 entrepreneurs, develop 1.5 million freelancers, and design “separate skills programmes for young people with lower formal education”.</p><p>But Jamaat has also offered unemployed graduates interest-free monthly loans of up to 10,000 taka (about $80) for up to two years.</p><p>Hossain, the Swansea University professor, stressed that the support would need to be repaid. “We are not ‘giving’ the money,” he said. “We are giving a loan, but interest-free.”</p><p>But economists say delivering the job creation both sides are promising would require sustained GDP growth of 8 to 10 percent and a considerable surge in domestic and foreign investment.</p><p>The PPRC’s Rahman said he was sceptical about interest-free loans as a fix. “Interest-free loans tend to be populist measures without much proven impact,” he said, arguing that “the solutions for unemployed graduates are their skilling and actual employment opportunities”.</p><p>Education has also become central to campaign promises.</p><p>BNP’s education proposals include a “one teacher, one tab” initiative, under which the party says it would provide tablet computers to primary and secondary teachers to support teaching and training. It also plans to expand multimedia classrooms, introduce compulsory vocational education at the secondary level, and strengthen technical and skills-based training alongside general education.</p><p>The party has further pledged to expand midday meals for students. Bangladesh currently runs a school feeding programme in parts of the primary and elementary school system, but coverage remains limited and uneven, and there is no nationwide scheme at the secondary level.</p><p>The BNP has also said it would expand sport, arts and cultural education, as well as introduce third-language learning – including Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and German, alongside Bengali and English – from the secondary stage, which party leaders argue would improve employability at home and abroad.</p><p>BNP leader Chowdhury said Bangladesh’s education system pushes too many students towards advanced degrees, which “creates more jobless people”, and that the BNP wants vocational schools “all around the country”, so more students move into skills tracks after high school. He pointed to China, where he said that “60 percent go to vocational education”, which helps young people find work “at home… [and] abroad”.</p><p>Jamaat’s education platform includes interest-free education loans of up to 10,000 taka (about $80) per month for 100,000 students selected on merit and need, annual support for 100 students a year to study at top global universities, and upgrading large colleges into full universities.</p><p>Hossain said Jamaat’s overseas-study pledge is limited. Students admitted to “fixed top universities… MIT, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge” would “get all the money”, while others would receive support for “the first two semesters” and repay the rest as an interest-free loan.</p><p>Rahman urged caution over student loan-style pledges. “The idea of student loans also needs to be thought through with care,” he said. “The burden of student loans hangs like a baleful cloud over the large swath of youth in the developed world.”</p><p>He argued that expanded scholarship schemes with strict targeting and compliance conditions could be a safer approach.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4284470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4284470\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4284470 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2023-07-19T042553Z_649109556_RC2262AI0GNR_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ECONOMY-1770085753.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tangled network cables are seen in front of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Limited building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, July 19, 2023.

It has also proposed reopening closed factories through public-private partnerships, with 10 percent ownership allocated to workers.</p><p>Rahman, the economist, said that “among the promises made by Jamaat, the one which has most merit is to freeze utility tariffs for the industrial sector for three years”.</p><p>The BNP’s pitch to business is less about a single pledge and more about a structural reset.</p><p>Chowdhury framed it as moving away from an “oligarchic economy” tied to businesses with political power and towards what he called a “democratisation of the economy”, with a level playing field for all firms.</p><p>In agriculture, the BNP has proposed a “farmer card” offering “subsidised fertiliser, seeds and pesticides, access to machinery, easier loans, crop insurance, fair-price sales and mobile access to market and weather information”.</p><p>Jamaat has promised interest-free loans for small and medium farmers.</p><p>But agriculture policy is already tied to a heavy subsidy bill. In the current fiscal year, the government allocated about 400 billion taka (roughly $3.2bn) for agriculture, fisheries, livestock and food security.</p><p>Economists caution that expanding support further will be difficult amid high inflation and revenue constraints. Rahman said both parties’ agriculture focus is welcome, but warned that “the same issues of leakage and mistargeting will be critical here, too”.</p><p>Health has also featured prominently.</p><p>The BNP has pledged to recruit 100,000 healthcare workers, 80 percent of them women, to deliver door-to-door primary care. The party is also promising free primary-care medicines and low-cost treatment for critical diseases through public-private partnerships.</p><p>Jamaat’s policies include free healthcare for citizens over 60 and children under five, building 64 specialised hospitals, one in each Bangladeshi district, and expanding maternal and child health support through a “first thousand days” programme, covering the period from the start of pregnancy through a child’s first two years.</p><p>For Rahman, the contest moving on is not only about big promises, but whether a new government can deliver without straining the economy.</p><p>He said this means breaking with the interim government’s “governing style”, one he argues has failed to “meaningfully engage with the business community” and curb the “institutionalised corruption” entrenched under Hasina’s government.</p><p>Rafi, the job seeker, put it more simply: Promises come easily, he said.</p><p>“But if the culture of extortions for business, and bribes for a job, doesn’t disappear”, he added, “then we’re back where we started”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

has said, as US President Donald Trump stepped up <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/29/if-cuba-falls-the-global-south-is-to-blame-too\">pressure on Havana</a>.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, Cuba’s deputy foreign minister, told the Reuters news agency on Monday that the US government was aware that Cuba was “ready to have a serious, meaningful and responsible dialogue”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">De Cossio’s statement represents the first hint from Havana that it is in contact with Washington, even if in a limited fashion, as tensions flared in recent weeks amid Trump’s threats against the Cuban government in the aftermath of the US military’s abduction of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro</a>, Cuba’s longstanding ally.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">“We have had exchange of messages, we have embassies, we have had communications, but we cannot say we have had a table of dialogue,” de Cossio said.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">In a separate interview with The Associated Press news agency, De Cossio said, “If we can have a dialogue, maybe that can lead to negotiation.”</p><p>The deputy minister also stressed that certain issues are off the table for Cuba, including the country’s constitution, economy, and its socialist system of government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Sunday, Trump indicated that the US had begun talks with “the highest people in Cuba”.</p><p>“I think we’re going to make a deal with Cuba,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p><p>Days earlier, Trump had referred to Cuba in an executive order as “an unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security, and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/trump-threatens-tariffs-on-countries-supplying-cuba-with-much-needed-oil\">warned other countries</a> he would impose more tariffs on them if they supplied oil to Cuba.</p><p>On Monday, Trump reverted to issuing threats to Havana, announcing at the White House that Mexico “is going to cease” sending oil to Cuba, a move that could starve the country of its energy needs.</p><p>Mexico, which has yet to comment on Trump’s latest statement, is the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/mexico-vows-solidarity-with-cuba-after-oil-shipment-cancellation-report\">largest supplier of oil</a> to Cuba.</p><p>Mexico had repeatedly said that it would not stop shipping oil to Cuba for humanitarian reasons, but also expressed concern that it could face reprisals from Trump over its policy.</p><p>In recent weeks, the US has moved to block all oil from reaching Cuba, including from Cuba’s ally Venezuela, pushing up prices for food and transportation and prompting severe fuel shortages and hours of blackouts, even in the capital, Havana.</p><p>Responding to Trump’s threat regarding oil supplies, Cuba’s De Cossio said that the move would eventually backfire.</p><p>“The US… is attempting to force every country in the world not to provide fuel to Cuba. Can that be sustained in the long run?” de Cossio said to Reuters.</p><p>The US has imposed decades of crushing sanctions on Cuba, but a crippling economic crisis on the island and stepped-up pressure from the Trump administration have recently brought the conflict to a head.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4284387\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4284387\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4284387 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260130__94LU6R9__v1__MidRes__CubaUsDiplomacyOilFuelShortage-1770081840.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Vehicles wait in line to refuel at a gas station in Havana on January 30, 2026.

It will combine $2bn of private capital with a $10bn loan from the US Export-Import Bank.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>It is the latest move by the White House to invest in rare-earth minerals needed in the production of key goods, including semiconductor chips, smartphones and electric car batteries.</p><p>The aim is to “ensure that American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage”, Trump said at the White House.</p><p>The move to develop a strategic stockpile is the latest in a slew of efforts by the Trump administration to take control of the means of production for critical rare-earth materials to limit reliance on other countries, particularly China, which has held up its exports to gain leverage in negotiations with Trump.</p><p>Here’s a look at some of the investments the US government has made in this space.</p><h2><strong>What are the investments?</strong></h2><p>In 2025, the Trump administration acquired equity stakes in seven companies by converting federal grants into ownership positions. Among the investments is a 10 percent stake in USA Rare Earth, which plans to build rare-earth element and magnet production facilities in the US.</p><p>The project is supported by $1.6bn in funding allocated under the CHIPS Act, legislation passed during the administration of former Democratic President Joe Biden, aimed at reducing dependence on China for semiconductor manufacturing.</p><p>USA Rare Earth announced the investment last week and expects commercial production to begin in 2028.</p><p>The US government also acquired a roughly 10 percent stake, valued at about $1.9bn, in <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/15/korea-zinc-plans-7-4bn-us-minerals-refinery-with-washingtons-backing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Korea Zinc</a> to help fund a $7.4bn smelter in Tennessee through a joint venture controlled by the US government and unnamed US-based strategic investors, who would then control about 10 percent of the South Korean firm.</p><p>The venture will operate a mining complex anchored by two mines and the only operational zinc smelter in the US. Construction is set to begin this year, with commercial operations expected to start in 2029.</p><p>In October, the government announced a $35.6m investment to acquire a 10 percent stake in Canadian-based Trilogy Metals to support the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (UKMP) in Alaska. The investment backs the development of critical minerals, including copper, zinc, gold, and silver, in Alaska’s mineral-rich northwest Ambler mining district.</p><p>Also in October, the US announced a 5 percent stake in <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/1/us-takes-a-stake-in-another-firm-this-time-a-large-lithium-mine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lithium Americas</a> as part of a joint venture with General Motors (GM) to fund operations at the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. The project will supply lithium for electric vehicles and has attracted significant interest from the Detroit-based automaker.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In August, the White House acquired an almost <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/28/intel-receives-5-7bn-as-trump-administration-buys-10-percent-stake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 percent stake in Intel</a>. The government’s investment in the semiconductor chip giant was an effort to help fund the construction and expansion of the company’s domestic manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>In July, the White House announced a 15 percent investment in MP Materials, which operates the only currently active rare-earth mine in the US, located in California. The largest federal stakeholder in the investment is the Department of War, then called the Department of Defense, which committed $400m.</p><p>The US is also reportedly exploring an 8 percent share in Critical Minerals for a stake in the Tranbreez rare-earths deposit in Greenland, underscoring Trump’s unsolicited attempts to acquire the Danish self-governed territory, the Reuters news agency reported.</p><p>Amid news of Trump’s stockpile plan, sector stocks are mixed. MP Materials and Intel are up 0.6 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Others finished out the day trending downwards. Lithium Americas is down 2.2 percent. Trilogy metals is down almost 2 percent, USA Rare Earth is down by 1.3 percent, and Korean Zinc finished down 12.6 percent.</p><h2 id=\"is-this-unusual\">Is this unusual?</h2><p>The government buying equity stakes in large companies is unusual in US history, but not unprecedented.</p><p>During the 2008 financial crisis, the US government temporarily acquired equity stakes in several major companies through the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP). In 2009, TARP provided federal assistance to General Motors, ultimately leaving the government with a more than 60 percent ownership share. This intervention began in the final months of the administration of former President George W Bush. The government fully sold its stake in GM in 2013.</p><p>Through TARP, the government also acquired a 9.9 percent stake in Chrysler, which it exited in 2011.</p><p>The programme extended beyond car makers to the financial sector. The US government took a more than 73 percent stake in GMAC (General Motors Acceptance Corporation, now Ally Financial), exiting its ownership in 2014. It also acquired nearly 74 percent of the financial services insurance giant AIG, selling its remaining stake in 2012, and took a 34 percent stake in Citigroup, which it fully exited by 2010.</p><p>“This isn’t like 2008, when there was an urgent need to shore up critical companies. There’s a much more measured approach here. They [the US government] want these investments to generate returns, and they need to be seen as good investments in order to attract other forms of capital,” Nick Giles, senior equity research analyst at B Riley Securities, an investment banking and capital markets firm, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>During the Great Depression, the government bought stakes in several large banks. Before that, at the turn of the 20th century, it bought an equity stake in the Panama Railroad Company, which was responsible for building the railway that would be used during the construction of the Panama Canal. That equity stake was attached to a specific project rather than a more open-ended challenge, such as foreign dependence on critical minerals.</p><p>“There may not be a defined end date, but they’re clearly looking to make a return, and it sends an important signal that more is coming. I don’t think they [the government] are going to let this fail,” Giles added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"political-divide-on-the-approach\"><strong>Political divide on the approach</strong></h2><p>Interest in providing funds to critical mineral projects was shared by Trump’s predecessor, Biden, who brought in the CHIPS Act for that purpose. Biden was focused on providing grants for projects rather than buying equity stakes.</p><p>Trump’s approach to buy stakes is actually more aligned with progressive Democrats than with members of his own party. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has long been a proponent of the US government buying equity stakes in companies.</p><p>In August, after the White House bought an equity stake in Intel, <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/20/us-senator-bernie-sanders-backs-trump-plan-for-government-stake-in-intel\">Sanders applauded</a> the move.</p><p>“Taxpayers should not be providing billions of dollars in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations like Intel without getting anything in return,” Sanders said at the time.</p><p>Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a Republican known for his libertarian stances, called ownership a “terrible idea” and referred to it as a “step towards socialism” on CNBC. North Carolina’s Thom Tillis likened the Intel investment to something that countries like China or Russia would do.</p><p>For Babak Hafezi, professor of international business at the American University, the investments are a step to remove any reliance on China.</p><p>“Without domestic control and resiliency in both extraction and production, we are dependent on China, which extracts nearly 60 percent of global rare-earth minerals and produces 90 percent of it. This creates a major global chokepoint, and China can use this chokepoint as a means to dictate American Foreign policy via supply chain limitations,” he said.</p><p>“Thus, establishing free and open markets for US consumption is critical to remove any dependency.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The 17-year-old travelled on Monday with his mother, Randa, to southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, and then on to Rafah, which has been closed by Israel for two years as it waged its genocidal war on Gaza, killing more than 70,000 Palestinians.</p><p>Randa told Al Jazeera that she had received a phone call on Monday morning informing her that Mohammed had been included in the first list of wounded patients scheduled to travel, and that they were instructed to head immediately to the Red Crescent Hospital in Khan Younis.</p><p>The reopening of Rafah, Gaza’s only land crossing that does not go through Israel, has been much touted as evidence of the progress of the second phase of the United States-backed Gaza “ceasefire” deal.</p><p>But events on Monday revealed a different reality, marked by strict security restrictions, complex procedures, and limited numbers being allowed to cross, falling far short of expectations and the scale of Gaza’s accumulated humanitarian needs.</p><p>Each of the five patients being allowed to leave was accompanied by two people as per Israeli orders, bringing the total number of travellers to 15, according to information provided to Gaza’s health authorities.</p><p>Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Gaza’s al-Shifa Medical Complex, told Al Jazeera that this was the only group that departed, despite prior plans with the World Health Organization (WHO) – the body overseeing coordination between Egypt and Israel – for the departure of 50 patients daily.</p><p>Egyptian official sources have told Al Jazeera that 50 Palestinians were also permitted to return to Gaza via the Rafah crossing, though no information is yet available on whether they have actually reached the Palestinian side.</p><p>Ismail al-Thawabta, the director of Gaza’s Government Media Office, highlighted just how low these numbers are compared with the approximately 22,000 people needing to leave Gaza for treatment abroad. Meanwhile, about 80,000 Palestinians who left Gaza during the war want to return, he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"eye-injury\">Eye injury</h2><p>Mohammed was injured in an Israeli air attack a year and a half ago, near where his family had been displaced in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, Randa said. He sustained a direct injury to his eye, severely affecting his optic nerve and ability to see.</p><p>“My son has been suffering immensely since his injury. Day after day, his condition kept worsening, and there is no treatment available for him in Gaza,” Randa said, while waiting in the hospital courtyard alongside other patients and their relatives.</p><p>Despite her joy at finally being able to accompany her son on his journey, Randa feels a sense of anguish at having to leave four of her six children behind, as she was only permitted to take one child as a second companion.</p><p>“What matters to me now is that my son regains his sight and can see again with his own eyes. That is my only concern at the moment,” Randa said.</p><p>“I also hope to return to Gaza soon after my son recovers, that the blockade will be lifted, and that all patients will be able to travel, just like my son.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-restrictions\">Israeli restrictions</h2><p>In the Red Crescent Hospital courtyard, dozens of patients on travel waiting lists expressed frustration over the first-day restrictions at Rafah.</p><p>Several patients, including those with amputations, gathered at the hospital, hoping to be permitted to travel to Egypt for treatment.</p><p>Despite patients and their families arriving early in the morning with high hopes, Israeli authorities refused to permit more than five patients to leave, leading to widespread dissatisfaction with the complex mechanisms accompanying the crossing’s partial reopening.</p><p>The multi-stage security procedure of Palestinians moving through the Rafah crossing begins with the preparation of daily lists of candidates for travel, which are then referred to the Israeli side for pre-travel security screening.</p><p>No one is allowed to pass through the crossing or enter it without explicit Israeli approval. The European Union Border Assistance Mission deployed to Rafah is limited to monitoring the process and verifying identities.</p><p>Arrivals in Gaza, after initial identity verification at the crossing under European supervision, are subject to additional inspection procedures at checkpoints located in areas under Israeli military control.</p><p>Raed al-Nims, the Gaza Red Crescent’s head of media, told Al Jazeera that the organisation was still waiting for updates regarding the transfer of more patients for treatment through the crossing.</p><p>He added that a group of patients was successfully transferred to Israel on Monday through the Kerem Abu Salem crossing, in coordination with the WHO.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desperate-need\">Desperate need</h2><p>Ibrahim Abu Thuraya was also one of the five patients allowed to leave Gaza on Monday.</p><p>Ibrahim was injured in the early months of the war, sustaining wounds that led to the amputation of his left hand and an injury to his left eye, where shrapnel is still embedded.</p><p>“Day after day, my eye condition is deteriorating, and I feel severe pain, especially since the shrapnel is lodged behind it and there are no medical capabilities in Gaza to deal with it,” he said from Khan Younis, before he travelled to Rafah. “Doctors told me that I need to travel abroad.”</p><p>Ibrahim was informed on Monday morning by the WHO and Gaza’s Ministry of Health that he had been approved for travel. He will be accompanied by his wife, Samar, and their son.</p><p>“I have suffered greatly for two full years just to be able to leave for treatment, and there are thousands of wounded like me,” he said. “I hope the crossing will be opened permanently.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Other plaintiffs included foreign nationals approved for immigrant visas through their specialised employment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hasan Shafiqullah, an immigration supervising lawyer at The Legal Aid Society, called the State Department’s policy “arbitrary, unlawful, and deeply harmful to families who have followed the rules and are simply seeking to reunite with their loved ones”.</p><p>Other lawyers supporting the case underscored that the policy disproportionately affects people from Africa, the Middle East, South and Central Asia and Eastern Europe.</p><p>Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, accused the Trump administration of relying on “obviously pretextual tropes about nonwhite families undeservedly taking benefits”.</p><p>“Congress and the Constitution prohibit white supremacy as grounds for immigration policy.”</p><p>The lawsuit further points to “arbitrary and disparaging” statements made by Trump and administration officials about immigrants being likely to receive public benefits.</p><p>It notes that most immigrants are ineligible for most government assistance programmes, yet are required to pay local, state, and federal taxes.</p><p>“A visa is a privilege not a right. In accordance with law, [State] Secretary [Marco] Rubio has made it clear that immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,” a State Department spokesperson, Tommy Pigott, said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Such a requirement prevents billions in waste, fraud, and abuse and protects public benefits for Americans,” Pigott said.</p><p>“The Department is pausing issuance to evaluate and enhance screening and vetting procedures – but we will never stop fighting for American citizens first.”</p><h2 id=\"chances-of-success\">Chances of success</h2><p>The odds of success for the new lawsuit, which comes amid a deluge of legal challenges, remained unclear.</p><p>Plaintiffs have won at least temporary pauses on several key immigration issues, particularly related to Trump’s use of the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/3/us-appeals-court-blocks-trump-use-of-alien-enemies-act-in-deportation-drive\">Alien Enemies Act</a> of 1798 to swiftly deport alleged gang members and his effort to end birthright citizenship, as lawsuits make their way through the legal system.</p><p>Many more long-term decisions remain elusive.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, in 2018, a 5-4 ruling by the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court upheld Trump’s visa-processing ban on several Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.</p><p>In the 2018 ruling, most justices ruled that the president had broad discretion to limit the entry of individuals into the US.</p><p>At the time, the Trump administration cited “national security” concerns rather than the “public charge” argument it used in the most recent suspension.</p></div></div></body></html>"
