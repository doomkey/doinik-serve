violate international law and “further entrench Israel’s apartheid system” against Palestinians.</p><p>In a statement on Tuesday, the human rights group said two bills <a

make the death penalty “another discriminatory tool in Israel’s system of apartheid”, Amnesty International said.</p><p>“These amendments mean that the most extreme and irrevocable punishment is being reserved for, and weaponised against, Palestinians,” it said.</p><p>“If adopted, these bills would distance Israel from the vast majority of states which have rejected the death penalty in law or in practice, while further entrenching its cruel system of apartheid against all Palestinians whose rights Israel controls.”</p><p>Israeli authorities have defended the measures, which are moving to committee stages for debate, as a necessary deterrent against deadly attacks.</p><p>But legal experts said their scope and application would violate international legal norms and result in the unjust treatment of Palestinians.</p><p>The legislation is being considered during <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/2/3/live-israel-kills-palestinian-as-few-allowed-to-exit-gaza-for-medical-care\">Israel’s

1962.</p><p>While it retains the death penalty for exceptional offences, such as genocide and treason, Amnesty International said the proposed legislation would “revive its implementation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territory” while weakening safeguards designed to prevent miscarriages of justice.</p><p>The bills include one that would allow for the application of the death penalty by amending the Israeli Penal Law and the Defence Regulations that Israel applies to the West Bank, the group said.</p><p>A second would introduce special provisions and an ad hoc military court to prosecute those accused of involvement in the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.</p><p>The rights group said proposed amendments to military laws applicable in the West Bank that would allow the death penalty would in effect apply only to Palestinians because they would explicitly exclude residents of Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.</p><p>Other changes, such as an amendment applying to those accused of intentionally causing “the death of a person with the <a

But the country’s inclusion in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, represents a huge step for the Azzurri.</p><p>Italy’s success at the European qualification last July, in which they finished second to the Netherlands, guaranteed a World Cup debut. Their 12-run victory over Scotland secured their progression and stunned the cricket world; Scotland, one of the most successful second-tier nations, were expected to finish in the top two.</p><p>A standout performance by allrounder Harry Manenti, who scored a run-a-ball 38 and took five wickets, and a 21-ball 50 from Emilio Gay, absent from the current squad through injury, turned the tournament on its head. Italy qualified through a superior net run rate, although <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/24/bangladesh-out-of-t20-world-cup-after-iccs-refusal-to-change-venues\">Bangladesh’s late withdrawal</a> from the T20 World Cup handed Scotland a last-minute berth.</p><p>Italy join Scotland, Nepal, West Indies and England in Group C of the 16-team tournament, with the top two progressing to the Super Eight phase. Their coach, former Ireland international Kevin O’Brien, has set his sights on reaching the knockout stage and was encouraged by the team’s performance in a pre-tournament tri-series against Ireland and the Netherlands in Dubai.</p><p>“We’re targeting to win games and, ultimately, want to qualify from the group,” said O’Brien. “We’ve got a very experienced squad, maybe not necessarily at World Cups, but we’ve certainly got players who have been playing professional cricket for numerous years.</p><p>“On our day, we can compete with any of the four other teams in our group. We beat Ireland in a T20 chasing 157, so that gives us a lot of confidence.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4285450\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4285450\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4285450\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2227960210-1770121230.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C491&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Wayne Madsen in action.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4285450\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wayne Madsen, who also plays for Derbyshire and the London Spirit in the UK, is the captain of the Italy national team [File: Adam Davy/PA Images via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-s-in-italy-s-squad\">Who’s in Italy’s squad?</h2><p>The 15-player squad is a mixture of five “home-base” players and others drawn from Australia, South Africa and England who qualify as Italian through relatives. None were born in Italy, although several hold Italian passports.</p><p>There are two sets of Australian brothers: Harry and Ben Manenti, and Justin and Anthony Mosca. Both Manenti brothers have played in Australia’s Big Bash League, and Ben played in South Australia’s title-winning Sheffield Shield team last season.</p><p>Other notable names include 37-year-old former South Africa international, JJ Smuts, who recently qualified through his wife’s heritage. A regular on the T20 franchise circuit, the explosive top-order batter and handy left-arm orthodox spinner is expected to lead the way with both bat and ball.</p><p>The captain is 42-year-old Wayne Madsen, a South African-born batter who moved to England and is currently the Derbyshire club captain, armed with the experience of 253 first-class appearances. Grant Stewart, originally from Australia, is another experienced professional in English domestic cricket, where he plays for Kent.</p><p>Aside from Kalugamage, who is now a leg spinner, there are four home base players. Zain Ali is a towering all-rounder who was born in Pakistan and moved to Italy with his family as a two-year-old. Hassan Ali and Syed Naqvi also have Pakistani roots, while Jaspreet Singh was born in India and raised in Italy.</p><p>Rounding out the squad are Marcus Campopiano, who hails from England, South African-born Gian Piero Meade and England-based Australian player Thomas Draca.</p><h2 id=\"the-authenticity-issue\">The authenticity issue</h2><p>There will undoubtedly be questions about whether a side fielding several players who have played much of their cricket in other countries can truly be considered Italian, or if their inclusion is helping Italian cricket grow in any meaningful way.</p><p>O’Brien is adamant that the team identity is based firmly around Italian culture.</p><p>“Before the qualifiers, they spoke about why they’re playing for Italy,” said O’Brien. “A lot of the players have a deep connection to the country through parents or grandparents, a lot of them certainly when it comes to Italian culture. The home-based players all speak Italian fluently, three or four of the non-Italian-based players speak it fluently. It’s an important thing that we do, and something that brings the people, the players and the culture and cricketing history in Italy all together.”</p><p>O’Brien has experience of playing international cricket with players of mixed backgrounds, and he likens the current Italian squad to that of Ireland’s debut World Cup squad in 2007, which included several players from Australia and South Africa, although he acknowledges Ireland had a stronger domestic system.</p><p>“The difference is the club cricket. You’re not going to get somebody from Australia to come over and be a professional in one of the clubs in Milan or Rome, because the standard isn’t there at the moment.</p><p>“There’s a strong understanding and passion for cricket in Italy, and the Federation is getting into schools. They are making steps, trying to take cricket more into the grassroots level in Italy.</p><p>“Of course, it’s going to be difficult. But if you don’t take these baby steps, you’ll never know where the sport can get to, and World Cups, it’s gonna grow the interest. You might not see the results for 10 years or so, but this World Cup can be a huge springboard for cricket in the country.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4285393\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4285393\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4285393\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/s2-1770120021.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Italy players in action\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4285393\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Italy have already signalled their intensions for the T20 World Cup, defeating Canada by 10 runs in Chennai, India, on Monday [Courtesy: International Cricket Council]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"chrishan-s-story\">Chrishan’s story</h2><p>Kalugamage’s journey highlights the importance of accessibility. After moving to a small town near Lucca, he turned to athletics in the absence of cricket and trained with Olympic gold medallist Marcell Jacobs, excelling in the long jump.</p><p>He discovered a local team before joining Roma Cricket Club, where he still plays, juggling cricket with 700-kilometre (435-mile) round trips from Lucca, where he works as a pizza chef.</p><p>“I lost a lot of jobs playing cricket in Italy, because I’m working in the restaurant,” said Kalugamage. “Sunday is the very busy day, so sometimes when I asked to leave to play cricket, they said ‘No, you can’t do it.’ But I leave my job, and I play cricket.”</p><p>Kalugamage’s development as an international leg spinner is remarkable considering Italian club cricket is played on a synthetic pitch typically used by junior and recreational players. O’Brien believes he could be a trump card for Italy with his quick leg breaks and googlies.</p><p>But Kalugamage also represents potential talent and passion. He cried with joy when Italy secured their qualification and says he has witnessed the sport’s growth in his adopted country.</p><p>“What we are actually thinking is that after the World Cup, it will be even bigger, and maybe a lot of young kids will be attracted by cricket and performances of our team.”</p><h2 id=\"world-cup-ambition\">World Cup ambition</h2><p>O’Brien knows what it’s like to shake up the established order. In 2011, he scored the then fastest World Cup century – off just 50 balls – in what was, at the time, the highest successful World Cup chase as Ireland defeated England.</p><p>“There’s a big similarity between where we are to where Irish cricket was in 2007, in terms of the strength of the teams. So there’s absolutely no reason why this Italian team can’t go into a group and win games and qualify for the Super Eight.”</p><p>For Kalugamage, who has never played in front of a large crowd, just making it to the world stage is a fulfilment of his childhood dreams.</p><p>“Il cricket e la mia vita,” he smiled when asked what the game means to him.</p><p>Cricket is my life.</p></div></div></body></html>"

While the conflict has ebbed and flowed over the decades, it has resurged sharply in recent years, in what analysts describe as an almost unprecedented phase.</p><p>The latest escalation unfolded on January 31, when <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/pakistani-forces-kill-145-fighters-in-balochistan-after-deadly-attacks\">coordinated attacks</a> were carried out in nearly a dozen cities across the province by secessionist groups seeking independence.</p><p>Led by the <a href=\"/news/2025/3/12/who-are-the-bla-the-group-behind-pakistans-deadly-train-hijack\">Baloch Liberation Army (BLA)</a>, the attackers killed more than 30 civilians and at least 18 law enforcement personnel. Following those attacks, during government operations lasting several hours, security forces said they killed more than 150 fighters.</p><p>A day later, Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister of the province, said in a television interview that the solution to Balochistan’s woes lay with the military rather than political dialogue.</p><p>But analysts say that the roots of the conflict – and some of the factors that keep it alive – lie in the final years of British rule in South Asia and the uncertain political geography preceding Pakistan’s independence.</p><h2 id=\"accession-to-pakistan-and-discontent\">Accession to Pakistan and discontent</h2><p>On the eve of partition, Balochistan was not a single political unit. Parts of the region were directly administered by the British as “Chief Commissioner’s Balochistan”, while the rest consisted of princely states including Kalat, Makran, Las Bela and Kharan, tied to the British Crown through treaties rather than colonial governance.</p><p>In 1947, the Khanate of Kalat was technically independent, a status initially recognised by Pakistan’s founder and first governor general, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.</p><p>That position shifted as the strategic value of Balochistan’s coastline – a gateway to the Strait of Hormuz – became clear. Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, the khan of Kalat, agreed to accede to Pakistan on March 27, 1948.</p><p>His brother, Abdul Karim, rejected the deal and led a small band of fighters into Afghanistan, marking the first Baloch rebellion. It ended within months with his surrender.</p><p>The episode was seen among Baloch nationalists as a “forced accession” and laid the foundation for future resistance.</p><p>A pattern soon emerged. Political exclusion gave rise to armed resistance, followed by a military response, and then an uneasy and temporary calm – before the cycle would repeat itself.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"cycles-of-revolt\">Cycles of revolt</h2><p>The second major uprising began in 1958, triggered by Pakistan’s “One Unit” scheme, which dissolved provincial identities in West Pakistan into a single administrative entity.</p><p>Baloch leaders saw the move as an erosion of autonomy and demanded the release of Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, who had been arrested.</p><p>Nawab Nauroz Khan, a veteran tribal leader who had fought British rule, led an armed rebellion. It ended with his arrest and the execution of several associates after a military trial. Khan was also awarded the death sentence, but it was later commuted to a life sentence, and he eventually passed away in jail.</p><p>A third phase followed in the 1960s, driven by opposition to military rule in the province – at a time when Pakistan was ruled by its first military government, that of Ayub Khan – and demands for political rights, increasingly shaped by leftist ideas. Though limited, it reinforced the view that Balochistan’s relationship with the state was governed by force.</p><p>The most intense conflict erupted in the 1970s.</p><p>After the dismissal of the elected provincial government of Balochistan in 1973, led by the National Awami Party (NAP), a full-scale rebellion spread across large parts of the province.</p><p>The NAP and its leaders were accused by the government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the prime minister of the country, of a conspiracy hatched in London to allegedly help in the disintegration of Pakistan. The conspiracy was never proven.</p><p>But the party’s leaders, including then chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, were arrested. Thousands of Baloch fighters clashed with nearly 80,000 Pakistani troops, and thousands of people were killed.</p><p>The fighting ended in 1977 after General Zia-ul-Haq seized power in a coup and granted amnesty to Baloch fighters. Their core grievances, however, remained unresolved.</p><h2 id=\"the-tipping-point\">The tipping point</h2><p>A period of relative calm followed, but resentment persisted. Critics accused the state of exploiting Balochistan’s natural resources, such as gas reserves, while local communities remained deprived.</p><p>Several incidents highlighted what Baloch groups described as heavy-handed state tactics, leading to the fifth and current rebellion that began in the early 2000s.</p><p>One flashpoint was the 2005 rape of Shazia Khalid, a physician working for a state-run gas company, allegedly by an army captain. Pakistan was then ruled by General Pervez Musharraf, who had taken power in a 1999 coup.</p><p>The incident provoked massive local protests, which met lethal force, but the simmering tension exploded into a full-blown conflict in August 2006, when Nawab Akbar Bugti, a former chief minister of the province and a popular Baloch tribal chief, was killed in a military operation.</p><p>Bugti’s death turned him into the most powerful symbol of Baloch resistance, triggering a surge in anger and rebellion, alongside a growing belief among many Baloch that independence was the only path forward.</p><p>In recent years, protests have increasingly been led by younger, middle-class Baloch, with women playing a prominent role.</p><p>The state’s response has involved a vast security presence and tactics criticised by rights groups.</p><p>Activists accuse the government of killing and forcibly disappearing thousands of ethnic Baloch suspected of supporting the rebellion. Many of the missing later turned up dead, often bearing signs of torture.</p><p>The government denies responsibility for the enforced disappearances and suggests that most of those who have gone missing have likely joined rebel armed groups, either in the mountains or across the border in Iran or Afghanistan.</p><h2 id=\"the-contemporary-rebellion\">The contemporary rebellion</h2><p>The ongoing rebellion has coincided with major shifts in Pakistan’s political economy.</p><p>Large-scale extraction of natural gas plans for deep-sea ports at Gwadar, excavation for minerals, and the launch of the $62bn China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have transformed Balochistan into a <a href=\"/news/2024/6/3/sharifs-beijing-trip-can-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-be-revived\">strategic focal point</a>.</p><p>For many Baloch groups, these projects represent extraction without benefit, leaving local communities marginalised.</p><p>Armed groups such as the BLA and the Balochistan Liberation Front frame their struggle as resistance to colonial-style exploitation and in pursuit of “national liberation”.</p><p>The Pakistani government has accused regional rival India of fomenting trouble in the province by supporting separatists. Those claims gained traction in 2016 with the <a href=\"/news/2019/9/2/indian-official-meets-detained-indian-spy-jadhav-in-pakistan\">arrest of Kulbhushan Jadhav</a> in Balochistan. Islamabad said he was an Indian intelligence operative working for the Research and Analysis Wing, India’s external intelligence agency.</p><p>Pakistan later released a video showing Jadhav confessing to facilitating attacks, presenting it as evidence of external interference. India has denied that Jadhav was a spy.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4283684\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Pakistan_Minerals_Feb2_2025-01-1770042211.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_Minerals_Feb2_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"searching-for-solutions\">Searching for solutions</h2><p>The 2010s saw the emergence of more sophisticated Baloch armed groups that increasingly targeted Chinese citizens and projects.</p><p>Attacks hit Gwadar port, <a href=\"/news/2019/5/12/gunmen-attack-hotel-in-pakistans-gwadar-kill-five-people\">a luxury hotel in the city</a>, the <a href=\"/news/2018/11/23/gunmen-attack-chinese-consulate-in-karachi\">Chinese consulate in Karachi</a>, and a<a href=\"/news/2022/4/27/female-graduate-student-behind-pakistan-university-attack-report\"> Chinese cultural centre</a>, among many several other incidents.</p><p>As violence has intensified, the government has also increased its focus on extracting Balochistan’s mineral wealth.</p><p>China operates a major copper mine in Saindak, while the Reko Diq project in western Balochistan, which is considered one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits, is also in the pipeline.</p><p>With Balochistan making up 44 percent of Pakistan’s landmass, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, Abdul Basit, a research fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, says geography poses a greater challenge than the rebellion.</p><p>Balochistan’s terrain is defined by a rugged, arid landscape of mountain ranges, with vast spaces which are only sparsely populated, making up just more than 6 percent of the total population of the country. The mountainous regions of the province are often used by rebel groups as sanctuaries.</p><p>“Can you really deploy security apparatus in a province which is as large as Balochistan, and with as difficult a terrain, to ensure complete eradication of violence, especially when the state refuses to look at the local faultlines?” he asked.</p><p>Many analysts argue that Pakistan must shift away from military-first approaches.</p><p>Imtiaz Baloch, a researcher on conflict in the province, says the rebellion has been handled with ego rather than a genuine effort to secure peace.</p><p>“Instead of addressing the root issues, governments have focused on shaping a narrative, mainly for audiences outside the province. Balochistan doesn’t need emotional posturing or optics; it needs a calm, political, and realistic approach,” he said.</p><p>Saher Baloch, a Berlin-based scholar with extensive experience in the province, says a political problem cannot be resolved through force.</p><p>Because fighters know the terrain better than security forces, she said that they need only to strike occasionally to expose state vulnerabilities.</p><p>“Where the state rules through fear rather than trust, intelligence also dries up. People don’t cooperate, information doesn’t flow, and that’s why even high security zones keep getting breached,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Government officials continue to argue that military force is the answer, a view that Rafiullah Kakar “strongly disagrees” with.</p><p>Kakar, a political analyst specialising in Balochistan and a doctoral candidate at the University of Cambridge, said Pakistan has relied on “coercive and militarised approaches” that have failed to bring stability.</p><p>“The Pakistani state needs to fundamentally shift and recalibrate its approach. The starting point must be meaningful confidence-building measures to create an enabling environment for political reconciliation and dialogue,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Any serious attempt to resolve the crisis, he added, must recognise its political nature and include steps such as addressing enforced disappearances, ensuring electorally legitimate representation, and establishing “a credible Truth and Reconciliation Commission”.</p><p>“Finally, the state must present a clear roadmap for structured dialogue and institutional mechanisms to address Balochistan’s longstanding political, economic, and governance-related grievances,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It established a diplomatic mission there in 1823.</p><p>A year later, the two nations signed a string of treaties focusing on peace, navigation and commerce, <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/countries/colombia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to</a> US government archives.</p><p>Since then, the two nations have continued to cooperate on security and economic matters. But these efforts have been interrupted at times, such as during the Cold War, by geopolitics and in relation to Colombia’s war on the drug trade.</p><p>Here is a timeline of key issues and events.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"business-interests-threatened\">Business interests threatened</h2><p>In 1928, US businesses were operating in Colombia. But their interests were threatened when Colombian employees of America’s United Fruit Company protested, demanding better working conditions. Political parties in Colombia had also begun questioning Washington’s expanding role in Latin America following these protests.</p><p>According to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), this was also the period of the “Banana Wars” when Washington was busy toppling regimes in South America to shore up its business interests in the region.</p><p>A string of US military interventions took place from 1898 to 1934 as Washington sought to expand its economic interests in the region until President Franklin D Roosevelt introduced the “Good Neighbor Policy”, pledging not to invade or occupy Latin American countries or interfere in their internal affairs.</p><h2 id=\"emergence-of-farc\">Emergence of FARC</h2><p>Security relations between the US and Colombia deepened during the second world war. In 1943, Colombia offered its territory for US air and naval bases while Washington provided training for Colombian soldiers.</p><p>According to the CFR<strong>,</strong> the US boosted military support for Colombia during its deadly conflict with armed rebel groups, which lasted from 1948 until the mid-1950s and killed more than 200,000 people. During this conflict, many independent armed groups emerged in the countryside, and the US implemented a strategy known as Plan Lazo to improve civilian defence networks.</p><p>In response, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was formed by rebel leaders and engaged in widespread violence and kidnappings, according to the CFR.</p><p>FARC claimed to be inspired by communist values and, in the late 1940s, controlled about 40 percent of the country, according to the CFR. Washington labelled it as a “terrorist” organisation and focused efforts towards destabilising the group.</p><p>FARC eventually signed a peace agreement with the Colombian government in 2016. In 2021, the group was <a href=\"/news/2021/12/1/what-next-after-colombia-farc-removed-from-us-terrorist-list\">delisted</a> from Washington’s foreign terrorist organisations’ list.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"war-on-drugs\">War on drugs</h2><p>As <a href=\"/news/2025/9/16/landmark-ruling-convicts-seven-farc-ex-leaders-of-wartime-crimes\">FARC</a> was rising in Colombia, the drug trade was also gathering momentum. Groups such as the Medellin Cartel and Cali Cartel emerged in the country, and trafficked marijuana and cocaine to the US on a regular basis.</p><p>Faced with a rising number of drug-related deaths, the US government <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-106\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spent</a> more than $10bn on counter-narcotics and security efforts to aid Colombia’s government between 1999 and 2018, according to a US Government Accountability Office report.</p><p>Former US presidents, including Bill Clinton and George W Bush, also launched counter-narcotic initiatives to disrupt drug trafficking, destroy coca crops, and support alternative livelihoods for coca farmers, in a bid to quash the cartels.</p><p>Trump’s first term as president, beginning in 2017, was marked by renewed counter-narcotic initiatives but he also threatened to decertify Colombia as a cooperative country if it did not take action against its drug cartels.</p><p>Tensions between the US and Colombia calmed under former US President Joe Biden, who focused on improving diplomatic ties by designating Colombia as a major non-NATO ally in 2022.</p><p>Today, cartels function in a decentralised manner and some have also been designated as terrorist organisations by the US. In December 2025, the Trump administration designated the <a href=\"/news/2022/5/12/terrifying-days-of-terror-under-colombias-gulf-clan-cartel\">Gulf Clan</a>, Colombia’s largest illegal arms group, which is also involved in drug trafficking, as a terrorist organisation.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-second-term\">Trump’s second term</h2><p>In 2022, Petro was elected as Colombia’s first left-wing president and took up office in the presidential palace with promises to lead Colombia in a more equitable, eco-friendly direction.</p><p>But tensions with the US flared again when Trump arrived in the White House for his second term in January 2025.</p><p>Since then, Petro has been a vocal critic of Trump’s policies, particularly those relating to Latin America.</p><p>Last year, the Trump administration began a series of military strikes on Venezuelan boats, which it alleged were carrying drugs, in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The Trump administration has struck dozens of boats, but has not provided any evidence that any were trafficking drugs. Petro called the aggression an “act of tyranny”.</p><p>Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025, Petro said that “criminal proceedings must be opened against those officials, who are from the US, even if it includes the highest-ranking official who gave the order: President Trump”, in relation to the boat strikes.</p><p>At the UNGA, Petro also criticised US ally Israel’s war on Gaza and called on US troops to “disobey Trump’s orders” and “obey the order of humanity”.</p><p>Washington revoked Petro’s US visa after he spoke at a pro-Palestine march outside the UNGA in New York.</p><p>Weeks later, the Trump administration also imposed sanctions on the Colombian president, who is set to leave office following a presidential election in May.</p><p>In a post on his Truth Social platform in October, Trump said Petro “does nothing” to stop the drug production [in his country], and so the US would no longer offer “payment or subsidies” to Colombia.</p><p>Shortly after carrying out the abduction of Venezuela’s Maduro, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that both Venezuela and Colombia were “very sick” and that the government in Bogota was run by “a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”. “And he’s not going to be doing it very long. Let me tell you,” Trump added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>When asked if he meant a US operation would take place against Colombia, Trump said, “Sounds good to me.”</p><p>In response, Petro promised to defend his country, saying that he would “take up arms” for his homeland.</p><p>In an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/petro-says-colombia-cooperating-with-us-despite-insults-threats\">interview</a> with Al Jazeera on January 9, however, Petro said his government is seeking to maintain cooperation on combating narcotics with Washington, striking a softer tone following days of escalating rhetoric.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was a 10-year agreement signed in 2010 by then-US President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, a close ally of Vladimir Putin who served a single term as Russia’s president from 2008 to 2012. It came into effect in 2011.</p><p>New START was an extension of earlier treaties. START I, which reduced the number of strategic warheads in deployment in both the US and Russia, was signed between the US and the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War in 1991 and was in place until 2009. START II, which aimed to further reduce the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and remove multiwarhead intercontinental ballistic missiles altogether, was signed in 1993 but never entered into force. Russia formally withdrew from it in 2002.</p><p>From 2003 to 2011, the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) was also in place. It required both sides to reduce operationally deployed strategic warheads, but it included minimal checks, relying on START I’s mechanisms for monitoring. This is what was replaced by New START in 2011.</p><p>New START was extended in 2021 for five more years after US President Joe Biden took office. The treaty states that it can only be extended once.</p><p>The treaty limits the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons, those designed to hit an adversary’s key political, military and industrial centres.</p><p>Deployed weapons or warheads are those in active service and available for rapid use as opposed to those that are in storage or awaiting dismantlement.</p><p>Under the agreement, Moscow and Washington are <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/new-start/\">committed to the following:</a></p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and a maximum of 700 long-range missiles and bombers.</li>\n<li>Limiting intercontinental ballistic missiles in deployment to 800.</li>\n<li>Allowing up to 18 inspections of strategic <a href=\"/news/2022/10/4/ukraine-war-will-putin-use-nuclear-weapons\">nuclear weapons</a> sites yearly by the other side to ensure the other has not breached the treaty’s limits.</li>\n</ul><p>The treaty allowed each country to send inspectors to the other country’s nuclear sites with little advance warning.</p><p>These inspections were put on hold in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspections were never resumed after this.</p><p>In 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and a war that has continued for four years.</p><p>Then, in 2023, Russian President Putin<b> </b>suspended Moscow’s participation in the New START treaty, citing Washington’s support for Ukraine during the war.</p><p>This meant that Russia stopped participating in inspections and sharing data but was still party to the treaty.</p><p>That put an end to on-site inspections and left both countries dependent on their own intelligence to judge the other’s compliance. Despite this, neither side has alleged that the other has violated the warhead limits, which are still in effect.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-the-treaty-matter\">Why does the treaty matter?</h2><p>The US and Russia are the two biggest nuclear powers in the world in terms of the number of warheads they possess. Together, the US and Russia possess about 90 percent of all nuclear warheads in the world.</p><p>The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation (CACNP) estimated that Moscow currently has 5,459 nuclear warheads, of which 1,600 are actively deployed.</p><p>The US has about 5,550 nuclear warheads, according to the CACNP, with about 3,800 of those active. At its peak in the mid-1960s during the Cold War, the US stockpile consisted of more than 31,000 active and inactive nuclear warheads.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said\">What has Trump said?</h2><p>US President Donald Trump appears eager to reach a new agreement to restrict nuclear weapons.</p><p>During an interview with The New York Times in January, Trump said of the New START treaty: “If it expires, it expires. … We’ll just do a better agreement.”</p><p>Trump has also said he would like to include China in any nuclear talks. “We are talking about limiting nuclear weapons. We will get China into that,” Trump said in August.</p><p>Separately that same month before a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, Trump said: “I think the denuclearisation is a very – it’s a big aim, but Russia is willing to do it, and I think China is going to be willing to do it too. We can’t let nuclear weapons proliferate. We have to stop nuclear weapons. The power is too great.”</p><h2 id=\"what-has-moscow-said\">What has Moscow said?</h2><p>Medvedev, who is currently the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, warned that if the New START treaty expires, it will mean the biggest nuclear powers will have unlimited capacity to expand their nuclear programmes for the first time since the 1970s.</p><p>“I don’t want to say that this immediately means a catastrophe and a nuclear war will begin, but it should still alarm everyone,” Medvedev said in an interview at his residence outside Moscow on Monday, which was reported by the Reuters and TASS news agencies and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger.</p><p>In September, Putin suggested that both countries should just keep abiding by the warhead limits, without a formal deal, for one more year.</p><p>“To avoid provoking a further strategic arms race and to ensure an acceptable level of predictability and restraint, we believe it is justified to try to maintain the status quo established by the New START treaty during the current, rather turbulent period,” Putin said in televised remarks at the Kremlin.</p><p>The Trump administration has not officially responded to this proposal.</p><p>At times, Putin has appeared more relaxed about the treaty, however. In October, he <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/russias-putin-says-no-big-deal-if-us-wont-extend-nuclear-warhead-limits\">told reporters</a> that Russia was developing new strategic weapons and<span> it would not be critical for Moscow if the US declined to extend the warhead limits set out in New START.</span></p><p>At the time, he told reporters: “Will these few months be enough to make a decision on an extension? I think it will be enough if there is goodwill to extend these agreements. And if the Americans decide they don’t need it, that’s not a big deal for us.”</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-lapse-of-this-treaty-mean\">What does the lapse of this treaty mean?</h2><p>When the treaty lapses, the legal limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads the US and Russia can each have will disappear.</p><p>In an article for Chatham House, the London-based think tank, Georgia Cole, research associate on the international security programme, wrote in late January: “This would mark a significant break in more than five decades of bilateral nuclear arms control. It would also signal a move away from nuclear restraint, making the world a more dangerous place.”</p><p>Advocates for nuclear arms control have voiced concern that this could lead to the proliferation of nuclear warheads.</p><p>“Unless Trump and Putin reach some sort of understanding soon, it’s not unlikely that Russia and the US will start to upload more warheads on their missiles,” Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, told Politico.</p><p>Cole wrote: “Without the New START limits, strategic planning on both sides is more likely to be driven by uncertainty and worst-case assessments. That increases the risk of a new arms race, especially if either side begins uploading additional warheads onto existing missiles or expanding delivery systems.”</p><p>The US political news website additionally reported that the US Department of Defense is already planning for a future without the New START treaty, quoting three anonymous sources familiar with the matter. It is unclear what these discussions or plans entail.</p><p>Both the US and Russia have been ramping up weapons production in recent years, developing nuclear-capable weapons designed to be able to carry a nuclear warhead even if they are not always deployed with one.</p><p>In January, Russia struck a target in western Ukraine close to the Polish border with its nuclear-capable hypersonic <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/russia-hits-ukraine-with-oreshnik-hypersonic-missile-why-it-matters\">Oreshnik</a> missile.

Establishing, for the first time, global targets to end all forms of violence against children, grounded in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p><p>Today, 10 years on, we must confront a stark reality: we are not on course to achieve those targets.</p><p>Each year, half of the world’s children are victims of violence. Bluntly, we are failing to keep a billion girls and boys safe in their homes, schools, communities, care settings and online.</p><p>We recognise the complexity of the issue, and we recognise its consequences, often lasting lifetimes and spanning generations. Violence erodes every investment that families, communities, and governments make in children, from their education and social inclusion to their mental and physical health. The violence experienced by a billion children today is the same violence that will undermine the health, prosperity, and stability of our societies tomorrow.</p><p>As Ministers, we are driven by the possible, by the interventions and investments that can most improve people’s lives. We are motivated by the fact that violence against children is entirely preventable. And that preventing violence strengthens public health outcomes, social protection systems, community resilience and intergenerational mobility.</p><p>Decades of rigorous research, community mobilisation, and country experience have given us a clear understanding of what works. The <a href=\"https://inspire-strategies.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">INSPIRE framework,</a> coordinated by WHO and partners, provides a proven blueprint of seven strategies – from strengthening norms and laws to supporting parents and caregivers, scaling response services and creating safe school environments. A recent, largest-ever, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(25)00214-7/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">evidence review</a> on preventing violence against children confirmed unequivocally that INSPIRE strategies work. We are now the first generation in history with the knowledge and tools to deliver sustained reductions in violence at a national scale. We have the opportunity, and responsibility, to act.</p><p>This is why we are launching the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/council-of-champions-on-ending-violence-against-children\">WHO Council of Champions to End Violence Against Children</a>. The first-ever global collective of Ministers committed to using our political capital to position violence prevention where it belongs: at the centre of national and global health, social development, justice, protection and economic agendas. We are compelled to act by the fact that children who grow up safe are healthier, learn better and are more socially protected, becoming adults who contribute to stronger, more equitable societies.</p><p>Together, we, the 10 Ministers, will generate – and demonstrate – political leadership. From the outset, we must confront the dramatic disparity between the scale of the problem and the scale of investment. Whether looking at domestic budgets or funder flows, the power of preventing violence – with its wins for child outcomes from social development to mental health – remains unrecognised and under-resourced. We are committed to prioritising the problem, increasing funding and intensifying actions to unlock the enabling potential of preventing violence against children.</p><p>This year is our proof point. In November 2026, the Second Global Ministerial Conference on Ending Violence Against Children, hosted by the government of the Philippines, will stand on the shoulders of an impactful <a href=\"https://endviolenceagainstchildrenconference.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">First Global Ministerial Conference in Colombia in 2024</a>. That moment proved what is possible. Prioritising our most promising and vulnerable citizens, mobilising member states, civil society, citizens and delivering unprecedented commitments to action for children affected by violence.</p><p>With the SDG deadline fast-approaching, we must do more and do better. The Ministerial Conference in Manila must celebrate success, lock-in progress, elevate expectation and generate concrete commitments, commensurate with the scale of the violence prevention challenge. It represents a moment to scale best-proven INSPIRE strategies, confront the financing gap head-on, strengthen health and social protection systems, and ensure that lived experience – of children, young people, civil society and victims of violence – helps shape the solutions so essential to delivering our shared SDG promise.</p><p>Let our next moves as Ministers prove our commitment – redoubling our efforts to work towards a world free from violence and exploitation, just as we pledged, just as each child deserves.</p><p><strong>Signed by:</strong></p><p><strong>HE Evis Sala, Minister of Health and Social Protection, Albania</strong></p><p><strong>HE Anna Karapetyan, Deputy Minister of Justice, Armenia</strong></p><p><strong>HE Alexandre Padilha, Minister of Health, Brazil</strong></p><p><strong>HE Stephanie Rist, Minister of Health, Families, Autonomy, and Disabled Persons, France</strong></p><p><strong>HE Wafa Bani Mustafa, Minister of Social Development, Jordan</strong></p><p><strong>HE Ahmed Abdulwahab Ahmed al-Awadhi, Minister of Health, Oman</strong></p><p><strong>HE Teodoro J Herbosa, Minister of Health, Philippines</strong></p><p><strong>HE Elia dos Reis Amaral, Minister of Health, Timor-Leste (East Timor)</strong></p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In total, that would bring 50 percent tariffs down to 18 percent.</p><p>In turn, India would reduce “their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO”, Trump wrote.</p><p>Trump added that Modi had also committed to “‘BUY AMERICAN’, at a much higher level, in addition to over $500 BILLION DOLLARS of U.S. Energy, Technology, Agricultural, Coal, and many other products”.</p><p>“Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward,” he wrote.</p><p>Shortly after, Modi’s statement was posted on X. In it, he completely avoided mention of a “trade deal”, or of any agreement to stop purchasing Russian oil, or committing to buy $500bn worth of goods from the US.</p><p>Instead, Modi simply confirmed that “Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%,” and expressed his gratitude over “this wonderful announcement”.</p><p>Then, he hailed Trump, writing: “President Trump’s leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity. India fully supports his efforts for peace.”</p><p>Analysts said these statements leave too much uncertainty, however.</p><p>“It’s no deal, but just a declaration by both leaders when nothing has been signed,” said Jayati Ghosh, an economist and professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p><p>“So far, whatever little has been revealed, it’s already a bad deal for India.

That was only a little higher than India-China trade worth $127.7bn.</p><p>But, unlike China, where the bilateral balance sheet is highly skewed towards Beijing, which has a trade deficit with India of about $95bn, India has a much more favourable trade balance with Washington.</p><p>In 2024, US exports to India amounted to about $41bn. While oils and fuels account for a nearly 30 percent share at $13bn, they are followed by precious pearls and stones, amounting to $5.16bn. India also imports parts for nuclear reactors, electrical machinery and equipment, and medical instruments from the US.</p><p>By comparison, Indian exports to the US, its biggest market, totalled nearly $87bn in 2024, including pearls, electrical machinery, and pharmaceutical products among the lead export products.</p><p>Now, Trump says Modi has agreed to buy unspecified US goods worth more than $500bn across several sectors, including energy, technology, coal, and agricultural products, among others.</p><p>But $500bn on its own is a promise to increase purchases by 1,150 percent.</p><p>Last week, the Modi government unveiled its annual budget, which included total spending plans of $590bn. Trump’s claimed promise from Modi would be worth about 85 percent of India’s annual budget.</p><p>This seems a stretch, analysts say.</p><p>“This is a come-down for the government of India. This deal is quite disconcerting for New Delhi,” said Biswajit Dhar, a trade economist who has worked on several Indian trade deals.</p><p>“So, the US will impose 18 percent tariffs on India, and India is going to give them duty-free access.

Bharat will never compromise on the interests of its farmers, dairy farmers and fishermen,” he said, using the Hindi name for India. “<span>And I am fully aware that I may have to pay a very heavy price personally, but I am prepared for it.”  </span></p><p>But on Monday, US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins wrote in a post on X: “New US-India deal will export more American farm products to India’s massive market, lifting prices, and pumping cash into rural America.”</p><p>She added: “In 2024, America’s agricultural trade deficit with India was $1.3 billion. India’s growing population is an important market for American agricultural products, and today’s deal will go a long way to reducing this deficit.”</p><p>An unnamed Indian government official was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying on Monday that India had agreed to buy US goods, including in the telecommunications and pharmaceutical industries, as part of its commitments under the deal. Publicly, however, New Delhi has been silent on this.</p><p>“This is really quite, quite disastrous,” Dhar said. “That goes against the verbatim commitment by the PM himself that farmers’ interests would be protected.</p><p>“The US agri-companies are really large, and the bottom line of any trade negotiation – to save Indian farmers – seems to have been dropped now.”</p><p>Ghosh, the Indian economist, said she doubted “if the domestic politics would even allow Modi to open the agriculture sector to Trump”.</p><p>“India cannot afford to do that. The impact would be huge, and the farmers’ protest will be even bigger amid a lot of discontent,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3941609\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3941609\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3941609\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-07-31T103347Z_886267835_RC2KXFAJUABW_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TARIFFS-INDIA-TEXTILES-1757596792.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"India textile tariff\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3941609\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Garment workers stitch shirts at a textile factory in Noida, India, on July 31, 2025 [Bhawika Chhabra/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-india-in-a-more-favourable-position-now\">Is India in a more favourable position now?</h2><p>On the face of it, the 18 percent US trade tariff on Indian goods makes India better placed than neighbouring rivals, such as Pakistan with 19 percent, Bangladesh and Vietnam with 20 percent, and China with 34 percent.</p><p>However, nearly all of India’s neighbours are beneficiaries of the US’s Generalized System of Preferences concession, under which Washington facilitates duty-free entry for selected goods from developing countries to support their exports.</p><p>New Delhi, which was previously the biggest beneficiary of this, was removed from that list in 2019 amid trade tensions as India resisted opening up its markets.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-things-do-we-not-know-about-this-deal\">What other things do we not know about this ‘deal’?</h2><p>Most importantly, we do not know if an India-US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been formally negotiated and concluded.</p><p>India signed a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/mother-of-all-deals-how-india-eu-trade-deal-creates-27-trillion-market\">major FTA with the European Union</a> last week, hailing it as the “mother of all deals”.

This deal, which will give a new momentum to our economy, will not only boost employment but will also prove to be a milestone in realising our resolve to make India a leader in every sector by 2047.”</p><p>Despite giving no further details about the agreement when he confirmed it in a press conference on Tuesday, India’s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, was similarly effusive.</p><p>“It will protect the sensitive sectors – the interests of our agriculture and our dairy sectors,” Goyal said, without explaining how. “It will open up huge opportunities for our labour intensive sectors and export sectors. This is truly a deal every Indian can be proud of.”</p><p>But Trump’s announcement from Washington drew ire from the political opposition in India, which pressed the Modi government to reveal the details of the deal.</p><p>“The main thing is that our PM is compromised. The public needs to think about this. Narendra Modi ji has sold your hard work in this trade deal because he is compromised. He has sold the country,” said Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition in the Indian parliament.</p><h2 id=\"does-this-mark-an-upturn-in-india-us-relations\">Does this mark an upturn in India-US relations?</h2><p>The public statements by Trump and Modi seem to signal a major thaw in relations that had turned frosty since the US president took office in January last year, experts say.</p><p>Sources of tension have anged from the handling of Indian immigrants to the US, a steep fee hike for the US’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/trumps-h-1b-visa-fee-hike-which-countries-could-benefit\">H-1B worker visa</a>, India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, and stalling trade negotiations. In addition, Trump has repeatedly claimed to have brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following their four-day hostilities last May. While Pakistan hailed the US president’s role and nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize, India denied that Trump had played a major role.</p><p>“Trump is playing to the domestic theatre to show that there’s a major victory coming out of this,” Harsh Pant, vice president of the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, said. “It is equally important for Modi to showcase that he’s able to withstand the pressure from Washington.</p><p>“This is the beginning of a new phase where the relationship will take on a different texture with clarity on lots of things [for leaders],” Pant told Al Jazeera. However, he cautioned that it will likely still take time to restore confidence fully between the two sides, particularly from India’s perspective.</p><p>Pant also added that issues like the purchase of Russian oil will persist, as New Delhi will try to protect its traditional ties with the Kremlin, as well.</p><p>But with the Monday announcement, Pant said, these niggles may be easier to resolve.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Linda Yaccarino, on April 20.</p><p>Other staff at X – known as Twitter before Musk’s 2022 purchase of the platform – have been summoned to appear the same week as witnesses, the office said.</p><p>“At this stage, the conduct of this investigation is part of a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the ‌X platform complies with French laws, insofar as it operates on national territory,” the prosecutor’s office said.</p><p>The prosecutor’s ‌cybercrime division was conducting the inquiry in addition to ⁠the French police’s cybercrime unit and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, or Europol, the office said.</p><p>In its post on X, the Paris Prosecutor’s Office said it was “leaving” the platform, advising people to find

They have built echo chambers where people live cut off from other narratives and from the true complexity of the world,” Sheikh Nasser bin Faisal Al Thani said at the Web Summit Qatar 2026 on Tuesday.</p><p>Journalism, the Al Jazeera director general, said, is “not an alternative to technology, or in opposition to it, but rather a valuable force capable of adding context to events, connecting diverse voices and revealing the human stories behind the news”.</p><p>“The evolution of journalism cannot be separated from profound changes driven by digital platforms and artificial intelligence within the public sphere,” he said.</p><p>But he called on the global technology sector to fundamentally rethink the design of digital platforms, warning that algorithmic models prioritising “shock” and “outrage” are eroding shared human understanding.</p><p>Sheikh Nasser argued that humanity has entered an era in which the challenge is no longer accessing information but making sense of its “overabundance”.</p><p>Addressing a packed audience at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center, Sheikh Nasser cautioned that while technology has democratised storytelling, it has also given rise to “troubling realities” in which attention-based economic models deepen division instead of fostering dialogue.</p><p>“Many are now surrounded by cascades of content, yet they feel more isolated, more alienated,” Sheikh Nasser said. He warned that current digital systems often “flatten complex truths into harsh binary choices”, creating fragmented worlds where “disagreements never meet”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-core-project\">The ‘Core Project’</h2><p>Amid fast-paced technological changes, such as artificial intelligence, Al Jazeera has embarked on a comprehensive initiative called the “Core Project” to review its role, responsibility and purpose in the digital age.</p><p>Describing it as a “re-evaluation of the fundamental ideas that underpin our journalism” rather than just a technical upgrade, Sheikh Nasser outlined a strategy to combine technology with “ethical and professional responsibility”.</p><p>“We plan to combine technology with ethical and professional responsibility to give journalists the tools to provide context, to report responsibly on breaking news, to separate facts from biases and to maximise the power of objective analysis and understanding,” he said.</p><p>The initiative aims to automate repetitive tasks to free up journalists for high-value analysis centred on three guiding principles: the “Now”, “Meaning or Context”, and “People”.</p><p>“The ‘Now’ alone cannot guide us,” he noted, explaining that while speed and accuracy are vital, journalism must provide the “Meaning” by linking events to their root causes.</p><p>Most critically, he redefined the audience not as passive consumers or data points but as “conscious actors” capable of engaging responsibly with the world.</p><p>“Resilient journalism – swift but not shallow, modern without abandoning its values – can restore context to the news, create space for debate and a human dimension to disagreements,” Sheikh Nasser said.</p><p>The director general concluded with a direct appeal to the tech leaders and innovators gathered in Doha, calling for a partnership in which “responsible journalism meets ethical technology”.</p><p>“The challenge we face today is not a battle between journalism and technology,” Sheikh Nasser said. “It is rather an opportunity to align them through shared responsibility, … to bridge divides and empower a world capable of dialogue.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Summit’s third edition</h3><p>The event in the Qatari capital opened on Saturday with Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, chairperson of the Qatar Foundation, challenging the conventional narrative of technological progress.</p><p>She criticised the “selectively told story of modern technology” that traces innovation solely from the European industrial revolution to Silicon Valley.</p><p>“Too often we talk about technology as if innovation has a single geography, a single language, a single image. But the story is incomplete. The very word algorithm comes from Al-Khwarizmi,” she said, referencing the ninth-century Persian mathematician.</p><p>“We were there at the foundations of knowledge, and we are here shaping its future.”</p><p>The summit’s opening also was marked by major announcements from Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, including the launch of QAI, Qatar’s national artificial intelligence company, and a $2bn expansion of the Qatar Investment Authority’s Fund of Funds programme for venture capital.</p><p>“We meet at a moment when innovation is the world’s most valuable currency,” Sheikh Mohammed said. “In Qatar, we do not want to simply watch the future arrive. We want to shape it alongside partners from around the world.”</p><p>The third edition of the Web Summit Qatar has drawn more than 1,600 start-ups, more than 800 investors and 400 speakers.</p><p>The event also has attracted a diverse array of international figures, including Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, musician and podcast host Questlove, and activist and former American football player Colin Kaepernick.</p><p>Pedro Lopes, Cabo Verde’s secretary of state for digital economy, praised Qatar’s hosting of the summit. “The Qataris should be proud of this event,” he said on a panel alongside Lebanon’s information minister, Paul Morcos.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Last month during the violent clashes between Kurdish forces and the Syrian army, the United States delivered a devastating message to Syria’s Kurds: Their partnership with Washington had “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/us-envoy-says-sdfs-role-in-syria-has-largely-expired-after-isil\">expired</a>“. This was not merely a statement of shifting priorities – it was a clear signal that the US was siding with Damascus and abandoning the Kurds at their most vulnerable moment.</p><p>For the Kurds across the region watching events unfold, the implications were profound. The US is no longer perceived as a reliable partner or supporter of minorities.</p><p>This development is likely to have an impact not just on the Kurdish community in Syria but also those in Iraq, Turkiye and Iran.</p><h2 id=\"fears-of-repeat-marginalisation-in-syria\">Fears of repeat marginalisation in Syria</h2><p>US support for Damascus under interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa paves the way for a centralised Syrian state – an arrangement that Kurds throughout the region view with deep suspicion. Their wariness is rooted in bitter historical experience.</p><p>Centralised states in the Middle East have historically marginalised, excluded and assimilated Kurdish minorities. The prospect of such a system emerging in Syria, with US backing, represents a fundamental divergence from Kurdish hopes for the region’s future.</p><p>The approach the Assad regime to the Kurdish question was built on systematic denial. Kurds were not recognised as a distinct collective group within Syria’s national fabric; the state banned the public use of the Kurdish language and Kurdish names. Many Kurds were denied citizenship.</p><p>Al-Sharaa’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">presidential decree</a> of January 16 promised Kurds some rights while the January 30 agreement between Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) included limited recognition of Kurdish collective identity, including acknowledgment of “Kurdish regions” – terminology conspicuously absent from Syria’s political vocabulary and government documents in the past.</p><p>These represent incremental gains, but they are unfolding within a transitional government structure that aims for centralisation as its ultimate objective. That is why Syrian Kurds remain suspicious of whether the promises made today will be upheld in the future.</p><p>While a consensus has emerged among the majority of Kurdish groups that armed resistance is not strategically viable at this stage, any future engagement with the US will be perceived with mistrust.</p><h2 id=\"possibility-of-renewed-shia-kurdish-alliance-in-iraq\">Possibility of renewed Shia-Kurdish alliance in Iraq</h2><p>After years of power rivalries between Shia and Kurdish parties in Iraq, both groups are now observing developments in Syria and potential changes in Iran with a shared sense of threat and common interests. If in 2003, their alliance was driven by a shared past – the suffering under Saddam Hussein’s regime – today it is being guided by a shared future shaped by fears of being marginalised in the region.</p><p>At both the political and popular levels, Shia and Kurdish parties and communities have had much more in common over the past few weeks than in the past. This convergence is evident not only in elite political calculations but also in public sentiment across both communities.</p><p>For the first time in recent memory, both Kurdish elites and ordinary citizens in Iraq are no longer enthusiastic about regime change in Iran, a position that would have been unthinkable just a few weeks ago.</p><p>In addition, last month, Iraq’s Shia Coordination Framework, an alliance of its Shia political parties, nominated Nouri al-Maliki for prime <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/iraq-shia-alliance-nominates-former-pm-nouri-al-maliki-as-its-candidate\">minister</a>, the most powerful position in the Iraqi government. Remarkably, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the dominant Kurdish political force, welcomed the nomination.</p><p>The KDP’s support for al-Maliki was not solely a reaction to anger over US policy in Syria. It was also rooted in Iraqi and Kurdish internal politics. The endorsement is part of an ongoing rivalry between the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) over Iraq’s presidency, an office reserved for the Kurds. The KDP needs allies in Baghdad to ensure its candidate, rather than the PUK’s, secures the position.</p><p>However, Washington might see an alignment between the KDP-led Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq and an al-Maliki-led government or a similar government in Baghdad as not conducive to its interests in Iraq, especially its efforts to curb Iranian influence.</p><p>Before casting blame, Washington should ask itself why the Kurds feels compelled to adopt this position. The Kurdish stance cannot be fully understood without factoring US policy in Syria into the discussion. From a Kurdish perspective, the US has not been a neutral arbiter in Syria.</p><h2 id=\"the-peace-process-in-turkiye\">The peace process in Turkiye</h2><p>Over the past year, many believed that the sustainability of Turkiye’s peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) hinged on a resolution of the Kurdish question in Syria and the fate of the SDF.</p><p>The violent clashes between Damascus, backed by Ankara and Washington, and the SDF threatened to close the door on negotiations. Remarkably, however, not all avenues have been shut.</p><p>It now appears the two issues are being treated as separate files. Negotiations with the PKK are likely to continue within Turkiye’s borders, and crucially, PKK leaders have not translated their disappointment over the weakening of the SDF into a definitive rejection of talks with Ankara.</p><p>What sustains this dynamic is that the SDF has not been entirely dismantled, leaving some breathing room for continued dialogue between Ankara and the PKK.</p><h2 id=\"the-iranian-kurds\">The Iranian Kurds</h2><p>The Iranian Kurds, although farther away from Syria, have also observed events there and made their conclusions. The abandonment of the SDF reveals the unpredictable nature of US support for the region’s minorities.</p><p>In light of this and given continuing US incitement against the Iranian regime, it is quite significant that the Iranian Kurds collectively and deliberately decided not to be at the forefront of the recent protests or allow themselves to be instrumentalised by Western media.</p><p>The Kurdish community in Iran is not enthusiastic about a potential return of Reza Pahlavi, who clearly enjoys support from Washington, and the restoration of the shah’s legacy, which was also oppressive. Iranian opposition groups – many of them based in the West – have not offered a better prospect for the Kurdish question. There is widespread fear that the current regime could simply be replaced by another with no guarantee for Kurdish rights.</p><p>Some Iraq-based Iranian Kurdish armed groups did carry out attacks on Iranian positions near the Iran-Iraq border. But the main Iranian Kurdish armed actors chose not to engage directly or escalate militarily. Their calculations are based on the uncertainty about the endgame envisioned by Israel and the US and the reality that any escalation would provoke Iranian retaliation against Iraqi Kurds.</p><p>With each abandonment of its Kurdish allies, the US further erodes the foundation of trust upon which its local partnerships rest. Iraqi and Syrian Kurds have learned to live with American unreliability, but this arrangement may not endure indefinitely. When it fractures, the consequences for US influence in the region could be profound.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
