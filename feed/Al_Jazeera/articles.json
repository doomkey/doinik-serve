Trump has since backed down from this threat.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"china-s-renewed-sales-pitch\">China’s renewed sales pitch</h2><p>While China has long sought to present itself as a viable alternative to the post-war US-led international order, its sales pitch took on renewed energy at the <a href=\"/economy/2017/1/17/chinas-xi-defends-free-trade-in-speech-at-davos\">World Economic Forum</a>‘s (WEF) annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this month.</p><p>As Trump told world leaders that the US had become “the hottest country, anywhere in the world” thanks to surging investment and tariff revenues, and Europe would “do much better” to follow the US lead, Chinese Vice Premier Li Hefeng’s speech emphasised China’s ongoing support for multilateralism and free trade.</p><p>“While economic globalisation is not perfect and may cause some problems, we cannot completely reject it and retreat to self-imposed isolation,” Li said.</p><p>“The right approach should be, and can only be, to find solutions together through dialogue.”</p><p>Li also criticised the “unilateral acts and trade deals of certain countries” – a reference to Trump’s trade war – that “clearly violate the fundamental principles and principles of the [World Trade Organization] and severely impact the global economic and trade order”.</p><p>Li also told the WEF that “every country is entitled to defend its legitimate rights and interests”, a point that could be understood to apply as much to China’s claims over places like Taiwan as to Denmark’s dominion over Greenland.</p><p>“In many ways, China has chosen to cast itself in the role of a stable and responsible global actor in the midst of the disruption that we are seeing from the US. Reiterating its support for the United Nations system and global rules has often been quite enough to bolster China’s standing, especially among countries of the Global South,” Bjorn Cappelin, an analyst at the Swedish National China Centre, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"the-west-is-listening\">The West is listening</h2><p>John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told Al Jazeera that the recent series of trips by European leaders to China shows that the Global North is listening, too. Other notable signs include the UK’s approval of a Chinese “mega embassy” in London, Gong said, and progress in a years-long trade <a href=\"/economy/2024/10/30/eu-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-prompting-rebuke-from-beijing\">dispute</a> over Chinese exports of electric vehicles (EVs) to Europe.</p><p>Starmer is also expected to pursue more trade and investment deals with Beijing this week, according to UK media.</p><p>“A series of events happening in Europe seems to suggest an adjustment of Europe’s China policy – for the better, of course – against the backdrop of what is emanating from Washington against Europe,” Gong told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The shifting diplomatic calculations are also clear in Canada, which has shown a renewed willingness to deepen economic ties with China after several spats with Trump over the past year.</p><p>Carney’s is the first visit to Beijing by a Canadian prime minister since Justin Trudeau went in 2017, and he came away with a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/16/canada-china-strike-trade-deals-to-slash-tariffs-on-evs-canola\">deal</a> that saw Beijing agree to ease tariffs on Canadian agricultural exports and Ottawa to ease tariffs on Chinese EVs.</p><p>Trump lashed out at news of the deal, threatening 100 percent trade tariffs on Canada if the deal goes ahead.</p><p>In a statement last weekend on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that Carney was “sorely mistaken” if he thought Canada could become a “‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States”.</p><p>The meeting between Carney and Xi this month also thawed years of frosty relations after Canada arrested Huawei executive <a href=\"/news/2018/12/7/anger-in-china-over-arrest-of-huaweis-meng-wanzhou-in-canada\">Meng Wanzhou</a> in late 2018 at the behest of the US. Beijing subsequently arrested two Canadians in a move that was widely seen as retaliation. They were released in 2021 after Meng reached a deferred agreement with prosecutors in New York.</p><p>In Davos, Carney told world leaders that there had been a “rupture in the world order” in a clear reference to Trump, followed by remarks this week to the Canadian House of Commons that “almost nothing was normal now” in the US, according to the CBC.</p><p>Carney also said this week in a call with Trump that Ottawa should continue to diversify its trade deals with countries beyond the US, although it had no plans in place yet for a free-trade agreement with China.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271260\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271260\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271260\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-24T161140Z_1324184165_RC212JA8ZUQ0_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TARIFFS-CANADA-1769601253.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C550&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Carney Beijing\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Canadian PM Carney, left, meets President Xi in Beijing, China, on January 16, 2026 [Sean Kilpatrick/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"filling-the-void\">Filling the void</h2><p>Hanscom Smith, a former US diplomat and senior fellow at Yale’s Jackson School of International Affairs, told Al Jazeera that Beijing’s appeal could be tempered by other factors, however.</p><p>“When the United States becomes more transactional, that creates a vacuum, and it’s not clear the extent to which China or Russia, or any other power, is going to be able to fill the void. It’s not necessarily a zero-sum game,” he told Al Jazeera. “Many countries want to have a good relationship with both the United States and China, and don’t want to choose.”</p><p>One glaring concern with China, despite its offer of more reliable business dealings, is its <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/how-did-chinas-trade-surplus-hit-1-trillion\">massive global trade surplus</a>, which surged to $1.2 trillion last year.</p><p>Much of this was gained in the fallout from Trump’s trade war as China’s manufacturers – facing a slew of tariffs from the US and declining demand at home – expanded their supply chains into places like Southeast Asia and found new markets beyond the US.</p><p>China’s record trade surplus has alarmed some European leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, who, in Davos, called for more foreign direct investment from China but not its “massive excess capacities and distortive practices” in the form of export dumping.</p><p>Li tried to address such concerns head-on in his Davos speech. “We never seek trade surplus; on top of being the world’s factory, we hope to be the world’s market too. However, in many cases, when China wants to buy, others don’t want to sell. Trade issues often become security hurdles,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The ties were normalised in 2014 under former President Barack Obama, in a major foreign policy shift. But Trump, who succeeded Obama, reversed the decision and reimposed sanctions during his first term.</p><p>In 2019, Trump banned cruise ships from visiting Cuba, one of the most popular forms of travel to the island, which earns much-needed revenue from tourism.</p><p>Mexico faces its own pressure from Washington, as Trump has threatened to take military action against Mexican drug cartels. Last week, the country transferred dozens of suspected cartel members to the US amid pressure from the Trump administration.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to power in January last year, the war on drugs has been at the top of his administration’s agenda. The US said its action against Maduro was justified, based on claims that Venezuela sent drugs to the US. But Caracas is not the main source of drugs coming into US territory.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-us-policy-affected-cuba\">How has the US policy affected Cuba?</h2><p>Cuba is enduring its worst economic crisis since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, as fuel shortages have caused prolonged power cuts, water and food supply disruptions.</p><p>Analysts say the Cuban economy could collapse completely as Mexican and Venezuelan oil supplies dry up.</p><p>A total blockade on oil imports to Cuba is part of possible new tactics by the Trump administration to drive leadership change in the Caribbean country, according to the US-based Politico site.</p><p>Al Jazeera could not confirm Politico’s report.</p><p>Rising geopolitical tensions with the US have also driven tourists away from Cuba, with the number of visitors dropping by nearly 70 percent since 2018.</p><p>For decades, tourism – a source of livelihood for millions of Cubans – generated up to $3bn a year for Cuba. Some 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba last year, significantly lower than the 4.8 million in 2018 and the 4.2 million in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p><p>Havana classic car driver Aldama recalled that he would sometimes work until 9pm. Nowadays, he’s lucky if he takes one or two tourists for a spin in a day.</p><p>He used to charge $50 for a drive around the capital. Now, given the lack of demand, he has lowered his price to $25 and even $20 if a tourist insists on bartering.</p><p>“The day that we run out of fuel, we’ll stop driving and look for another job,” Aldama told The Associated Press. “There’s no other choice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose,” he said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The US president added that “hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal – NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS – one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence! As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL!”</p><p>In an apparent reference to <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/6/22/live-us-joins-israels-attacks-on-iran-bombs-three-nuclear-sites\">the US bombing</a> of three of Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, the US president warned that should Tehran fail to agree a deal, the next attack would ‌be “far ‌worse”.</p><p>Trump’s outburst came shortly after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country would not restart negotiations while it is being threatened with an attack.</p><p>Araghchi insisted that Iran has not sought to restart negotiations and would not do so while the threats persist.</p><p>“There was no contact between me and [US envoy Steve] Witkoff in recent days, and no request for negotiations was made from us,” Araghchi told state media.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Our stance is clear: Negotiations don’t go along with threats, and talks can only take place when there are no longer menaces and excessive demands,” he said.</p><p>Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem said that behind the US’s public threats, much was going on behind closed doors as mediators sought to find a solution to the crisis.</p><p>“It seems a lot is going on on the diplomatic side,” he said. “Mediators are trying their best to come up with a solution because the situation right now is really very serious.”</p><p>Publicly, Iran was signalling its readiness to fight, Hashem added, but also its readiness to talk “whenever the negotiations are proper” and not enforced on them through military threat.</p><h2 id=\"show-of-power\">‘Show of power’</h2><p>Wednesday’s tensions came after the Trump administration moved the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/us-military-moves-navy-air-force-assets-to-the-middle-east-what-to-know\">USS Abraham Lincoln</a> aircraft carrier to the region, spurring fears of a military confrontation.</p><p>Adnan Hayajneh, a professor of international relations at Qatar University, said that move was a “show of power” by Washington intended to send a message to Tehran “that if you cannot follow exactly what we want, we will let the missiles fly”.</p><p>He said it remained to be seen whether the US would choose the path of diplomacy or military action but the threats were “the American way of convincing [Iran] to come to the table”.</p><p>Washington wants to put a halt to the Iranian nuclear and missile programmes, which pose a challenge to Israeli hegemony in the region, and is seeking to do so while Tehran is weak domestically, regionally and internationally, Hayajneh said.</p><p>Regarding Iran’s defiant rhetoric in response to the US threats, he said Tehran had struck a similar tone during last year’s war with Israel, in which the US participated.</p><p>“At the end of the day, they did not deliver,” he said. “Israel was controlling the skies.”</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/trump-says-us-still-watching-iran-as-massive-fleet-heads-to-gulf-region\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Trump</a> has repeatedly indicated that he is considering ordering military action in response to Tehran’s crackdown on antigovernment protests this month, raising tension across the region.</p><p>Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister, had said earlier this month that Iran was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/iranian-fm-araghchi-warns-iran-ready-for-war-if-us-wants-to-test-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">ready for war</a> if Washington wanted to “test” it.</p><p>Earlier this week, Iranian President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/iran-president-tells-saudi-crown-prince-that-us-threats-cause-instability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Masoud Pezeshkian</a> hit out against the latest US “threats”, saying they were “aimed at disrupting the security of the region and will achieve nothing other than instability”.</p><p>Nevertheless, speaking to Al Jazeera on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/turkiyes-fm-fidan-says-israel-looking-for-opportunity-to-attack-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Hakan Fidan</a> suggested “Iran is ready to negotiate a nuclear file again”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-nuclear-programme\">Iran nuclear programme</h2><p>In June, as indirect negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme were under way, the US joined Israel in its 12-day war on Iran by bombing three of its main <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/iran-rejects-inspections-of-bombed-nuclear-sites-without-iaea-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">nuclear facilities</a>.</p><p>The bombings killed 430 people and Iranian officials have <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/as-us-armada-approaches-iran-warns-of-dire-consequences-if-attacked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">promised to launch</a> a “comprehensive and regret-inducing response” if attacked again.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly claimed that last year’s US attacks “obliterated” the Iranian nuclear programme, which Western nations and international institutions worry is aimed at developing nuclear weapons.</p><p>However, Tehran insists the programme has strictly civilian purposes and it has the right to carry out the enrichment of uranium.</p><p>The whereabouts of the country’s highly enriched uranium have remained unknown since the June attacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US continues to ramp up the pressure on Iran by focusing its rhetoric on recent antigovernment <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">protests</a>, in which thousands of people are reported to have been killed.</p><p>The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it has confirmed at least 6,221 deaths, including at least 5,858 protesters, and is investigating 12,904 others.</p><p>The United Nations special rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, has said the death toll could reach <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/iran-rejects-un-rights-resolution-condemning-protest-killings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">20,000 or more</a> as reports from doctors inside Iran emerge.</p><p>Iran’s government has put the death toll at 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces and labelling the rest as “terrorists”.</p><p>Al Jazeera has been unable to independently verify the figures.</p><p>Trump has in the past laid down two red lines for launching an attack: the killing of peaceful demonstrators and the possible mass execution of detainees.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"regional-tensions\">Regional tensions</h2><p>The threat of military action has raised tensions across the region. Iran has pledged to retaliate against any US strike with attacks on bases in the region that host US forces.</p><p>Both Tehran and the US Air Force have announced military drills near the Strait of Hormuz while Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has warned that neighbouring countries would be “considered hostile” if their territory is used by the US during any attack.</p><p>In June, Tehran responded to the bombing of its nuclear facilities with an attack on US forces stationed at the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/iran-attacks-us-air-base-in-qatar-what-we-know-so-far\">Al Udeid</a> airbase in Qatar.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which both host US forces, have signalled they will not allow their airspace to be used for any attack.</p><p>The tension has also provoked a diplomatic whirlwind in the region.</p><p>On Wednesday, Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said its top diplomat, Badr Abdelatty, had spoken with Araghchi and Witkoff separately in a bid to “work toward achieving calm, in order to avoid the region slipping into new cycles of instability”.</p><p>However, Hayajneh, the Qatar University professor, said the calls for de-escalation from regional actors were unlikely to play a major role in influencing US decisions on whether it would strike Iran.</p><p>“[Trump] doesn’t really care about regional actors,” he said. “At the end of the day, he listens to himself.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The analysis identifies an area of about 1.3sq km (half a square mile) that has undergone systematic levelling.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"9\">According to the investigation, the operations went beyond mere debris removal and involved the flattening of land previously devastated by Israeli air strikes.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"9\">The cleared zone is located adjacent to two Israeli military posts, suggesting the new camp will be under direct and immediate military supervision. The satellite evidence aligns with reports that the facility is to act as a controlled “holding pen” rather than a humanitarian shelter.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271184\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271184\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271184\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Area-After-26-01-2026-1769599457.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Recent satellite images reveal that Israel has been conducting rubble removal operations in the south of the Gaza Strip, especially in western Rafah.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on full “security control”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"14\">For Palestinians hoping to return to Gaza, this means submitting to what Afifa describes as “human sorting stations”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"15\">“This mechanism is designed to deter return,” Afifa said. “Palestinians will face interrogation, humiliation and the risk of arrest at these Israeli-run checkpoints just to go home.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"16\">By leveraging facial recognition technology confirmed by Avivi, Israel is creating a high-risk ordeal for returnees, he said. Afifa argued it will force many Palestinians to choose exile over the risk of the “sorting station”, serving Israel’s longstanding goal of depopulating the Strip.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4021265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4021265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4021265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/INTERACTIVE-Gaza-map-Israels-withdrawal-in-Trumps-20-point-plan-yellow-line-map-1760017243.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Gaza map Israel’s withdrawal in Trump’s 20-point plan yellow line map-1760017243\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4021265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"permanent-occupation-within-the-yellow-line\">Permanent occupation within the ‘yellow line’</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"18\">The Rafah camp is just one piece of a larger puzzle. Israel in effect occupies all of Gaza with a physical military presence in 58 percent of the Gaza Strip. Its forces directly occupy an area within the “yellow line”, a self-proclaimed Israeli military buffer zone established by an October ceasefire.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"19\">“We are witnessing the re-engineering of Gaza’s geography and demography,” Afifa said. “About 70 percent of the Strip is now under direct Israeli military management.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"20\">This assessment of a permanent foothold is reinforced by Netanyahu’s own remarks to the Knesset on Monday. By declaring that “the next phase is demilitarisation”, or disarming Hamas, rather than reconstruction, Netanyahu signalled that the military occupation has no end date.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"21\">“The talk of ‘reconstruction’ starting in Rafah under Israeli security specifications suggests they are building a permanent security infrastructure, not a sovereign Palestinian state,” Afifa added.</p><h2 id=\"a-show-of-peace\">A ‘show’ of peace</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"23\">For the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza, the hope that the return of the last Israeli captive would bring relief has turned into frustration.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"24\">“There is a deep sense of betrayal,” Afifa said. “The world celebrated the release of one Israeli body as a triumph while two million Palestinians remain hostages in their own land.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"25\">Afifa warned that the international silence regarding these “sorting stations” risks normalising them. If the Rafah model succeeds, it would transform Gaza from a besieged territory into a high-tech prison where the simple act of travel becomes a tool of subjugation, he said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"26\">“Israel is behaving as if it is staying forever,” Afifa concluded. “And the world is watching the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/map-shows-what-would-happen-to-gaza-under-the-us-master-plan\">show</a> of peace while the prison walls are being reinforced.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Major-General Osama Abdel Salam, former director of the Centre for Strategic Studies and Research, argues that the return of civilians naturally enhances security.</p><p>“The filling of abandoned neighbourhoods with residents reduces the risk of negative phenomena, prevents theft and spreads an atmosphere of reassurance,” Abdel Salam explained.</p><p>However, the infrastructure challenge is monumental. Saad El-Din El-Tayeb, spokesperson for Khartoum State, told Al Jazeera that the government has spent more than a year attempting to clear the debris of war.</p><p>“We began by cleaning the cities of bodies and burnt vehicles, restarting water stations, and rehabilitating power distribution lines,” El-Tayeb said.</p><p>He highlighted that Khartoum suffered the “largest looting operation” of its electrical infrastructure in history. Approximately 15,000 electrical transformers were stripped, with looters targeting the copper in underground cables and motors. Despite this, El-Tayeb noted that authorities are diverting available electricity to critical facilities like hospitals and water stations, while encouraging the use of solar energy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"nostalgia-amid-the-ruins\">‘Nostalgia’ amid the ruins</h2><p>For the displaced, the decision to return is often emotional rather than practical. Rimah Hamed, a dentist and journalist, fled Khartoum for Gezira State and later Egypt when hospitals closed and security collapsed.</p><p>She recently returned to her family home in Khartoum. “The primary motivation was nostalgia,” Hamed told Al Jazeera. “The Sudanese character is sentimental. People returned because they missed their homes.”</p><p>Hamed found her neighbourhood transformed. Her house was empty, stripped of essential items, with no running water or electricity.</p><p>“There was only one water source in the neighbourhood where everyone went to fill up,” she recalled. “But gradually, neighbours started coming back. The neighbourhood began to regain its social features, and life returned little by little.”</p><p>Hamed observed that the community had developed a “psychological immunity” to the harsh conditions, adapting to shortages through grassroots initiatives.</p><h2 id=\"prerequisites-for-peace\">Prerequisites for peace</h2><p>While emotional ties drive some to return, sustainable reintegration requires tangible resources. Tom Ndahiro, a Rwandan genocide researcher, suggests that “relative peace” is the baseline requirement – a sense that the situation has improved enough to survive the night.</p><p>Experts interviewed by Al Jazeera outlined a hierarchy of needs for a sustainable return:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> A trusted leadership to organise resettlement and prevent chaos.</li>\n<li><strong>Shelter:</strong> Even temporary structures like tents, provided they offer safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Essentials:</strong> Food security and access to clean water are non-negotiable.</li>\n<li><strong>Power:</strong> Electricity is viewed as the decisive factor for economic stability.</li>\n</ul><p>Rami Mahkar, a journalist, emphasised that security must come first. “Without security, the displaced are forced to move again,” he said, adding that the presence of functioning shops for food and supplies is critical for those trying to rebuild their lives.</p><p>As Sudan attempts to turn the tide on the world’s largest displacement crisis, the durability of this return remains untested. As Hamed noted, the returnees are currently fuelled by resilience and longing, hoping to rebuild what the war has destroyed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Many of those threats have been from strangers, but Omar has also been the repeated target of United States President Donald Trump’s ire.</p><p>And in recent weeks, Trump has extended hostile rhetoric to all <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-plans-crackdown-on-somali-communities-in-minnesota-what-we-know\">Somali Americans</a> and Somalia while his administration has launched its most severe crackdown on immigrants yet in the state of Minnesota, centred on the city of Minneapolis, which Omar represents in the US House of Representatives. In the past three weeks, federal officers have shot dead two US citizens who were protesting against the crackdown, which in turn further inflamed tensions in the state.</p><p>So what happened on Tuesday, and what’s behind Trump’s fixation with Omar, Somalis and Minnesota?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-at-omar-s-event\">What happened at Omar’s event?</h2><p>Omar was attacked in Minneapolis on Tuesday when a man rushed towards the stage during her town hall and sprayed her with an unknown liquid using a syringe, according to police and video footage.</p><p>The incident occurred as Omar was criticising federal immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, singling out the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and the head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p><p>“ICE cannot be reformed. It cannot be rehabilitated. We must abolish ICE for good, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must resign or face impeachment,” Omar said to applause shortly before the attack.</p><p>The man, identified as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak, was sitting in the front row when he stood up and ran towards the podium. Omar took a few steps towards him with her hand raised before he was tackled, restrained by security and arrested.</p><p>In a statement, Omar’s office said she continued the event after the disruption. “During her town hall, an agitator tried to attack the congresswoman by spraying an unknown substance with a syringe,” the statement said. “She continued with her town hall, because she doesn’t let bullies win.”</p><p></p><p>The crowd cheered as the man was pinned to the floor and his hands were tied behind his back. In video footage, someone in the audience can be heard saying, “Oh, my God, he sprayed something on her.”</p><p>Authorities have not publicly identified the substance, but witnesses described a strong, unpleasant odour.</p><p>The incident took place within an hour of Trump, a Republican, mentioning the Democrat during a speech in Iowa.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-ilhan-omar\">Who is Ilhan Omar?</h2><p>Omar came to the US as a child refugee from Somalia.</p><p>She <a href=\"/features/2016/11/15/ilhan-omar-first-female-somali-american-lawmaker\">was born in Mogadishu</a> and her family fled the country in 1991 when Somalia descended into prolonged cycles of clan-based violence, famine and attacks by the armed group al-Shabab, all of which continue to destabilise the Horn of Africa.</p><p>After spending four years in a refugee camp in Kenya, her family was granted resettlement in the US state of Virginia. They later moved to Minneapolis, home to the largest Somali communities in the country.</p><p>Minnesota has an <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-plans-crackdown-on-somali-communities-in-minnesota-what-we-know\">estimated 80,000 people</a> of Somali origin. A majority of them were born in the US. Of those who were born outside the country, 87 percent are naturalised citizens.</p><p>Since November, Trump has repeatedly attacked Somalia and its diaspora while also keeping a focus on Omar.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-targeted-somalis\" data-start=\"118\" data-end=\"172\">How has Trump targeted Somalis?</h2><p>On November 21, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was “immediately” terminating temporary protected status (TPS) for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, referring to a programme designed to provide emergency refuge for people whose countries are in crisis. About 705 Somalis were on that programme.</p><p>Without providing evidence, Trump claimed that “Somali gangs are terrorising the people of that great State” and accused Governor Tim Walz, without proof, of overseeing a state that had become a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.</p><p>“Send them back to where they came from,” Trump said. “It’s OVER!”</p><p>In early December, Trump told reporters that he did not want Somali immigrants in the US, claiming that residents of the East African country “contributed nothing” to the US while relying on aid. Trump did not provide any evidence to support these claims.</p><p>He called Somali immigrants “<a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ilhan-omar-denounces-donald-trump-for-calling-somali-immigrants-garbage\">garbage</a>“.</p><p>His language against Somalis has been widely criticised as racist, including by some members of his Republican Party. But that hasn’t stopped Trump.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in December, he said Somalia “isn’t even a country” and the nation “doesn’t function”.</p><p>At the start of January, the Trump administration froze childcare payments in Minnesota during an investigation into alleged fraud that the president has insisted revolves around benefits for Somali immigrants.</p><p>Trump also took his attacks against Somalis to the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/world-economic-forum-at-davos-2026-dates-location-and-what-to-expect\">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos, Switzerland, where he spoke last week.</p><p>“We’re cracking down on more than $19bn in fraud that was stolen by Somalian bandits,” he said. “Can you believe that? Somalia – they turned out to be higher IQ than we thought. I always say these are low-IQ people. How did they go into Minnesota and steal all that money?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-is-trump-targeting-minnesota-and-why\">How is Trump targeting Minnesota and why?</h2><p>Officially, Trump has justified his administration’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/minnesota-sues-trump-administration-over-immigration-crackdown\">crackdown in Minnesota</a> as aimed at undocumented immigrants whom he has blamed, without evidence, for disproportionately contributing to crime and fraud.</p><p>But even by the standards of ICE operations in multiple cities and states across the country, the nature and duration of the violence unleashed by its officers and the officers of other federal agencies, such as Border Patrol, on the streets of Minnesota appear unmatched, according to several observers.</p><p>On January 7, Renee Nicole Good, a 34-year-old woman, was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis while she was trying to drive her car away from officers. The Trump administration claimed the officer fired in self-defence, but video evidence has raised questions about that account.</p><p>Then, on Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, was shot dead by federal agents while he was helping a woman pushed down on the street by officers. Trump administration officials claimed Pretti had brandished a handgun and was threatening officers, but video footage showed that he did not have a weapon in his hand at the time when he was shot.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On January 13 after Good had been killed, Trump lashed out at Minnesota’s Democratic leadership. While referring to the “GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA” in a Truth Social post, he also issued a blunt warning: “THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION &amp; RECKONING IS COMING.”</p><p>Governor Walz was quick to pick up on Trump’s comments and accuse him of choosing to “punish” the state because it had voted against him in the past three presidential elections.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Illinois, Minnesota is the only Upper Midwestern state that Trump failed to win even once in his three bids for the presidency in 2016, 2020 and 2024. Walz himself was the Democratic Party’s vice presidential candidate in 2024, running against Trump and Vice President JD Vance.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-trump-s-history-of-attacking-ilhan-omar\" data-start=\"118\" data-end=\"172\">What’s Trump’s history of attacking Ilhan Omar?</h2><p id=\"it-goes-back-to-2019\" data-start=\"245\" data-end=\"303\">In April 2019, Trump falsely accused Omar of downplaying the September 11, 2001, attacks.

This follows Pakistan’s August military campaign against Taliban forces in the northwestern Bajaur district, which displaced hundreds of thousands.</p><p>Shafi Jan, a provincial government spokesman, blamed federal authorities via social media for the displaced people’s hardships, accusing the Islamabad government of changing its position regarding military operations.</p><p>Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, from imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party, has opposed military intervention and pledged to prevent a full-scale operation in Tirah.</p><p>Military officials maintain they will continue targeted intelligence operations against Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
