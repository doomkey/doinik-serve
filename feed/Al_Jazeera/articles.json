star Achraf Hakimi is to face trial for rape, ⁠he said in a social media post.</p><p>The Morocco national team player said in a post on X on Tuesday that he denies the allegations.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">“Today, a rape accusation is enough to justify a ‌trial, even though I deny it and everything proves it’s false,” Hakimi said.</p><p class=\"p1\">“This is as unjust to the innocent as it is to the genuine victims. ⁠I calmly await this ⁠trial, which will allow the truth to come out publicly.”</p><p class=\"p1\">The Nanterre prosecutor’s office had <a href=\"/news/2023/3/3/morocco-and-psg-defender-hakimi-charged-with-rape\">opened an investigation in ⁠2023</a> after an allegation of rape was made against ⁠him by a woman.</p><p class=\"p1\">The prosecutor confirmed on ⁠Tuesday that Hakimi’s case had been sent to trial.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hakimi’s lawyer Fanny Colin also said a trial had been ordered.</p><p class=\"p1\">“A trial has been ordered on the basis of an accusation that rests solely on the word of a woman who obstructed all investigations, refused all medical examinations and DNA tests, refused to allow her mobile phone to be examined, and refused to give the name of a key witness,” the AFP news agency quoted Colin as saying.</p><p class=\"p1\">The plaintiff’s lawyer, Rachel-Flore Pardo, said her client was relieved to hear the case was going to court.</p><p class=\"p1\">She said the judiciary had been exemplary in handling the case.</p><p class=\"p1\">But its treatment in general showed “there are still areas where the #MeToo movement has not yet breached the sound barrier, chiefly in men’s football,” AFP quoted her as saying.</p><p class=\"p1\">PSG will face Monaco in Wednesday’s return ‌leg of their Champions League knockout round playoff tie.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hakimi was in the initial ‌squad ‌list published last Tuesday.</p><p class=\"p1\">PSG coach Luis Enrique when asked about Hakimi’s situation at Tuesday’s news conference, said: “This matter is in the hands of the authorities.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The building, hosting dozens of other displaced families, was run by a neighbourhood committee and funded by Sudanese expatriates in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar who wire money monthly to cover rent, food and basic healthcare.</p><p>“We seek to ease the burden on displaced persons and vulnerable groups, while promoting a culture of volunteerism and cooperation among the residents of Kosti,” says Emad Asalaya, a 28-year-old coordinator of the neighbourhood committee known as For Cost.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332009\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332009\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332009\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Photo-01-1771847474.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Volunteers from the \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volunteers from the Kulna Qeem initiative distribute meals inside a temporary shelter in Rabak [Handout/Kulna Qeem]</figcaption></figure><p>Local volunteer groups, such as For Cost, have taken over support for Sudanese displaced by two years of civil war pitting government forces against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that, as of now, have killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.</p><p>Hundreds of such committees have sprung up around the country to provide shelter and food for hundreds of thousands of people since 2023.</p><h2 id=\"humanitarian-donations-dry-up\">Humanitarian donations dry up</h2><p>Kamal said that, before she was forced to leave Kadugli, she had heard that aid agencies were providing food and medicine to displaced people fleeing to safety in cities like Kosti.</p><p>“I felt lost because I had three children with me, and my diabetes medication had run out on the way,” she said. “I was afraid that I would get sick and not be able to take care of my children. At that moment, all I could think about was a safe place to sleep.”</p><p>“In the end, it was the city’s residents and neighbourhood committees who helped us. They shared what they had with us, even though their own circumstances were not easy. If they hadn’t done that, I don’t know how we would have survived.”</p><p>Kamal was one of hundreds of thousands of Sudanese displaced by fighting in South Kordofan and el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, who were able to reach cities already strained by two years of civil war, only to find that international humanitarian infrastructure had largely contracted.</p><p>Almost a year ago, in a March 2025 <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/urgent-appeal-major-donors-reduce-life-saving-funding-amid-sudan-crisis-statement-united-nations-resident-and-humanitarian-coordinator-sudan-clementine-nkweta-salami\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, described sudden cuts by leading Western government donors as “a catastrophic blow” to humanitarian assistance in a country she called “one of the deadliest humanitarian crises of our times”.</p><p>Things have not improved since then.</p><p>The UN said it was forced to cut its 2026 humanitarian appeal to $23bn after steep cuts by Western donors, including the United States. The UN had originally sought $47bn for 2025, but later <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/un-cuts-global-aid-plan-as-funding-plummets\">revised the figure</a> as aid cuts by the new administration in the US, followed by other top Western donors, including Germany, became clear.</p><h2 id=\"local-networks-absorb-what-institutions-cannot\">Local networks absorb what institutions cannot</h2><p>More than half of Sudan’s population is hungry and famine is spreading, according to the UN. The cuts come as displacement continues to push families into Khartoum, Kosti, White Nile capital Rabak, and other urban centres already over capacity.</p><p>Between 300 and 400 families benefit daily from the meals provided by For Cost, according to its estimates. In October 2025, its health awareness campaign reached more than 1,600 girls during a breast cancer awareness drive. Funding comes from private contributions and local partner organisations, a community-assembled line of defence against a gap that international donors have left widening.</p><p>In Rabak, Dwalbit Mohamed, an engineering graduate from the Sudan University of Science and Technology, has led the initiative known as We Are All Values since July 2023, operating charity kitchens at the Qoz al-Salam displacement camp and organising meals for patients at Rabak Teaching Hospital and al-Jasser camp.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332016\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332016\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332016\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Photo-12-1-1771847485.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Volunteers from the \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volunteers from the Min Ajl Kosti initiative assist in a temporary shelter [Handout/Min Ajl Kosti]</figcaption></figure><p>At Qoz al-Salam, Abdullah Muqaddam Toto, a 34-year-old father of five displaced from South Kordofan, lost his livelihood when fighting reached his area. He had worked as a baker.

Initiative coordinators say dozens of families benefit weekly from this arrangement, a system that exists almost entirely outside formal humanitarian infrastructure, in a capital where that infrastructure is nearly absent.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332014\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332014\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332014\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Photo-11-1-1771847482.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Volunteers from the \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volunteers from the Min Ajl Kosti initiative assist in a temporary shelter [Handout/Min Ajl Kosti]</figcaption></figure><p>From Kosti to Rabak to Khartoum, the specific mechanisms change: a converted school, a camp kitchen, an empty apartment, but the dynamic is consistent: local communities absorbing a humanitarian burden that exceeds their resources, sustained by diaspora remittances, private donations, and volunteer labour, with no guarantee of continuity.</p><p>As war continues to reshape Sudan’s population geography, the question these networks face is not whether they can respond to emergencies — they already are — but whether improvised solidarity can hold under the weight of a crisis that international donors, by their own coordinator’s account, have left dangerously underfunded.</p><p>Asalaya warned that when humanitarian support declines, it directly impacts the number of families being served and the quality of the assistance provided.</p><p>“Despite this, we try not to let the displaced feel this shortage because they have come to us in very harsh circumstances, and it is our duty to support them as much as possible,” he said.</p><p> </p><p><em>This piece was published in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.egab.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Egab</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A recent report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates that Russia has had approximately 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 soldier deaths between February 2022 and December 2025 – the highest number of military deaths for any major power in a single conflict since World War II.</p><p>Russia has not reported battlefield deaths since January 2023, when it confirmed losing more than 80 soldiers in a Ukrainian attack, bringing Moscow’s officially acknowledged military deaths to slightly above 6,000.</p><p>For Ukraine, CSIS estimates military casualties between 500,000 and 600,000, including up to 140,000 deaths. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently stated that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died, with many more listed as missing. Neither side releases reliable or timely casualty figures, and independent verification remains unattainable.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission has confirmed more than 15,000 civilian deaths in Ukraine since the invasion began, noting this is likely an underestimate. In excess of 40,600 civilians have been injured during this period.</p><p>At least 763 children have died in the conflict, according to UN data.</p><p>The year 2025 was the deadliest for Ukrainian civilians since 2022, with 2,514 deaths and 12,142 injuries – a 31 percent increase in civilian casualties compared with 2024.</p><p>Approximately 5.3 million Ukrainians have sought refuge in Europe, while another 3.7 million remain internally displaced within Ukraine. The country’s pre-war population exceeded 40 million.</p><p>The physical destruction is catastrophic. Cities such as Bakhmut, Toretsk, and Vovchansk have been reduced to rubble. The World Health Organization has documented more than 2,800 attacks on healthcare facilities since 2022, while Russian strikes on energy infrastructure have left millions without heat and power.</p><p>About one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory is contaminated with mines or unexploded ordnance. According to the World Bank, the reconstruction costs for Ukraine are projected to reach $588bn over the next decade.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At its furthest advance in March 2022, Moscow’s forces occupied roughly 27 percent of Ukrainian territory. That early momentum, however, proved unsustainable.</p><p>In the second half of 2022, Ukraine mounted sweeping <a href=\"/news/longform/2022/10/14/mapping-one-month-of-ukraines-counteroffensive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">counteroffensives</a> that unravelled Russian positions in Kharkiv oblast and forced a withdrawal from Kherson city. By late November, the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, DC, estimated Ukraine had reclaimed approximately 74,000sq km (28,600sq miles), reducing Russian control to about 19 percent of the country.</p><p>From 2023, the conflict became one of attrition centred on the mineral-rich Donbas region. Russian forces took Soledar and Bakhmut after months of brutal combat, and, in 2024, Avdiivka – gains that were secured at extraordinary human and material cost. That same year, Ukraine mounted a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, underscoring that the front line into Russia’s west was not impenetrable.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4333428\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4333428\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4333428\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-DYNAMICS-OF-TRUST-IN-PRESIDENT-ZELENSKYI-FEB15-2026-copy-2_1-1771917329.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - DYNAMICS OF TRUST IN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYI - FEB15, 2026 copy 2_1-1771917329\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4333428\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>By 2025, despite heavy reported losses, Russia had only gained a further <a href=\"/news/2026/1/2/over-400000-russians-killed-wounded-for-0-8-percent-of-ukraine-in-2025\">0.8 percent</a> of Ukraine’s territory, according to Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii. These advances mainly occurred in Donetsk, particularly in the town of Pokrovsk, which saw only 70 metres (77 yards) of Russian advances a day in 2025, according to the Reuters news agency. Pokrovsk was finally captured by Russia in early <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/russia-says-it-captured-pokrovsk-a-key-logistics-hub-in-eastern-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December</a>.</p><p>According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), an independent conflict monitor, the capture of Pokrovsk paved the way for operations in Dnipropetrovsk, resulting in a tripling of violence in the region compared with the year before.</p><p>Moscow’s forces concentrated fighting around the logistical hub of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/russia-claims-to-have-seized-more-than-5100-square-km-of-ukraine-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kostiantynivka</a>, which they entered in December, in a bid to gain control of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – the last major cities under Ukrainian control in Donetsk.

According to ACLED, in 2025, drone-led targeting of civilians became the leading form of attack, dwarfing other media.</p><p>Shelling, artillery and missile attacks initially dominated the conflict, with more than 101,200 events recorded since the war began. While these types of events have decreased as the war has gone on, there has been a rise in air/drone attacks and armed clashes.</p><p>Air and drone attacks rose from 6,000 in 2023 to almost 16,000 in 2024 and more than 29,000 in 2025. The jump reflects Russia’s expanding drone programme.</p><p>Russia is mainly using Shahed-type drones in their attacks. At the start of the war, these low-cost weapons were primarily supplied by Iran. Now, similar drones are produced in Russia, costing between $20,000-50,000 in production. For example, Geran-2, which are Russian analogues of the Iranian missiles, can reach a range up to 2,000km (1,243 miles) depending on the type. According to the ISW, Russia is producing these drones in Tatarstan, a republic about 800km (500 miles) east of Moscow.</p><p>In January, Ukraine’s top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskii, said: “At the moment, the enemy produces daily 404 ‘Shaheds’ (Iranian-designed drones) of different kinds. And the plans are to increase that. The enemy plans to boost production significantly, up to 1,000 drones a day.”</p><p>Ukraine has employed several tactics and weapons to take down or disable drones, including modern air defence systems, mobile fire teams and electronic warfare.</p><p>However, Russia escalated its use of coordinated mass strikes with waves of drone attacks, missiles and decoys used to overwhelm air defences in Ukraine.</p><p>Particularly devastating drone attacks on civilians have landed in densely populated cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/four-killed-in-russian-attacks-in-ukraine-ahead-of-eu-ministers-meeting#:~:text=In%20the%20south%2C%20two%20people,on%20the%20Telegram%20messaging%20app.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Odesa</a>.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"more-than-1-900-attacks-on-energy-infrastructure\">More than 1,900 attacks on energy infrastructure</h2><p>Last month, 16-year-old Taira Sluisarenko’s apartment building in eastern Kyiv was hit by a Russian drone, blowing out windows and buckling walls in the apartments above hers.</p><p>“I was sitting on the toilet floor and right away felt [the explosion] shake us more than usual,” she <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/in-ukraine-deaths-from-hypothermia-rise-as-russia-attacks-energy-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> Al Jazeera.</p><p>A second drone struck the same location and killed Serhiy Smolyak, a 56-year-old emergency medic, and wounded his colleagues. Russia deployed 278 missiles and drones that night, which killed four and injured dozens.</p><p>Days later, with temperatures plunging to -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit), President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared a nationwide state of emergency for the energy sector, stating that Ukraine’s energy system was meeting only 60 percent of the country’s electricity needs.</p><p>Across Ukraine, similar strikes have played out with grim regularity since 2022, falling hardest in winter, when they strip millions of heat, water and power as temperatures plunge double-digits below freezing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to data from ACLED, since the conflict began, Russia has carried out more than 1,900 attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, which, before the war, was one of Europe’s most robust. The majority of attacks have occurred along the front line.</p><p>On January 16, Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal said: “There is not a single power plant left in Ukraine that the enemy has not attacked.”</p><p>Depending on the facility and scale of damage, the time it takes to repair Ukraine’s energy infrastructure ranges from hours or weeks to months or years.</p><p>In September last year, Russia launched yet another campaign of targeted attacks against energy infrastructure in Ukraine in the lead-up to the coldest months. October saw the highest number of attacks with 175 strikes, followed by January with 138 attacks.</p><p>Across the country, generation plants and distribution networks have buckled under the recent assaults, and rolling blackouts have returned.</p><h2 id=\"the-failure-of-peace-talks\">The failure of peace talks</h2><p>In the past four years, there have been more than a dozen rounds of peace talks and summits, other than sporadic direct negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.</p><p>The most intensive period of negotiations came in the first two months of the war, with five rounds of talks held in <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/russia-ukraine-talks-all-the-mediation-efforts-and-where-they-stand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Belarus</a> and Turkiye between late February and late March 2022. The most significant were held on March 29, 2022, in Istanbul, where Ukraine presented a detailed 10-point proposal, including neutrality. The talks collapsed in April following the discovery of mass civilian killings in Bucha, 25km (16 miles) west of Kyiv.</p><p>From mid-2022 until early 2025, diplomatic efforts were dominated by multilateral summits, which excluded Russia. Without Moscow’s participation, none of these summits yielded breakthroughs.</p><p>Direct negotiations resumed in <a href=\"/news/2025/6/3/russia-ukraine-direct-talks-no-ceasefire-but-what-did-they-agree-to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 2025</a>, when Turkiye successfully brought both sides to Istanbul for two rounds of talks, which resulted in a prisoner exchange.</p><p>The most recent developments have been the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/us-has-given-ukraine-and-russia-june-deadline-to-end-war-zelenskyy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump administration</a>’s engagement starting in late January 2026, with envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner facilitating trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi and Geneva. They are the first sustained direct negotiations since Turkiye’s first efforts in 2022. As of yet, there have no breakthroughs on a peace agreement.</p><p>Talks so far have not yielded results, as Russia has demanded it wants control of all of the Donbas region and the denial of NATO membership to Ukraine. But Ukraine has ruled out ceding control of its territory. Kyiv also wants security guarantees as part of any deal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid linked to thousands of deaths in the US.</p><p>Beyond drug trafficking, the group profits from extortion, migrant smuggling, and oil and mineral theft.</p><p data-start=\"605\" data-end=\"641\">It operates across much of Mexico and has built international trafficking routes stretching through Latin America to the US and parts of Asia.</p><p data-start=\"726\" data-end=\"841\">The cartel has also been linked to a series of high-profile attacks against security forces and public officials.</p><p data-start=\"843\" data-end=\"1131\">In 2015, gunmen shot down a Mexican military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade during an operation to capture its leader.</p><p data-start=\"1133\" data-end=\"1466\">In June 2020, the group attempted to assassinate then public security secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch in Mexico City.

It is deliberate and performative, designed to dominate rivals quickly and discourage resistance.</p><p data-start=\"797\" data-end=\"948\">“That was an aberration a generation ago. The CJNG made it almost daily news. And that’s because of the way El Mencho trained his cartel.</p><p data-start=\"1153\" data-end=\"1346\">“He trained them almost like Genghis Khan in their approach to conquest,” Dalby said, referring to the feared Mongol warrior. “They would wipe out opposition and use that as a warning: If you oppose us, this is what will happen to you.”</p><p data-start=\"1348\" data-end=\"1583\">That approach helped the cartel grow quickly across multiple states, but it also meant constant confrontation. Much of its influence rests on mobility, intimidation and strategic alliances rather than deeply rooted territorial control.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331507\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331507\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331507\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-23T022824Z_1735401018_RC2ERJARFBG3_RTRMADP_3_MEXICO-VIOLENCE-DRONE-1771831015.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C428&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mexico fears more violence after army kills Jalisco cartel leader\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4331507\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Smoke billows from burning vehicles in Puerto Vallarta amid a wave of violence, with torched vehicles and gunmen blocking highways in more than half a dozen states [Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-is-next-for-mexico-after-the-killing-of-el-mencho\">What is next for Mexico after the killing of ‘El Mencho’?</h2><p>The death of Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera is one of the most significant blows to a Mexican criminal organisation.</p><p>While experts note the CJNG may now be in a “weaker position”, many warn that “decapitating” the cartel without dismantling its resources is a mistake.</p><p>Critics argue that instead of long-term “financial strangulation”, the government has returned to a strategy that previously failed during the presidency of Felipe Calderon (2006-2012).</p><p>Under Calderon, a hardline military offensive targeted cartel leaders in an effort to dismantle organised crime. But while several senior drug kingpins were captured or killed, the crackdown led to violent fragmentation. Hundreds of thousands were killed or disappeared in the years that followed, yet criminal groups ultimately adapted and continued to expand.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"362\">When the current governing party, Morena, came to power in 2018 under former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, it promised a different approach.

She added that this could last “for months to come and potentially years to come as the criminal landscape is being redesigned”.</p><h2 id=\"will-the-jalisco-cartel-survive\" data-path-to-node=\"9\">Will the Jalisco cartel survive?</h2><p>Yes, in all likelihood, say experts.</p><p>According to Meza, the Mexican government, by killing a leader while the organisation “is still at its peak”, has triggered a cycle of retaliation and internal power struggles.</p><p>This is because the cartel still “has the capacity to set half the country on fire”, and, separately, local rivals could now “test how far they can go to see if the CJNG gives ground”, Dalby explained.</p><p>Ultimately, experts suggest that removing a figurehead does not dismantle the business.</p><p>“El Mencho’s removal is like saying that a company is going to fail because you take out the CEO,” Dalby added.</p><p>“Not at all. The flow of drugs is going to continue … and there are going to be plenty of pretenders to the throne.

far-right activist.</p><p>The French Foreign Ministry announced the decision on Monday, as diplomatic relations between Paris and Washington continue to deteriorate amid several disagreements, including on trade tariffs, the war in Ukraine and the role of Europe in countering Russia.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span

ambassadorial mission and the honour of representing one’s country, the minister (Jean-Noel Barrot) has requested that he (Ambassador Kushner) no longer be allowed direct access to members of the French government,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p><p>The US ambassador can continue his diplomatic duties and have “exchanges” with officials, the ministry added.</p><p>Foreign Minister Barrot summoned Kushner after the US embassy in Paris reposted on Sunday comments by the Trump administration in Washington about the death of far-right activist <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/france-arrests-nine-over-killing-of-far-right-activist-quentin-deranque\">Quentin Deranque</a>, 23, who was beaten to death in a fight with alleged far-left activists, in an incident that shocked France.</p><p>Instead of personally answering Barrot’s summons, Kushner sent a senior official from the embassy in his place, citing personal commitments, the AFP news agency reported, quoting a diplomatic source.</p><p class=\"p1\">Speaking Tuesday, Barrot described the failure to attend as “a surprise” that flew in the face of diplomatic protocol and will dent Kushner’s ability to serve as an ambassador.</p><p>“We must have an explanation with him,” Barrot said, speaking to public broadcaster France Info. “We don’t accept that foreign countries can come and interfere, invite themselves, into the national political debate.”</p><p>“When these explanations have taken place, then the US ambassador in France will, naturally, regain access to members of the French government,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It was not the first time that the ambassador had refused a summons issued by the French Foreign Ministry.</p><p>In August 2025, Kushner was also called to the ministry after the French government took exception to his criticism that French President Emmanuel Macron was not tackling anti-Semitism.</p><p>The US charge d’affaires attended that meeting instead of Kushner.</p><p>The US embassy in Paris and the US Department of State have yet to comment on the measures imposed on the ambassador.</p><p>Kushner’s refusal to meet the minister made the front pages of French newspapers on Tuesday, the France 24 news outlet reported, with headlines declaring “tensions are running high” between the ministry and the US embassy.</p><h3>‘We have no lessons to learn’</h3><p>Kushner, the father of US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been a lightning rod of controversy in the US.</p><p>He had previously been stripped of his licence as a lawyer after being convicted and jailed for two years for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering.</p><p>He was later pardoned by Trump.</p><p>The original posts on social media that angered the French government, and were later shared by the US embassy, were made by the US State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism, saying the killing of Deranque “should concern us all”.</p><p>The post further warned against the rise of “violent radical leftism” in France and its role in Deranque’s death, saying it “demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety”.</p><p>“We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice,” it added.</p><p>Barrot reacted angrily to the US administration’s comments, saying France did not need a lecture.</p><p>“We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement,” he said, as he announced that he was summoning Kushner for a meeting on Monday.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/macron-and-meloni-clash-over-killing-of-french-far-right-activist-in-lyon\">Italy’s Prime

countries”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

If the Israeli people can do it, we can also do it,” Chakravorty told the gathering, adding that the Modi government was “determined” to do so.</p><p>Six years later, Chakravorty’s words ring truer than ever. As Modi prepares for his second visit to Israel starting on February 25, the two countries are bound by more than just friendship, trade and military partnerships – they are increasingly, say some analysts, also joined at the hip in certain facets of their models of governance.</p><p>Under Modi, India has openly embraced Israel – at the <a href=\"/features/2026/2/23/how-modi-broke-down-walls-between-india-israel-at-palestines\">expense</a> of its longstanding support for the Palestinian cause, say analysts. But New Delhi, they add, also appears to have imported multiple elements of Israel’s security and administrative approach to Palestinians, and unleashed them into its domestic policies since Modi took power in 2014.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-17T084945Z_766476451_RC1AE9AD5D10_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771863278.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi Israel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu writes a message in the visitors’ book as his wife Sara and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi look on, during a visit to Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad, India, January 17, 2018 [Amit Dave/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hostile-subjects-under-occupation\">‘Hostile subjects under occupation’</h2><p>At the heart of these deepening ties, say analysts, is a shared ideological vision.</p><p>Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has roots in a philosophy, Hindutva, that seeks to turn India into a Hindu nation and a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – similar to Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland.</p><p>“The India-Israel relationship under Modi is a bond between two ideologies that see themselves as civilisational projects and Muslims as demographic and security threats,” said Azad Essa, author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel.</p><p>“The friendship works because they have similar supremacist ends,” Essa told Al Jazeera. “Under Modi, India and Israel became strategic partners, and Delhi began to see Israel as a template and as key to India’s move toward becoming a great power.”</p><p>One of the most apparent examples of India borrowing from Israel is the so-called “bulldozer justice” policy of Modi’s party.</p><p>Over the past decade, authorities in several BJP-ruled states have demolished the homes and shops of hundreds of Muslims and also razed multiple mosques. These demolitions have been carried out, for the most part, without legal notices being issued to occupants or owners of the establishments. They have usually followed religious tensions in the particular neighbourhood, or protests against Modi government policies – and sometimes, after just a local argument that had taken on religious overtones.</p><p>One of the BJP’s top leaders, Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, is now known by his supporters as “Bulldozer Baba” (Daddy Bulldozer).</p><p>It’s a leaf straight out of Israel’s playbook. Israel has demolished thousands of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and displaced their residents, making way for illegal Israeli settlements. And during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, almost all of the Palestinian territory’s homes, offices, hospitals, schools, universities and places of worship have been destroyed or badly damaged.</p><p>“The Hindu nationalist belief system is steeped in affinity for Zionism and Israel,” said Sumantra Bose, a political scientist whose work focuses on the intersection of nationalism and conflict in South Asia. “Generations of [Rashtriya SwayamSevak Sangh, the ideological fountainhead of the BJP] cadres, Modi included, have been indoctrinated in this ideology and have imbibed the love of Israel.”</p><p>The nation-state of Israel, which Bose characterised as majoritarian and supremacist, is the model Hindu nationalists are implementing in India in the Modi era, he argued. “The Israeli ideal finds reflection in many policies and measures of Modi’s government.”</p><p>Muslims in India have faced a range of social boycotts in recent years. It is increasingly difficult to rent a home, Muslim children often face bullying and harassment at school, and the community has mostly fled a number of villages after attacks.</p><p>In November 2024, India’s top court ruled that government authorities cannot demolish any property – even if belonging to people accused of a crime – without following due legal process. However, on the ground, such demolitions continue.</p><p>Essa, the author of Hostile Homelands, said both India and Israel use the bulldozing of homes and properties “to target and punish certain populations and underscore a political message to communities, including who may belong to the nation and who is an outsider”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332439\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332439\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332439\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-15T083553Z_1879430900_RC1CE343E010_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771863248.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C508&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi ISrael\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332439\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu adjusts his headphones as he and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi attend a signing of agreements ceremony at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, January 15, 2018 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"overarching-shadows-of-security-doctrine\">Overarching shadows of security doctrine</h2><p>At the forefront of India-Israel bilateral ties are their defence relations and an overlapping security doctrine. India is the largest buyer of Israeli weapons, pumping in billions of dollars in purchases.</p><p>India has also supplied weapons to Israel amid its ongoing genocidal war on Gaza. Israel has provided joint training sessions for Indian soldiers with the Israeli army, alongside a wide array of Israeli systems, including UAVs, air defence systems, and advanced radar and surveillance technology.</p><p>But among advocates of a deeply securitised Indian state, Israel has long had an appeal that extends far beyond its supply of advanced weapons.</p><p>After gunmen killed 26 civilians in the tourist town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22, 2025, India bombed multiple locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, accusing Islamabad of being behind the attack on tourists.</p><p>Pakistan, which denied any role, hit back, firing missiles and drones as the nuclear-armed neighbours engaged in an intense four-day air war.</p><p>During that period, debates and shows on several Indian TV news channels were rife with references to Israel after the attack in Kashmir. Arnab Goswami, an anchor, stated: “22 April is to India what 7 October was to the Israelis,” referring to the day when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel in 2023. A guest on the programme said, “We demand we turn Pakistan into Gaza.”</p><p>A retired top policeman, who was posted in Indian-administered Kashmir, told a Hindi newspaper that “we must respond like Israel.”</p><p>Among Israel’s most controversial security exports to India is the sophisticated spyware, Pegasus, made by the Israeli software firm NSO Group.</p><p>Siddharth Varadarajan, cofounder of The Wire, a nonprofit news website publishing from New Delhi, was one of the journalists targeted by the spyware that an Israeli firm reportedly sold to the Modi government under an undisclosed defence deal.</p><p>“[The Israeli spyware] turns an iPhone into a personal spying device,” Varadarajan told Al Jazeera, recounting his experience, adding that it could secretly record and transmit video and photographs.</p><p>“This Israeli model of using spyware to keep an eye on any possible arena of opposition or criticism is something that the Modi government has adopted and embraced wholeheartedly,” he said.</p><p>India’s Supreme Court appointed an expert committee, which found malware in some phones but said it could not conclusively attribute it to Pegasus, citing limited cooperation from the Modi government.</p><p>Varadarajan said that even if some repressive ideas are not exclusively Israeli, the Indian government has been “a happy adopter”. India ranks at the top among democracies that impose internet restrictions, and the country has slid in multiple democracy indices in recent years.</p><p>Referring to the overlapping patterns in India and Israel’s policies, Varadarajan said, “It is a great pity that methods that the Israelis use against occupied people are being used by the Modi government against its own citizens.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4299762\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4299762\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299762\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-08T163436Z_723218502_RC2P7JA6BDJI_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-1770628461.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"West Bank\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4299762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Palestinian woman ushers her children away from a group of Israeli soldiers during a weekly settlers’ tour in Hebron, in the Israeli‑occupied West Bank, January 24, 2026 [Mussa Qawasma/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"treat-populations-like-external-threats\">‘Treat populations like external threats’</h2><p>To be sure, India has long battled a series of internal security challenges of its own, as it has tried to unify and hold together a large and diverse landmass: Separatist movements have ranged from its northeast to Kashmir. In 1966, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered helicopter gunships to bomb parts of the northeastern state of Mizoram to quell a rebel movement.</p><p>Other regions, especially India’s deep south, have long worried about the Hindi-speaking north trying to dominate them culturally – this has led to sporadic tussles over language and resources.</p><p>But amid all of that, “what Israel has done is help provide India with the technology and expertise to become more oppressive, authoritarian, and militarised, like Israel,” Essa told Al Jazeera. “And these methods are all-encompassing: They treat populations as external threats.”</p><p>Nowhere is that clearer than in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>One of the world’s most militarised zones, Kashmir has since August 2019 been stripped of not just its earlier semi-autonomous status, but of most democratic power – as a region – that other provincial authorities have. The Modi government’s move to kill political dialogue or diplomatic engagement when it comes to Kashmir also mirrors Israel’s approach, said Bose, also a professor of international politics at Krea University, in India.</p><p>“It echoes Netanyahu’s approach of rejection and non-engagement with the Palestinians and the exclusive reliance on military power,” he added.</p><p>To be sure, Kashmir and Palestine have a very distinct past and present. Still, India’s approach to Kashmir increasingly carries parallels with Israel’s treatment of the West Bank, said Essa.</p><p>“There is the militarisation, population management, and the legal regimes that allow both India and Israel to conduct their occupations and maintain daily control over the people – from checkpoints to raids and communication blackouts,” Essa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Like the occupied West Bank, India maintains Kashmir in a state of almost permanent emergency, where military presence, surveillance, and extraordinary legal powers shape everyday life,” he argued. “And like the West Bank, daily governance in Kashmir is outsourced to local administrators with limited real power.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
