But in January 2024, after the ELSC stepped in, the police dropped the student’s caution and deleted all associated records. The university confirmed in March that there would be no further disciplinary action.</p><p>ELSC said “Zionist advocacy” groups, journalists and media outlets were involved in 138 incidents – including UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), a pro-Israel organisation that it said played a part in 29 of the documented cases.</p><p>“The goal of this analysis is to denaturalise this politically produced process,” the group said. “This strategic targeting across sectors represents a kind of division of repressive labour. It aims to dismantle solidarity at every stage, from the formation of political consciousness in universities and schools, to its expression in culture, to its organisation in public spaces.”</p><p>Another incident involved a football club’s kit manager who was dismissed after posting his views about Israel’s conduct on social media.</p><p>The case of <a href=\"/news/2024/5/10/uk-government-revokes-visa-of-palestinian-student\">Dana Abuqamar</a>, a University of Manchester student, is also analysed in the database. The Home Office revoked her visa after she told Sky News that, after 16 years of Israel’s blockade of Gaza, “We are both in fear (of) how Israel will retaliate … but also we are full of pride.”</p><p>She later clarified that her comments were not in support of the October 7 attacks into southern Israel, during which more than 1,000 people were killed. The UKLFI reported her to the police and her university, but in 2024, she won a human rights appeal.</p><p>“The main immediate goal of this anti-Palestinian repression is to depoliticise the movement, to make it seem as though it’s not a legitimate political and ethical struggle, but rather a security problem, a problem of so-called anti-Semitism or a breach of compliance,” ELSC’s Abdelhamid said.“I don’t think that has succeeded … two years on we still see people resisting the repression happening in Britain [and] speaking up and acting for Palestine and against the genocide.”</p><p>Since Israel’s onslaught on Gaza began in October 2023, tens of thousands of Britons have rallied in support of Palestine.</p><p>According to YouGov, one in three Britons have “no sympathy at all for the Israeli side in the conflict” after Israel killed more than 70,000 people in two years and decimated the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The government, led by Labour leader Keir Starmer, has long been accused of cracking down on pro-Palestine solidarity because of a wave of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/uk-police-arrest-four-people-for-pro-palestine-intifada-calls\">arrests</a> during demonstrations and due to its proscription of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/palestine-action-cofounder-ammori-after-high-court-win-uk-ban-backfired\">Palestine Action</a> as a “terror” organisation – a ruling <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/uk-decision-to-ban-palestine-action-as-terror-group-unlawful-court-says\">recently deemed unlawful</a> by the High Court.</p><p>In January, Human Rights Watch said that its research found a “disproportionate targeting of certain groups, including climate change activists and Palestine protesters, undermining the right to protest freely and without fear of harassment”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Historically, Ethiopian Jews suffered religious persecution, and after Israel’s formation, it sought their emigration under its <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/how-israel-used-discriminatory-laws-to-strip-palestinians-of-citizenship\">Law of Return</a> policy. Between the late 1970s and mid-1990s, tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews were <a href=\"/video/al-jazeera-world/2025/1/28/ethiopia-to-israel-secret-journeys\">covertly transported to Israel</a> – during a time when several African countries, including Ethiopia, had cut off ties with Israel over the 1973 Yom Kippur War and its invasion of Egypt.<b> </b>On the cusp of a civil war in Ethiopia in 1991, Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, launched a daring operation that airlifted 14,000 Ethiopians over the course of just two days.</p><p>About 160,000 Ethiopian Jews now live in Israel. Many within the community have struggled to integrate and have complained of <a href=\"/opinions/2015/5/4/ethiopian-jews-not-jewish-enough\">discrimination</a> and racism. In 2019, tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews flooded the streets in <a href=\"/news/2019/9/15/israels-ethiopian-community-denounces-racism-ahead-of-election\">protest</a> across Israeli cities after a 19-year-old of Ethiopian origin was shot dead by the police.</p><p>Ethiopia-Israel state relations have, meanwhile, remained steady. In 2016, when Netanyahu visited the country in his first prime ministerial visit – Addis Ababa became one of the first African countries to voice support for Israel’s long-sought observer status at the AU. Fierce opposition from South Africa, Algeria and other countries supporting Palestine delayed the process until 2021. Later, in 2023, the AU confirmed it had <a href=\"/news/2023/2/20/african-union-says-israels-observer-status-suspended\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">withdrawn</a> the status.</p><p>Mashav, Israel’s aid agency, has, in the past decade, provided aid to Ethiopia in the form of agriculture and water cooperation projects, although Addis Ababa receives much more significant funding from wealthier partners like China. When Israel sponsored several African journalists on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/h23oLcWcoLI?si=BLS2cxvRQcpbmoA6\">media trips</a> to the country last year, Ethiopia was among the countries it invited journalists from.</p><p>More recently, both countries are bound by their support for Somaliland, which Somalia claims as part of its territory and which Israel sees as critical to its own national security, Hargeisa-based analyst Moustafa Ahmad told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In December, Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/israel-becomes-first-country-to-recognise-somaliland\">recognised</a> Somaliland’s statehood, becoming the first country to do so. Months before, there were unconfirmed talks about plans to move displaced <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/somaliland-recognition-for-forced-transfer-of-palestinians-not-worth-it\">Palestinians</a> to Somaliland or to South Sudan, another key Israeli ally in the region. Analysts speculate that countries like South Sudan and the United Arab Emirates, another close friend of Israel, may also recognise Somaliland.</p><p>Israel’s focus on the Horn of Africa intensified after a late 2024 report from a United Nations expert panel, which found that the Somalia-based armed group, al-Shabab, was actively collaborating with Yemen’s Houthis. Where the Houthis were providing weapons and drone training, al-Shabab was, in return, granting access to a smuggling corridor stretching along the Somali coast and connecting to the Gulf of Aden, where Iranian weapons could be smuggled into Yemen.</p><p>The move to recognise Somaliland was therefore meant to disrupt that cooperation by stationing an Israeli naval base in the region, analysts note.</p><p>“It’s part of their calculations even if they haven’t said it publicly,” Ahmad said.</p><p>Several countries, as well as the AU, have pushed back on Israel’s recognition of Somaliland, calling it a violation of Somalia’s sovereignty. In Somaliland, however, many have celebrated the move.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3381204\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3381204\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3381204\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-12-11T212840Z_625569935_RC29NBA901WI_RTRMADP_3_SOMALIA-SECURITY-ETHIOPIA-TURKEY-1733973766.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C543&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan poses with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed following a press conference in Ankara, Turkey, December 11, 2024.

Although massive and rapidly industrialising, Ethiopia is landlocked, having lost its sea access after Eritrea seceded in 1993. Prime Minister Abiy has often said <a href=\"/features/2026/2/18/fears-of-slow-certain-death-stalk-tigray-amid-rumblings-of-renewed-war\">sea access</a> is critical for his country.</p><p>The fall-out between Ethiopia and Somalia was so severe that analysts sounded the alarm over possible armed conflict between the two neighbours until Turkiye, a key development partner for Mogadishu, stepped in to smooth things over by pressuring Addis Ababa to coordinate with Mogadishu instead.</p><p>It is likely, analysts say, that Israel is now hoping to push Ethiopia further towards recognising Somaliland, which boasts a 850km (528-mile) coastline. In Hargeisa, many are disappointed after more countries failed to follow Israel’s steps, Ahmad said.</p><p>Addis Ababa, though, might not appreciate further pressure at the moment as it faces increasing regional isolation on several fronts.</p><p>One key reason is the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (<a href=\"/features/2025/9/9/from-haile-selassie-to-crowdfunding-how-ethiopias-gerd-dam-was-born\">GERD</a>), which Egypt and Sudan say is blocking the water supply they need for irrigation.</p><p>A source of national pride for Ethiopians, the dam was funded almost entirely through citizens’ donations and government funds. Israeli engineers participated in the project, and Israel reportedly sold weapons to Ethiopia to protect the dam amid tensions with its neighbours, although the Israeli government denies this.</p><p>At the same time, Addis Ababa is also facing <a href=\"/features/2026/2/18/fears-of-slow-certain-death-stalk-tigray-amid-rumblings-of-renewed-war\">tensions with Eritrea</a>, which has moved closer to Somalia and Egypt. Both countries have historically feuded, and recently, tensions have again risen over the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/25/why-ethiopias-tigray-could-be-on-the-brink-of-another-conflict\">2020 Tigray War</a> and Abiy’s repeated statements about his country needing access to the sea.</p><p>“Addis Ababa is cautious of making a decision that will cement its regional isolation at this time [because] it is clearly hedging among various actors seeking to influence the Horn of Africa and Red Sea region,” Ahmad said.</p><p>Pressure is also mounting on Addis Ababa from countries eager to keep the status quo.</p><p>On Sunday, Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Ethiopia and said in his speech: “I would like to emphasise that Israel’s recognition of Somaliland does not benefit Somaliland or the Horn of Africa.”</p><p>His statement drew a backlash from Hargeisa, which called it “unacceptable interference” aimed at wrecking relations between Somaliland and its partners.</p><p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which is embroiled in an <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/31/saudi-uae-fallout-and-its-impact-on-yemens-recognised-government\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ongoing rift </a>with the United Arab Emirates over how to deal with the conflict in Yemen, also intervened in the fray in February. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Waleed Elkhereiji was in Addis Ababa this week to discuss “regional peace”, just two weeks after Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud arrived in the city for talks with Abiy.</p><p>So far, it is unclear if Riyadh has recorded any success in influencing Addis Ababa.</p><p>How Israel will fare in that regard is also still unclear.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He preserved his foothold in financial circles and rebuilt his relationships among billionaires and senior bankers.</p><p>Al Jazeera has reviewed the latest documents published by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on January 30, 2026, gathered during federal investigations into Epstein. The files shed new light on how, despite his conviction, he remained embedded within elite financial networks for years. Epstein was later charged in 2019 with sex trafficking involving minors before his death by suicide in federal custody.</p><p>The records show that, between 2008 and 2019, Epstein’s survival depended on something less visible, a banking system that continued to process his money and a network of willing financiers. As long as this remained, the gates to power did not close. And in return, Epstein offered a different kind of access.</p><h2 id=\"jes-staley-the-banker-who-kept-the-doors-open\">Jes Staley: The banker who kept the doors open</h2><p data-start=\"179\" data-end=\"389\">Epstein and Staley had a longstanding relationship dating back to Staley’s time at JPMorgan Chase in the early 2000s, and their contact continued well after Epstein’s 2008 conviction.</p><p data-start=\"179\" data-end=\"389\">In JPMorgan’s third-party complaint against Staley, drawing on allegations by the US Virgin Islands (USVI), it states that he visited Epstein’s Palm Beach residence in January 2009 while Epstein was serving his sentence after pleading guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution.</p><p data-start=\"391\" data-end=\"798\">According to the filing, that visit “corresponded with Epstein wiring $2,000 to a woman with an Eastern European surname”.</p><p data-start=\"800\" data-end=\"1149\">The USVI further alleges that, in late August 2009, after Staley emailed Epstein to say he would be in London the following week, the latter asked whether he would “need anything” during the trip.</p><p data-start=\"800\" data-end=\"1149\">Staley allegedly replied, “Yep.” The complaint states that on August 31, 2009, Epstein wired $3,000 to the same woman.</p><p>Meanwhile, the latest files reviewed by Al Jazeera show further sustained communication between the two men after Epstein had become a registered sex offender.</p><p>Emails disclosed in litigation reveal exchanges that were personal in tone and, at times, suggestive.</p><p>In July 2010, Epstein asked Staley, “What character would you like next?” after referencing “Snow White”. Staley replied: “Beauty and the Beast.” The exchange later featured prominently in regulatory scrutiny of their relationship.</p><p>Another email sent to Epstein by an unnamed individual the same day stated that “the snow white was f***** twice as soon as she put her costume [on]”.</p><p>At this time, Epstein remained a lucrative client for JPMorgan. His accounts reportedly held more than $200m and generated significant revenue for the bank. According to The New York Times, Staley acted as one of Epstein’s strongest internal advocates, becoming his “chief defender”.</p><p>Internal emails cited in the report show executives debating whether Epstein was an honourable person and whether the relationship should continue. Staley, however, insisted that the relationship was safe.</p><p>JPMorgan ultimately severed ties with Epstein in 2013.</p><p>The closeness of the relationship later became central to regulatory action in the United Kingdom. Correspondence between Barclays and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) claimed Staley had ceased contact with Epstein well before joining Barclays.</p><p>However, the FCA found that Staley had remained in contact with Epstein in the days leading up to the announcement of his appointment as chief executive in October 2015. In 2023, the <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-decides-fine-ban-james-staley?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FCA</a> fined and banned him from holding senior roles in financial services, concluding he had been “reckless” in his representations about the nature of the relationship.</p><p>The practical consequence of those earlier decisions was significant. As long as Epstein remained banked by a global financial institution, he retained the infrastructure required to operate, move funds, manage accounts and present himself as a legitimate financier.</p><h2 id=\"leon-black-the-billionaire-who-kept-paying\">Leon Black: The billionaire who kept paying</h2><p>If banks provided Epstein with the tools to access money, billionaires provided Epstein with legitimacy in elite circles.</p><p>Leon Black, cofounder of Apollo Global Management, reportedly paid Jeffrey Epstein $158m between 2012 and 2017 for tax and estate planning advice, according to an independent review conducted by the law firm Dechert and commissioned by Apollo.</p><p>The payments came years after Epstein had pleaded guilty in Florida and registered as a sex offender.</p><p>Court documents released in subsequent investigations also contain allegations from a woman who told prosecutors that Epstein asked her to massage both Black and Jes Staley, and that sexual contact occurred during those encounters. Black has denied wrongdoing.</p><p>In 2021, Guzel Ganieva publicly accused Black of sexual abuse and coercion, alleging that he introduced her to Epstein and attempted to pressure her into sexual contact with him.</p><p>Black responded that he had engaged in a consensual relationship with Ganieva, denied any coercion and rejected the allegation that he sought to force her to have sex with Epstein.</p><p>Litigation followed, with claims and counterclaims filed in New York courts. In 2023, Ganieva’s lawsuit was dismissed. Black has consistently denied wrongdoing.</p><p>New documents viewed by Al Jazeera, contained within the DOJ files, shed light on how disputes within this circle were managed.</p><p>The file is a draft transcript of a secretly recorded meeting on August 14, 2015 at Le Bernardin in New York between Black (identified as “JD”) and Ganieva.</p><p>In the transcript, Black confronts Ganieva over what he describes as a $100m demand. He outlines what he calls “three different directions” the dispute could take. He proposes what he describes as a “15 million dollar package”, including “a million dollars a year for 12 years” and an additional 2 million pounds ($2.7m at the current exchange rate) to be invested for UK residency purposes.</p><p>If she goes public, he warns, “you could end up with nothing … and will probably land you in jail”. At one point, he states, “But this is total extortion.”</p><p>Other filings and reporting indicate that Epstein advised Black during this period, helping to arrange meetings and suggesting surveillance as the dispute escalated, offering a glimpse into how Epstein operated within a network where he was trusted in moments of personal and financial vulnerability.</p><p>The professional relationship between Black and Epstein endured for years after 2008, with public reporting indicating they remained in contact until shortly before Epstein’s arrest in 2019.</p><h2 id=\"deutsche-bank-the-slow-retreat\">Deutsche Bank: The slow retreat</h2><p>After JPMorgan ended its relationship with Epstein in 2013, Deutsche Bank became his primary banker.</p><p>According to reporting by The New York Times, payments from Leon Black to Epstein continued to flow through accounts at Deutsche Bank. At least one transfer was reportedly flagged internally as unusual, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>In 2020, New York’s Department of Financial Services fined Deutsche Bank $150m for compliance failures related to its handling of Epstein and other high-risk clients.</p><p>Regulators found the bank had processed millions of dollars in suspicious transactions, including payments to individuals described as young women, without filing required suspicious activity reports in a timely manner.</p><p>Deutsche Bank acknowledged shortcomings in its controls and said it had strengthened its compliance systems.</p><p>Epstein remained a client until 2018, a decade after his conviction. By the time Deutsche Bank terminated the relationship, Epstein had been a registered sex offender for 10 years.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_699ed26b2b879-1772016235.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As court documents tied to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein continue to surface, the scandal has become an international embarrassment, exposing how quickly powerful men can turn into reputational liabilities. That discomfort reached New Delhi, where Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates was expected to deliver the keynote address at the AI Impact Summit but ultimately did not attend amid criticism and apparent unease within the Modi government over his past meetings with Epstein. The spectacle was revealing. Public moral outrage travels swiftly when scandal threatens reputations and diplomatic optics. Yet that sensitivity to association sits uneasily beside a domestic reality in which sexual violence against women unfolds with brutal regularity, drawing neither comparable embarrassment nor consequence. The contrast is grotesque. A political culture capable of signalling discomfort towards a global scandal remains strikingly untroubled by the everyday brutality faced by women at home.</p><p>Under the Modi administration, the news cycle churns with reports of gang rapes like factory output — steady, relentless, and numbing in repetition. The rapes have become so common that they are reported like the weather. Heatwave deaths. Flash flood. Five-year-old abducted, raped, murdered. And like the weather, only God is responsible. Not the rapist. Not the court. Not the police. Definitely not the prime minister.</p><p>Between the time this piece was commissioned and published, a five-year-old was gang-raped in Meerut, a 26-year-old was gang-raped in Faridabad, and a 17-year-old was gang-raped in Odisha. A 42-year-old was gang-raped in Delhi’s suburbs. A 12-year-old girl was kidnapped and gang-raped in Bikaner. There were more gang rapes in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, and Kanpur. I could give you statistics, but numbers could never convey the larger, all-encompassing terror of living with predators. The threat of sexual violence is as constant as gravity. The cases are gruesome — intestines pulled out, rods inserted, tongues cut out, acid thrown, decapitation, strangulation, and burning. When I look at government data about rape — an average of 86 women are raped every day — it feels as grisly as stumbling upon a mass grave in Excel sheets.</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his home minister, Amit Shah, ostensibly obsessed with restoring law and order at any cost, seem entirely unconcerned that India is the gang rape capital of the world on their watch.</p><p>The most alarming instance of this was when convicted rapist and Bharatiya Janata Party politician Kuldeep Singh Sengar, found guilty of raping a minor in 2017 and a native of Makhi village in Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh, was granted bail by a high court, raising the possibility of his reintegration into the very social and political landscape that had once enabled his impunity. A high court granted him bail in December. Thankfully, it was stayed by the Supreme Court, but only after infuriated women gathered in Delhi to protest. Sengar had raped a teenager, who was also gang-raped by his associates. Her father was murdered in police custody. A case was registered only after she threatened to burn herself in front of the chief minister’s residence. Her tragic story showcases how Indian men, like the Modi administration, remain remarkably unembarrassed about the state of affairs.</p><p>Sadly, this is not an aberration; it is the system speaking in its mother tongue.</p><p>Public memory matters because each new case unfolds against the residue of the ones we were told would change everything. In 2012, I read about the “Nirbhaya” gang rape three days after the incident, on my way from the airport. I had been deliberately avoiding the news until she ended up at Safdarjung Hospital, and my editor needed a health update from me. After I learned all the details of what men had done to this young woman, I thought the world would stand still. A threshold had been crossed. Something told me the world would start anew. There were protests, and people everywhere would know her name, and something like this would never happen again.</p><p>All of my naivety was drowned in a chorus of “Not All Men”, as the gang rape was turned into something viral to hang a hashtag on. The refrain did not defend innocence so much as redirect attention away from accountability and back towards male comfort.</p><p>It is impossible for me to hear of such cases and not think: What if it were me? My body. That rod. Those men. The suffering and mutilation of women’s bodies is so reliable that there is now a market to help ease our fear. Security apps. Pepper sprays and wearable panic alarms. Every time I write about this subject, I sit with the absolute inadequacy of the written word in the face of men who film the rapes, brag about them, and get rehabilitated nevertheless.</p><p>It wouldn’t be out of place to call this moment unprecedented, but it is beyond that. It is existential. Whether it is the United States or India, women are watching the same choreography of power protecting itself, as men of consequence close ranks and wait out the storm. The similarity lies not in scale or context, but in the recurring spectacle of institutions cushioning powerful men while survivors fight alone. For a while now, both countries — allegedly the biggest and the oldest democracies — have been on a trajectory of self-destruction, with men leading the way. Under Modi as well as Trump, rape has become an extension of politics. Women are violated no longer by men alone, but by courts, hospitals, and newsrooms, too. It is the age of monsters. It did not begin with Epstein, Gates, or Sengar, of course, but they are the symbols of it.</p><p>While the middle class was busy buying into the dream of upward mobility, careerism, and two bedrooms in a gated suburb, we let thugs cultivate a wholesale misogynist empire that runs on hate for women. I do not know what to do with the rage I feel. What do you do when you are constantly told that your body, your people, your gender are disposable? I don’t know.</p><p>What I do know is that the teenager who survived Sengar is still fighting for justice. I know that the survivors of Epstein’s sex trafficking network are fighting for justice, too. These women are fighting with heart and soul and sweat and muscle. I know that I have no right to be despondent while they stand tall, looking every inch the hero they are. I also know that nobody puts up a fight like that unless you love your sisters.</p><p>At this dark hour, it feels important to place on record that as the Modi administration recoils theatrically from the shadow of the Epstein scandal at the summit stage, the satire writes itself. A government that cannot, or will not, protect its women should be far more ashamed of what is ordinary than of what is scandalous.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

that Israeli policies in the West Bank – including “the systematic unlawful use of force” by the Israeli army and unlawful demolitions of Palestinian homes – aim to uproot Palestinian communities.</p><p>The UN report raised concerns of “ethnic cleansing” by Israeli authorities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, amid increased attacks and forcible transfers that “appear to aim at a permanent displacement” of Palestinians.</p><p>The UN has documented an unprecedented increase in settler attacks since Israel’s genocidal war began in October 2023, with more than 3,700 reported until the end of 2025, more than the previous 10 years combined.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The attacks have gathered pace this year, with <a

Security forces were responding to reports that members of “Saraya al-Jawad” (al-Jawad Brigades), a shadowy armed group linked to regime remnants, had launched an attack on security positions.</p><p>According to the official Al-Ikhbariya TV channel, the confrontation killed at least one member of the Internal Security Forces. Security units managed to “neutralise” a top commander of the militia along with two of his associates, bringing the death toll to at least four.</p><h2 id=\"the-tiger-s-shadow\">The ‘Tiger’s’ shadow</h2><p>The emergence of Saraya al-Jawad represents a shift from disorganised loyalist resistance to an organised rebellion in the coastal heartland, traditionally the stronghold of the al-Assad family.</p><p>Formed in August 2025, the militia is reportedly loyal to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/leaked-calls-reveal-plot-by-al-assad-regime-officers-to-destabilise-syria\">Suheil al-Hassan</a>, the brigadier-general who commanded the notorious Quwwat al-Nimr (Tiger Forces), an elite unit in the former regime’s army.</p><p>The Ministry of Interior accuses the group of carrying out a campaign of destabilisation, including “assassinations, bombings, and targeting public celebrations”. The crackdown in Latakia comes as the transitional government, which took power after the regime’s collapse in December 2024, attempts to dismantle “deep state” armed cells.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"battles-on-two-fronts\">Battles on two fronts</h2><p>The violence in the west coincided with a resurgence of attacks in the east earlier in the week, undermining the country’s fragile stability.</p><p>On Tuesday, ISIL (ISIS) claimed responsibility for a series of attacks carried out on Monday on security outposts in Deir Az Zor province.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Al-Mayadin:</strong> A soldier was killed in an ambush on the city’s outskirts.</li>\n<li><strong>Al-Sabahiyah:</strong> Two consecutive attacks on a security checkpoint left four security personnel dead.</li>\n</ul><p>Interior Minister Anas Khattab linked the two fronts in a statement on X, accusing “remnants of the previous regime and ISIL” of attempting to “tamper with the country’s security and target its successes”.</p><h2 id=\"suspicious-timing\">‘Suspicious timing’</h2><p>Analysts suggest the simultaneous flare-ups on the coast and in the east are likely not a coincidence.</p><p>Brigadier General Munir al-Hariri, a strategic security expert based in Amman, told Al Jazeera Mubasher that the resurgence of these groups is “suspicious”, hinting at external manipulation.</p><p>“There is something suspicious in this story,” al-Hariri said. He argued that external actors who lost influence in Syria – specifically pointing to Iran – may be mobilising “dormant cells” within the former regime’s intelligence apparatus and even facilitating ISIL activity to portray the new Syrian state as “weak and incapable of controlling security”.</p><p>“The middle ranks of the [old] regime’s intelligence had deep ties with these groups,” al-Hariri added, suggesting a historical “exchange of roles” between regime loyalists and hardliners to create chaos.</p><h2 id=\"the-security-vacuum\">The security vacuum</h2><p>However, Bassam al-Suleiman, a political researcher based in Damascus, attributes the spike in violence to the natural friction of a power transition and the withdrawal of international forces.</p><p>“The organisation [ISIL] is exploiting the state of security imbalance resulting from the change in control and the withdrawal of US forces,” al-Suleiman told Al Jazeera Mubasher.</p><p>He warned that the vast Syrian Badia (desert) – which constitutes nearly 40 percent of the country’s territory – risks becoming a safe haven for regrouping militants if the government does not act on a swift “crisis cell” approach.</p><p>“The fear today is that the security vacuum in this desert will be exploited and turned into training camps,” al-Suleiman said, calling for the government to engage Arab tribes in Deir Az Zor as a “support force” against the rebellion.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He also defended his immigration efforts, which have caused turmoil in Democratic-run cities and resulted in the deaths of two US citizens shot by immigration agents.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Trump called on legislators to stand and show their support if they agree that the “first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens”. That garnered a prolonged standing ovation from Republicans and silence from seated Democrats, prompting Trump to say they should be “ashamed of themselves”.</p><p>Scant in Trump’s speech: Acknowledgement of the fourth anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war, which he vowed during his presidential campaign to end. He also didn’t discuss the release of government files on late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, an issue Trump pivoted on after undermining efforts to release them, although some Epstein victims were in attendance.</p><p>Dozens of Democrats skipped Trump’s address and attended outside events, including a rally on the National Mall. Democratic Representative Texas, Al Green, was escorted out of the House chamber at the start of Trump’s speech after he held up a sign that read “Black people aren’t apes,” referencing a video Trump recently posted on Truth Social depicting President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. (The video was later removed, and the White House said it was posted in error.)</p><p>A rare moment of bipartisan cheer came when Trump introduced the Olympic gold-medal-winning men’s hockey team and announced plans to award goaltender Connor Hellebuyck the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards.</p><p>Here are fact-checks of some of Trump’s statements.</p><h2 id=\"economy\">Economy</h2><p>Inflation has eased somewhat during Trump’s second term, but “plummeting” is an exaggeration.</p><p>The year-over-year rise in prices for January 2026 was about 2.4 percent. That’s lower than the year-over-year rate when he took office in January 2025, but it had already fallen from a peak of roughly 9% in the summer of 2022 under former President Joe Biden.</p><p>By Biden’s last month in office, year-over-year inflation was about 2.9 percent. The Federal Reserve aims to keep inflation about 2 percent year-over-year.</p><h3 id=\"inflation-has-dipped-modestly-under-trump-compared-to-what-he-inherited\">Inflation has dipped modestly under Trump, compared to what he inherited</h3><p>Some items have seen price decreases during Trump’s second term, while others have experienced price increases.</p><p>The price of gasoline has dropped about 6 percent, and the price of new and used cars has dropped by a little under 1 percent.</p><p>Groceries are up by about 2 percent, electricity is up by 6.3 percent, housing is up by 3.4 percent, medical care is up by 3.2 percent and apparel is up by 1.8 percent.</p><p>Wages on Trump’s watch have so far risen faster than inflation.</p><h3 id=\"trump-claimed-gasoline-is-now-below-2-30-a-gallon-in-most-states-and-in-some-places-1-99-a-gallon\">Trump claimed gasoline is ‘now below $2.30 a gallon in most states’</h3><p>Looking at statewide averages, Trump is wrong – not one state has an average below $2.30 per gallon, according to the American Automobile Association. Some individual stations might be lower.</p><p>The state with the nation’s lowest average price on February 24 was Oklahoma, at $2.37 a gallon. Arkansas, Kansas and Mississippi are the other states with average prices at or below $2.50 a gallon. Another nine states had gasoline between $2.50 and $2.60 a gallon.</p><p>According to GasBuddy, a gasoline price app, two Oklahoma stations on February 23 were charging $1.99 a gallon, as were three in Kansas and two in Texas.</p><p>Trump said, “When I visited the great state of Iowa just a few weeks ago, I even saw $1.85 a gallon for gasoline.” However, a woman attending the speech fact-checked him; it was $2.69 a gallon at the station outside the Iowa venue for Trump’s speech there. The state average at the time was $2.57 a gallon, and GasBuddy found just four stations in the state selling for less than $2 a gallon.</p><p>Gasoline prices have fallen during Trump’s second term, from a nationwide average of $3.11 a gallon when he was inaugurated to $2.92 the week of February 16.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-claim-on-drug-prices\">Trump’s claim on drug prices</h2><p>“I’m also ending the wildly inflated cost of prescription drugs like it’s never happened before,” he said.</p><p>Trump said prescription drug prices for Americans are dropping to some of the lowest in the world, with differences as high as “300, 400, 500, 600 percent and more, all available right now at a new website called TrumpRX.gov.”</p><p>That’s mathematical hyperbole, and it exaggerates savings on the new TrumpRx.gov website. A 100 percent drop in a drug’s price means it would cost $0. Prices slashed by 300 percent to 900 percent would mean drug manufacturers are paying people who are obtaining medications, instead of the other way around.</p><p>The discounts on TrumpRx.gov are largely limited to drugs for weight loss and fertility that many Americans have to pay for out of pocket because insurance plans often offer limited or no coverage. For example, the site offers Cetrotide, a medication used as part of fertility treatments, for $22.50, down from $316.12 – a 93 percent discount. It also offers Wegovy pills for $149 a month, down from $1,349 – an 89 percent discount.</p><p>Other pharmacies or websites sell generic versions of 20 of the 43 drugs on Trump’s website, often at lower prices. Plus, the website says these discounts are currently “only available for cash-paying patients,” not people using their insurance.</p><p>A White House official told PolitiFact the administration plans to extend the website’s benefits to people with insurance through Trump’s health care plan, which has not advanced in Congress.</p><h2 id=\"immigration\">Immigration</h2><p>“In the past nine months, zero illegal aliens have been admitted to the United States,” Trump declared, referring to undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Encounters with people trying to illegally cross the US southern border have dropped significantly during Trump’s second term.</p><p>In January 2026, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials encountered immigrants at the southern border nearly 10,000 times compared with more than 61,000 encounters in January 2025.</p><p>According to the Department of Homeland Security, US Border Patrol has not released any immigrants into the US for eight months while they await their court proceedings. That means immigrants encountered by Border Patrol have either been quickly deported or detained.</p><p>“And with our new military campaign, we have stopped record amounts of drugs coming into our country and virtually stopped it completely coming in by water or sea,” the US president said.</p><p>There is no evidence that drugs coming in by sea have been “virtually stopped” by the Trump administration’s “new military campaign.”</p><p>Trump didn’t detail what military campaign he was referencing, but since September 2025, the Trump administration has struck at least 41 vessels killing about 152 people in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean. The administration hasn’t provided any evidence that the vessels it has struck were carrying drugs.</p><p>There has been a drop in Customs and Border Protection drug seizures since the strikes began. But the Coast Guard – not CBP – oversees most drug seizures on water, especially in international waters. And that agency has seen a steep increase in drug seizures.</p><p>The White House cites a drop in CBP drug seizures as a success at the same time the Coast Guard cites an increase in drug interdictions as a success, too.</p><p>However, neither an increase nor a decrease in drug seizures shows how many drugs are entering the US. That number is unknowable, according to drug experts. Drug seizures tell us only how many drugs are stopped from entering the US.</p><h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2><p>“Last year, the murder rate saw its single largest decline in recorded history. This is the biggest decline, think of it, in recorded history, the lowest number in over 125 years,” Trump said in his long speech.</p><p>He’s right about the largest decline, but whether it’s the lowest in 125 years is less certain.</p><p>Experts expect that when the final 2025 murder rate, as defined by the FBI, is released later this year, it likely will be the lowest in at least 65 years. The 2025 drop of about 20 percent is likely to become the largest one-year decline ever recorded, experts say.</p><p>Whether it is the lowest in 125 years is less certain. Here’s why the 125 years number raises questions: The data collected between 1930 and 1960 is not comparable to later data, and the data from 1900 to 1930 includes all homicides, not just murders. (A killing in self-defense, for instance, is a homicide but not murder.)</p><p>The FBI’s murder rate is poised to hit a low for at least the past 60-plus years</p><h2 id=\"snap-benefits\">SNAP benefits</h2><p>“In one year, we have lifted 2.4 million Americans, a record, off of food stamps,” Trump said.</p><p>The number refers to Americans who are projected to lose their benefits following the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act – not necessarily people who were able to afford to be off them.</p><p>An August 2025 Congressional Budget Office analysis found that about 2.4 million Americans would lose access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps, because of the law.</p><p>The law expanded work requirements for able-bodied adults, mandating that parents of dependent children ages 14 and older work, volunteer or participate in job training at least 80 hours a month. It also requires adults ages 55 to 64, veterans, people experiencing homelessness and people who were formerly in foster care to meet the new requirements, while exempting Native Americans.</p><p>About 42 million low-income people receive benefits through SNAP, getting an average individual monthly benefit of about $190, or $356 per household. Recipients can use the benefits to buy fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy products, bread and other foods. The majority of SNAP households live in poverty.</p><h2 id=\"trump-accounts\">Trump accounts</h2><p>Trump also promoted his newly launched “Trump accounts”, which is a saving tool for children.</p><p>Under the programme set to be implemented in July, babies born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, will receive $1,000 in seed money from the federal government. Parents can make additional deposits but aren’t required to.</p><p>Trump said accountholders, with “modest additional contributions,” could see their investment “grow to over $100,000 or more by the time they turn 18.”</p><p>But this growth is not guaranteed over decades, and it almost certainly wouldn’t happen in 18 years.</p><p>An investment calculator maintained by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission shows that $1,000 could grow to about $6,000 after 18 years.</p><p>If accountholders added another $9,000 during that time – something many Americans could not afford to do – it would produce about $60,000 in 18 years, at a 10 percent rate of growth.</p><p>The historical annual average gain for the US stock market is about 10 percent, but that rate of gain is not assured. Management fees also could eat into any gains.</p><p>Even a modest 2 percent inflation rate would take a big bite out of the final amount.</p><p>Finally, the amount in the account would decline further upon withdrawal because of taxes.</p></div></div></body></html>"

because export-dependent Germany needs “economic relations all over the world”.</p><p>“But we should be under no illusions,” he said, adding that China, as a rival to the US, now “claims the right to

Earlier this month, SAF asserted that it had succeeded in breaking through the siege of the city.</p><p>In November, the UN formally declared a famine in Kadugli, pointing to “months without reliable access to food or medical care”.</p><p>The statement also pointed to the reported atrocities committed by the RSF in el-Fasher in North Darfur state, which include “systematic killing”, “mass displacement” and “summary executions”. The UN has previously described el-Fasher as a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/un-finds-sudans-el-fasher-a-crime-scene-first-access-since-rsf-takeover\">“crime scene.”</a></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>After the paramilitary group was pushed out of the capital, Khartoum, in March, the RSF shifted its campaign to the Kordofan region and to the city of el-Fasher in North Darfur, which had been the army’s last bastion in the vast Darfur region until it fell to the RSF in October.</p><p>Following the capture of el-Fasher, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/three-aid-workers-killed-4-wounded-in-rsf-drone-attack-in-sudans-kordofan\">accounts surfaced</a> accusing the group of mass killings, rape, abductions and widespread looting, prompting the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open a formal probe into alleged “war crimes” by both parties to the conflict.</p><p>On Tuesday, the UNSC imposed sanctions on four high-ranking RSF figures, including the brother of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the current head of RSF. The sanctions include travel restrictions and asset freezes.</p><h2 id=\"attacks-against-aid-workers\">Attacks against aid workers</h2><p>The UNSC also expressed alarm over repeated drone attacks against civilians, civilian infrastructure and humanitarian workers, including strikes on WFP operations since early February 2026.</p><p>“Council members reiterated that deliberate attacks against humanitarian personnel, their premises and assets may constitute war crimes,” it said.</p><p>“They called on all parties to the conflict to respect and protect humanitarian personnel, as well as their premises and assets in accordance with their obligations under international law.”</p><p>It called for safe, unhindered humanitarian access and the free movement of civilians. “They (UNSC) stressed that starvation must not be used as a weapon of war,” it added.</p><p>According to the latest figures from the WFP, at least 21.2 million people, or 41 percent of the population, are facing high levels of acute food shortages, while 12 million people have been “forced from their homes by the conflict”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And they’re at this moment again pursuing their sinister ambitions,” Trump said, as he broached the subject of potential military action against Iran about 90 minutes into his record-length speech.</p><p>“We are in negotiations with them. They want to make a deal, but we haven’t heard those secret words: ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon.’”</p><p>Trump said his “preference” was “to solve this problem through diplomacy, but one thing is certain: I will never allow the world’s number one sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon.</p><p>“Can’t let that happen,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump said that after the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">US attacks on Iran’s nuclear sites</a> in June 2025, “they were warned to make no future attempts to rebuild their weapons programme, in particular, nuclear weapons – yet they continue”.</p><p>Iran has insisted for years that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only. Neither US intelligence nor the UN’s nuclear watchdog found any evidence last year that Iran was pursuing atomic weapons.</p><p>As well as accusing Iran of restarting its nuclear programme, Trump claimed Tehran was working to build missiles that “soon” would be capable of reaching the US, echoing claims in Iranian state media that Tehran is developing a missile capable of reaching North America.</p><p>He also claimed Iran was responsible for roadside bombings that have killed US service members and civilians.</p><p>He criticised Tehran over the deaths of thousands of protesters killed during recent antigovernment demonstrations, claiming that Iranian authorities killed 32,000 people during a crackdown – much higher than the thousands widely believed to have been killed.</p><p>“The (Iranian) regime and its murderous proxies have spread nothing but terrorism and death and hate,” Trump said.</p><h2 id=\"iran-s-foreign-ministry-responds\">Iran’s Foreign Ministry responds</h2><p>Trump’s latest comments on the tensions come amid a significant US military build-up in the Middle East, and before a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/iran-says-ready-for-talks-but-will-defend-itself-against-us-aggression\">third round</a> of indirect talks scheduled for Thursday.</p><p class=\"p1\">Trump said on February 19 ⁠said he was giving Tehran 10 to 15 days to make a deal.</p><p>The talks, to be held in Geneva and mediated by Oman, will be attended by Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, along with Iranian officials, including Araghchi.</p><p>The US leader’s comments drew a fierce response from Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, with ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei accusing Trump of “big lies” in his claims about his government.</p><p>“Professional liars are good at creating the ‘illusion of truth’,” he said in a post on X.</p><p>“Whatever they’re alleging in regards to Iran’s nuclear program, Iran’s ballistic missiles, and the number of casualties during January’s unrest is simply the repetition of ‘big lies’.”</p><p>He added: “No one should be fooled by these prominent untruths.”</p><h2 id=\"all-options-on-table\">‘All options on table’</h2><p>The ministry’s comments on Wednesday came as Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, speaker of Iran’s Parliament, said that Iran remained committed to negotiations, while warning that it was prepared to retaliate if Washington once again resorted to military action.</p><p>“If you choose the path of diplomacy – one in which Iranian dignity and mutual interests are respected – we will remain at the negotiating table, as we are now,” said Ghalibaf.</p><p>“We have the third round of talks tomorrow, and we will continue on this path in the future as well.”</p><p>But, he said, “if your decision is to repeat what happened before – through deception, lies, and misinformation – and to bomb the negotiating table while Iran is pursuing diplomacy under these conditions, then you will once again taste the strong blow of the Iranian nation and our defensive forces”.</p><p>He added: “All options are on the table: both dignified diplomacy and a deterrent defence that will make you regret your actions.”</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, Araghchi said in a post on X that a deal with Washington to avert conflict was “within reach”, as Iran prepared to resume talks in Geneva “with a determination to achieve a fair and equitable deal – in the shortest possible time”.</p><p>“Our fundamental convictions are crystal clear,” he wrote. “Iran will under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon; neither will we Iranians ever forgo our right to harness the dividends of peaceful nuclear technology for our people.”</p><p>Iran and the US had “a historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement”, he said, “but only if diplomacy is given priority”.</p><h2 id=\"trump-trying-to-build-support-for-strikes\">Trump trying to build support for strikes</h2><p>Hassan Mneimneh, researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera that Trump’s comments on the supposed threat of Iranian missiles appeared to be a bid to drum up domestic support for a military operation against Iran, something he was struggling to achieve.</p><p>Trump was attempting to do this by painting Iran’s missiles as a direct threat to the US, even though the arsenal was primarily a threat to Israel, he said, lacking the capacity to strike the United States.</p><p>He said the ongoing negotiations appeared to be a futile process, with the US insisting that the talks would cover Iran’s missile programme, which was not originally on the negotiating table.</p></div></div></body></html>"
