The US quietly removed sanctions on five individuals and companies allegedly tied to the regime’s arms trade on July 24.</p><p>“This is a major step backward for international efforts to save lives by restricting the murderous junta’s access to weapons,” Andrews said in a statement. “It is unconscionable to undermine these efforts by rolling back sanctions on Myanmar arms dealers and junta cronies.”</p><p>The move has drawn criticism amid an ongoing civil war in Myanmar, where the military, led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, seized power in a 2021 coup that overthrew the government of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p><p>Andrews said the companies removed from the sanctions list had been implicated in brokering weapons and materials for the regime’s military operations.</p><p>“What makes this action even more appalling is that sanctions against the junta are proving to be effective,” Andrews added, pointing to data showing a more than 30 percent decline in Myanmar’s imported military equipment from 2023 to 2024, which he attributed in part to US-led sanctions.</p><p>The move comes despite US President Trump signing a notice in February extending the executive order underpinning Myanmar-related sanctions, saying the 2021 coup “continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>And in a June statement to the UN, the US representative accused the military regime of bombing civilians and conscripting Rohingya to fight on its behalf.</p><p>But the decision to ease sanctions came two weeks after Myanmar’s military chief sent a glowing letter of praise to US President Donald Trump. In the letter, the general commended Trump’s “strong leadership” and praised his administration for defunding US-backed media outlets critical of the regime.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>A senior official from Trump’s administration said the sanctions decision was unrelated to the letter.</p><p>But critics say the timing raises serious concerns. John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, called the move “extremely worrying” and warned that it “suggests a major shift is underway in US policy, which had centered on punitive action against Myanmar’s military regime”.</p><p>Andrews urged the Trump administration to reverse course. “Rather than removing sanctions, the US should be extending them to include Myanmar Economic Bank, the key military-controlled financial institution that it relies on to pay for imported military equipment.”</p><p>“This is a dangerous and disturbing trend,” he added. “I urge the Trump administration to stand with the people of Myanmar and reconsider its decision to make it easier for the military junta to attack them with sophisticated weapons of war. It is literally a matter of life and death.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Trump’s Justice Department has now said the previously touted Epstein client list did not in fact exist, angering Trump’s supporters.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The department first sought court permission on July 18 to make public transcripts of the confidential grand jury testimony given by witnesses years ago in the two cases, but Manhattan-based US District Judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer asked the government to flesh out the legal bases for the requests.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Even if one or both of the judges allow the transcripts to be made public, it is not clear whether the public would learn anything new or noteworthy about Epstein or his longtime girlfriend Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021.</p><p>Lawmakers have also been seeking testimony from Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in a Florida prison for her role in his crimes.</p><p>Maxwell’s lawyer has said she would speak to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee if granted immunity for her testimony.</p><p>“The Oversight Committee will respond to Ms Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony,” a spokesman for the panel said.</p><p>Democrats have also sought to attach votes on the Epstein files to unrelated bills multiple times, prompting House Speaker Mike Johnson to send lawmakers home for the summer a day early last week rather than risk them succeeding.</p><p>“Donald Trump promised he would release the Epstein files while he was on the campaign trail. He made that promise, and he has yet to do it,” Schumer said in a speech on Tuesday on the Senate floor.</p><p>In the filings, prosecutors said the only witness at Epstein’s grand jury was an FBI agent. That same agent and a New York City Police Department detective were the only witnesses to testify before Maxwell’s grand jury, prosecutors said.</p><p>Maxwell’s four-week trial in 2021 included public testimony from sex trafficking victims, associates of Epstein and Maxwell, and law enforcement officers.</p><p>She is asking the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. She had pleaded not guilty.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The data is clear, and there are no more excuses — now is the time for ‘too late’ Powell to cut the rates!”</p><p>Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, has been under pressure from Trump for months cut interest rates but has repeatedly said the Fed will wait to see how the economy evolves under the tariff pressures before deciding if it will reduce its key interest rate.</p><h2 id=\"policy-initiated-slowdown\">‘Policy-initiated slowdown’</h2><p>Despite claims that there is boosted investment in the US, the data says otherwise as private sector investment plunged 15.6 percent in the second quarter.</p><p>“Today’s GDP release only further confirms that we’re in the midst of a policy-initiated slowdown.

In addition, there has also been a decrease in exports, led by cars, engines, and parts, a reflection of existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles,” Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Contrary to the White House’s claims, job growth also slowed. Last month’s US Labor Department jobs report showed limited traction in sectors impacted by tariffs, including wholesale trade. <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/3/solid-us-job-numbers-mask-weakness-underneath\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Labor Department’s July report</a> is slated to be released on Friday.

China has even pushed for “de-dollarisation”, by promoting its currency, the yuan, and forming <a href=\"/economy/2023/7/17/argentinas-yuan-lifeline-sign-of-brinksmanship-between-china-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">currency swap agreements</a> with other countries.</p><p>Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, recently noted that a “shift” was under way that would allow for the “euro to gain global prominence”.</p><p>Lagarde said in June that the euro accounts for approximately 20 percent of global foreign exchange reserves, and that the “dominant role of the US dollar”, which accounts for 58 percent, “is no longer certain”.</p><p>“History teaches us that regimes seem enduring – until they no longer are. Shifts in global currency dominance have happened before. This moment of change is an opportunity for Europe. It is a ‘global euro’ moment,” Lagarde said.</p><p>The dollar has also weakened this year, experiencing its sharpest six-month decline in decades.</p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Global investors have been reacting to policy uncertainty under the administration of US President Donald Trump, rising debt, and shifting interest rate expectations – with some questioning its “safe-haven” appeal.</p><p>Experts say that in the unlikely event that the US were to lose its reserve currency status, the impact would be profound, as the country would lose much of its leverage to influence global trade and enforce sanctions – international trade that does not directly involve the US often runs through the dollar.</p><p>Or, as Trump told reporters earlier this month, “If we lost the world standard dollar, that would be like losing a war.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“We would not be the same country.”</p><h2 id=\"exorbitant-privilege\">‘Exorbitant privilege’</h2><p>As the global reserve currency, the US dollar underpins a monetary system where central banks rely on it to stabilise their economies, manage debt and implement trade policies.</p><p>Historically seen as a safe investment, the dollar remains so deeply embedded in the global system that, despite recent shake-ups, it is unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon, emboldened by a longstanding history of resilience.</p><p>The US dollar was put on this course in the 1930s, when then-President Franklin D Roosevelt centralised US gold reserves and tied the dollar to a fixed supply of gold.</p><p>Then, in 1944, the US spearheaded the Bretton Woods Agreement, which pegged international currencies to the dollar, leading to the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>With much of the world recovering from war and the US holding the majority of global gold reserves, the dollar emerged as the anchor of the post-war financial system, and by the 1960s, gave the US what former French Minister of Finance Valéry Giscard d’Estaing called an “exorbitant privilege”.</p><p>In 1971, US President Richard Nixon severed the last remaining ties to the gold standard, an action that became known as the “Nixon shock”, allowing the dollar to float freely in the open market. Despite the wave of changes, the US economy remained strong, bolstered by its growth in manufacturing and information, which helped the dollar maintain its status.</p><p>Since the Nixon era, the dollar’s dominance has mostly only strengthened, even as countries like China have outpaced the US in economic growth, population and manufacturing output. The US has continued to wield disproportionate influence through trade agreements and financial sanctions.</p><p>“Many times, even between emerging markets when one converts a currency, like the Brazilian real and the South African rand, for example, there is a transaction to US dollars in between, and so, the US extraterritorial power here stems from the fact that other countries, global banks, don’t want to lose their access to the US dollar-based financial system,” Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>This also adds weight when the US imposes sanctions.</p><p>“From a geopolitical standpoint, the US having a reserve currency gives it more flexibility to weaponise its currency via financial sanctions and the like,” Ziemba said.</p><p>Because transactions often pass through banks that work in tandem with the US Federal Reserve, they can be subject to US sanctions – even if the US is not directly involved.</p><p>That is why the financial sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine led to a default on Moscow’s sovereign debt. In 2022, sanctions from the administration of former US President Joe Biden effectively cut Russia off from dollar-based trade, freezing $300bn in assets held by its central bank and crippling its economy. As a result of the sanctions led by the US, Russia’s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by $104bn.</p><p>If the dollar did lose its status, domestically, it would mean higher borrowing costs. Without foreign demand for US debt, interest rates would rise, driving up the cost of mortgages and credit cards. This is because private banks peg their interest rates to those of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>“It would mean the US no longer has this big pool of foreign savings to rely on to keep the US borrowing costs down. It’s kind of a fundamental threat to the US economic model of the past few decades, which has generally been relatively low interest rates, which has enabled consumers, firms and the government to finance a lot of debt at relatively cheap prices,” Pearce said.</p><p>“A loss of dollar dominance for the US means higher interest rates in the US, and that’s really going to put pressure on demand. Mortgages are gonna get a lot more expensive,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"a-new-era-of-economic-uncertainty\">A new era of economic uncertainty</h2><p>Unlike in Nixon’s era, when US dominance was largely uncontested, the current global economy is more interconnected.</p><p>Emerging powers such as China and India have expanded their global influence, and alternative financial systems, including the rise of cryptocurrencies, have gained traction. Repeated policy whiplash from one US administration to the next risks undermining that stability in a landscape of growing threats.</p><p>Trump’s erratic approach to tariffs and global agreements has revived doubts about the US’s reliability on the world stage and raised long-term concerns about the stability of the dollar.</p><p>“I think Trump has done more than anybody in modern history to undermine key institutions,” said Alex Jacquez, a special assistant to the president for economic development at the White House National Economic Council under Joe Biden.</p><p>After Trump’s first term, global partners felt the US had returned to diplomacy under Biden, Jacquez told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“When I came in with the Biden administration and worked on these issues, certainly, we had our disputes and our issues with our trading partners, but the international community welcomed us back with good-faith negotiations. But that came with scarring and pain with their interactions with the Trump administration.”</p><p>However, Jacquez noted that regaining that trust may now be harder. This is not simply because of Trump, but also because of the broader pattern of reversals in US policy that his administration has driven.</p><p>Jacquez argues that frequent U-turns, abrupt withdrawals from agreements and threats to longstanding alliances have created global instability, making it difficult for other nations to formulate long-term plans, which could compromise the long-term stability of the dollar.</p><p>That comes alongside Trump’s tax legislation, which he recently signed into law, and is expected to add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit. This is stoking fears about long-term US economic stability, potentially raising borrowing costs that could impact global investors, central banks and everyday consumers.</p><p>In 2023, then-Senator JD Vance questioned the value of the dollar as the global reserve currency in an exchange with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.</p><p>“I think in some ways, you can argue that the reserve currency status is a massive subsidy to American consumers, but a massive tax on American producers,” Vance said.</p><p>But since Trump took office with Vance as vice president, tariffs have put pressure on US producers, not the status of the dollar.</p><p>There are also concerns over Trump’s attempts to influence the Federal Reserve, which could impact the status of the dollar. The president has long criticised Powell for not lowering interest rates, and has threatened to fire and replace him.</p><p>Earlier this month, US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent told Bloomberg that the White House has begun the formal process of finding a successor for Powell, whose term ends in 2026. This comes amid reporting from CBS News that last week, the president asked a group of Republican lawmakers if he should fire Powell.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>However, Trump told reporters later that firing Powell was “highly unlikely”.</p><p>“Policies of that nature, which would make investing in US treasuries risky, particularly for foreign investors, I think that would make me a bit more concerned about a loss of reserve currency status,” Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Tariffs and other policies have taken that kind of US exceptionalism off the table at least for this year. We expect the US to be relatively hard-hit by these tariffs compared to the rest of the world. However, when you think of the long-term performance, it’s still a relatively dynamic economy,” Pearce added.</p><h2 id=\"contenders-for-the-global-reserve-currency\">Contenders for the global reserve currency</h2><p>There are groups of nations that are increasingly positioning themselves to take on a larger role in global finance, but none has yet matched the dollar’s influence. This means it is unlikely that any currency could replace the dollar as the de facto global reserve currency.</p><p>But there are attempts to challenge the US’s influence. BRICS nations have moved to reduce their reliance on the US dollar in recent years, which has become a growing concern for Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>At the same time, the European Central Bank is also pushing for the euro to play a more central role in the global system, but as Lagarde noted in her essay, a “step towards greater international prominence for our currency will not happen by default: it must be earned”.</p><p>Despite attempts by other nations to expand their influence over the global reserve, and the recent decline in the dollar’s value, economists argue that it is unlikely the dollar will lose its status as the world’s reserve currency. And, if it did, it might take decades to even see a minor shift.</p><p>“It’s definitely premature to worry about the dollar losing the global reserve currency status. Even if [it did], that would take multiple years for that to happen,” Hong Cheng, the head of fixed income and currency research at Morningstar, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Pearce also said that a change in the global reserve hierarchy was unlikely.</p><p>“A dramatic shift in which the US clearly loses its place atop the pile, I think that’s far off the cards. I find it difficult to see any viable contender emerging to the dollar in that sense,” Pearce said.</p><p>Instead, experts say a more realistic future could involve a multipolar currency system, where the dollar shares its role with other major currencies, including China’s renminbi.</p><p>“We could be heading into some kind of multipolar reserve currency environment where there is an additional role for currencies like China’s renminbi. There’s no one clear alternate currency,” said Ziemba, the adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.</p><p>Even if a transition were to occur, it would take decades.</p><p>“You would need kind of a managed unwinding through either coordination or kind of some sort of alternative system to emerge, which again would take time,” Jacquez said.</p><p>While the dollar’s share in global reserves has declined, it is not at an unprecedented low.</p><p>“The dollar share in FX [foreign exchange] reserves was lower in the early 1990s, so the recent decline in its share is not completely out of the norm to just under 60 percent,” according to JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>In emerging markets, “the same ratio of USD reserves as in 1995” still holds. Even after recent sell-offs, including one by China in April, analysts do not expect a major impact.</p><p>Countries often hold US Treasuries as liquid assets, which provides stability to their own currencies, so unravelling the US dollar’s status could also undermine their own interests.</p><p>“With more than 30 percent of foreign Treasury holdings maturing in the next 2 years, international investors are more likely to let these assets mature and choose to reinvest part of the proceeds elsewhere. We think large-scale selling is unlikely,” the note added.</p><p>That signals that the US dollar will likely remain dominant for the foreseeable future.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s one dominant currency that’s gonna replace the dollar. And if there was hypothetically a change, I think that’s going to take many years to shift,”  Cheng added.</p><p>“We’re talking about the next 20, 30, or even 50 years.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He said its members feel \"outraged and betrayed\" by Congress's actions.</p>\n<p>His life was derailed by the events of 1985. He credits the trauma he endured with impeding his studies. What happened the morning he was farming outside the village lingers with him to this day.</p>\n<p>\"The military had arrived and asked people to gather for a town assembly,\" Ochoa explained, punctuating his thoughts with long pauses.</p>\n<p>\"Once they were all gathered, they separated the women from the men and put them inside one of the villagers’ huts.

Israel says its military onslaught was in response to the Hamas-led attacks that left at least 1,139 people dead in Israel, but rights groups have slammed its scorched earth tactics in Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"1201\" data-end=\"1385\">Starmer emphasised that the recognition of Palestine has long been a part of Labour Party policy and forms a central pillar of a broader peace initiative that the government has been developing over time.</p><p data-start=\"621\" data-end=\"1016\">“As our election manifesto said, Palestinian statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people. It is not in the gift of any neighbour and is also essential to the long-term security of Israel,” a statement issued by the prime minister’s office said.</p><p data-start=\"621\" data-end=\"1016\">“We are committed to recognising a Palestinian state as a contribution to a renewed peace process which results in a two-state solution, with a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state.”</p><h2 id=\"what-specific-conditions-did-starmer-set-for-recognising-palestine\">What specific conditions did Starmer set for recognising Palestine?</h2><p>Starmer laid out a series of conditions he said Israel must fulfil if it wishes the UK not to recognise Palestinian statehood, which include:</p><ul>\n<li>Take substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza</li>\n<li>Agree to a ceasefire</li>\n<li>Commit to a long-term, sustainable peace, reviving the prospect of a two-state solution</li>\n<li>Allow the UN to restart the supply of aid</li>\n<li>Make clear there will be no annexations in the West Bank.</li>\n</ul><p>The prime minister also reiterated the demands that remain in place for Hamas, which are:</p><ul>\n<li>Release all captives</li>\n<li>Sign up to a ceasefire</li>\n<li>Commit to disarmament</li>\n<li>Acknowledge that they will play no part in the government of Gaza.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The UK government will assess the extent to which the two parties, Israel and Hamas, have met its conditions before taking a call in September.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-recognising-palestine-as-a-state-mean-and-which-other-countries-have-done-so\">What does recognising Palestine as a state mean, and which other countries have done so?</h2><p>As of now, the State of Palestine is recognised as a sovereign nation by 147 of the 193 UN member states, about 75 percent of the international community.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Three other European countries, Spain, Ireland, and Norway, officially recognised Palestine last year.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">France will recognise a Palestinian state during the UNGA in September.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"205\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">According to experts, the recognition may have limited practical effect, but diplomatically, it could be significant, potentially pressuring the US, one of Israel’s main backers, to reconsider its stance.</p><p data-start=\"126\" data-end=\"401\">“Even if this is not a big step in the humanitarian sense – if you are starving in Gaza, these words of diplomats and politicians maybe don’t matter that much – but diplomatically, this is massive. And what really struck me was the specificity of Starmer’s demands,” William Lawrence, a former US diplomat, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"403\" data-end=\"735\">“And if the whole world, all turn to Trump with that sort of specific outline and common cause, it will have an effect on Trump. All of this matters, even if it doesn’t fix the problem instantaneously. Everyone is moving in the right direction now, both in terms of pressuring Israel and in terms of pressuring the United States,” Lawrence added.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"is-the-uk-really-preparing-to-recognise-palestine\">Is the UK really preparing to recognise Palestine?</h2><p id=\"according-to-al-jazeera-s-milena-veselinovic-starmer-is-currently-under-significant-pressure\">According to Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic, Starmer is currently under significant pressure.</p><p>“He is under a lot of pressure, domestically, here from the public, as well as from his own members of parliament to make some move on this issue; people have been moved by those images of people starving in the last few days,” Veselinovic said while reporting from London.</p><p>Last week, 221 members of parliament from nine political parties signed a letter addressed to Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy, urging them to recognise a Palestinian state. That number has since risen to 255.</p><p></p><p>Veselinovic added that the UK is not promising to recognise a Palestinian state.</p><p>“[This is not] like when the French President Macron said he will do that, he will recognise the Palestine state in September, this is a way of pressure that the UK government is hoping to apply on the Israeli government to try to improve the conditions on the ground in Gaza,” she added.</p><h2 id=\"will-it-have-any-practical-effect-on-the-situation-in-gaza\">Will it have any practical effect on the situation in Gaza?</h2><p>Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said the move will hopefully “affect the situation on the ground” and lead to a ceasefire in Gaza.</p><p>The world had seen “the most horrific scenes” in Gaza and the time had come to “abate the suffering of the Palestinian people”, he said speaking at the UN.</p><p>Scepticism, however, remains high as some question the sincerity behind recent announcements.</p><p data-start=\"316\" data-end=\"624\">Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Bishara said leaders, including Starmer and Macron, continue to support Israel in its war on Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"316\" data-end=\"624\">“We need to see some measures being taken other than just lofty rhetoric, because they are in no position to be talking about peace and justice when they are accomplices in genocide,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"1696\" data-end=\"2261\">Bishara also criticised the lack of specifics from the two leaders when they announced their plans to recognise a Palestinian state.</p><p data-start=\"1696\" data-end=\"2261\">“Is it a state in 10 percent of the West Bank? Or is it a state on all territories occupied in 1967 – including East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza – as contiguous sovereign territories?” he added.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-israel-responded\">How has Israel responded?</h2><p>“Starmer rewards Hamas’s monstrous terrorism &amp; punishes its victims,” Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on X.</p><p>Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said the UK move “harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages”, adding that Starmer’s announcement followed “the French move and internal political pressures”.</p><p>France became the first G7 member to announce its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, with President Macron describing the decision as part of the country’s “historical commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"
