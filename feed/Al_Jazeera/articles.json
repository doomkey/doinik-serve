It has also failed to allow the entry of the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/un-warns-gaza-aid-still-too-slow-as-israel-restricts-supplies-despite-truce\">amount of aid</a> it agreed to, destroyed more than 1,500 buildings, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klrO05fcCC0\">expanded deeper </a>into Gaza, cutting people off from their homes.</p><p>“It’s theatre because everyone was fed up with the genocide and keen for it to disappear and not solve it. And that’s exactly what we’ve seen,” Shehada said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the weeks since the ceasefire began, Gaza has flickered in and out of media headlines.</p><p>“The main difference, of course, is the reduced media coverage, which was one of the intended purposes of the so-called ceasefire,” Lebanese Palestinian researcher and writer Elia Ayoub told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“There is far less pressure on Israel today than there was until October 10, with no sign of accountability on the horizon.”</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-genocide-is-not-over\">‘Israel’s genocide is not over’</h2><p>The ongoing harm to Palestinians in Gaza has also been noted by Amnesty International, which released a legal analysis last week of what it <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/israel-escalates-aerial-assault-of-southern-central-gaza-past-yellow-line\">called</a> the “ongoing genocide in the Occupied Gaza Strip”.</p><p>“The world must not be fooled. Israel’s genocide is not over,” said Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International.</p><p>The analysis cites the number of Palestinians killed since the ceasefire went into effect, Israel’s restriction of relief, humanitarian and medical supplies, and how Israel’s blockade and siege of Gaza led to a famine, and thus an increased vulnerability to illnesses.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“So far, there is no indication that Israel is taking serious measures to reverse the deadly impact of its crimes and no evidence that its intent has changed,” Callamard said.</p><p>Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), said on October 1, before the ceasefire, that 100 people were dying in Gaza a day, mostly from Israeli military operations or shootings at <a href=\"/news/2025/5/20/what-is-the-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-and-why-has-it-been-criticised\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a> aid distribution points.</p><p>Since the ceasefire, people are still dying from direct military operations, albeit fewer per day, and the foundations of Palestinian society in Gaza are still lying in ruins.</p><p>“Israel is continuing its genocide in Gaza, but its pace is different; the destruction on the houses is continuing and the killing of Palestinians is continuing, and the Israeli yellow line of occupation in the Gaza Strip is part of the genocide,” defence analyst Hamze Attar told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The genocide is not only about killing people, but about restricting people from going back to their homes and creating a new reality in the Gaza Strip.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"simply-genocide\">Simply genocide</h2><p>One of the ceasefire’s main stipulations was for Hamas and other Palestinian groups to return the captives held in Gaza. Hamas has returned all living captives and all but two of the bodies of dead captives: an Israeli policeman named Ran Gvili and a Thai national named Sudthisak Rinthalak.</p><p>One of the remaining bodies could be returned in the coming days, according to Israeli media. For months, Israel’s most fervent supporters claimed a return of the captives would end the war.</p><p>Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem previously said the group has shown its “commitment to fully complete the exchange process and its ongoing efforts to finalise it despite significant difficulties”.</p><p>As for Israel, it has released 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and returned the bodies of 345 more who died in its prisons. Many reportedly showed signs of torture, mutilation and execution. However, Israel has not eased its pressure on the people of Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“As soon as ceasefires go into effect, nobody bothers with details, which gives Israel a free hand to do what it wants,” Shehada said.</p><p>As for the United States, which helped pressure Israel into the deal, Shehada said Trump is more interested in the spectacle of peace than in “the dynamics on the ground”, adding that Israel violates the ceasefire systematically, making it difficult for mediators to keep up.</p><p>The end goal, he said, was still the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>In Gaza, as in <a href=\"/features/2025/11/23/israel-attacks-beirut-suburb-two-days-after-lebanon-agreed-for-talks\">Lebanon</a> or in <a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/israel-attacks-on-syria-what-happened-who-did-israel-claim-it-was-after\">Syria</a>, Israel has undermined peace agreements, analysts say. Netanyahu has claimed his goal is to destroy and dismantle Hamas, though <a href=\"/news/2025/6/8/clearly-an-excuse-does-netanyahu-really-want-hamas-gone\">analysts have repeatedly doubted</a> his stated intentions.</p><p>“It confirms what we already knew: that the goal is not to defeat an armed enemy, Hamas, but to make sure that life itself cannot be sustained in Gaza in the long-term,” Ayoub said.</p><p>“It’s simply genocide.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

At a December 1 press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticised Hernandez’s three-week jury trial as being scant on evidence.</p><p>After his conviction, a judge denied Hernandez’s motion for a new trial.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-hernandez-convicted-of\">What was Hernandez convicted of?</h2><p>Hernandez’s presidency ran from January 2014 to January 2022, during which he told US officials he was working to combat drug trafficking. Trump praised his efforts in 2019.</p><p>In April 2022, the US government indicted and extradited Hernandez to the US on drug- and weapons-trafficking charges. On June 26, 2024, District Judge P Kevin Castel sentenced him to 540 months in prison and 60 months of supervised release for cocaine importation and related weapons offences.</p><p>The US Justice Department said Hernandez had financed his political career with drug trafficking proceeds and had used his presidential authority to traffic hundreds of tonnes of cocaine to the US.</p><p>At one point, the department said, Hernandez declared that he wanted to “stuff the drugs right up the noses of the gringos”.</p><p>The prosecution included testimony from witnesses, some of them former traffickers. Documents presented in the case said Hernandez facilitated the importation into the US of more than 400 tonnes of cocaine — equivalent to about 4.5 billion doses — working with coconspirators armed with machineguns, assault rifles and grenade launchers.</p><p>The Honduran military and the police carried out orders from criminal groups, according to witnesses in Hernandez’s trial.</p><p>US prosecutors said Hernandez ended up receiving millions of dollars of drug proceeds from some of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking organisations in Honduras, Mexico and other countries. He then used those bribes to fuel his rise in Honduran politics, which enabled him to protect his co-conspirators, prosecutors said.</p><p>Hernandez’s brother, Juan Antonio Hernandez Alvarado, a former member of the Honduran National Congress, received protection from the government under Hernandez’s leadership. Hernandez also received millions of dollars from  Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, prosecutors said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-was-the-us-able-to-try-a-foreign-head-of-government\">How was the US able to try a foreign head of government?</h2><p>Trump said the US singled out Hernandez because he was the president of Honduras. It is unusual but not unprecedented for a foreign president to be prosecuted.</p><p>Under international law, a sitting head of state or head of government enjoys “complete immunity” from prosecution in the courts of another country, said Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service who specialises in international law.</p><p>However, the restrictions are looser for former heads of state. Hernandez was weeks out of office at his US extradition.</p><p>A former head of state or government is immune from another country’s prosecution if it is about actions carried out in their official capacity, Arend said. But the US was able to prosecute Hernandez because drug trafficking has historically not been considered an “official” duty.</p><p>Because he was facing drug-trafficking charges, “there would be no impediment under international law to trying him, a former president, for those charges”, Arend said.</p><p>Hernandez’s prosecution “seemed to have legitimacy both in the US and in Honduras”, said Daniel Sabet, a visiting fellow at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University who studies Central America. “Outside of his core supporters, the arrest was seen as legitimate.”</p><p>Such prosecutions are rare but not unprecedented, most notably the case of Manuel Noriega of Panama.</p><p>In 1989, President George HW Bush sent US forces into Panama to seize <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/a-timeline-of-cia-operations-in-latin-america\">Noriega</a>, the country’s leader, after his indictment by a US grand jury on drug-related charges. (Noriega’s status as head of government was contested in Panama at the time, and his status was not recognised by the US.)</p><p>After turning himself in and being extradited to the US state of Florida, Noriega was tried and convicted on eight counts of drug trafficking, money laundering, and racketeering. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison. The prosecution was upheld by a three-judge appeals court panel in 1997, turning aside Noriega’s argument that his position as head of state should have preempted his prosecution.</p><p>Sabet also cited the case of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko, who was arrested in the US in 1999, charged with 53 counts of money laundering. He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison.</p><p><em>PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Under proposals he outlined in parliament on Tuesday, only defendants accused of rape, murder or manslaughter, or cases meeting a defined “public-interest” test, will undergo a jury trial.</p><p>Reforms to the justice system include creating a new tier of “swift courts” as part of a plan to tackle unprecedented delays in the court system. New jury-free courts will take on many of the cases normally heard by juries at Crown Courts, which cover serious crimes.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The upshot is that jury trials for defendants facing relatively short custodial sentences – those of up to three years – will be scrapped in England and Wales. The reforms will not extend to Scotland, which has its own legal system, or Northern Ireland.</p><p data-start=\"964\" data-end=\"1196\">Earlier this year, the Ministry of Justice reported that more than 78,000 Crown Court cases remain unresolved, a record number. Eliminating the jury aspect of a trial saves about 20 percent of the time of a trial, the government claims.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-government-proposing\" data-start=\"964\" data-end=\"1196\">What is the government proposing?</h2><p data-start=\"1735\" data-end=\"2036\">Under the reforms announced on Tuesday, criminal cases which carry sentences of up to three years, as well as complex fraud and financial cases, will be tried without juries. Serious offences, including rape, murder and manslaughter, will remain subject to jury trial.</p><p>Also under the reforms, the government will set aside 550 million pounds ($726m) for victim support services over the next three years. This will fund support for survivors and witnesses as they move through the justice system, counselling and guidance.</p><p>A Justice Ministry memo, which was circulated around Whitehall last week, had seemed to suggest Lammy would go further than he has announced by allowing jury trials for “public interest” cases with potential prison sentences of over five years only.</p><p>However, it is understood that following backlash from members of the Cabinet and legal figures, he has watered down his planned reforms.</p><p>Regardless, they represent a change from Lammy’s views in the past. In a social media post five years ago, he wrote, “Trials are a fundamental part of our democratic settlement. Criminal trials without juries are a bad idea.”</p><p>The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, accused Lammy of “scrapping the institution he once lauded”.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-lammy-announcing-these-changes-now\">Why is Lammy announcing these changes now?</h2><p>The reforms follow the results of a review of criminal courts by former judge Sir Brian Leveson in July. The government commissioned that review because of a significant backlog of criminal cases which had developed.</p><p>Justice Ministry figures show that the open criminal caseload was 78,329 at the end of June, 10 percent higher than the year before. The median length of cases has also increased by 10 percent – from 153 to 168 days – since 2024.</p><p>This backlog was caused primarily by two things: delays backed up from the COVID-19 pandemic, and years of underinvestment in the courts.</p><p>Leveson advised the government to end jury trials for some serious offences, which could be conducted instead by one judge or with two sitting magistrates without compromising “the right to a fair trial”.</p><p>Lammy had described the backlog as a “courts emergency” and warned that the backlog could rise to 100,000 by 2028 if it was not addressed.</p><p>Announcing his criminal court reform in the Commons, he said, “I will create new swift courts within the crown court with a judge alone deciding verdicts in trial of either way cases with a likely sentence of three years or less as Sir Brian [Leveson] recommends.”</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-criticisms-of-these-proposals\">What are the criticisms of these proposals?</h2><p>The right of defendants to a trial by jury has long been a central part of the English justice system.</p><p>In advance of Lammy’s announcement, Mark Evans, president of the Law Society of England and Wales, which represents thousands of solicitors, told The Guardian newspaper that the proposals were an “extreme measure” that go “far beyond” Leveson’s recommendations.</p><p>“This is a fundamental change to how our criminal justice system operates and it goes too far. Our society’s concept of justice rests heavily on lay participation in determining a person’s guilt or innocence,” he said. “Lay participation” refers to people who are not legally trained and pertains to the right to a trial by a jury of one’s peers.</p><p>Riel Karmy-Jones, a criminal solicitor, told the BBC that the new proposals would not fix the backlog, which she blamed on decades of underfunding in the UK’s legal system.</p><p>She added that introducing an “untested layer of complexity” by removing juries would undermine the justice system.</p><p>Following the announcement in parliament, Abigail Ashford, a solicitor advocate, told the BBC: “Judge-only trials risk deepening existing inequalities and eroding confidence among communities who already feel marginalised.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“In complex or sensitive cases, removing the community from assessing credibility and fairness undermines trust in a way that cannot be compensated for by concentrating decisions in the hands of a single judge.”</p><p>A survey of Criminal Bar Association members found 88.5 percent are opposed to the creation of new “swift courts”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-english-history-of-jury-trials\">What is the English history of jury trials?</h2><p>The concept behind jury trials can be traced to the Magna Carta of 1215, which laid the foundations for parliamentary power. It stated that no free man could be punished “except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land”.</p><p>While this clause did not immediately lead to the establishment of juries as they are today, it cemented the idea that state power should be constrained and that local communities – the general populace, rather than just those with legal training – should play a role in trials.</p><p>By the end of the English Civil War around 1660, the independence of juries had become a key safeguard against arbitrary rule. The Bushel’s Case of 1670 cemented this by ruling that jurors could not be punished for their verdicts, establishing the principle of jury autonomy.</p><p>The English Bill of Rights in 1689 further entrenched the right of defendants to trial by jury, particularly in criminal matters, as a safeguard against interference or abuses by the King. Juries became symbols of both community participation and protection from state overreach.</p><p>As the British Empire expanded, the jury system travelled with it, influencing judicial systems in the United States, Canada, Australia, India and parts of Africa and the Caribbean. As such, the British model remains one of the most influential templates for due process around the world.</p><h2 id=\"have-any-other-countries-scrapped-jury-trials\">Have any other countries scrapped jury trials?</h2><p>In 1941, the Vichy regime under World War II German occupation in France replaced traditional juries with cours d’assises, courts composed mainly of judges. That system has been largely retained since then. Advocates claim it produces predictable verdicts, but critics say it has weakened the public role in administering justice.</p><p>Some parts of the former British Empire have retreated from traditional jury trials since their introduction by the British.</p><p>India abolished virtually all jury-led trials for criminal cases following a notorious murder trial in 1959, during which intense media pressure and perceived jury bias led to the controversial acquittal of Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati.</p><p>Singapore phased out juries between the 1960s and 1970s, arguing that a small, multilingual population made representative juries unreliable. Officials also claimed that complex commercial cases were too much for untrained people on juries to take on and required specialist judges.</p><p>Malaysia followed a similar path, abolishing jury trials in 1995. Officials pointed to the persistent difficulty of “empanelling” truly impartial jurors – a process that involves identifying, selecting and formally appointing citizens to hear a case.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Here is more about how the United States has used such strikes throughout history.</p><h2 id=\"did-the-us-carry-out-a-double-tap-strike\">Did the US carry out a double-tap strike?</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/video/newsfeed/2025/9/3/trump-says-us-strike-targeted-venezuelan-drug-smuggling-boat-2\">US military struck</a> a boat in the Caribbean on September 2, as part of its ongoing military campaign against drug-trafficking networks.</p><p>Its campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific has, so far, killed <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2025/11/15/us-confirms-four-people-killed-in-20th-strike-on-vessel-in-the-caribbean\">more than 80 people</a> while targeting at least 21 boats it claims were trafficking drugs. It has not provided any evidence to support this.</p><p>The first strike on September 2 destroyed one vessel and killed nine people. Two survivors were left clinging to debris in the water.</p><p>But the Washington Post has reported that mission commander Admiral Frank Bradley then authorised a second strike, killing the two survivors.</p><p>The Post reported that Bradley had acted after receiving a verbal directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. One source characterised that directive as: “The order was to kill everybody.” Hegseth has denied issuing such an order.</p><p>On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Bradley “worked well within his authority and the law” in ordering the second strike.</p><h2 id=\"has-the-us-used-double-tap-strikes-before\">Has the US used ‘double-tap’ strikes before?</h2><p>The US is believed to be one of the main countries to have used double-tap strikes extensively in recent history.</p><p>Here is a brief timeline of Washington’s alleged or confirmed use of double-tap strikes on various targets.</p><h3>2025: Yemen</h3><p>In April, the US conducted <a href=\"/news/2025/4/18/more-than-30-killed-80-injured-in-us-air-strikes-on-yemen-report\">air strikes</a> on the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen.</p><p>In a social media post, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said the objective of these strikes was “to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen”.</p><p>CENTCOM, the US military arm overseeing operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of South Asia, added: “Today, US forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists.”</p><p>The strike killed at least 80 people and wounded another 150, according to the Hodeidah Health Office in Yemen. The Houthi-led government said that the strikes had been made on a civilian facility.</p><p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an American Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, said the US struck the site a second time – a “double tap” – just as first responders were arriving at the scene. The US has never confirmed this attack was a double tap.</p><p>United Kingdom-based watchdog Airwars, which gathers open-source information, also recorded this incident as a double-tap attack in its online database.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>2017: Yemen</h3><p>In September 2017, two US drone strikes targeted the Al Saru area, a rural locality in the Sama’a district of Al Bayda governorate in central Yemen.</p><p>That area is under Houthi control. In 2017, al-Qaeda was believed to also be operating in rural parts of the area.</p><p>While casualty reports from those strikes vary, Airwars reported that the second strike hit people coming to the aid of those wounded in the first attack.</p><p>US CENTCOM confirmed that, in total, three strikes occurred in Al Bayda that day, killing “several” al-Qaeda members.</p><p>However, local media reported that between two and four civilians had also been killed.</p><p>In April 2017, the Pentagon confirmed that a US strike had killed eight al-Qaeda members in the Shabwa governorate. However, other reports suggested three civilians had also been killed, according to Airwars.</p><p>Sources, including the AFP news agency, suggested that those civilians were killed in the second of a double-tap attack after they had gone to help those hurt in the first strike.</p><h3>2012: Pakistan</h3><p>During the administration of US President Barack Obama, US missiles hit a tent in Zowi Sidgi, a remote village in North Waziristan, in July 2012, in what was described by people on the ground as a double strike. The US claimed it was targeting alleged al-Qaeda sanctuaries in the region.</p><p>According to Amnesty International’s Mustafa Qadri, who was speaking to the BBC at the time, a group of miners and woodcutters had gathered in the tent for dinner.</p><p>Moments after the first strike, when people had arrived to assist those who were hurt, a second US missile hit the same location, local people said. Eighteen people died in total in the two strikes.</p><p>The US has never publicly confirmed that this was a double-tap attack.</p><h3>2003 and 2004: Iraq</h3><p>In 2003, US forces in Baghdad fired at wounded Iraqis during the invasion of Baghdad, during Operation Thunder Run. The US military alleged that the Iraqis were pretending to be dead or injured and were, in fact, planning a surprise attack.</p><p>US reporter David Zucchino, who was embedded with the US military, reported that Iraqi soldiers who had appeared to be dead were getting up and firing at US vehicles from behind, after they passed by.</p><p>For this reason, US Army Lieutenant Colonel Eric Schwartz ordered US soldiers to “double tap” – or shoot at anyone who showed any signs of moving close to a weapon.</p><p>In 2004, US soldiers attacked the Fallujah mosque in the Al Anbar governorate of Iraq, claiming they were being fired upon. Afterwards, they shot at injured Iraqis inside the mosque.</p><p>NBC News correspondent Kevin Sites, who was embedded with the US military, reported that a US soldier had shot an unarmed, wounded Iraqi prisoner at the mosque. The next day, Sites filmed an American soldier shouting at Iraqis in the mosque, accusing them of pretending to be dead.</p><p>Footage from the mosque attack sparked controversy, prompting an investigation by the US military into whether a US soldier who shot a prisoner had acted in self-defence, legitimately fearing a surprise attack. Investigators found insufficient evidence to charge the soldier.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4145242\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4145242\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4145242\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2003-11-21T120000Z_599521578_PBEAHUOLWAL_RTRMADP_3_IRAQ-1764678689.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C571&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. soldiers arrive at the site of morning attacks in central Baghdad November 21, 2003. \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4145242\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US soldiers arrive at the site of morning attacks in central Baghdad on November 21, 2003 [File: Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-double-tap-strikes-a-war-crime\">Are double-tap strikes a war crime?</h2><p>While double-tap strikes are not explicitly deemed a war crime, international law restricts their use. The 1949 Geneva Conventions prohibit the targeting of medics, anyone assisting in rescue efforts, or those wounded in a first strike.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-history-of-double-tap-strikes\">What is the history of double-tap strikes?</h2><p>Double-tap strikes date back to the 19th century, when British soldiers fired at bodies of French soldiers who had fallen to the ground during fighting at the Battle of Waterloo.</p><p>This practice continued through World War I, when soldiers from both the Allied and Central Powers – including Britain, France and Germany – used bayonets to stab enemy soldiers lying on the ground.</p><p>During World War II, German, Soviet, Japanese, British and US troops used the tactic to ensure that the enemy soldiers who appeared dead were actually dead.</p><p>In more recent history, several other countries have also been accused of carrying out double-tap attacks.</p><p>According to evidence collected by Airwars, Israel conducted a double-tap shelling in Gaza’s Khan Younis in May this year, injuring at least three members of the Palestinian Civil Defence.</p><p>Overall, since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, Airwars has recorded 28 instances of Israel carrying out double-tap strikes in Gaza, which have killed or injured medics and civilians. These were mostly air strikes, with a few instances of artillery strikes.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The investigations came after Zuma-Mncube filed an affidavit against her sister. Zuma-Mncube claims to be the former president’s eldest daughter of at least 20 children from six wives. The current state of the relationship between the sisters is unclear.</p><p>Zuma-McNube’s affidavit, filed on November 22, alleged that Zuma-Sambudla, alongside two others, lured the 17 men to Russia on claims that they would receive yearlong security training and then return to South Africa. But the men were handed over to a Russian mercenary group and were sent to fight in Russia’s war on Ukraine instead, the affidavit continued. At least eight of the 17 men were members of the Zuma family, it added.</p><p>The affidavit listed the other two accused as Siphokazi Xuma and Blessing Khoza.</p><p>In a statement last week, Zuma-Mcnube said the three individuals had violated several South African laws relating to trafficking, providing foreign military assistance without government consent, and fraud.</p><p>“Driven by my moral obligation, I have opened a criminal case at the Sandton Police Station,” Zuma-Mcnube said, urging that the South African government should “expedite all diplomatic efforts to secure the immediate and safe return of our citizens”.</p><p>A father of three told The New York Times he received a phone call in July from someone who identified themself as Zuma-Sambudla to join a yearlong training program in Russia after which he would have a job working in security for the MK party. The man said six weeks after arriving in Russia, his trainers surprisingly gave him military fatigues, and he was sent to the front lines of the war in Ukraine’s Donbas region.</p><p>Another South African man who said he was on the front lines in Ukraine told the BBC that Zuma-Sambudla and other recruiters had bought him tickets to travel from South Africa.</p><p>South African officials said earlier on November 6 that they received distress signals from 17 South Africans aged between 20 and 39, who were asking to be removed from the front lines in Ukraine. Sixteen of the men were from the KwaZulu-Natal province, Zuma’s home region, while one was from the Eastern Cape. President Cyril Ramaphosa directed the police to investigate the case.</p><p>Speaking on the sidelines of the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/22/g20-leaders-adopt-new-declaration-even-as-us-boycotts-summit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">G20 Leaders’ Summit in Johannesburg</a> last week, Foreign Minister Richard Lamola said South Africa was talking to Russian and Ukrainian authorities to repatriate the trapped men.</p><p>“The police must investigate and whoever is involved in this must be arrested,” Lamola said, adding: “It is not an easy situation because they are [on] the front lines of this battle, but we are hopeful that there will be breakthroughs.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4138458\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4138458\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4138458\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13500365-1764380197.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"epa12517823 Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, appears in court on charges of terrorism in Durban, South Africa, 11 November 2025.

She pleaded not guilty to terrorism-related charges at the start of her trial [Stringer/EPA]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-the-five-people-who-have-been-charged\">Who are the five people who have been charged?</h2><p>Five people have been charged this week in relation to the alleged recruitment of men for the Russian military, according to South African police. Authorities said they responded to a tip-off as the group of five tried to leave the country on a flight from OR Tambo International Airport to Russia via the UAE. South African police say they are not yet treating this case as linked to the allegations against Zuma-Sambudla.</p><p>Among the five accused is prominent radio host Nonkululeko Patricia Mantula, 39, who works with the country’s public broadcaster, SAFM. The other four were men aged between 21 and 46, officials said, and Mantula was “facilitating the travel and recruitment” of the men into Russia, the police said.</p><p>All now face charges of violating a South African law banning foreign military assistance. A court set their next appearance on December 8 for a bail application.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-south-african-law-say-about-foreign-wars\">What does South African law say about foreign wars?</h2><p>It is a crime to serve in a foreign military without permission from the country’s National Conventional Arms Control Committee, according to South Africa’s 1998 <a href=\"http://www.gov.za/documents/acts/regulation-foreign-military-assistance-act-15-1998-20-may-1998\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act. </a></p><p>Authorisations may be denied if the requests are found to conflict with South Africa’s obligations under international law or if they will result in the infringement of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the territory in which the foreign military assistance is to be rendered.</p><p>The same act also bans mercenary activities entirely. South African residents or citizens are explicitly forbidden from recruiting, training, financing, or participating in mercenary activities.</p><p>Violating the law could attract a heavy fine, imprisonment, or both.</p><p>South Africa’s constitution also prohibits trafficking. It prohibits forced labour, as does the 1997 Basic Conditions of Employment Act.</p><p>Police authorities have not officially charged Zuma-Sambudla with a crime. Police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe told The Associated Press news agency that any police charges “are still to be determined through a thorough investigation”.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera, South Africa analyst Sanusha Naidu said the case was not likely to affect Russia-South Africa relations, which have become stronger in recent years under President Cyril Ramaphosa. Both countries are part of the BRICS and G20, both informal economic groupings of emerging powers often seen as an alternative to exclusive Western groups like the G7.</p><p>“I don’t think that the relationship is going to be any different now than in the past just because you have mercenaries who have been recruited by one person linked to the MK party,” she said. “[The recruitments] contravene our internal legislations, so it’s not going to shift the relations from where it is now.”</p><p>In October 2024, an AP investigation found that young African women were being lured to work at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia’s Tatarstan region, where some helped produce military grade drones. Several African governments – including South Africa in August – have issued warnings to women, asking them to be cautious of foreign work schemes.</p><p>Kenyan authorities, in September, said they rescued more than 20 people from a suspected trafficking ring that had intended to lure them to fight in the Ukraine war with promises of jobs in Russia. Officials said some 200 Kenyans are already fighting for Russia.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-zuma-sambudla-said\">What has Zuma-Sambudla said?</h2><p>In a statement submitted to police authorities last Monday, Zuma-Sambudla claimed she herself was a “victim” of the scheme, alleging that she had been deceived by a person called Blessing Rhulani Khoza, who she said contacted her on WhatsApp with promises of lucrative security contracts in Russia. The politician said she travelled to Russia on her own and was exposed to “non-combat, controlled activities” which convinced her of the legitimacy of the scheme.</p><p>“Prior to this unsolicited message, I had no relationship, acquaintance, or prior knowledge of this person whatsoever,” she wrote. Zuma-Sambudla claimed she again flew to Russia after hearing the men, including her family members, were sent to battle, and that she filed appeals with Russian officials and the South African embassy there.</p><p>“I shared information innocently. They chose to join on their voluntary interest,” she added. “I would not, under any circumstances, knowingly expose my own family or any other person to harm.”</p><p>Zuma-Sambudla had served as a parliament member for the MK party since June 2024. Her father founded the opposition party after he was <a href=\"/news/2024/1/31/why-did-south-africas-ruling-anc-suspend-ex-president-jacob-zuma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dramatically expelled </a>from the then-ruling African National Congress (ANC) on allegations of misconduct. Zuma and President Ramaphosa, once close allies, have been bitter political rivals in recent years, and the MK is currently the largest opposition party in parliament.</p><p>On Friday, MK party President Magasela Mzobe said at a media briefing that Zuma-Sambudla had resigned “to focus on helping families to return to loved ones”. Her resignation, Mzobe added, was not an “admission of guilt” or the result of the organisation finding her guilty of any wrongdoing.</p><p>Former President Zuma has not commented on the case.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance party, a former opposition party that joined the ruling coalition alongside the ANC since 2024, sued Zuma-Sambudla last Thursday, on charges of human trafficking and recruitment for mercenary activities.</p><p>The DA – which has long been against South Africa’s closeness with Moscow <a href=\"/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/\">amid Russia’s war on Ukraine</a> – alleged it had access to messages from a WhatsApp group chat “administered” by Zuma-Sambudla, and claimed the Ramaphosa presidency and Zuma knew about the recruitments.</p><p>The chats “show clear coordination in luring at least 22 men to Russia under the guise of ‘personal development’, ‘security training’, and even promises of Russian or Canadian citizenship”, the party said.</p><p>The men’s passports were confiscated, their clothes burned, and their communication with families cut off once in Russia, the DA said. Three men who had well-placed family connections were returned to South Africa, the party added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He was a top peace negotiator and made strategic decisions about the war with Russia that led to disastrous miscalculations and losses, according to a four-star general.</p><p>Yermak “formed an entire system of appointing people in state administration, ministries and military agencies”, Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Such concentration of power turned Yermak into a seemingly unsinkable, Machiavellian figure as he gained notoriety among Ukrainian officials and top brass, Western leaders and diplomats for his abrasive manners, reluctance to compromise and heavy-handed handling of subordinates.</p><p>And yet, Yermak’s team of negotiators managed to convince Washington to remove some of the most contentious parts of the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/trump-wants-us-to-capitulate-to-russia-ukrainians-aghast-at-peace-plan\">28-point peace plan</a> that many in Ukraine and the West called a carbon copy of the Kremlin’s wish list.</p><p>But on Friday, Zelenskyy fired Yermak – after months of Western pressure and speculation about his role in a $100m corruption <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/could-ukraines-corruption-crisis-lead-to-military-defeat-against-russia\">scandal</a>, an hours-long search of his apartment and a “30-minute-long tantrum with cursing, reproaches and accusations”, according to a Ukrainian daily.</p><p>“Until the last minute, Yermak didn’t believe that the First One [Zelenskyy] will have him sacked,” a government source told the Pravda outlet.</p><p>The firing followed a consensus among key political figures, even the ones appointed by Yermak, the daily reported.</p><p>Zelenskyy diplomatically called the sacking a “resignation”.</p><p>“I’m grateful to Andriy for always representing Ukraine’s position in the negotiation track exactly the way it should be represented,” he said in a video address.</p><p>Hours later, Yermak made a single statement most likely aimed at United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>“I’m going to the front[line] and am prepared for any reprisals. I am an honest and decent person,” he said in a text message in English sent to a reporter with the New York Post, reportedly Trump’s favourite newspaper.</p><p>Some Ukrainians are still deeply pessimistic about the political games amid daily blackouts, Russian air raids, soaring prices and hopelessness about the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/russia-says-it-captured-pokrovsk-a-key-logistics-hub-in-eastern-ukraine\">war’s end</a>.</p><p>“<a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/23/a-corruption-scandal-may-well-end-the-war-in-ukraine\">Corruption</a> is a hydra,” said Taras Tymoshchuk, a 43-year-old retired serviceman, who suffered injuries and contusions while fighting pro-Russian separatists in the eastern region of Donbas between 2015 and 2017.</p><p>“Yermak is the head we all knew. He’s been cut off, but many more will grow in his place,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But another disgraced figure – <a href=\"/features/2020/4/17/why-is-a-heroine-of-ukraines-revolution-charged-with-murder\">Tetiana Chornovol</a>, an ex-lawmaker and journalist who enlisted after being charged with arson and premeditated murder – said she would let Yermak join her small squad as a drone operator.</p><p>During the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Chornovol assaulted pro-Russian figures, led protesters to seize the city hall and was said to have incited them to throw Molotov cocktails into an office of ex-President Victor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions, according to Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigations. A 57-year-old IT expert suffocated in the smoke.</p><p>“He’ll be a regular fighter without a past,” Chornovol wrote of Yermik on Facebook on Saturday.</p><p>However, self-banishment to the front line does not make Yermak immune to the consequences that may stem from a huge investigation into corruption schemes around the state-controlled nuclear power monopoly.</p><p>Now, Ukraine and its allies are pondering the aftermath of Yermak’s dismissal, while speculating over his successor.</p><p>“The replacement will be quite painful,” Romanenko said.</p><p>Yermak was widely blamed for mismanaging Kyiv’s talks with Moscow before the full-scale invasion in 2022 – and for downplaying the invasion that, as he reportedly said, he “didn’t believe would really happen”.</p><p>Yermak’s “defence plans were largely unrealistic and have not been implemented”, Romanenko said.</p><p>Yermak also opposed drastic steps such as the huge mobilisation of all men of fighting age and the imposition of martial law that would “put the economy on a wartime track”, Romanenko said.</p><p>Yermak’s replacement should be proposed by the president but voted in by Parliament.</p><p>There’s already a list of possible candidates – Deputy Prime Minister Mikhaylo Fyodorov, Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal and Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya.</p><p>Zelenskyy may also appoint a political dark horse, an unknown figure with a military background and front-line experience, to cheer up top brass and average servicemen.</p><p>On Saturday, Zelenskyy reportedly conferred with the heads of military and intelligence agencies – and Pavlo Palisa, 40, a decorated colonel who graduated from a US military college in 2022, fought in the months-long battle for the eastern town of Bakhmut and became Yermak’s deputy in November 2024.</p><p>None of Yermak’s possible successors will have his reputation, notoriety and years-long personal relations with the president – and none is likely to regain his clout.</p><h2 id=\"corruption-track-extremely-useful-to-us\">‘Corruption track extremely useful to US’</h2><p>However, the dismissal will benefit Kyiv in the coming weeks amid resumed peace talks as Washington has lost an ace up its sleeve – Yermak’s presumed involvement in corruption schemes involving multi-billion Western aid.</p><p>“The corruption track in Ukraine was extremely useful to the United States from the viewpoint of pressuring Zelenskyy personally,” Kyiv-based analyst Ihar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Zelenskyy considered Yermak an irreplaceable ally and enforcer of his will – and Washington could have used it to demand political concessions in exchange for keeping him, Tyshkevich said.</p><p>Yermak’s resignation removes the “blackmail format” while Ukrainian negotiators could say that Kyiv is about to restructure the decision-making process, he said.</p><p>Some Western partners were also “tense” about Yermak’s decisions that sidelined Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he said.</p><p>“As paradoxical as it sounds, in the short-term perspective, [Yermak’s resignation] certainly strengthens Zelenskyy,” Tyshkevich said.</p><p>But by early 2026, whoever replaces Yermak will have to make “several right decisions” to further strengthen Zelenskyy, he said.</p><p>For now, the president faces an immediate dilemma.</p><p>He could opt to keep the highly personalised system Yermak built, or dismantle it to allow figures once opposed to Yermak to work closer with Zelenskyy, Tyshkevich said.</p><p>Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party formally dominates the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s lower house of parliament, but there is infighting and squabbles.</p></div></div></body></html>"
