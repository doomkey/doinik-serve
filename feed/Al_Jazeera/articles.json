It leads the field with nine nominations overall.</p><p>Anderson was not the only cinematic “auteur” to receive laurels from the Golden Globe Foundation.</p><p>Chloe Zhao’s historical tear-jerker Hamnet — based on the relationship between playwright William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes — nabbed six nominations in various drama categories.</p><p>And Ryan Coogler’s springtime crowd-pleaser Sinners — a vampire film and cultural commentary, wrapped in one — scored seven nods, including Best Drama, Best Director and Best Cinematic Achievement.</p><p>While the Golden Globes are often seen as a cozy, champagne-clacking affair for Hollywood titans, this year’s nominations also suggest an ever-more international scope for its honourees.</p><p>The meditative Norwegian drama Sentimental Value scooped up eight nominations, and the French nominee It Was Just an Accident, by Iranian director Jafar Panahi, earned four.</p><p>South Korea and Brazil also broke free from the Non-English Language Film category, scoring nominations in the acting, songwriting and animation competitions for films like KPop Demon Hunters, No Other Choice and The Secret Agent.</p><p>Some pieces of award bait, meanwhile, failed to deliver on their potential. Director Luca Guadagnino’s slippery, post-MeToo drama After the Hunt, for example, only scored a single nomination for star Julia Roberts.</p><p>Likewise, the musical film Wicked: For Good — the sequel to last year’s award-season juggernaut — disappointed its expectations. While it scored nods in acting and song categories, it failed to land in contention for some of the biggest prizes, including Best Motion Picture: Comedy or Musical.</p><p>The 83rd annual Golden Globes are scheduled to air on January 11, 2026.

When he arrived, he saw Syria’s future president emerging from the historic mosque.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"because-of-this-liberation-i-have-hope\">‘Because of this liberation, I have hope’</h2><p>Al Jazeera first met Yamen a few days later, outside that same mosque on the first Friday after the liberation of Damascus.</p><p>“Because of this liberation, I have hope,” <a href=\"/features/2024/12/30/syria-end-of-fear-assad-damascus-aleppo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/features/2024/12/30/syria-end-of-fear-assad-damascus-aleppo\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">he said at the time</a>.</p><p>On December 7, 2025, Yamen was still filled with positivity on the eve of the anniversary of the liberation of Damascus. At 21 years old, his face was fuller than a year ago, and he spoke calmly with an intellectual air.</p><p>He listed a number of things that he felt had been improved by the new government, led by al-Sharaa.</p><p>The streets had been upgraded, infrastructure had been repaired, the exchange rate had improved, the health sector was getting better, and employees’ salaries had been raised, he said.</p><p>“What I have mentioned is just the tip of the iceberg, so there’s still more to improve, God willing, much more.”</p><p>He also pointed to the issue of freedom of expression. Under al-Assad, any criticism of the regime could end in imprisonment.</p><p>Many Syrians told Al Jazeera that having dollars or even speaking the word aloud on a mobile phone could result in punishment or imprisonment.</p><p>“The issue of freedom of expression is one of the issues that has made the most difference,” he said.</p><p>He pointed out recent antigovernment protests in <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/syria-extends-homs-curfew-as-killings-threaten-to-inflame-sectarian-tension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/news/2025/11/24/syria-extends-homs-curfew-as-killings-threaten-to-inflame-sectarian-tension\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Homs</a> and the Syrian coast, where troops affiliated with the new government contributed to <a href=\"/features/2025/3/20/dont-trust-anyone-are-syrias-alawis-losing-faith-in-the-new-government\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/features/2025/3/20/dont-trust-anyone-are-syrias-alawis-losing-faith-in-the-new-government\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">widespread sectarian violence</a> in March.</p><p>“Right now, we are sitting here. For example, you might disagree with me on a political opinion. But under the old regime, you were careful with every word,” Yamen said.</p><p>On the actual anniversary, the next day, Yamen headed down to Umayyad Square to take part in the celebrations and the collective euphoria and joy.</p><p>Tens of thousands were expected to attend. By 3pm (12:00 GMT), fireworks burst overhead as helicopters and powered paragliders flew through the sky, while below the square was already full of people waving the green, black and white Syrian flag.</p><p>People continued to pour in for the processions, which the government said would start at 8pm (17:00 GMT).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"i-can-help-this-country\">‘I can help this country’</h2><p>Jobar is still destroyed, and rebuilding will take years. Yamen compared the destruction of the area with the destruction Israel has unleashed on Gaza.</p><p>Under the Assad regime, dozens of areas were obliterated through barrel bombs, air raids, and siege. The World Bank has estimated the reconstruction costs in Syria will require between $140bn and $345bn.</p><p>“I will never forget the time of our forced displacement,” he said. “Our region, our people, our families in Ghouta and Jobar were displaced.”</p><p>Still, Yamen no longer dreams of Spain.</p><p>“There are things that make me want to challenge everything and stay, I mean, this is something that’s not about me,” he said. He is in his final year studying law and hopes to find work upon his graduation.</p><p>“I am ultimately a member of society. Before, corruption in the legal field filled me with doubt about working here,” Yamen said.</p><p>“But today, if I find a good opportunity after graduation, either in the private sector or working with the state, I will take it so that I can help this country.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

IndiGo is the only airline that connects many smaller cities and towns in India, such as Shillong, Kolhapur, Prayagraj, Agra and Deogarh, giving it a monopoly on those sectors.</p><p>On Friday, about 1,600 flights were cancelled. A day later, more than 700 flights were cancelled, followed by some 650 flights on Sunday. More than 400 flights have been cancelled so far on Monday.</p><p>The disruptions have caused a huge outcry.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-new-guidelines-on-pilot-rest-and-duty-hours\">What are the new guidelines on pilot rest and duty hours?</h2><p>Early in 2024, the Indian government introduced new Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations to improve pilots’ working hours, rest periods, and fatigue management across Indian airlines. These rules reduced the maximum daily duty hours and tightened rest requirements, aligning more closely with international fatigue‑risk norms.</p><p>The new rules, which came into effect on November 1, asked airlines to:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Increase pilots’ mandatory weekly rest period from 36 to 48 hours. A pilot’s personal leave request, however, cannot be included under the mandatory rest period.</li>\n<li>Cap pilots’ flying hours that continue into the night to 10 hours.</li>\n<li>Cap the weekly number of landings a pilot can make between midnight and early morning to two.</li>\n<li>Submit pilots’ fatigue reports every quarter to India’s aviation regulator – the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).</li>\n</ul><p>Aviation experts and pilot unions have blamed IndiGo for poor preparation and negligence in adapting to the new rules. Former AirAsia CFO Vijay Gopalan attributed the crisis to IndiGo’s “very, very lackadaisical, nonchalant attitude” towards adapting to the latest regulations.</p><p>“Despite the two-year preparatory window before full FDTL implementation, the airline inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze, entered non-poaching arrangements, maintained a pilot pay freeze through cartel-like behaviour, and demonstrated other short-sighted planning practices,” the Federation of Indian Pilots told the Press Trust of India news agency on December 4.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-india-introduce-flight-duty-time-limitations\">Why did India introduce Flight Duty Time Limitations?</h2><p>The Indian civil aviation authorities introduced the FDTL regulations to address pilot fatigue and safety concerns, bringing them closer to international standards.</p><p>These international standards are set by bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency which sets global aviation standards and coordinates international air transport, and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).</p><p>The new regulations were introduced after years of lobbying by pilot unions and associations in India, including the Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA), for updated fatigue rules. They raised concerns about operational safety risks and health impacts from long, irregular hours.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-it-like-to-be-a-pilot-in-india\">What is it like to be a pilot in India?</h2><p>Pawan*, a commercial pilot with an Indian airline, told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, “You need to have completed about 200 hours of flight time through a training institution before working with an airline.”</p><p>As a child, Pawan lived in a housing society with pilots, engineers and airport managers because his father was also a pilot. These factors inspired him to become a pilot.</p><p>He added that, unlike many industries with annual inflation‑linked raises, pilot salaries rarely increase, and benefits are mostly standard – staff flight tickets for family, limited medical insurance and compensation if a licence is lost due to medical reasons or death.</p><p>“From a lot of people that I’ve interacted with in the industry who’ve been here now 15 years close to the company, they are saying things like, ‘I feel like I’m earning the same thing I earned 10 years back, or maybe even less,'” Pawan, who has been a pilot in India for almost a decade, said.</p><p>Different websites have different estimates for the average salary earned by pilots in India.</p><p>The New Delhi-based FMS Aviation Academy estimates that the annual salary of new Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) holders starts from 400,000 rupees ($4,400), as of 2025.</p><p>According to the academy, the annual salary of senior captains for commercial airlines can exceed 10 million rupees ($120,000). Another New Delhi-based aviation school, We One Aviation, cites the same figure for the salary of senior captains.</p><p>The entry-level job is a junior first officer or cadet. After sufficient flying hours, one is promoted to become a senior. After more than 3,000 hours of flying, pilots take the Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) theoretical test to become a captain, a position that allows them to take full responsibility for the flight.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-india-compare-with-the-rest-of-the-world\">How does India compare with the rest of the world?</h2><p>International bodies like the ICAO do not prescribe specific limits to the number of hours or number of flights pilots can safely operate to avoid fatigue. Different countries have different regulations.</p><p>For example, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) says pilots should get a minimum 48-hour break in any consecutive seven‑day period. Night duty is capped at nine to 10 hours. It does not state an explicit landing cap. In Australia, pilots can earn approximately 200,000 Australian dollars ($134,000) a year, and captains can earn up to 400,000 Australian dollars ($268,000) a year, according to the Melbourne-based Holmes Aviation Institute.</p><p>According to Canadian Aviation Regulations, pilots must get at least 36 consecutive hours off during any seven‑day period when they are operating from their normal home base. The night duty is limited to eight to 10 hours. There is no formal cap on night landings. In Canada, pilots can make between 38,000 Canadian dollars ($27,740) and 250,000 Canadian dollars ($182,500) a year, according to the Ontario-based institute, Flight Trainers.</p><p>The EASA sets the weekly rest to a minimum of 36 hours, which can be reduced to 24 hours with compensation. The average annual salaries for airline pilots across 17 European countries range from 32,299 euros ($35,000) in Romania to 113,672 euros ($122,776) in Switzerland as of 2025, according to the ERI Economic Research Institute.</p><p>In the United States, flight crew members get 30 consecutive hours free from all duty during a consecutive seven-day period of work. It caps the night duty to nine to 10 hours. There is no formal cap on night landings. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median pay for commercial pilots in 2024 was $198,100 per year.</p><p><em><strong>*Name changed to maintain anonymity</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The United States cannot replace European citizens in deciding which are the right parties and the wrong parties,” Costa said.</p><p>“The United States cannot replace Europe in its vision of freedom of speech,” he noted, adding, “Our history has taught us that there is no freedom of speech without freedom of information.”</p><h2 id=\"ideology-not-strategy\">‘Ideology, not strategy’</h2><p>In Berlin, Sebastian Hille, a deputy spokesperson for the German government, said some of the criticisms in the document were “ideology rather than strategy”.</p><p>“Political freedoms, including the right to freedom of expression, are among the fundamental values of the EU,” he said.</p><p>He said Berlin also disagreed with the document’s failure to classify Russia, which in February 2022 launched a full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, as a threat.</p><p>“We stand by NATO’s joint analysis, according to which Russia is a danger and a threat to trans-Atlantic security,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"divisions-over-russia\">Divisions over Russia</h2><p>The US strategy document makes clear that Washington wants to improve its relationship with Moscow, saying that it has a “core interest” in ending the conflict with Ukraine to “reestablish strategic stability with Russia”, while hitting out at European officials’ “unrealistic expectations” for a solution to the war.</p><p>An initial US plan for ending the war, which would have allowed Russia to hold on to large territories in eastern Ukraine, sparked <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/us-ukraine-talks-why-are-european-leaders-opposing-trumps-peace-plan\">criticism</a> from European leaders amid concerns that Washington is trying to force Kyiv to accept unfavourable <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/zelenskyy-says-territorial-concessions-remain-ukraines-biggest-challenge\">terms</a>.</p><p>The plan has since been altered, first with input from Ukraine alongside its European allies and then in meetings between Ukrainian and US officials. The full details of the proposal as it stands have not been disclosed.</p><p>By contrast, Moscow <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/russia-welcomes-trumps-revised-us-security-strategy\">has welcomed</a> Trump’s strategy document.</p><p>Costa said that given the strategy document’s position on Ukraine, “we can understand why Moscow shares [its] vision.”</p><p>“The objective in this strategy is not a fair and durable peace. It’s only [about] the end of hostilities, and the stability of relations with Russia,” he said.</p><p>“Everyone wants stable relations with Russia,” Costa said, but “we can’t have stable relations with Russia when Russia remains a threat to our security”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Over the last two months in Darfur, Sudan, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have committed <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/rsf-digging-mass-graves-in-sudans-el-fasher-to-clean-up-massacre-expert\">horrifying atrocities</a> in the city of el-Fasher. There, they have fired on and killed civilians already shattered by more than 500 days of siege; people already so starved they have been forced to eat animal feed.</p><p>People who have managed to escape – often walking to the town of Tawila, 60km (37 miles) southwest of el-Fasher – are deeply traumatised. The killings have been indiscriminate and ethnically targeted, according to testimonies of survivors that Médecins Sans Frontières  (Doctors Without Borders – MSF) teams treat in Tawila. Women report harrowing testimonies of rape. <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/hundreds-of-children-terrified-and-alone-after-fleeing-sudans-el-fasher\">Children</a> have arrived, terrified, in the arms of strangers, having been orphaned in el-Fasher.</p><p>People have been massacred, tortured, and summarily executed. Many remain stranded or unaccounted for as the violence that has swept through the city continues unchecked; several thousand people remain detained, held for ransom.</p><p>My Sudanese colleagues are treating patients as they await news of their relatives. Most of my colleagues in Tawila have family members, friends, or colleagues whom the RSF killed in el-Fasher.</p><p>While the scenes unfolding across Darfur are shocking and outrageous, we should not be surprised. For months, Sudanese people and many observers, including MSF, have been warning that this massacre would be the inevitable result of the RSF takeover of el-Fasher.</p><p>That is because we had seen it before. At the onset of the war in 2023, at least <a href=\"/features/2024/6/25/a-massacre-an-exodus-from-darfur-and-years-of-rehab-for-sudanese-refugees\">15,000 people</a>, mainly belonging to the Masalit and other non-Arab communities, were killed as the RSF took West Darfur’s capital, el-Geneina. Displaced and injured people treated by MSF in Chad reported being attacked because of their tribe or ethnicity and were told to “leave this country or die”. An MSF retrospective mortality <a href=\"https://www.msf.org/msf-survey-sheds-new-light-scale-and-intensity-ethnic-violence-west-darfur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> showed rates 20 times higher in the months following April 2023, compared with pre-war figures. Nearly one man in 20 aged between 15 and 44 was reported missing during this period. El-Geneina is now virtually empty of Masalit people.</p><p>The Zamzam camp, on the outskirts of el-Fasher, was once the country’s largest displacement camp. The carnage that occurred there when the RSF launched a large-scale assault in April was not a wake-up call either. Well before those massacres, our teams in Zamzam had repeatedly warned of the scale of malnutrition and called for a massive humanitarian response – to no avail.</p><p>Even when a state of famine was declared in the camp in August 2024, MSF trucks carrying food supplies were stuck for months in North Darfur; the RSF ordered them to go anywhere but near el-Fasher. Later, the displaced and besieged communities were regularly hit by shelling, forcing MSF to leave the camp in February 2025.</p><p>Far from being the actions of rogue RSF commanders, the mass atrocities culminating in el-Fasher have been part of a deliberate campaign to starve, forcibly displace, and kill civilians, often along ethnic lines.</p><p>The RSF, which, according to reports by international organisations and media outlets, is supported by the United Arab Emirates, bears responsibility for the crimes it has committed in el-Fasher. It must immediately halt mass atrocities and ethnically targeted killings and provide a safe passage to survivors.</p><p>Warring parties must uphold the obligations they have under international humanitarian law, but also those under basic humanity. Both parties must grant immediate humanitarian access to people in need, regardless of who controls the territory.</p><p>But that this tragedy was so predictable underscores how shared and collective the overall failure to protect civilians is.</p><p>The death and destruction are being enabled by too many governments choosing not to use their influence to try to pressure the warring parties to stop killing people or blocking humanitarian aid. Choosing to issue passive statements of concern, while they and their allies provide financial and political support, and the weapons that destroy, maim, and kill.</p><p>More than 20 years ago, when similar extreme violence was committed, the world mobilised for Darfur. The International Criminal Court charged former President Omar al-Bashir with crimes against humanity and genocide for the atrocities committed by his army and and the Janjaweed militias, which later were reorganised into the RSF.</p><p>Today, as other crimes are committed against the same ethnic groups, world leaders cannot look away. Countries that have influence with the warring parties, including the United States, the UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, known as the Quad, must act to prevent further atrocities.</p><p>As the dust settles on the horrors of el-Fasher, we must refuse to move towards a “new normal” of accepting such atrocities. We need political commitment, sustained humanitarian mobilisation based on an impartial evaluation of the situation, and accountability. Last month, the UN Human Rights Council <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/un-rights-council-orders-probe-of-appalling-abuses-in-sudans-el-fasher\">tasked</a> the independent fact-finding mission for Sudan to investigate crimes committed in el-Fasher – a process which we call on all states and parties to support.</p><p>We need to do more for people whose lives are still in danger in el-Fasher and the surrounding towns. And we need to make sure that the cycle of violence and ethnic cleansing finally comes to an end in Darfur.</p><p>The conflict dynamics under way seem to indicate that the excruciating plight of el-Fasher may not be the end of horrific violence, but rather a milestone in a catastrophic war that keeps crushing civilian lives, notably at this moment in the Kordofan region. We fear that more civilian victims and other scenes of atrocities will unfold.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Far-right groups in Europe such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Vox in Spain, Front Populaire in France and Lega Nord in Italy, among others, have built their electoral campaigns on anti-immigrant and xenophobic narratives.</p><p>On Friday last week, Carl Bildt, Sweden’s former prime minister, wrote in a post on X that “in saying that Europe faces ‘civilizational erasure’ the Trump new security strategy places itself to the right of the extreme right in Europe”.</p><p></p><p>Gerard Araud, former French ambassador to the US, also wrote on X that “the stunning section devoted to Europe reads like a far-right pamphlet. It largely confirms this perception.”</p><p></p><p>Mark Sedgwick, a professor of Arab and Islamic Studies at Aarhus University in Denmark, told US broadcaster NBC that the language of the Trump administration’s national security strategy also fits with the language used by supporters of the “great replacement” conspiracy theory.</p><p>That conspiracy theory was first introduced by French author Renaud Camus in his book Le Grand Remplacement in 2011, and claimed that “elites” in France were trying to replace the White European population by encouraging immigration from Muslim-majority countries.</p><p>Since then, it has been used by far-right groups in the West, including the US, to campaign against mass immigration.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Trump administration document suggests that “Western Europe is no longer a top priority for the US,” according to Gregoire Roos, director of the Europe and Russia and Eurasia Programmes at Chatham House.</p><p>What this means is that the Trump administration now “looks [more] favourably on central and Eastern Europe, where there are closer political proximities”, Roos told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“While they don’t agree on everything, countries such as Slovakia and Hungary share views [with the US] on EU bureaucracy, non-European migration as a threat to identity, and greater caution when it comes to siding with Ukraine in its war against Russia,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-trump-aligning-with-europe-s\">Why is Trump aligning with Europe’s far right?</h2><p>Washington’s relations with European far-right leaders have certainly improved since Trump returned to office in January.</p><p>Late on Thursday, through the NSS, the Trump administration called on Washington to take a role in “cultivating resistance” within Europe and encouraged “its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit”.</p><p>“We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilisational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation,” the Trump administration added.</p><p>According to a December 5 report by The Associated Press news agency, Markus Frohnmaier, a member of Germany’s AfD, said Trump’s NSS is “a foreign policy reality check for Europe and particularly for Germany”.</p><p>But Roberto Forin, acting director of the Geneva-based Mixed Migration Centre (MMC), told Al Jazeera that the Trump administration’s NSS doctrine is an “unapologetic defence of whiteness”, and called it a “suprematist’s discourse”.</p><p>“The objective of the current administration is to divide Europe, and polarise the continent by weaponising migration,” he said.</p><p>“It is another example of how the new US administration is leading the race when it comes to not only migration issues, but rather multiculturalism,” he added.</p><p>On December 4, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters in Berlin that Europe is able to deal with its issues without foreign interference. He said that while Washington remains an important security partner in Europe, the alliance is “focused on addressing security policy issues” and not topics such as the continent’s freedom of speech and expression.</p><p>“We see ourselves as being able to discuss and debate these matters entirely on our own in the future, and do not need outside advice,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-else-has-washington-s-nss-said-about-europe\">What else has Washington’s NSS said about Europe?</h2><p>Amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, the NSS document targeted European officials’ “unrealistic expectations” for ending the conflict, stating that the US has a “core interest” in doing so.</p><p>According to the Reuters news agency, Pentagon officials told diplomats in Washington this week that the US was not yet satisfied with Europe’s defence spending amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and said the US may stop participating in NATO by 2027 if European countries do not increase their investment.</p><p>The NSS stated that Washington would prioritise “enabling Europe to stand on its own feet and operate as a group of aligned sovereign nations, including by taking primary responsibility for its own defence, without being dominated by any adversarial power”.</p><p>European countries, including Germany, France and the UK, have announced they will increase their defence spending and investments in military amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. At the NATO Summit in June, members of the alliance <a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/nato-commits-to-major-defence-spending-hike-sought-by-trump\">pledged</a> to allocate up to 5 percent of their national GDP to defence and related sectors by 2035.</p><p>But on December 3, a US official told Politico that US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels that the EU should focus on “turning its defence commitments into capabilities” and highlighted that “protectionist and exclusionary policies that bully American companies out of the market” should be avoided since it “undermines” NATO’s “collective defence”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-this-bolster-europe-s-far-right\">Will this bolster Europe’s far right?</h2><p>Ian Lesser, a fellow and head of The German Marshall Fund of the US (GMF)’s Brussels office, said in a report that EU and NATO observers are likely to view the NSS as “confirmation of established concerns about the direction and style of American policy”.</p><p>But he warned that it also “points to European cultural and demographic decline in ways likely to reinforce the views of hard-right elements in Europe”.</p><p>“Viewed from Brussels, the strategy underscores the reality of an administration that is not isolationist but rather hyper unilateralist,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
