It’s covered in water. Everything inside is wet.”</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>A few metres away lies a pile of smashed concrete blocks and twisted metal. It is the rubble of a building that <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/building-collapse-in-northern-lebanon-kills-at-least-six\">collapsed on February 8</a>, killing at least 15 people.</p><p>In Tripoli, collapsed buildings are fast becoming common. This is the fourth building to collapse this winter alone. Today, hundreds of buildings are at risk of collapse due to a lethal combination of ageing infrastructure, unregulated construction, Lebanon’s 2019 <a href=\"/news/2025/3/10/whats-happening-with-lebanons-economy-and-will-it-recover\">economic crisis</a>, the <a href=\"/tag/turkey-syria-earthquake/\">2023 earthquake</a> that fractured much of the local infrastructure’s foundation, and a relatively heavy rain season.</p><p>Locals like Hazrouni are afraid their buildings will be next.</p><p>“They told us that you should evacuate and you shouldn’t stay, but how are we supposed to leave when we are in a bad situation?” he asked, raising his palms to the sky. “Where are we supposed to go?”</p><h2 id=\"collapsing-structures\">Collapsing structures</h2><p>In the 1950s, Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest city and the largest in the country’s north, was a hub for trade and shipping in the region. But in the intervening years, its status has fallen to become one of the poorest cities on the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>It is also a city of massive disparity. Multiple billionaires live in Tripoli, including the former Prime Minister Najib Mikati and former Minister of Finance Mohammad Safadi, while about 45 percent of the city’s population lives in poverty, according to a 2024 World Bank report.</p><p>Over the years, most of Tripoli’s middle- and upper-class residents have moved to the southern edge of the city, leaving behind its impoverished classes to inhabit the decaying old city. Many of the poor know their concrete buildings are ageing and in poor condition, but have little means to fix them.</p><p>“The first problem is that the structures are old,” Fayssal al-Baccar, an engineer, told Al Jazeera from a restaurant in southern Tripoli. Al-Baccar is also the founder of the Tripoli Emergency Fund, a private initiative started in response to the collapsing building issue that has been fundraising to help the city.</p><p>“The lifespan of concrete is between 50 to 80 years,” al-Baccar explained, and in many of the buildings in central Tripoli, that lifespan is coming to an end. On a sheet of white paper with a blue pen, he drew a model of a building’s foundation.</p><p>“Through time, the pH [level] of the concrete will become more and more acidic,” he said, sketching lines around the base of his drawn wall. “Then it will corrode the steel – the steel will self-destruct – and the building will collapse.”</p><p>The issue has been exacerbated by a few incidents in particular. When a 2023 earthquake devastated northern Syria and southern Turkiye, it was widely felt in Tripoli as well. Local officials say that it damaged much of the infrastructural foundations of older buildings, many of which have had irregular or unregulated floors added to them, making them weaker. The area has also suffered from neglect and a lack of infrastructure for years, even before the 2019 economic and banking crisis.</p><p>Lastly, there is the issue of water damage. This year, Lebanon has received more rainfall than in the last couple of years. And in the days leading up to the collapsed building on February 8, it rained multiple times. “Water is infiltrating into the concrete and is also making the steel worse,” al-Baccar said.</p><p>That is why al-Baccar has recruited whom he described as some of the city’s “best and most successful” to help fill governmental gaps.</p><p>One of those people is Sarah al-Charif, the Tripoli Emergency Fund’s spokesperson and fundraising committee member. She is also the Lebanon director for Ruwwad Al Tanmeya, a nonprofit focused on youth and disenfranchised communities, and was appointed vice president of Tripoli’s Port Authority last year.</p><p>“You’re talking about areas where most, if not all, of the buildings are old and dilapidated, some of which are actually on the verge of collapse,” al-Charif said from her office at Ruwwad Al Tanmeya’s office in Bab al-Tabbaneh, less than a kilometre (0.62 miles) away from where the building collapsed on February 8.</p><p>“The fact that the problem is so big reflects decades of accumulated neglect by a state that hasn’t fulfilled its obligations towards this city,” she said.</p><p>Al-Charif said she doesn’t hold the current government – <a href=\"/news/2025/2/26/lebanons-new-government-wins-confidence-vote-in-parliament\">which took office a year ago</a> – responsible, but that historically, “people who were in positions of power didn’t do anything, they weren’t fulfilling their duties”.</p><p>“There’s also a part that falls on the landlord, a part that falls on the tenant, and a part that falls on the merchants who are the builders. Maybe they’re using substandard materials,” she said. “So everyone has to take their share of the responsibility.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"historical-neglect\">Historical neglect</h2><p>Standing on the street, Wissam Kafrouni, 70, points to the top floor of a building just a few doors down from the structure that collapsed on February 8. A crack runs zig-zagging down the building’s side, in the pattern of descending stairs. His nephew rents the top-floor apartment, he says, but the landlord is claiming that repairs are the responsibility of the tenant.</p><p>Locals in this neighbourhood say that many officials have visited the site in recent days, including Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. They also say that they’ve been told for years that the local municipality has plans to fix the infrastructure, but that little has come about from it.</p><p>The local government has known about the issue for years, but until now, little has been done. Deputy Mayor Khaled Kabbara is part of a new municipal government elected in 2025.</p><p>“The issue of cracked buildings is a very old issue in the city of Tripoli, and unfortunately, it has not been dealt with in previous periods,” he told Al Jazeera from Tripoli’s municipality headquarters. But this new municipal government that was elected in 2025, he said, has “raised its voice”.</p><p>Kabbara also said that Tripoli has been historically ignored by Beirut “since independence” in the 1940s, but that the current government was working with the local government to find solutions.</p><p>“Honestly, this is the first time that we feel that someone is listening and there is someone who is working with us,” he said.</p><p>A group of engineers are currently inspecting buildings around the city to decide if damaged buildings can be repaired or must be evacuated and demolished. Evacuation warnings have been issued for 114 buildings, though that number is expected to rise substantially.</p><p>Families that evacuate should receive a one-year shelter allowance to secure alternative housing. Religious institutions have opened their doors to evacuees, while Turkiye has also promised to donate about 100 prefabricated houses.</p><p>A call centre has also been set up for residents to report suspected issues with their buildings. The hotline has so far received reports on approximately 650 different buildings, Kabbara said.</p><p>One of the buildings previously reported to the call centre was the building that collapsed on February 8. Locals had heard a creaking sound coming from the building.</p><p>Kabbara acknowledged that the report was received and that the residents were afraid. However, he said, the engineers had not inspected it before it collapsed because nothing in the report indicated it needed an urgent inspection.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>Back in Bab al-Tabbaneh, numerous locals expressed frustration and fear. They said many officials and associations have visited the site, but few have delivered on promises to help them.</p><p>“We’ve been told there is a plan to fix the infrastructure since the Siniora government,” Samir Rajab, 56, said, referring to Fouad Siniora, the prime minister of Lebanon from 2005 to 2009. “But nothing happens.”</p><p>Next to the destroyed building site, Mustapha al-Abed, 54, repaired a broken washing machine out of a small workshop. He said his work was not very fruitful lately, as poverty forced many in this area with broken appliances to wash their laundry by hand.</p><p>He looked over at the site where the building had gone down just days earlier. “The problem is not here any more. These people are already dead,” he said. He then pointed across the street to a bustling neighbourhood, where people were doing their Ramadan shopping.</p><p>“The problem is all the other buildings.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

so-called Board of Peace.</p><p>US Army General Jasper Jeffers, who has been appointed as the head of a future Gaza stabilisation force by Trump’s board, said on Thursday that the Indonesian

in Washington, DC.</p><p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who was among several world leaders participating in the meeting, said his country would contribute up to 8,000 personnel to the planned force “to make this peace work” in the war-torn Palestinian territory, where Israel’s genocide has killed at least 72,000 people.</p><p>Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said his country will also send an unspecified number of troops, including medical units, to Gaza, while Morocco’s Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said that his country is ready to deploy police officers to Gaza.</p><p>Albania, whose prime minister recently made a two-day official visit to Israel, has also said it will contribute troops, while neighbouring countries Egypt and Jordan have said they will participate by training police officers.</p><p>Indonesia, which was one of the first countries to commit to sending troops, has sought to reassure potential critics that its participation is intended to ensure international law is upheld in Gaza, amid Israel’s genocidal onslaught.</p><p></p><h3>‘Indonesian troops will not be involved in combat operations’</h3><p>Indonesia’s foreign minister met with both United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour in New York on Wednesday, in advance of President Subianto’s participation in the Board of Peace meeting.</p><p>“Indonesia’s mandate [on troop deployment] is humanitarian in nature with a focus on protecting civilians, humanitarian and health assistance, reconstruction as well as training and strengthening the capacity of the Palestinian Police,” Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a recent statement, according to the Jakarta Post newspaper.</p><p>“Indonesian troops will not be involved in combat operations or any action leading to direct confrontation with any armed group,” the ministry said, responding to questions raised over its future role in Gaza by Amnesty International.</p><p>The head of Amnesty International Indonesia, Usman Hamid, has voiced concerns that Indonesia risked violating international law through its participation in the Board of Peace and the planned stabilisation force for Gaza.</p><p>Hamid warned that Indonesia’s deployment of troops to Gaza “means putting Indonesia at risk of participating in a mechanism that will strengthen violations of International Humanitarian Law”.</p><p>“The Peace Council does not include members from the most disadvantaged Palestinians, but instead includes members from Israel, which has for nearly eight decades carried out an illegal occupation and apartheid against the Palestinian people, even committing genocide in Gaza,” Hamid wrote last week in an open letter to the speaker of the People’s Representative Council of the Republic of Indonesia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Palestinians have also <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/19/palestinians-in-gaza-say-board-of-peace-will-further-occupation\">voiced concerns</a> that Trump’s Board of Peace will only further entrench Israel’s illegal occupation of the Gaza Strip, as Israeli forces continue to carve out more “buffer zones” and restrict the entry of food and other aid, months into a so-called “ceasefire” with Hamas, during which almost 600 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks.</p><p>The Gaza stabilisation force differs from other peacekeeping forces deployed by multilateral organisations such as the UN or the African Union.</p><p>In neighbouring Lebanon, more than 10,000 peacekeepers from 47 countries continue to participate in the <a

with Italy, is one of the largest contributors of troops to UNIFIL, which has repeatedly <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/un-peacekeepers-say-israeli-forces-fired-on-them-in-southern-lebanon\">come under

That will be a big day.”</p><p>The UN has indicated that the US owes about $2.196bn to its regular budget, including $767m for the current year. Another $1.8bn is owed for the UN’s peacekeeping operations.</p><h2 id=\"a-financial-crisis\">A financial crisis</h2><p>For years, the UN has faced a financial crisis, with a growing shortfall of contributions. Each of the organisation’s 193 member states is required to contribute, based on its economic ability.</p><p>Poorer countries could be asked to contribute as little as 0.001 percent of the UN’s regular budget. Wealthier countries could reach the maximum contribution amount of 22 percent.</p><p>But unpaid dues have already forced the UN to slash its spending and reduce its services.</p><p>In a stark warning last month, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cautioned that the international body faces an “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues.</p><p>Guterres revealed that the UN’s regular operating budget could be depleted as early as July, a scenario that would severely jeopardise its global operations.</p><p>The US is the largest donor to the UN, as the world’s largest economy. But it currently owes billions in unpaid dues.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/united-nations-presses-for-answers-on-us-funding-commitments\">UN officials have stated</a> that the US accounts for approximately 95 percent of the arrears to the organisation’s regular budget.</p><h2 id=\"empty-words\">‘Empty words’</h2><p>Since returning to the White House for a second term in January 2025, Trump has elevated concerns that US dues might go unpaid.</p><p>The Republican leader has repeatedly criticised the UN as ineffective, even articulating that sentiment at September’s UN General Assembly.</p><p>“What is the purpose of the United Nations?” Trump asked the assembly. “All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty words.”</p><p>Throughout his second term so far, he has cut foreign aid spending and withdrawn from international commitments. In January, for instance, his government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/trump-to-withdraw-us-from-dozens-of-un-international-organisations\">pulled out of 31 UN programmes</a>, including its democracy fund and a body that works on maternal and child health.</p><p>But on Thursday, at his Board of Peace meeting, Trump appeared to take a warmer stance towards the UN, saying he planned to work “very closely” with the organisation.</p><p>“Someday, I won’t be here. The United Nations will be,” he said, seeming to endorse its longevity.</p><p>Trump also acknowledged the organisation’s financial distress: “They need help, and they need help money-wise.” He did not mention the US arrears.</p><p>While the Board of Peace establishment was meant to oversee the Gaza ceasefire, many see it as an attempt by Trump to rival the UN Security Council’s role in preventing and ending conflicts around the world.</p><p>Critics have described the board, which Trump chairs, as a “parallel system” that risks undermining the UN’s authority and operations.</p><p>Trump himself appeared to position his Board of Peace as an oversight body for the UN in Thursday’s remarks.</p><p>The Board of Peace, he said, “is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in the US, critics point out that no such government shake-ups have occurred following the files’ release.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on Thursday has renewed calls for accountability for those in the US involved in Epstein’s crimes.</p><p>There has long been speculation about the financier’s influential social circle, which included a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/trump-congress-and-the-epstein-files-what-happens-next\">past friendship</a> with US President Donald Trump and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/israel-installed-security-at-epsteins-manhattan-apartment-for-ex-pm-barak\">ties</a> to foreign governments, including Israel.</p><p>Critics have questioned how those relationships might have shielded Epstein during his lifetime.</p><p>In 2008, he was convicted of solicitation and procuring a minor for sex in Florida, but he entered into a plea deal widely considered lenient. He ultimately served 13 months of an 18-month sentence.</p><p>The US Department of Justice has maintained that it has found no evidence of criminal conduct beyond the charges against Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence.</p><p>US lawmakers, however, have repeatedly <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/six-men-named-in-us-congress-why-is-so-much-redacted-in-the-epstein-files\">accused</a> the Justice Department of not being fully transparent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In New Mexico, pressure has been intensifying to investigate Epstein’s connections to the state. A truth commission launched by state lawmakers held its first meeting earlier this week.</p><p>The four-member panel of state representatives is tasked with probing allegations that the Zorro Ranch may have been a site of sexual abuse and sex trafficking.</p><p>State lawmakers have also called for answers as to why Epstein was not registered as a sex offender in New Mexico after he pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida.</p><p>Torrez’s office said it would work with the commission and seek access to the complete, un-redacted federal case files related to Epstein.</p><p>“As with any potential criminal matter, we will follow the facts wherever they lead, carefully evaluate jurisdictional considerations, and take appropriate investigative action, including the collection and preservation of any relevant evidence that remains available,” the office said in a statement.</p><p>Epstein purchased the 2,480-square-metre (26,690sq ft) Zorro ranch in 1993 from Democratic Governor Bruce King.

Poverty is high, inequality is high, and there’s widespread shortages of basic services. The situation overall is quite fragile.”</p><p>The IMF figures show Venezuela’s public debt sitting at roughly 180 percent of its GDP right now, before factoring in any court rulings or arbitration payouts from old defaults.</p><p>Kozack said the global lender was still gathering information and facts on the best way to proceed with the South American country.</p><p>The IMF hasn’t had any formal dealings with Venezuela in more than 20 years. Its last official assessment of the country came in 2004.</p><p>In 2007, Venezuela paid off its last World Bank loan under Maduro’s predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.</p><p>If the IMF restores ties with Venezuela, the South American oil exporter would have access to about $4.9bn worth of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) that were frozen seven years ago, after the IMF refused to recognise Maduro’s leadership.</p><p>SDRs are reserve assets whose values are tied to five currencies: the US dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen and the British pound sterling.</p><p>But US engagement in Venezuela could also create change in the country’s economy.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month that the administration of President Donald Trump would be willing to convert Venezuela’s SDRs to dollars to help rebuild the country’s economy.</p><p>And last week, the US Department of the Treasury announced it was easing some sanctions on Venezuela’s energy sector.</p><p>The Trump administration has placed a heavy focus on Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, even going so far as to claim that the natural resource rightfully belonged to the US.</p><p>Citing US oil exploration in the area in the 20th century, Trump has called Venezuela’s decision to nationalise the oil sector the “largest theft of property in the history” of the US.</p><p>His government has encouraged foreign investment in Venezuela’s oil sector since Maduro’s removal.</p><p>It has also issued two general licences, including one that allows energy companies Chevron, BP, Eni, Shell and Repsol to conduct further oil and gas operations in Venezuela. Those companies already have offices in the country and are among the main partners of state-run oil company PDVSA.</p><p>The second licence allows foreign companies to enter new oil and gas investment contracts with PDVSA.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Some material suggests he shared official reports from a 2010 Southeast Asia trade trip with the financier.</p><p>“The fact that the former royal is in custody represents quite a stunning turn of events for the royal family,” Al Jazeera’s Camille Nedelec said, reporting from London.</p><p>“The former prince was at one time the favourite of the late queen, and now it’s the culmination of his slow descent into disgrace,” she added.</p><p>The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325380\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325380\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325380\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-02T111837Z_2128575369_RC2MDJAPAEDT_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-EPSTEIN-ANDREW-1771525334.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor rides a horse in Windsor Great Park\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325380\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor rides a horse in Windsor Great Park [Toby Melville/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-was-mountbatten-windsor-arrested\">Why was Mountbatten-Windsor arrested?</h2><p>Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on “suspicion of misconduct in public office”, Thames Valley Police said.</p><p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"534\">Thames Valley Police said earlier in February it was “assessing” reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent confidential trade reports to Epstein in 2010, when he was the UK’s special trade envoy.</p><p>The Norfolk police said they were supporting Thames Valley Police in the investigation.</p><p>Both forces are involved because his former residence, Royal Lodge in Windsor, falls under the jurisdiction of Thames Valley Police. He has since moved to Wood Farm on his brother’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, after King Charles asked him to leave the Windsor property on February 2.</p><p>Late on Thursday, the Thames Valley Police confirmed Mountbatten-Windsor was released and that the searches in Norfolk had concluded.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-is-misconduct-in-public-office\">What is misconduct in public office?</h2><p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which oversees prosecutions in England and Wales, <a href=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/prosecution-guidance/misconduct-public-office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">describes</a> it as a criminal offence “that concerns serious wilful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities of the public office held”.</p><p>The CPS says the offence is committed when the following circumstances apply: a public officer acting as such wilfully neglects to perform their duty and/or wilfully misconducts themselves to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder without reasonable excuse or justification.</p><p>In the case of Mountbatten-Windsor, police are investigating allegations that he shared with Epstein confidential government information that he had access to because he was a UK trade envoy.</p><p>He also held the title of prince at the time, but that is not relevant to the misconduct in the public office investigation.</p><p>A conviction for that offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, but sentences can also be much shorter, depending on the seriousness of the specific case.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325563\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325563\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325563\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-19T191727Z_948764426_RC27PJAADHQQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-EPSTEIN-BRITAIN-ANDREW-1771530589.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britain’s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, leaves Aylsham Police Station\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325563\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, younger brother of Britain’s King Charles and formerly known as Prince Andrew, leaves Aylsham Police Station in a vehicle [Phil Noble/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-is-andrew-s-connection-to-jeffrey-epstein\">What is Andrew’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein?</h2><p data-start=\"46\" data-end=\"138\">The former prince first became publicly linked to Epstein in the early 2000s.</p><p data-start=\"46\" data-end=\"138\">The two were photographed together on several occasions, including in New York in 2010, after Epstein had already served a jail sentence in Florida for child sex offences.</p><p data-start=\"46\" data-end=\"138\">Mountbatten-Windsor said he met Epstein through UK socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p data-start=\"720\" data-end=\"1164\">The association came under intense scrutiny in 2014 after accuser Virginia Giuffre alleged that she had been trafficked by Epstein and his associate Maxwell and forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor in the early 2000s when she was 17.</p><p data-start=\"720\" data-end=\"1164\">The former prince gave a widely criticised interview to the BBC’s Newsnight programme in November 2019, in which he denied wrongdoing and said he had “no recollection” of meeting Giuffre.

We will know when there are men – rich men – in handcuffs being perp-walked to the jail,” Massie said in his speech. “And until then, this is still a cover-up.”</p><p>Over the years, Epstein built a network of hundreds of girls and young women for sexual exploitation. Many of the victims were made to travel around with him and stay at his private island in the Caribbean.</p><p>But the Trump administration has all but ruled out further charges in the case.</p><p>Last year, before the release of the documents, the US Department of Justice <a href=\"/news/2025/7/7/epstein-no-client-list-died-suicide-justice-department-says\">denied that Epstein</a> had a “client list” of powerful people to whom he trafficked his sex abuse victims.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier this month, deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche sparked outrage when he appeared to dismiss calls for prosecuting Epstein’s allies.</p><p>“We will always investigate any evidence of misconduct. But as you know, it is not a crime to party with Mr Epstein,” he told Fox News. “And so, as horrible as it is, it is not a crime to email with Mr Epstein.”</p><p>Alsalem, the UN expert, said Blanche’s comments were “dismissive” of the victims and “the horrific experiences” they endured.</p><p>She noted that it had been known that Epstein was convicted of sex abuse crimes in 2008.</p><p>“In light of everything that we know and was known even back then by those who engaged with him, nobody can claim unawareness,” Alsalem told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But indeed, at the same time, everybody accused should still benefit from a fair and impartial trial, but that’s why we have to get to that impartial and fair trial, and then they can also explain themselves.”</p><h2 id=\"the-trump-connection\">The Trump connection</h2><p>Epstein was given what is widely seen as a lenient plea deal during his first conviction, where he admitted to solicitation of prostitution with a minor and was sentenced to 18 months in jail that included work release privileges.</p><p>He was arrested and charged again in 2019 after media reports scrutinised the 2008 federal prosecution against him, which was led by Alexander Acosta, who served as labour secretary in the first Trump administration.</p><p>Trump himself has been accused of ties to Epstein, but the US president said that he only knew the late sex offender as a neighbour in Palm Beach, Florida, and eventually dissociated with him because he was a “creep”.</p><p>Last year, The Wall Street Journal released what it said was a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/trumps-alleged-suggestive-letter-to-epstein-released-by-democrats\">sexually suggestive</a> birthday card in the shape of a nude woman sent by Trump to Epstein. The US president denied sending the letter and filed a lawsuit against the newspaper over the allegation.</p><p>“If a Prince can be held accountable, so can a President,” Democratic Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury wrote on X after Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest.</p><p></p><p>Congressman Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, called the arrest of the former British royal an “enormous step forward” towards accountability.</p><p>“Oversight Democrats called for Mountbatten-Windsor to come clean about his ties to Epstein months ago, and Britain is now holding him accountable with this arrest,” Garcia said in a statement.</p><p>“Now it’s time for the United States to end this White House cover-up. President Trump and his Epstein Administration are not above the law.”</p><p>In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week, a majority of US respondents – 53 percent – agreed that the Epstein files have lowered their “trust in the country’s political and business leaders”.</p><p>And 69 percent said their views were captured by the statement that the files “show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions”.</p><p>Trump’s allies often note <a href=\"/news/longform/2024/12/28/enabling-genocide-former-biden-officials-reflect-on-the-presidents-legacy\">that the administration</a> of former Democratic President Joe Biden had four years to release the Epstein files, but chose not to do so.</p><p>Some powerful Democratic politicians and donors, including former President Bill Clinton and ex-Treasury Secretary <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/19/ex-treasury-boss-summers-resigns-from-openai-after-named-in-epstein-files\">Larry Summers</a>, also had ties to Epstein.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"organised-attack-against-women-and-children\">‘Organised attack’ against women and children</h2><p>The issue goes beyond the US.

But trade was diverted away from China. The goods gap with Taiwan doubled to $147bn and shot up 44 percent, to $178bn, with Vietnam.</p><p>Trump last year unleashed a barrage of tariffs against trading partners with the aim, among other things, of addressing trade imbalances and protecting US industries. But the punitive duties have not yielded a manufacturing renaissance, with factory employment declining by 83,000 jobs from January 2025 through January 2026.</p><p>“There just isn’t any evidence out there in the economic research literature to suggest that tariffs have materially impacted trade deficits historically when countries have implemented them,” said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p>The trade gap ballooned by 32.6 percent to a five-month high of $70.3bn, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and the US Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters forecast the trade deficit would contract to $55.5bn.</p><p>The report was delayed because of last year’s government shutdown.</p><p>Imports increased 3.6 percent to $357.6bn in December. Goods imports surged 3.8 percent to $280.2bn, boosted by a $7bn increase in industrial supplies and materials, mostly non-monetary gold, copper and crude oil. Capital goods imports increased by $5.6bn, lifted by computer accessories and telecommunications equipment. That rise is likely related to the construction of data centres to support artificial intelligence.</p><p>But consumer goods imports fell, pulled down by pharmaceutical preparations. There have been large swings in imports of pharmaceutical preparations because of tariffs.</p><p>“But strong imports should also imply strength in details like inventories or business investment,” said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. “Surging computer imports in particular should correspond with stronger business equipment investment and could remain strong due to AI-related demand.”</p><p>Exports fell 1.7 percent to $287.3bn in December. But capital goods exports increased, boosted by semiconductors. There were increases in exports of consumer goods, including pharmaceutical preparations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The structure of the deal would have made Epstein a co-owner and, effectively, a landlord to the US government.</p><p data-start=\"1232\" data-end=\"1416\">There is no evidence that the transaction went ahead. But the prospect of a convicted sex offender acquiring a stake in property serving the Pentagon raises serious security questions.</p><p data-start=\"1418\" data-end=\"1551\">Among millions of emails published last month, an FBI informant wrote in a memo that Epstein was a “Mossad Agent” <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">working for Israel</a>.</p><p data-start=\"1553\" data-end=\"1671\">“Epstein was close to the former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, and trained as a spy under him,” the memo adds.</p><p data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1902\">Epstein maintained a decade-long relationship with Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and one-time senior military intelligence figure. Barak visited Epstein’s New York townhouse more than 30 times between 2013 and 2017.</p><p data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1902\">The ties between Epstein and Israel have come into sharp focus following the release of the documents. Beyond his interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak, the files document Epstein’s financial support for Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli army and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his connections to the Mossad, Israel’s overseas intelligence agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"1904\" data-end=\"2064\">The Pentagon-linked proposal formed part of three documents – an email, an investor presentation and a deal summary – contained within the newly released files.</p><p data-start=\"2066\" data-end=\"2299\">David Stern, a businessman who referred to himself as Epstein’s “soldier”, forwarded the offer. Stern also served as a close aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/2/19/live-ex-uk-prince-andrew-arrested-amid-epstein-scandal\">arrested</a> on Thursday on “suspicion of misconduct in public office” following revelations in the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/why-was-former-prince-andrew-arrested-by-uk-police\">Epstein files</a>.</p><p data-start=\"2301\" data-end=\"2511\">In the same year Stern relayed the Pentagon-area proposal, he became director of the St George’s House Trust at Windsor Castle and attended an event at St James’s Palace, where he sat beside the late Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p data-start=\"2513\" data-end=\"2754\">Stern also sent Epstein a separate proposal in 2015 to invest in two FBI field offices in Richmond and Baltimore, and courthouses, which were called “sexy assets”. That deal required an initial $25m, followed by a further $80m, with ownership routed through a Cayman Islands offshore entity.</p><p data-start=\"2756\" data-end=\"2900\">Real estate investor Jonathan D Fascitelli originated both property proposals.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Wexner’s name appears, both redacted and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/six-men-named-in-us-congress-why-is-so-much-redacted-in-the-epstein-files\">unredacted</a>, on communications and financial documents within these files.</p><p>“I was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,” Wexner said in a statement. “He was a con man.

At the time, Epstein was a college dropout who had briefly taught at Manhattan’s elite Dalton School after reportedly exaggerating his academic credentials. He had passed through Bear Stearns under executive Alan “Ace” Greenberg before leaving to set up his own advisory firm.</p><p>By 1986, he had met Wexner. Five years later, the retail billionaire had granted him full power of attorney, an extraordinary delegation allowing Epstein to sign cheques, hire staff, borrow money, and buy or sell property on Wexner’s behalf.</p><p>Al Jazeera has reviewed newly released Justice Department records, including a 1998 purchase and sale agreement and related promissory note and guaranty, which detail the mechanics of asset transfers between the two men.</p><p>The documents show how control of Wexner’s Manhattan townhouse at 9 East 71st Street was formalised through a structured transaction involving a $10m promissory note and a personal guaranty signed by Epstein. The property became Epstein’s New York base and a symbol of his growing stature.</p><p>By the early 1990s, Epstein was embedded in Wexner’s philanthropic and corporate world, serving as a trustee of the Wexner Foundation and as the president of Wexner-affiliated property companies. In 1996, he relocated his firm to the US Virgin Islands, positioning himself as an offshore financier.</p><p>The authority Wexner granted him over assets, philanthropy and property did more than elevate his status socially. It conferred institutional legitimacy. With control over substantial wealth and formal roles inside a major foundation, Epstein could present himself as a financier with access to capital and global networks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-wexner-foundation-and-the-israel-connection\">The Wexner Foundation and the Israel connection</h2><p>One of the clearest through-lines from that period runs to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was introduced to Epstein by former Israeli President Shimon Peres at a large event in Washington in 2003.</p><p>Between 2004 and 2006, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/wexner-foundation-2-3-million-to-barak-was-for-2-reports-1-wasnt-finished/\">the Wexner Foundation</a> paid Barak approximately $2.3m for two commissioned research studies, one on leadership and another on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The foundation later said only one paper was completed, but determined that the work justified the payment.</p><p>Barak, who served as Israel’s prime minister from 1999 to 2001 and later as defence minister from 2007 to 2013, maintained contact with Epstein for several years.</p><p>A court filing included in the newly released Epstein records contains an allegation that prominent victim Virginia Giuffre claimed that Wexner and Barak were two of the men Epstein trafficked her to.</p><p>The filing does not provide supporting evidence for the claim. Neither man has been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.</p><p>In February this year, Barak <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/former-israeli-pm-barak-responds-to-criticism-over-close-epstein-links\">told</a> Israel’s Channel 12 he had been unaware of the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and regretted ever meeting the financier.</p><p>Wexner has said he severed ties with Epstein around 2007 after he discovered the financier had “misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family”.</p><p>But the financial and institutional credibility Epstein accumulated during his years managing Wexner’s wealth did not evaporate when that relationship ended.</p><h2 id=\"epstein-editing-barak-s-op-ed\">Epstein ‘editing’ Barak’s op-ed</h2><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Even after his relationship allegedly ended with Wexner, Epstein now had the social prestige, and money, to develop ties with powerful decision-makers, emails newly released by the Justice Department and reviewed by Al Jazeera show.</p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">In October 2014, Nili Priel Barak – Barak’s wife – wrote to Epstein about travel plans to New York, suggesting dates when Ehud Barak would be in town and asking whether he would be available to meet.</p><p>Days later, she forwarded him a draft opinion piece, writing: “Herewith the Op Ed. Please let me know your opinion and your remarks. Thanks.”</p><p>Epstein replied with what he labelled “beginning edits”, returning a version of the unpublished article. The draft speaks in Barak’s political voice, including the line: “As the Minister of Defence of Israel I’ve met more than once with [US] President [Barack] Obama…” and lays out arguments about the “two states solution” versus a “one state solution”.</p><p>A year later, in 2015, Epstein invested in Reporty Homeland Security, later rebranded as Carbyne, a startup chaired by Ehud Barak that developed advanced emergency communications technology – further tying their political relationship to a shared commercial venture.</p><p>The company’s leadership included CEO Amir Elichai, a former special forces officer, and director Pinhas Buchris, a former Israeli Defence Ministry director-general and former commander of Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s cyber intelligence unit.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2014, documents <a href=\"https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/jeffrey-epstein-israel-surveillance-state-cote-d-ivoire-ehud-barak-leaked-emails\">reportedly</a> indicate Epstein also assisted Barak in exploring security-related business with African world leaders. The documents illustrate how Epstein managed to convert financial credibility into political access, and then reinforced those relationships through shared commercial ventures.</p><p>Barak has said: “I am responsible for all my actions and decisions. There is room to question whether I should have investigated more thoroughly. I regret not doing so.”</p><p>Wexner has never been charged with any crime and has said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal conduct. But his name appears repeatedly throughout the newly released files, a reminder of how central their relationship once was.</p></div></div></body></html>"
