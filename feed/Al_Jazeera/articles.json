She had also volunteered at refugee camps in Calais.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Such a terrorist,” she says, tongue in cheek, speaking to Al Jazeera in London.</p><p>Head, 29, is part of the so-called “Filton 24”, two dozen pro-Palestine activists alleged to have raided the Bristol branch of Elbit Systems UK, a subsidiary of Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, in August 2024.</p><p>Less than a year later, after other activists broke into an airbase in Oxfordshire and allegedly spray-painted two Voyager refuelling and transport planes, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/what-is-the-palestine-action-group-and-why-is-the-uk-banning-it\">the UK proscribed Palestine Action</a>, the group which claimed responsibility for both incidents, as a “terrorist” organisation.</p><p>“We were some of the first activists in a very long time to be treated as terrorists,” Head said. “That had a massive impact on our treatment inside the carceral system.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>She said family and friends encountered overly burdensome administrative difficulties when trying to arrange prison visits while the books she wanted to read were screened, claims that are consistent with the accounts of other Palestine Action-linked activists and their families, but allegations the Ministry of Justice has previously denied.</p><p>Head, whose barrister in court likened her to a suffragette, was released three weeks ago on bail. Convicted of no crime, she had served 18 months in prison, well beyond the UK’s usual six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p><h2 id=\"i-was-so-depressed-and-so-isolated\">‘I was so depressed and so isolated’</h2><p>After she was released, Head’s friend asked what she wanted to eat as one of her first meals.</p><p>“I sat there completely overwhelmed, so she just said, ‘Right, pesto pasta’, and I swear nothing has ever tasted that good.”</p><p>While getting used to her freedom, living in a seaside town and continuing her activism – Al Jazeera interviewed Head at the launch of a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/anti-palestinian-repression-legal-experts-document-hundreds-of-uk-cases\">new database</a> tracking the repression of pro-Palestine voices – she remembers her lowest points in jail.</p><p>During her detention, she was moved from Bronzefield prison in southern England to Foston Hall, a facility nearly 250km (155 miles) north, far further from her loved ones.</p><p>In August 2025, about a year after she was arrested, she said she attempted to take her own life at Foston Hall.</p><p>“I was so depressed and so isolated and was so aware that the public was just being told these lies about us, by the police, by the right-wing press, by the state itself – I had no power to counter that narrative.</p><p>“I tried to take my own life … purely out of powerlessness of being used as a political play piece and having very little recourse to [my] own agency.”</p><p>She said she was taken to an emergency department, “where I was handcuffed to a prison officer the whole time”. After blood tests, she was returned to prison from hospital the following day.</p><p>The prison system’s conditions need “massive” reform, she said.</p><p>In 2025, 29 people died in the UK’s prisons in circumstances officially described as “self-inflicted”, while there were about 75,000 incidents of self-harm.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The hunger striking activists had also called for improved conditions, demanding an end to what they called censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls and books.</p><p>Founded in 2020, Palestine Action’s stated objective has been to counter Israeli war crimes – and what it says is British complicity in them – by targeting weapons manufacturers and associated companies. Its main target is Elbit Systems, which has several UK sites.</p><p>The Israeli firm produces the drones that are used with deadly effect in <a href=\"/tag/israel-palestine-conflict/\">Israel’s genocidal war</a> against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, but the company’s UK subsidiary denies that it supplies the Israeli military.</p><p>All Palestine Action-linked activists have denied the charges against them.</p><p>Head is said to have driven a van into the Bristol site, using it as a “battering ram” to get inside the factory.</p><p>“It’s so painful to see that so little has changed in Palestine, that the genocide has continued unabated,” she said. “It’s horrifying, but it confirms what we’ve known all along, that state actors like Israel, the US and the UK were never going to abide by international law and that we must continue to voice our opposition and try to bring about true justice for Palestine.”</p><h2 id=\"new-protests-against-elbit-systems-uk\">New protests against Elbit Systems UK</h2><p>In recent weeks, in a dizzying turn of events, the High Court ruled that the Palestine Action ban was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/uk-decision-to-ban-palestine-action-as-terror-group-unlawful-court-says\">unlawful</a> and all “Filton24” defendants have been acquitted of aggravated burglary. Twenty-three of the 24 were bailed in two rounds, including a group that participated in a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/prison-rights-elbits-loss-how-the-palestine-action-hunger-strike-won\">life-threatening hunger strike</a>. Only one, Samuel Corner, remains in jail. He faces an additional charge of causing grievous bodily harm to a police officer.</p><p>The jury reached partial or no verdicts on the counts of criminal damage and violent disorder, so Head and other activists now face a retrial.</p><p>On the Palestine Action ban, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has been granted permission to appeal the High Court ruling.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elbit Systems UK continues to be targeted.</p><p>On Thursday, activists affiliated with a group called People Against Genocide claimed to have blocked the Elbit UK Systems site in Bristol by “locking on”, a protest tactic that involves attaching oneself to an object.</p><p>“The arms firm claim that the Filton facility is a research, development, and manufacturing hub, but quadcopter drones, of the exact type used to kill civilians in Gaza, have previously been discovered here, ready to be shipped to the Israeli military,” they said.</p><p>Avon and Somerset Police told Al Jazeera that three people “causing disruption” had been arrested for offences relating to “locking on, contrary to the Public Order Act 2003”.</p><p>At the time of publishing, Elbit Systems UK and the Ministry of Justice had not responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

and a civil society group have said that mass graves were found in a part of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where the M23 rebel group has recently withdrawn from, as fighting in the region escalates despite a United States-mediated peace deal.</p><p>The governor of South Kivu province, Jean-Jacques Purusi, told The Associated Press news agency on Thursday that authorities found two mass graves with at least 171 bodies in the Kiromoni and Kavimvira neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the eastern city of Uvira.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

identified two sites: one mass grave containing approximately 30 bodies in Kiromoni, not far from the Burundian border on the Congolese side, and another in Kavimvira where 141 bodies were found,” Purusi told AP over the phone.</p><p>The Executive Secretariat of the Local Network for the Protection of Civilians, a civil society group in the region, said on Thursday it wanted to visit the mass graves but was prevented from doing so by the Congolese military.</p><p>Information gathered so far indicates that the victims were killed by M23 rebels, said Yves Ramadhani, the group’s vice president.</p><p>The governor and the civil society group alleged that the rebels killed the individuals because they suspected them of belonging to the DRC army or a pro-government militia.</p><p>Both the DRC military and M23 have been accused of extrajudicial killings and abuses by rights groups. Al Jazeera could not independently verify Purusi’s or the group’s claims.</p><p>The M23 is the most prominent of the more than 100 armed groups that are vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern DRC, near the border with Rwanda.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>M23 has been in a tense and violent conflict with the DRC government for more than a decade. The first fighting began in 2012 but de-escalated the next year, only to resume in 2021.</p><p>Then, in January 2025, the rebels gained ground, seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, before taking Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu, the following month. And in December, the group <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/18/m23-fighters-withdraw-from-key-drc-town-of-uvira\">seized control of Uvira</a> in an offensive that killed more than 1,500 people and forced about 300,000 to flee, according to regional authorities.</p><p>The rebel group later announced it would withdraw from the city, in what it said was a “unilateral trust-building measure” requested by the US to facilitate the peace process.</p><p>M23 claims it is fighting for the rights of the minority Tutsi community, who it says has been marginalised by the state. The DRC government has condemned the rebels and neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting them, for seizing land and resources.</p><p>Last year, two separate peace negotiation processes took place – one between <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/drc-rwanda-backed-m23-sign-framework-deal-for-peace-after-talks-in-qatar\">DRC and M23</a> mediated by Qatar, and a separate one between <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/4/rwanda-drc-presidents-sign-washington-accord-peace-deal\">Kinshasa and Kigali</a> mediated by the US.</p><p>Despite agreed ceasefires, fighting has continued in the east of the country.</p><p>The conflict has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people displaced, according to the UN agency for refugees, and thousands killed.</p><p>More than 200 people were also killed in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern DRC last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

On February 17, Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia announced that the Eastern Cape would be added to the list and a deployment would take place in 10 days – although no soldiers have so far been deployed.</p><p>The president’s decision followed pressure from civil society groups and the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, which runs the Western Cape, to take drastic action to curb widespread gang-related violence in the three provinces.</p><p>A day before its province was added to the deployment schedule, the DA joined residents in Gqeberha, the largest city in the Eastern Cape, for a “Do Our Lives Not Matter?” protest to demand that Ramaphosa take urgent action.</p><p>In Gauteng, neighbourhoods surrounding the province’s once-lucrative abandoned mines have often been turned into battlegrounds, resulting in shootouts between police and illegal artisanal miners, known as zama zamas.</p><p>Gauteng and the Western Cape frequently appear at the top of the country’s organised crime lists while the Eastern Cape made headlines last year for a series of killings linked to extortion syndicates.</p><p>In the latest crime statistics, police announced the arrests of 15,846 suspects nationwide and the seizure of 173 firearms and 2,628 rounds of ammunition from February 16 to Sunday alone.</p><p>Gauteng took up the most space in the police’s crime highlights, which included a 16-year-old arrested in Roodepoort for possession and distribution of explosives and the seizure of counterfeit clothing and shoes worth 98 million rand ($6.1m).</p><p>Overall, South Africa has some of the world’s most violent crime with an average of <a href=\"https://issafrica.org/iss-today/is-south-africa-s-crime-problem-turning-around\">64 people killed every day</a>, according to official statistics.</p><p>The three provinces selected for military deployments have a turbulent history with the armed forces, not least during the apartheid era when the regime used soldiers to unleash deadly crackdowns on antiapartheid activists.</p><p>“They were the enemy,” Jacobs said, recalling his own arrest in September 1987 during a student protest on the Cape Flats opposing the racist government, which was replaced in the country’s first democratic elections in 1994.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340618\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340618\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340618\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Michael-Jacobs-5164-1772112650.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C523&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Cape Town\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4340618\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Michael Jacobs at his office in Cape Town [Otha Fadana/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Today after three decades of democracy, poverty, unemployment and violent crime remain a major challenge in the area.</p><p>But Jacobs, like other critics of the military police, believes the new move will do little to cure the ills that he said gangs exploit to increase their influence. Children as young as eight years old are recruited into their ranks.</p><p>The Town Centre, a shopping mall that was once a hub of economic activity, has been reduced to a ghost town where the drug trade thrives despite the fact that it is right next to a police station, according to Jacobs.</p><p>For him, there is a direct link between the country’s economic decline and the flourishing of gang activity over the past decade on the Cape Flats, where working-class people have seen their livelihoods stripped away as the manufacturing sector shrank.</p><p>On an average weekday when children should be at school, he said, you see children and even women in their 60s in Mitchells Plain digging through rubbish bins to find glass, plastic or other things they can recycle and turn into income. “At least it will put something on the table.”</p><h2 id=\"plugging-a-haemorrhage\">Plugging a ‘haemorrhage’</h2><p>Social issues and not simply military intervention should be put at the heart of government anticrime efforts, analysts say.</p><p>“There’s no other way to describe it other than plugging a hole that is haemorrhaging at the moment with regards to these forms of organised crime,” said Ryan Cummings, director of analysis at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused risk management firm.</p><p>Irvin Kinnes, an associate professor with the University of Cape Town’s Centre for Criminology, pointed out that constitutionally the army is limited in the duties its members may perform among the civilian population. Their role will be largely to support police, who will retain control of all operations.</p><p>He fears the government has not learned lessons from previous army deployments in South Africa’s democratic era.</p><p>The army was dispatched to the Western Cape in 2019 during a previous spike in gang violence and was again sent in to help with the enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions the following year.</p><p>“It’s a very dangerous thing to bring the army because there’s an impatience with the fact that the police are not doing their job. And so they come in with that mentality and want to beat up everybody and break people’s bones,” Kinnes said.</p><p>“We saw what happened in COVID. They killed people as the army. It’s not as if the police don’t kill people, but the point is, you don’t need the army to do that.”</p><p>To the government’s detractors, summoning the army is nothing more than an attempt at political heroics before local elections due to be held this year or in early 2027.</p><p>Kinnes pointed out that, according to police statistics, crime has been decreasing without the help of the army.</p><p>“It’s very much political. It’s to show that the political leaders have kind of heard the public. But the call for the army hasn’t come from the community. It’s come from politicians,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4310477\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4310477\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4310477\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-11-02T124816Z_358423518_RC1AE0FC5000_RTRMADP_3_SAFRICA-GANGS-1770950826.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Residents look on as police stand guard while South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visits crime ridden Hanover Park to launch a new Anti-Gang Unit, in Cape Town, South Africa November 2, 2018.

On Monday in his weekly newsletter, the president sought to separate the South African armed forces from their troubling past, listing several operations that benefitted communities, such as disaster relief efforts and law enforcement operations at the border.</p><p>He made it clear that the army’s role would merely be a supporting one “with clear rules of engagement and for specific time-limited objectives”.</p><p>Its presence may free up officers to focus on police work and would take place alongside other measures, such as strengthening antigang units and illegal mining teams, he said.</p><p>“Given our history, where the apartheid state sent the army into townships to violently suppress opposition, it is important that we do not deploy the [military] inside the country to deal with domestic threats without good reason,” Ramaphosa wrote.</p><p>Cummings said it was clear the president’s hand was forced amid an unrelenting wave of violence. “The rhetoric of the president up until now suggests that this was a directive that he was not necessarily too keen on implementing.”</p><p>On the ground, soldiers appear equally reluctant about their pending engagement.</p><p>Ntsiki Shongo is a soldier who was deployed in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. He told Al Jazeera, using a pseudonym, that any operation involving the police was almost certainly doomed.</p><p>“We [in the army] become so negative when we are working with them [the police] because always we don’t get what we need,” he said.</p><p>“We know how easy it is to get these gangsters, to get these drug lords, but unfortunately, the police, they are not cooperating with us because some of them are in cooperation with these criminals,” he charged. “Maybe they are scared for their lives because they are staying in the same areas with them.”</p><p>Shongo referred to an ongoing commission investigating police corruption that has implicated senior government officials and led to the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/13/south-african-police-minister-suspended-over-corruption-allegations\">suspension of national Police Minister Senzo Mchunu</a>.</p><p>“So this operation, … is it going to be a success? I don’t know. It all depends on the police,” he said, adding that he and his fellow soldiers long for the day the government lets the military solve the problem on its own.</p><p>“Even when we are just sitting having lunch as soldiers, we talk about the police. We pray that one day the state can say, ‘Let’s take the military inside the country and clean out all these weapons, all these guns, all these gangsters,’” he said.</p><p>“The military is ready, and they want to prove a point because we’ve been hungry for these things.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

been jailed in New York without bail since they were seized from their Venezuelan home on January 3 in a bloody nighttime raid by US military forces.</p><p>US prosecutors allege that Maduro abused his

immediately respond to a request for comment, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>According to The Associated Press news agency, if the US government were to allow Venezuela to pay for the

But this time, citing a confidential informant, police told Singh that his wife and two children were at risk, too.</p><p>“I was told to make sure it’s extended to you, your wife and your two children,” the police officer told Singh in a conversation recorded on his home’s doorbell camera.</p><p>Singh was an associate of <a href=\"/news/2023/9/19/india-canada-row-who-was-hardeep-singh-nijjar-what-is-khalistan-movement\">Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Sikh activist and Canadian citizen who was assassinated in Canada in June 2023. The killing caused a massive diplomatic row. Canada accused Indian government agents of involvement in Nijjar’s killing, and framed it as part of an Indian policy of transnational repression targeting Sikh activists abroad.</p><p>But, while Singh was informed of the threat to him and his family on Sunday, a senior Canadian government official told reporters in an off-the-record briefing on Wednesday that “India is no longer a threat” to security, two days before Carney was due to land in New Delhi.</p><p>This marks a significant shift in Canada’s tone and approach to India under Carney, who is looking to diversify foreign relations to cushion the impact from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war, analysts say.</p><p>Observers say Carney’s visit to New Delhi this week could mark the start of a reset of the bilateral relationship, which hit new lows in recent years under Canada’s former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4341610\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4341610\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4341610\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2024-05-21T183720Z_566872816_RC25V7AHHZIP_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-INDIA-1772131920.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4341610\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sikh protesters stand outside the Surrey Provincial Court, where four suspects arrested by Canadian police for the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar appeared, in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, on May 21, 2024 [Jennifer Gauthier/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-rupture-in-ties\">The rupture in ties</h2><p>The mood in Ottawa had already changed a great deal since Carney succeeded Trudeau to lead the government in March last year.</p><p>Under Trudeau, relations between Canada and India had deteriorated to tit-for-tat accusations and the expulsion of diplomats, particularly since the killing of Nijjar in June 2023.</p><p>Nijjar was a prominent advocate for a Sikh homeland in the form of an independent Khalistani state in India. New Delhi calls this separatism and views Nijjar and others in the movement as “terrorists”.</p><p>Following Nijjar’s killing, pressure mounted on Trudeau from the influential Sikh diaspora in Canada, demanding accountability. In October 2024, during an inquiry into foreign interference, Trudeau said there were “ever clearer indications” that India had violated Canada’s sovereignty by targeting Sikh activists on Canadian soil.</p><p>India’s “actions”, Trudeau said, were a “horrific mistake”.</p><p>Canada also accused India of interfering in its domestic politics, including by providing funds to politicians whom New Delhi preferred. India firmly rejected the allegations, calling them “preposterous”, and urged Canada to take action against anti-Indian elements operating from its soil – an apparent reference to Sikh activists.</p><p>But Nijjar’s killing opened a can of worms for the Indian establishment. In November 2023, the US Department of Justice charged an Indian national with allegedly plotting to assassinate <a href=\"/news/2023/11/30/did-india-order-the-murder-of-a-us-sikh-separatist-heres-what-we-know\">Gurpatwant Singh Pannun</a>, an American lawyer and also a Sikh activist.</p><p>Nikhil Gupta, 54, accused of plotting to kill Pannun, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/14/indian-national-admits-role-in-us-sikh-leaders-assassination-plot\">pleaded guilty</a> to three criminal charges in a federal court in New York City earlier this month. He faces up to 40 years in prison for admitting to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p><p>Sikh activists in the United Kingdom were also reportedly warned of a threat from the Indian government.</p><p>Trudeau’s approach to the issue, in some sense, had become emblematic of the problem in bilateral ties, said Harsh Pant, a foreign policy analyst in New Delhi.</p><p>His confrontational approach “meant that issues that could have been dealt with at the bureaucratic level were elevated to the strategic level”, and it became difficult to disentangle the two, he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4341614\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4341614\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4341614\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-06-17T200914Z_1408408275_RC2C4FAUF7C6_RTRMADP_3_G7-SUMMIT-1772131938.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4341614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands before posing for a photo during the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Kananaskis, in Alberta, Canada, on June 17, 2025 [File: Amber Bracken/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"thaw-in-icy-relations\">Thaw in icy relations</h2><p>When Carney was <a href=\"/news/2025/3/9/who-is-mark-carney-canadas-new-liberal-leader-and-next-prime-minister\">elected new leader of the ruling Liberal Party</a> in 2025, he replaced Justin Trudeau amid historic tensions with the United States and fears of a trade war with the Trump administration. Carney took the stage, actively looking for new partners to mitigate this threat.</p><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi leapt to congratulate him and immediately called on him “to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people”.</p><p>Soon, Carney had invited Modi to Canada for the G7 summit in June last year, where both leaders met on the sidelines. New envoys in both countries followed. Suddenly, everything had changed in the relationship, said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based analyst on South Asia.</p><p>“There is just more optimism and momentum for the relationship,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. Under Carney, the Canadian government “recognises that this relationship is too important to let it flounder”.</p><p>The commercial incentives for Canada to get the relationship back on track are huge. “And that all starts with changing the tone and the mood,” Kugelman said. Hence, this week’s comments by Canadian officials that “India is no longer a threat”.</p><p>Vina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera that Ottawa has moved from a public, crisis-driven posture to a more deliberate, step-by-step “reset”.</p><p>Under Carney, “the emphasis is on rebuilding structured channels so security concerns – including transnational repression and interference – can be handled through sustained law enforcement and national security cooperation rather than megaphone diplomacy,” she argued.</p><p>“Ottawa is trying to do both at once: defend the rule of law at home while advancing areas of mutual interest abroad.”</p><p>But Carney’s change in approach does not mean the problem of threats against Sikh activists has vanished.</p><p>“Canadian officials definitely still worry about the transnational repression issue, and particularly as legal proceedings continue,” said Kugelman.</p><p>The current Canadian government is merely taking a different approach, he suggested: “a more ‘accommodationist’ approach – one that focuses on essentially working through this issue with India”.</p><p>Unlike the Canadian officials in their off-the-record briefing, Foreign Minister Anita Anand evaded a direct question from reporters when quizzed about whether India is no longer considered a threat. Instead, she said, discussions on the issues of transnational violence are ongoing at the highest levels of both governments.</p><p>New Delhi will also want to address the challenges of “Khalistani extremism”, which will be a challenge for Carney, said Pant, who is vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4341621\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4341621\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4341621\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-06-17T214313Z_508775542_RC2F4FAJV0RY_RTRMADP_3_G7-SUMMIT-1772132084.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C516&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4341621\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives at a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney during the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada, on June 17, 2025 [File: Amber Bracken/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-way-forward\">The way forward</h2><p>On Friday, Carney <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/27/canadian-pm-carney-heads-to-india-on-significant-trip-to-consolidate-ties\">began his two-day visit</a> to New Delhi, where the two prime ministers are holding talks at Hyderabad House and will review the India-Canada Strategic Partnership.</p><p>The Canadian PM is also expected to lock in deals on trade and investment, including on energy, critical minerals, agriculture, education, research and people-to-people ties.</p><p>Collaboration in these sectors will define the trajectory of this relationship going forward, said Pant.</p><p>Ultimately, the key external factor driving Carney’s visit to New Delhi is Trump’s trade war, said Kugelman. Both Canada and India have seen their relations with the US, a top trade partner, slide since Trump returned to the White House in January last year.</p><p>While India has somewhat <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\">stabilised its relations</a> with the US this year since trade negotiations reached the final stages, Ottawa and Washington remain at odds over their worldviews and international trade.</p><p>“[Carney’s approach] is part of a broader global trend that we’re seeing, countries that have worked with the US for a long time are now looking to strengthen ties with other partners,” said Kugelman. “From the perspective of Ottawa and New Delhi, it’s really a no-brainer that this relationship not only has to get back on track, but it also needs to be put in a position where it can grow even more.”</p><p>Nadjibulla of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada added that India is key to Canada’s efforts to reduce over-reliance on the US and to diversify its economic and strategic partnerships.</p><p>But unresolved issues, like the ones of transnational violence, undermine the durability of now-blooming bilateral ties, she added.</p><p>“If unresolved security allegations sit in the background without credible processes and enforcement cooperation, normalisation becomes politically brittle,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. “Vulnerable to the next incident, leak, or court development.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The sources said that the strike occurred in an area outside the Israeli military’s control, and described the condition of some of the wounded as critical.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"7\">In the central Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed and others were injured in a similar Israeli drone strike that targeted a police post at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"9\">Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said that the rising number of deaths as a result of the ongoing Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip reflects “the Zionist occupation’s blatant disregard for the efforts of mediators, and its complete disregard for the Peace Council and its role”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"10\">Qassem added, in a statement, that Israel is continuing its war of extermination against the Palestinian people, despite some changes to form and method, indicating that “the talk of the guarantor states about stopping the war lacks any real substance on the ground”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"10\">Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said, “It has been a bloody night. Israeli forces carried out a series of deadly air strikes, this time primarily focusing on police checkpoints that have been deployed too close to areas where armed militias are operating in the eastern communities of the Gaza Strip, in particular in … Khan Younis and Bureij refugee camp.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"10\">“Six police members have been killed as a result … But also here, the timing and location are critically reshaping the whole equation between both sides. Israel has made clear that Israel will not be responsible for reorganising the remnants of life in Gaza. That’s why we can see that any kind of restoration of previous services, including police… will be thwarted,” he added.</p><p>The Gaza Crossings and Borders Authority on Friday reported that 50 Palestinians travelled through the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Thursday including 13 patients and 37 companions., while 41 citizens returned to to Gaza.</p><p>There has been a trickle of human movement in either direction since Israel partially opened the crossing. Thousands of Palestinians require urgent medical attention outside of the devastated enclave but Israel is severely restricting their exit.</p><p>The authority also reported 286 trucks entered Gaza Thursday, including 174 commercial trucks and 112 carrying aid.

There are no restraints towards Israel at all, so the design is very colonial,” Shofwan added.</p><p>The board’s executive committee comprises Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner; US Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East; Marc Rowen, CEO of Apollo Global Management; World Bank President Ajay Banga; former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair; and Robert Gabriel Jr, US deputy national security adviser.</p><p>Palestinian participation in the board has been siloed into a “transitional committee” of apolitical technocrats led by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister.</p><p>Earlier this month, shortly after Prabowo signed on to the Board of Peace, representatives from some 40 civil society and religious groups in Indonesia met the president to discuss the Gaza mission, Indonesia’s state news agency Antara reported at the time.</p><p>Prabowo told the groups he was prepared to withdraw from the Board of Peace if it “fails to advance the goal of an independent Palestine”, Antara reported, citing Muhammad Cholil Nafis, vice chairman of Indonesia’s top Islamic advisory body.</p><p>Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also emphasised that the country’s troops will be in Gaza “solely to support Palestine’s recovery and its fight for independence and sovereignty”.</p><p>In addition to deploying troops to Gaza, Indonesia will also focus on humanitarian assistance and send several hospital ships.</p><p>But observers told Al Jazeera that Prabowo’s decision to join the Board of Peace reflected more his “personalised” style of leadership and his desire to be seen as a global player than a direct concern with the question of Palestine.</p><p>“We participated with peacekeepers in Lebanon and [the Democratic Republic of the] Congo, but now the new president wants to make Indonesia diplomatically stronger on the global level,” said Yon Machmudi, an expert in Indonesian politics and international relations, also at the University of Indonesia.</p><p>“This is also part of the motivation of the president to be involved in any kind of negotiations with the peace process,” he said.</p><p>“I think Prabowo truly wants to leave a significant legacy, remembered as a president active in global peace, not only in the Middle East but also in other regions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war,” Machmudi said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325932\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325932\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325932\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-19T152221Z_1999133281_RC21PJAVWJ8M_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-TRUMP-BOARD-1771563119.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and other world leaders attend the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., on February 19, 2026.

The deal kept tariff rates at 19 percent, while Indonesia agreed to cut tariffs on 99 percent of its US imports.

And India, with its 1.4 billion people, is a potentially large market for Canada’s vast petroleum and natural gas reserves, among other products.</p><p>But to build those economic bonds will require Carney to overcome diplomatic tensions and hesitancy about the costs of its exports, according to analysts.</p><p>“Canada domestically needs to figure out to what extent it wants to grow its oil and gas industry,” said Tarun Khanna, professor at the University of British Columbia who focuses on energy policy.</p><p>“Improvement in the overall relationship can provide incentives to both nations.”</p><h2 id=\"repairing-a-diplomatic-rupture\">Repairing a diplomatic rupture</h2><p>Part of the hurdle for Carney is repairing recent diplomatic strains between his country and India.</p><p>The two countries engaged in a prolonged diplomatic freeze in September 2023, after Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alleged that India was involved in the killing of a Sikh separatist activist on Canadian soil.</p><p>India rejected the allegations as false, and both countries expelled each other’s diplomats.</p><p>A breakthrough came last year when Carney invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Kananaskis, Alberta, to attend the Group of Seven (G7) leaders’ summit in June.</p><p>Since then, relations have thawed. In September, both sides named new diplomats to serve as high commissioners to each other’s countries.</p><p>In the lead-up to this week’s meeting, more bilateral collaboration has unfolded. Officials from India and Canada have engaged in senior ministerial and working-level engagements in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), liquefied natural gas (LNG), critical minerals and supply chain resilience.</p><p>“This is a very significant visit and allows Prime Minister Carney to consolidate a reset that began in the relationship last year,” said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, a research institute.</p><h2 id=\"finding-alternative-trading-partners\">Finding alternative trading partners</h2><p>But the rapprochement with India also comes in a transition period for Canada.</p><p>The US has long been its primary trading partner: It is the only country it shares a border with. But since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, the US has taken an aggressive stance towards trade with Canada.</p><p>Trump has stacked steep tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminium and automobile parts. He also suggested he would like Canada to cede its sovereignty and become a state within the US.</p><p>Carney has resisted such efforts, including by imposing counter-tariffs on US goods.</p><p>But in January, he gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he outlined his vision for “middle-power” states to break from the superpowers that seek their “subordination”.</p><p>“From the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just,” Carney said.</p><p>“This is the task of the middle powers: the countries that have the most to lose from a world of fortresses and the most to gain from genuine cooperation.”</p><p>Carney’s trip to India, followed by Australia and Japan, is his first major trip to Asia following his Davos speech. Experts say the outing will give him a stage on which to spread his appeal for “genuine cooperation” among smaller economies.</p><p>“It allows him to take that message of middle-power diplomacy to India, Australia and Japan, the three most significant for Canada in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Nadjibulla.</p><p>The trip also comes at a time when, on the domestic front, Carney’s top priority is to strengthen economic resilience, make sure investments keep flowing into Canada, and protect industries that have been hit by Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>As part of that push, <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/15/canadas-mark-carney-seeks-reset-on-pivotal-trip-to-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carney visited China last month</a>, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so in almost a decade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-market-for-canadian-energy\">A market for Canadian energy</h2><p>Carney’s latest trip is expected to yield announcements on Canadian exports of oil, natural gas, uranium and critical minerals, as well as cooperation with India on developing nuclear power as a clean energy source.</p><p>The outreach effort is “part of Carney’s strategy” to diversify its economic trading partners and find new markets for its products, according to MV Ramana, an expert in energy and security at the University of British Columbia.</p><p>Canada is the fourth-largest exporter of crude oil in the world, and the fifth-largest oil producer overall. Its crude exports were valued at more than $100.7bn in 2024 alone.</p><p>But Ramana believes that negotiations will also centre on Canada’s uranium. The North American country is the world’s second-largest producer of the metal, which is key to nuclear power production.</p><p>“Canada is trying to position itself as an exporter, a petro-state of sorts — not just for oil and gas, but also critical minerals and uranium,” Ramana said.</p><p>India has a long history of nuclear cooperation with Canada, which provided it with a research reactor in the 1950s for its nascent nuclear programme.</p><p>It has continued to import uranium from Canada, and the two countries are in the midst of finalising a 10-year, $2.8bn deal that would ensure a supply of the metal to India.</p><p>Given that backdrop, Ramana said he expects to see announcements on small modular reactors for nuclear energy, even though there are currently only a few operating in Russia and China.</p><p>The first in North America — the Darlington New Nuclear Project — is in the works in Ontario, and Carney appears to be angling for Canada to become a leader in such small-scale reactors. But it won’t be easy, warned Ramana.</p><p>“These are supposed to be cheaper, but they also produce far less power. As a result, the cost per unit of power generation will be much higher,” he said.</p><p>Another complication is the fact that the licence for the modular reactor design is owned by a US company.</p><p>That means the US will need to be involved, said Ramana, a tricky balance as Carney continues to be in the crosshairs of Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"combination-of-price-and-strategic-decision\">‘Combination of price and strategic decision’</h2><p>With the largest population in the world, India’s already-huge energy demands are expected to keep increasing.</p><p>Khanna, the energy policy expert, said that means there is likely to be negotiation about fossil fuels as well during Carney’s trip.</p><p>“We don’t know what will materialise, but given the Indian energy situation, oil and gas is one thing that will be on the table,” said Khanna.</p><p>But India has also faced backlash under Trump about where it sources its energy supply from.</p><p>In August, the US president slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on India, doubling his tariffs on the South Asian nation to 50 percent, as a penalty for its import of Russian oil.</p><p>That was finally <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/2/trump-to-slash-us-tariffs-on-india-from-50-percent-to-18-percent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rolled back</a> this month, and US tariffs on India were brought down to 18 percent, though that rate, among others, was overturned by a decision from the US Supreme Court.</p><p>Now, the current US tariffs on Indian imports sit at 10 percent. But experts have warned that Trump’s tariff policies have sown uncertainty among the US’s trading partners, including India.</p><p>So New Delhi is looking to secure its oil supplies, and Canada is looking for new buyers, Khanna said. But price will ultimately be the key.</p><p>“India is a price-sensitive market, so the Indian side will be looking for deals that secure supplies but at a reasonable price,” he pointed out.</p><p>If Ottawa seeks to increase its market, “then it’s up to them to see what kind of incentives they can hand out”, Khanna added.</p><p>For India to sign a deal, “it will have to be a combination of price and strategic decision”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We could hardly break it into smaller change or buy anything, as sellers don’t accept overused paper bills,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Moreover, the seller doesn’t accept it unless I spend it all, as they don’t have change. Now, as he is paid into his bank account, we buy everything through bank apps,” she added.</p><p>But digital payments have added another layer of hardship to a large segment of the population.</p><p>Most Palestinians still do not receive bank-transferred salaries, many lack access to smartphones, and those who have phones struggle to keep them charged in an area where electricity services are in severe crisis.</p><p>To add to that, there is still the problem of finding a good internet connection for the transfer process.</p><p>Abu Harbeid said a proper trip to the market requires her to have her husband or son with her to pay for goods.

A small group of traders effectively manages cash circulation through high-commission cashing operations.”</p><p>He said that when money itself becomes a traded commodity, it signals severe distortion in the monetary system. “Cash, like any commodity, becomes subject to supply and demand dynamics. When it becomes scarce, its value increases beyond its nominal worth. From an economic perspective, this represents a structural disruption of the monetary system.</p><p>“The formal banking sector and the Palestinian Monetary Authority were sidelined. What we are seeing is the neutralisation of the formal monetary system,” he said.</p><p>Abu Qamar said the deeper issue was confidence – not just in cash, but in the financial system as a whole. “Cash is inherently difficult to track, whereas electronic payments are traceable and can be frozen or restricted. Implementing such a transition abruptly produces severe economic and social distortions,” he warned.</p><p>“Widespread selling on credit is not a sign of market stability – it is an indicator of declining incomes and weakened purchasing power. When debt expands rapidly without a parallel increase in income, the result is social fragmentation. Approximately 95 percent of households in Gaza depend on aid,” he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4340209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4340209\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4340209 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/When-money-is-scarce-every-choice-counts-bank-cash-or-on-credit.-1772105810.jpg?resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People purchasing goods at a grocery shop at Al-Zawya market [Ola al-Asi/ Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4340209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People shopping for goods at a grocery store in az-Zawya market [Ola al-Asi/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Profiteering from Gaza’s woes </strong></h2><p>The war has paved the way for middlemen to cash in illegally on the financial woes of Gaza, residents said.</p><p>Sukkar said that when her husband or sons needed cash, they were often forced to deal with brokers who charge a hefty commission that could reach 50 percent.</p><p>“We lose our money to them for nothing; they steal from us under our full consent,” she said.</p><p>Many residents, like Abu Harbeid, also do not trust bank transfers, saying they prefer physical cash in hand.</p><p>“I ask my sons, where does that money in the account appear?” said Sukkar.</p><p>“Who holds our money in their hands? I used to see money and count it, the banknotes and the change. On some days, when there are technical problems with the bank applications, we get nervous about the possibility of losing the money in their accounts,” she added.</p><p>Abdallah Sukkar, whose family ran a well-known family store in the Shujayea area in eastern Gaza before the war, said families who receive direct deposit salaries often buy with bank transfers.</p><p>“But I don’t like this method; I prefer cash,” he said.</p><p>He said he accepts all banknotes, whether new or worn-out ones, and allows people to buy on credit, but admitted that all of that affects his ability to make improvements to the roadside stall he now runs in place of his family’s old business.</p><p>He also complained of unpaid debts, adding that debts had soared by more than 500 percent during the war, while his profits barely reach 2 percent. He said he had given out 20,000 shekels’ worth of goods to new customers, “all of [whom] have become customers during the war”.</p><p>“People don’t have money; I can’t turn them away when they come to buy food on credit. It’s already catastrophic in Gaza,” he said.</p><p>“From the beginning of Ramadan till now, I haven’t had banknotes and change, which affects the sales. I don’t have small change to give to people who have cash, so they turn to other stalls or shops.</p><p>“Yesterday, when the bank application stopped, we were terrified that we might lose our money in the bank,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

region, killing one person and injuring eight others, regional governor Ivan Fedorov wrote on the Telegram platform. The attacks included drone strikes, artillery shelling and three missile strikes, Fedorov said.</li>\n<li>Ten people, including an eight-year-old child, were also injured in an overnight Russian attack on the regional capital, Zaporizhzhia city, the region’s military administration said. Russian strikes damaged about 80 high-rise buildings and private houses in three districts of the city, as well as two shopping centres, the administration added.</li>\n<li>Russian forces injured 16 people, including two children, in attacks on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said in a post on Facebook.</li>\n<li>A Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone reached Ukraine’s Kharkiv region on Tuesday, marking the first time Ukraine had detected this type of drone reaching the region, the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement. The drone hit a tree and no injuries were reported, the office added.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian missiles struck the Russian border town of Belgorod, inflicting serious damage on energy installations and disrupting power, water and heating, the region’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said early on Friday.</li>\n<li>Belgorod Mayor Valentin Demidov said on Telegram on Thursday that “nearly 10,000 customers in the city are temporarily without power” following “regular shelling of Belgorod’s power facilities by the Ukrainian Armed Forces”.</li>\n<li>Belgorod’s operational headquarters also said on Thursday that at least 115 Ukrainian drones had been launched towards the region in a 24-hour period.</li>\n<li>More than 90,000 Ukrainians are considered to be “missing under special circumstances”, the Ukrainska Pravda media outlet reported, citing Ukraine’s commissioner for missing people, Artur Dobroserdov. Those missing include members of the military as well as civilians, including children, Ukrainska Pravda reported.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said that Ukraine had received the remains of 1,000 bodies from Russia, “which, according to preliminary information from the Russian side, may belong to Ukrainian defenders”.</li>\n<li>Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky confirmed in a post on Telegram that Russia had handed over the bodies of 1,000 “fallen Ukrainian soldiers” to Kyiv and received 35 bodies of Russian soldiers.</li>\n<li>The exchange followed <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/us-ukraine-to-meet-in-geneva-as-russia-attacks-kyiv-with-missiles-drones\">recent trilateral talks</a> between Russia, the United States and Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"peace-negotiations\">Peace negotiations</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukrainian and US officials again met in Geneva on Thursday to discuss post-war reconstruction, even as a deal to end the war remains elusive, the Reuters news agency reported.</li>\n<li>Putin’s special economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev said Russian officials also held talks with US officials on Thursday, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 id=\"politics-and-diplomacy\">Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia said on Thursday it would retaliate against a European Union decision to cut Moscow’s diplomatic representation in Brussels, and that the move showed the EU did not deserve to take part in negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the EU decision to limit the size of the Russian mission to 40 people was “discriminatory” and would not go unanswered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Zakharova also said that any deployment of British troops in Ukraine would prolong the war and bring an “increase in the risk of a large-scale military confrontation involving many more states”, following a recent newspaper article by British Defence Minister John Healey.</li>\n<li>French Ministry of Defence spokesperson Olivia Penichou told reporters that Russia’s accusation that Ukraine was developing a “dirty” nuclear bomb was “baseless”, accusing Russia of using “disinformation to foster a climate of mistrust”.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban asked the EU to send a “fact-finding mission” to assess damage to the Druzhba oil pipeline in Ukraine, in a letter seen by Reuters. The request follows after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that repairs to the pipeline that supplies Hungary and Slovakia with oil were taking an extended period of time due to ongoing Russian attacks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 id=\"regional-security\">Regional security</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Swedish broadcaster SVT reported that a suspected Russian drone approached France’s Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier while it was docked in Sweden’s Malmo.

States has ruled that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) broke the law by disclosing confidential taxpayer information “approximately 42,695 times” to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/heres-what-to-know-about-your-legal-rights-when-encountered-with-ice\">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE).</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69646607/74/center-for-taxpayer-rights-v-internal-revenue-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decision</a> issued on Thursday, US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly found that the IRS had erroneously shared the taxpayer information of thousands of people, in apparent violation of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The ruling cited IRS Code 6103, one of the strictest confidentiality laws in federal statute, which largely prohibits the disclosure of tax return information without consent.</p><p>Kollar-Kotelly said that the IRS violated that law “approximately 42,695 times by disclosing last known taxpayer addresses to ICE”.</p><p>“The IRS not only failed to ensure that ICE’s request for confidential taxpayer address information met the statutory requirements, but this failure led the IRS to disclose confidential taxpayer addresses to ICE in situations where ICE’s request for that information was patently deficient,” she wrote.</p><p>Her finding is based on a declaration filed earlier this month by Dottie Romo, the chief risk and control officer for the IRS, which revealed that the IRS had provided the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with information on 47,000 of the 1.28 million people that ICE had requested.</p><p>In most of those cases, Romo said, the tax agency gave ICE additional address information in violation of privacy rules created to protect taxpayer data.</p><p>The government is appealing the case, but the Thursday ruling is significant because Romo’s declaration supports the decision on appeal.</p><p>Kollar-Kotelly, meanwhile, called the Romo declaration “a significant development in this case”.</p><h2 id=\"what-agreement-does-the-irs-have-with-ice\">What agreement does the IRS have with ICE?</h2><p>The case is the result of a growing effort under the administration of President Donald Trump to <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/12/31/how-donald-trump-launched-a-new-push-to-amass-us-government-data-in-2025\">consolidate government data</a>, alarming rights advocates who fear an erosion of taxpayer privacy.</p><p>Part of that data has been used to carry out Trump’s campaign of mass deportation, a key pillar of his second-term agenda.</p><p>On April 7, the IRS entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security to help with “non-tax criminal enforcement”.</p><p>That agreement, however, was widely understood to be the groundwork for the identification and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/how-donald-trumps-spending-bill-could-kick-us-deportations-into-overdrive\">deportation</a> of immigrants in the US through taxpayer data.</p><p>The Center for Taxpayer Right sued the government over the disclosure, citing protections instituted after the 1972 Watergate scandal revealed how former President Richard Nixon misused tax data during his term.</p><p>“This nation already once experienced a President who sought to collect tax information on his political allies and enemies in the White House for use for favor and punishment,” the centre wrote in an initial complaint.</p><p>“Following the Watergate era, Congress clearly and unequivocally acted to protect the American people from these intrusions.”</p><p>It argued that taxpayer data is uniquely sensitive and “in grave jeopardy” of being shared broadly across the government.</p><p>Nina Olson, founder of the Center for Taxpayer Rights, said after Thursday’s ruling, “This confirms what we’ve been saying all along: that the IRS has an unlawful policy that violates the Internal Revenue Code’s protections by releasing these addresses in a way that violates the law’s requirements.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Representatives from the IRS and the Department of the Treasury did not respond to The Associated Press’s requests for comment.</p><p>Currently, the data-sharing agreement allows ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the US illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.</p><p>The deal, signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, led the then-acting commissioner of the IRS to resign.</p><p>There are several ongoing cases that challenge the agreement between the IRS and immigration authorities.</p><p>Earlier this week, a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit declined to issue a preliminary injunction for the immigrants’ rights group Centro de Trabajadores Unidos and other nonprofits as they sue the federal government to stop implementation of the agreement.</p><p>In declining the preliminary injunction request, Judge Harry T Edwards wrote that the nonprofit groups “are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim”, since the information the agencies are sharing isn’t covered by the IRS privacy statute.</p><p>Still, two separate court orders have blocked the agencies from massive transfers of taxpayer information and blocked ICE from acting upon any IRS data in its possession. Those preliminary injunctions are still in place.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Colombia has, for many years, been the world’s largest source of cocaine.</p><p>And like Trump, Noboa has increasingly relied on tariffs against Colombia to force adherence to Ecuador’s national security strategy.</p><p>His government has accused Petro’s of failing to cooperate with border security measures. The two countries both sit on the Pacific coast, and they share a land border that stretches roughly 586 kilometres, or 364 miles.</p><h2 id=\"questions-about-electricity\">Questions about electricity</h2><p>Thursday’s announcement follows an initial 30 percent tariff imposed by Quito in early February.</p><p>Ecuadorian officials have also justified the protectionist measures by citing a growing trade deficit.</p><p>According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a data analysis firm, nearly 4 percent of Colombian exports go to Ecuador, worth roughly $2.13bn. Ecuador imports significant quantities of medicines and pesticides from Colombia.</p><p>Fewer exports go from Ecuador to Colombia, though. Roughly 2.3 percent of Ecuador’s exports abroad go across the shared border, amounting to a value of $863m.</p><p><span>Ecuador’s trade deficit with Colombia sits at roughly $1.03bn through 2025, according to government data, excluding oil.</span></p><p>But in spite of the anticipated tariff hike, it is unclear whether Ecuador will apply the new tariffs to Colombian electricity — a critical resource for the country.</p><p>In a retaliatory move following the initial tariffs, Colombia suspended all energy sales to its neighbour.</p><p>That suspension risks fuelling tensions in Ecuador against Noboa’s government. Recent droughts have created disruptions to Ecuador’s hydroelectric dams, which provide nearly 70 percent of the country’s power.</p><p>Those disruptions have caused <a href=\"/features/longform/2024/12/19/in-the-dark-how-rolling-blackouts-have-transformed-life-in-ecuador\">widespread power outages</a> in recent years, which in turn have prompted antigovernment protests. In the past, Noboa has responded by buying electricity from Colombia.</p><h2 id=\"pipeline-standoff\">Pipeline standoff</h2><p>The transportation of fossil fuels has also become a flashpoint between Ecuador and Colombia in the aftermath of February’s tariffs.</p><p>Noboa’s government has hiked fees for Colombian crude delivered through the Trans-Ecuadorian System Oil Pipeline (SOTE) by 900 percent.</p><p>That raises the cost to approximately $30 per barrel. Colombia has responded by halting all oil shipments through the line.</p><p>Despite high-level diplomatic efforts, tensions between the neighbouring countries remain at an impasse.</p><p>Officials representing foreign policy and security held a meeting this month in Ecuador, but the gathering concluded without a breakthrough.</p><p>In announcing the latest tariff hike, Ecuador’s Ministry of Production and Foreign Trade levelled criticism at Colombia for failing to implement “concrete and effective” measures to curb drug trafficking along the border.</p><p>Once considered a bastion of stability, Ecuador has seen a spike in homicide and other violent crimes.</p><p>According to the Geneva-based Organized Crime Observatory, the Andean nation recorded a homicide rate of approximately one murder every hour last year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It argues that the sanctions are an effort to punish Albanese for bringing attention to rights abuses Israel has perpetuated against Palestinians.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Since 2022, Albanese, a legal scholar, has served as the special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza, where she monitors human rights abuses against Palestinians. The UN Human Rights Council selected her for the position.</p><p>The Trump administration, however, sanctioned her last July, calling her “unfit” for her role and accusing her of “biased and malicious activities” against the US and its ally, Israel.</p><p>It also highlighted her work with the International Criminal Court (ICC), which — after considering the recommendations of Albanese and other experts — issued an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>Albanese’s family, however, defended her comments as an expression of free speech, protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.</p><p>“Francesca’s expression of her views about the facts as she has found them in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and about the work of the ICC is core First Amendment activity,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-role-chronicling-abuses\">A role chronicling abuses</h2><p>Albanese, an Italian citizen, has long fielded criticism from the Israeli government and its allies in the US for her criticisms of the violence committed against Palestinians.</p><p>Her international profile has grown since Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza on October 8, 2023. More than <a href=\"/features/2026/2/18/gaza-death-toll-exceeds-75000-as-independent-data-verify-loss\">75,000</a> Palestinians have died in that conflict, according to experts and local health officials.</p><p>In March 2024, six months into the war, Albanese <a href=\"/news/2024/3/26/un-expert-accuses-israel-of-several-acts-of-genocide-in-gaza\">testified in a report</a> that she had “reasonable grounds to believe” that the standards for genocide had been reached in Gaza, as outlined in the UN Genocide Convention.</p><p>Israel rejected the findings. Albanese, meanwhile, said <a href=\"/news/2024/3/27/un-expert-says-she-faces-threats-after-israel-gaza-genocide-report\">she faced threats</a> after making her statement to the UN.</p><p>Her public role and blistering condemnation of Israeli abuses have made her a subject of frequent ire from Israeli and US authorities.</p><p>But in Thursday’s lawsuit, Albanese’s family members questioned whether US sanction power should be used to stifle allegations of human rights abuses.</p><p>They also highlighted Albanese’s situation as the mother of a US citizen.</p><p>“At its heart, this case concerns whether Defendants can sanction a person — ruining their life and the lives of their loved ones, including their citizen daughter — because Defendants disagree with their recommendations or fear their persuasiveness,” the court filing said.</p><p>The US Department of State, however, has waved aside the lawsuit as “baseless lawfare”. It maintains that the sanctions against Albanese are “legal and appropriate”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-wider-campaign-in-the-us\">A wider campaign in the US</h2><p>Sanctions generally freeze the US-based assets of an individual and prevent anyone else in the US from doing business with them.</p><p>Since returning for a second term, Trump has used sanctions as penalties for several critics of Israeli and US actions, even beyond Albanese.</p><p>Last June, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-administration-sanctions-international-criminal-court-judges\">sanctioned four ICC judges</a> for taking “illegitimate and baseless actions” against the US and Israel. Then, in August, two more ICC judges, <a href=\"/news/2025/8/20/us-expands-sanctions-targeting-international-criminal-court\">plus two prosecutors</a>, were also slapped with sanctions.</p><p>As recently as December, <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/18/us-sanctions-more-icc-judges-citing-ruling-on-israeli-war-crime-probe\">another pair of ICC judges</a> were added to the list for their involvement in the investigation of alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>A growing number of scholars, rights groups and international organisations have said that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide.</p><p>Israel and the US, however, have largely refuted that assessment. They have also questioned whether the ICC has jurisdiction in their countries.</p><p>Though the US and Israel are not party to the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding document, both have been accused of rights abuses in countries that are members.</p><p>In Albanese’s case, the US government has accused the rapporteur of anti-Semitism and criticised her for pushing for boycotts of US companies implicated in Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.</p><p>“We will not tolerate these campaigns of political and economic warfare, which threaten our national interests and sovereignty,” the US State Department said in its sanctions <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/sanctioning-lawfare-that-targets-u-s-and-israeli-persons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement</a>.</p><p>But Albanese has indicated that she remains committed to her work regardless of the disruptions to her life.</p><p>“My daughter is American. I’ve been living in the US, and I have some assets there. So of course, it’s going to harm me,” Albanese said after the sanctions announcement.</p><p>“What can I do? I did everything I did in good faith, and knowing that, my commitment to justice is more important than personal interests.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
