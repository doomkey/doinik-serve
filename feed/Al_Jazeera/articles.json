It would also ban those it deems as supporting “an armed struggle by an enemy state or a terrorist organisation against the State of Israel”.</p><p>The measures were roundly condemned, given that Israel has weaponised aid throughout the genocide and falsely accused the United Nations humanitarian agencies of working with Hamas fighters and sympathisers.</p><p>Israel has also accused MSF – without providing evidence – of employing people who fought with Palestinian groups.</p><p>MSF said it would “never knowingly” employ people engaging in military activity.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-msf-agree-to-israel-s-demands\">Why did MSF agree to Israel’s demands?</h2><p>MSF runs medical services in Gaza as well as the occupied West Bank, providing critical and emergency medical care, including surgical, trauma, and maternal care. It also helped run field hospitals in Gaza during two years of Israeli genocide.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday, MSF said following “unreasonable demands to hand over personal information about our staff”, it has informed Israeli authorities that, as an exceptional measure, “we are prepared to share a defined list of Palestinian and international staff names, subject to clear parameters with staff safety at its core”.</p><p>It said MSF’s Palestinian employees agreed with the decision after extensive discussions.</p><p>“We would share this information with the expectation that it will not negatively affect MSF staff or our medical humanitarian operations,” MSF said. “Since 1 January 2026, all arrivals of our international staff into Gaza have been denied and all our supplies have been blocked.”</p><h2 id=\"how-have-observers-reacted\">How have observers reacted?</h2><p>MSF’s decision was condemned by some doctors, activists and campaigners, saying it could endanger Palestinians.</p><p>A former MSF employee, who requested to remain anonymous, told Al Jazeera, “It is extremely concerning, from a duty of care perspective, from a data protection perspective, and from the perspective of the most foundational commitment to humanity, that MSF would make a decision like this.”</p><p>“Staff are extremely concerned for their wellbeing and futures. Other NGOs have been in uproar, since it further exposes their decision not to concede to Israel’s demands,” they said. “MSF faces profoundly difficult decisions – concede to the demands of a genocidal regime, or refuse and face complete expulsion and an abrupt end to all health activities in the coming weeks. But what is humanitarianism under genocide? There must be alternatives – alternatives that demand a much bolder and more disruptive approach to humanitarianism amid such brutal political decline.”</p><p>Ghassan Abu Sittah, a British surgeon who has volunteered in Gaza several times, said, “The moral bankruptcy lies in the implication that during a genocide, Palestinians are capable of making free consent. Their employees have as much choice as the Palestinians who knowingly went to their death at the feeding stations to feed their families.”</p><p>He added that the decision was “in clear contravention” of European Union data protection laws.</p><p>Hanna Kienzler, a professor of global health at King’s College London, said on X, “MSF, you have withdrawn your teams from war-affected settings before when you felt a mission’s integrity and/or safety were compromised. What makes you think Palestinian staff can be treated like cannon fodder so you can continue your mission in Gaza?”</p><h2 id=\"have-other-groups-heeded-israel-s-demands\">Have other groups heeded Israel’s demands?</h2><p>Israel says 23 organisations have agreed to the new registration rules. The others are understood to be weighing their decisions.</p><p>Al Jazeera contacted Oxfam and is awaiting a response.</p><h2 id=\"is-aid-being-delivered-to-gaza\">Is aid being delivered to Gaza?</h2><p>Gaza has been pulled back from the brink of famine, but needs far more aid to support the population amid continued Israeli attacks – more than 400 people have been killed since a fragile ceasefire came into place in October, large-scale displacement and a healthcare crisis.</p><p>Food shortages persist.</p><p>Israel said it would commit to allowing 600 aid trucks per day to enter the Strip, but in reality, only 200 or so are being let in, locals say.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thirty-two Cuban soldiers, some of them providing protection to Maduro, were also killed.</p><p>Then last week, he made the “weapons laboratory” accusations and was quoted by El Universal as saying: “The president of the United States admitted that they had used weapons that had never been used on battlefields, weapons that no one in the world possessed. They used that technology against the Venezuelan people on January 3, 2026.”</p><p>He appeared to be referring to an interview Trump gave to the US news channel NewsNation in which he said a “sonic weapon” had been used.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-about-us-secret-weapons\">What has Trump said about US ‘secret weapons’?</h2><p>Days after Maduro’s abduction, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reposted comments that appeared to have been posted on X by a Venezuelan security guard. He wrote that the US had “launched something” during the operation that “was like a very intense sound wave”.</p><p>“Suddenly, I felt like my head was exploding from the inside,” the security guard wrote. “We all started bleeding from the nose. Some were vomiting blood. We fell to the ground, unable to move.”</p><p>Al Jazeera has not been able to verify this account.</p><p></p><p>In his NewsNation interview last week, Trump said the “sonic weapon” was used against Maduro’s <a href=\"https://www.latintimes.com/topics/cuban\">Cuban</a> bodyguards in what he described as a heavily fortified area.</p><p>“Nobody else has it. And we have weapons no one knows about,” Trump said. “And I say it’s probably best not to talk about them, but we have some incredible weapons. That was an incredible attack. Don’t forget that house was in the middle of a fortress and military base.”</p><p>Then, on Sunday, Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying the US had used a weapon designed to disable defensive equipment.</p><p>“The discombobulator,” he said. “I’m not allowed to talk about it.”</p><h2 id=\"what-sonic-or-other-disabling-weapons-has-the-us-been-known-to-use-in-the-past\">What ‘sonic’ or other disabling weapons has the US been known to use in the past?</h2><p>The best known “sonic” systems used by the US are directional acoustic hailing and warning devices, especially the long-range acoustic device (LRAD), Brussels-based military and political analyst Elijah Magnier told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“These are not traditional weapons. Instead, they are powerful, focused sound projectors used for things like stopping ships, securing bases, protecting convoys, managing checkpoints and sometimes crowd control,” he said.</p><p>The main purpose of these devices is to control behaviour by sending voice commands over long distances at a high volume. They can cause discomfort and are designed to force people to either comply with the commands or to leave an area.</p><p>“LRADs have been deployed on ships for piracy deterrence, in port security and by law enforcement agencies,” Magnier explained. “At high output settings, these devices can cause pain, vertigo, nausea or hearing damage, which makes their use sensitive and subject to scrutiny.”</p><p>LRADs are not designed to disable electronics or communication networks, however.</p><p>Another weapon used to disorient people is the active denial system (ADS), which is often wrongly called a “sonic” weapon but does not use sound.</p><p>“Instead, it uses millimetre-wave energy to create a strong heating feeling on the skin, making people move away,” Magnier said. “ADS was sent to Afghanistan in 2010 but was pulled back without being used in combat. Like LRAD, ADS is meant to affect people, not machines.”</p><h2 id=\"how-do-these-devices-work\">How do these devices work?</h2><p>The LRAD system can focus sound into a narrow wave. At a low setting, it enables voices to be heard clearly over long distances. At a higher setting, however, it can be physically debilitating.</p><p>“These effects are only physical and mental,” Magnier said. “Unlike electromagnetic tools, LRAD cannot turn off missiles, radars, computers or communication systems.</p><p>The rapid heating ADS causes to the outer layer of the skin triggers intense discomfort and compels people to move away. “It is a nonlethal area-denial tool intended for crowd control and perimeter defence,” Magnier said.</p><p>“Neither of these systems can realistically disable air defence systems, communication networks or military equipment,” he said. “If equipment stops working, it is much more likely due to electromagnetic, cyber or power denial methods.”</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-us-use-to-disable-systems-and-equipment\">What does the US use to disable systems and equipment?</h2><p>Magnier said the US military is known to use several types of “nonkinetic” and “pre-kinetic” tools. These include:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Electronic warfare (EW)</strong>, which can jam radar systems, block communications, trick GPS and fool sensors. “These actions help control the electromagnetic spectrum,” he said. “EW makes it harder for opponents to understand what’s happening and coordinate their defences before or during attacks.”</li>\n<li><strong>Cyber-physical operations</strong>, which involve sabotaging networks and industrial control systems. “The best known example is the Stuxnet campaign, which targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuge controllers and caused physical damage by changing their software” in 2009, Magnier said.</li>\n<li><strong>Counterelectronics, directed-energy weapons</strong>, which are mainly high-power microwave systems that are built to disable electronics by flooding their circuits with microwave pulses. “The main US project for this is CHAMP (Counter-electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project), which was created to disable electronics without physical force,” Magnier said.</li>\n<li><strong>Graphite or carbon-fibre munitions</strong> that can short-circuit electrical grids and cause widespread power failures without destroying all the equipment.</li>\n</ul><p>“These tools are a key part of the US military’s approach to gaining an ‘information advantage’ and controlling different areas of conflict,” Magnier said.</p><h2 id=\"how-do-these-systems-work-and-when-have-they-been-deployed\">How do these systems work, and when have they been deployed?</h2><p>Electronic warfare changes or blocks the electromagnetic environment. It can disorient radar systems by making them “see” noise or fake targets. It can also cause radios to stop working and disrupt GPS and sensor systems.</p><p>“The aim is to blind, confuse and throw off the enemy to create an opportunity for action,” Magnier said.</p><p>In the Stuxnet cybercampaign in 2009, a computer worm was installed on a computer at an Iranian nuclear facility to cause mechanical damage by taking over industrial control systems. “This operation is widely believed to have been carried out by US and Israeli intelligence against Iran’s nuclear programme,” Magnier said.</p><p>High-power microwave systems can also disable electronics by flooding their circuits with microwave energy, making them stop working without any visible damage to them. “Public tests in the early 2010s showed these systems could selectively disable electronic targets,” Magnier said.</p><p>Graphite or carbon-fibre munitions spread tiny conductive fibres that can short-circuit parts of electrical grids. “These weapons have been linked to major power outages in Iraq in 1991, Serbia in 1999 and Iraq again in 2003,” Magnier said.</p><p>“The basic strategy stays the same: first, take down power, communications, sensors and coordination, then start physical attacks.”</p><h2 id=\"has-the-us-tested-new-weapons-in-other-countries\">Has the US tested new weapons in other countries?</h2><p>“Yes, and this is not just something the United States does. Modern wars often become the first real-world test for new technologies once they are ready to be used,” Magnier said.</p><p>The 1991 Gulf War was the first time stealth aircraft, precision-guided bombs and electronic warfare were used on a large scale.</p><p>The cyberattack on Iran in 2009 was the first time a cyber-physical weapon was used at a strategic level.</p><p>The GBU-43/B MOAB, called “the mother of all bombs”, was first used in combat by the US in Afghanistan in 2017. It is a nonnuclear explosive used in precision strikes against fortified underground targets such as tunnels that delivers an enormous blast wave.</p><p>“It is important to know that testing usually does not mean secret device trials,” Magnier said. “Instead, it means using new tools in real situations and improving them based on what happens and the feedback received.”</p><p>All major countries test new systems in secret as well, especially in areas like electronic warfare, cyber-operations, space targeting, signals intelligence and special operations, he explained.</p><p>“The main difference is not how secret the tools are but how widely they are used, where they are based and how willing countries are to use them.”</p><p>Some examples, such as the Stuxnet attack, involve several countries working together.</p><p>“The US uses Israel for several testing grounds of different types of weapons and other warfare equipment of all kinds, mainly against the Palestinians, in Lebanon and Iran,” Magnier said.</p><p>The US has also accused other countries of using “sonic weapons” against its own personnel. In 2017, it <a href=\"/news/2017/8/12/us-urges-cuba-to-probe-health-attacks-on-diplomats\">demanded an investigation</a> into a suspected sonic attack that left several of its diplomats in need of medical treatment and forced them to leave Havana.</p><p>Then-US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US mission in the Cuban capital had been subjected to “health attacks” that left some staff with hearing loss.</p><p>Canada’s government also <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/canadian-diplomat-cuba-treated-hearing-loss-170810214423519.html\">said</a> at least one Canadian diplomat in Cuba had been treated for hearing loss.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-trump-mean-by-a-discombobulator\">What does Trump mean by a ‘discombobulator’?</h2><p>There is no verified definition of a specific “discombobulator”.</p><p>“These terms are not technical and seem to be used as political labels for existing tools,” Magnier said.</p><p>“The most reasonable view is that this term refers to a group of known nonkinetic tools, not a new device.”</p><p>These could be:</p><ul>\n<li>Cyber-disruption targeting command networks</li>\n<li>Targeted kinetic strikes against antennae, relays and sensor nodes and localised power denial</li>\n</ul><p>To observers on the ground, this would appear as systems suddenly “not working”, Magnier said. A sonic device, however, is highly unlikely to have been responsible for affecting equipment in this way, he added.</p><p>“Reports say Venezuela’s Russian-made air defence systems failed, which could mean they were not well integrated or ready. This can happen because of electronic warfare, node suppression, cyberattacks or weak operations without needing any science fiction explanation. We have seen this happening in Syria for Russian weapons prior to Israel’s attacks.”</p><p>A sonic weapon could have affected soldiers and guards. If people had physical symptoms during the raid in Caracas, that does not indicate a new “sonic weapon” was being used.</p><p>“These effects could come from blast pressure, flash-bang devices or other common disorientation tools,” Magnier said. “There is no public evidence for a new type of weapon.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Recent fighting between the Syrian military and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led group controlling most of northeastern Syria, ended with the government significantly expanding the territory under its control, particularly in Arab-majority areas. Long the SDF’s primary patron, Washington brokered a ceasefire but sided with Damascus in declaring that the time had come for the SDF to reintegrate into the new Syrian state. This stunning pivot has been long in the making, especially since the ouster of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.</p><p>US support for the SDF was always problematic and ultimately destined to end. During my time working on the Syria file at the State Department, I joined several officials in warning the Obama administration that backing the SDF was a strategic mistake that would prolong the conflict and deepen sectarian tensions.</p><p>It would have been wiser — though more difficult — to address the root causes that enabled the rise of ISIL (ISIS): al-Assad’s repression of his people and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s sectarian policies. Instead, Washington risked fracturing Syria and undermining its ties with Turkiye.</p><p>The SDF was dominated by hardline Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) elements that were actively fighting Turkiye, a critical NATO ally. The group was also deeply at odds with the rest of the Syrian opposition and with most Kurdish factions in Syria and Iraq. We argued that whether al-Assad or the opposition ultimately prevailed, the SDF would eventually be forced to reintegrate into a state structure led by the victor.</p><p>Nonetheless, the decision was made to enlist the SDF in the fight against ISIL, while largely sidelining al-Assad’s crimes against his own people. Fast forward to today, and an outcome favourable to Washington appears to be unfolding, despite its role in creating the problem in the first place.</p><p>First, the worst-case scenario — retaliation by a victorious opposition against Kurdish civilians — has not materialised. On the contrary, the Syrian government has gone to great lengths to reassure the Kurdish community that it will be protected, while establishing humanitarian corridors for those affected by the fighting.</p><p>On January 16, President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree</a> granting citizenship to Kurds and recognising Kurdish as a national language alongside Arabic. The timing was impeccable, undercutting the SDF’s primary claim to legitimacy as the sole protector of Kurdish rights and freedoms. Moreover, Syrian military and security forces largely avoided repeating earlier mistakes seen along the coast and in Suwayda, where violence against minority communities had occurred.</p><p>Second, the Syrian military demonstrated impressive operational proficiency in defeating a US-trained and equipped force that had long been viewed as the only cohesive partner capable of countering ISIL and other extremist threats.</p><p>Al-Sharaa’s victory will have a powerful demonstration effect, reinforcing Washington’s perception that it now has a willing and capable military partner in Damascus. This opens new strategic options for the US as it reassesses the scope and duration of its military presence in northeastern Syria.</p><p>Third, the government gained control over vital oil and gas fields in the northeast; this will significantly accelerate Syria’s economic recovery while reducing its dependence on US financial support. The administration of US President Donald Trump wants Syria to become economically viable as a partial return on its gamble on al-Sharaa and his government.</p><p>Accounting for more than 80 percent of Syria’s oil and gas production, these fields will likely attract foreign investment. While US energy firms may participate, thereby benefitting the US economy, the Syrian government is also seeking to diversify its investment partners through agreements with multiple countries.</p><p>Of course, these developments remain fluid, and much can change in the coming weeks and months. After its rapid gains, Damascus would be wise to pursue a negotiated settlement with the SDF as it retreats to predominantly Kurdish areas.</p><p>Continuing fighting would carry severe humanitarian and reputational costs. On January 18, al-Sharaa announced a US-mediated <a href=\"https://x.com/hmzhmo/status/2012917682207654165?s=61\">ceasefire</a> that included integrating SDF institutions into the central government structures. However, talks on the following day failed to resolve the thorny issue of how to incorporate SDF military units.</p><p>Both sides should focus on implementing the January 18 <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/syria-announces-ceasefire-agreement-with-kurd-led-sdf-after-heavy-fighting\">agreement</a> rather than drifting towards full-scale confrontation. Al-Sharaa clearly holds the upper hand, but he can further demonstrate statesmanship by signalling, both domestically and internationally, his commitment to a peaceful resolution.</p><p>For the SDF leadership, options are increasingly limited given recent battlefield losses and sustained US pressure to integrate. As difficult as it may be, the moment has arrived. The current pause in hostilities offers an opportunity to secure special administrative arrangements in Kurdish-majority cities and regions, such as allowing SDF fighters to continue serving locally even as they integrate into the national security apparatus.</p><p>These seismic shifts reflect al-Sharaa’s astute reading of US strategic interests and his ability to act accordingly. Washington has long favoured a unified, stable Syria that poses no threat to its neighbours. For decades, the US tolerated the Assad regime’s brutalities because it broadly maintained these conditions.</p><p>With Syria today clearly incapable of threatening regional stability, Trump’s central concern has been whether the country’s new leadership can reunify the nation while preserving order. Al-Sharaa’s recent manoeuvres suggest he may have taken a decisive step towards answering that question.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><strong><em>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</em></strong></p></div></div></body></html>"

Pretti</a> in the US city of Minneapolis.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Sunday claimed that Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, had “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun”, and that agents had “attempted to disarm the suspect, but the armed suspect violently resisted”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended

US Border Patrol agents on Saturday before stepping in to defend a woman who was shoved to the ground by one agent.</p><p>In footage shared by US-based Drop Site news, Pretti can be seen trying to help the woman before at least five agents tackle him to the ground and shoot him multiple times after a scuffle on the icy road.</p><p>Analysis of footage by US media and Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism group, shows that Pretti’s gun had already been confiscated by an agent before he was shot dead.</p><p>Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara later told reporters that Pretti was a “lawful gun owner” with a permit, and that his only criminal history was a few traffic tickets.</p><p>Despite the video evidence, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino told a news conference that Pretti’s gun showed that he “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement”.</p><p></p><p>Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security, claimed without evidence that Pretti was an “assassin” who tried to “murder federal agents”, while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said he had “violently” resisted arrest.</p><p>Popular right-wing influencers amplified the Trump administration’s claims on X.</p><p>The MAGA-allied account “Libs of TikTok” labelled Pretti a “lunatic” and an “assassin”.</p><p>Right-wing influencer Alexander Muse told his 681,000 followers that Pretti was “expecting a firefight at a distance” with federal agents despite there being no evidence that he ever took out or brandished his gun.</p><p>Some right-wing influencers went even further than echoing the Trump administration’s narrative, piling blatant misinformation on top of officials’ baseless accusations.</p><p>Trump ally Nick Sorter, who has 1.4 million followers on X, falsely claimed that Pretti, a US citizen, was an “illegal alien” who was “armed with a gun and attempted to PULL IT on agents as he was being apprehended”.</p><p>Conservative podcaster Jesse Kelly smeared Pretti as a “soldier for the communist revolution” who had “died fighting in a war” in an X post that included a photo of Pretti on a hike.</p><p>MAGA-affiliated accounts also shared digitally altered images purporting to be pictures of Pretti dressed in female clothing.</p><p>In a statement, Pretti’s parents said their son was a “kindhearted soul” and that the administration’s “sickening lies” about him were “reprehensible and disgusting”.</p><p>Claims that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” and scrutiny of his political beliefs mirror similar accusations levelled at Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was also fatally shot by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis earlier this month.</p><p>Trump administration officials also described Good as a “terrorist” and claimed that she was trying to run over an immigration officer with her vehicle despite video evidence casting doubt on those claims.</p><p>Officials have also spread misleading information seemingly aimed at discrediting protests against Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown more generally.</p><p>The White House last week shared an image of an arrested activist, Nekima Levy Armstrong, that had been altered with artificial intelligence to make her look emotionally distressed.</p><p>Some Republicans have pushed back on the narrative pushed around Pretti’s death, including Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, who said on X that “carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right”.</p><p>The National Rifle Association, a pro-gun lobby group, also rejected a suggestion by a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor  that approaching a law enforcement officer with a gun could be grounds for being shot.</p><p>Minnesota law enforcement officials have also contested statements by Trump administration officials, including a claim by Vice President JD Vance that local authorities refused to assist their federal counterparts in the investigation into Pretti’s killing.</p><p>The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said on Sunday that it was state authorities who were being obstructed, stating on X that its officers had been denied access to the crime scene by the DHS.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In December 2024, Israeli ministers and parliament members visited a location in the southern Israeli town of Sderot, overlooking the Gaza Strip. They pointed at Beit Hanoon and Beit Lahiya, stating that more than 800 Jewish families were willing to move there “as soon as possible”, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.</p><p>Additionally, at an Israeli conference held on December 23, Defence Minister Israel Katz outlined plans to establish agricultural-military bases called “Nava Nahal” – Israeli military outposts that combine farming with an armed presence in an effort to consolidate control over a territory – in the north of Gaza.</p><p>Katz stressed that Israel “will never withdraw and will never leave Gaza”, calling these bases “replacements” for the Israeli settlements cleared in 2005. That was the year Israel withdrew its settlers from the Gaza Strip under a unilateral disengagement plan following the <a href=\"/news/2005/9/28/al-aqsa-intifada-timeline\">second Intifada</a>.</p><p>The withdrawal continues to be a sore topic for the powerful Israeli far right, which considers it a mistake that must be corrected.</p><p>And even if settlements are not eventually built, Israeli leaders have made it clear that they want to control a buffer zone deep into Gaza, territory that would eventually include areas like Beit Hanoon.</p><p>One Israeli officer, quoted in the Long War Journal, said that the campaign to raze Beit Hanoon was part of an operation “to create a significant security perimeter and make it very difficult for the enemy to return to its infrastructure”.</p><p>Israel’s critics say the goal is clear. Speaking to Al Jazeera, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese said that “under the fog of war, Israel is going to destroy Gaza, displace the Palestinians, and attempt to reoccupy and conquer the land”.</p><p>Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">has violated the ceasefire</a> at least 1,300 times since it began on October 10, which includes shooting at civilians 430 times and bombing or shelling Gaza more than 600 times.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But there is one certainty: as long as the fighting carries on, rebuilding cannot happen,” he added.</p><p>Ain al-Arab, which the SDF liberated from a lengthy siege by ISIL in 2015, took on symbolic value as their first major victory against the armed group. It took another four years for the SDF, supported by a US-led international coalition, to defeat ISIL territorially in Syria.</p><p>Syria’s new government, which took power in 2024 after the fall of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, has demanded that the SDF disband.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, has said the purpose of its alliance with the SDF has largely ended.</p></div></div></body></html>"
