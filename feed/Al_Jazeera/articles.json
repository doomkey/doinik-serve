New Delhi’s relations with Washington grew particularly strong under the presidencies of George W Bush and Barack Obama, and remained that way during Trump’s first term and under Joe Biden.</p><p>At the heart of that US warmth towards India, say analysts, was its bet on New Delhi as a balancing force against Beijing, as China’s economic, military and strategic heft in the Asia Pacific region grew. With Soviet communism history, and China, the US’s biggest strategic rival, Washington increased its focus on Asia – including through the Quad, a grouping also including fellow democracies India, Australia and Japan.</p><p>But a decade after Obama famously described the US and India as “best partners”, they appear to be anything but.</p><p>Trump has <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/us-india-relations-at-their-worst-as-trump-slaps-50-percent-tariff\">imposed a 50 percent tariff</a> on Indian imports, among the highest on any country’s products. Half of that penalty is for India’s purchases of Russian oil during its ongoing war with Ukraine – something that the Biden administration encouraged India to do to keep global crude prices under control.</p><p>Meanwhile, China – which buys even more Russian oil than India – has received a reprieve from high US tariffs for now, as Washington negotiates a trade deal with New Delhi.</p><p>That contrast has prompted questions over whether Trump’s approach towards China, on the one hand, and traditional friends like India on the other, marks a broader shift away from the US pivot to Asia.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3509430\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3509430\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3509430\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25044858165155-1739494885.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Narendra Modi and Donald Trump shake hands.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3509430\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President Donald Trump and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, DC, on Thursday, February 13, 2025 [Alex Brandon/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"troubles-for-india-and-modi\">Troubles for India, and Modi</h2><p>Since the early 2000s, successive governments in New Delhi have embraced closer ties with Washington, with its stocks rising in the US as an emerging strategic partner in security, trade and technology.</p><p>Trump made that relationship personal – with Modi.</p><p>During Trump’s first term, he shared the stage twice in public rallies with Modi, as they also exchanged frequent bear hugs and described each other as friends.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But none of that could save New Delhi when Trump hit India with tariffs only matched by the levies issued against <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/10/whats-behind-trumps-50-percent-tariff-for-brazil-despite-trade-surplus\">goods from Brazil</a>.</p><p>“The tariff moves have triggered the most serious rupture in the US-India relations in decades,” said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>For months after Trump threatened tariffs on Indian imports, New Delhi tried to placate the US president, refusing to get drawn into a war of words. That has now changed, with India <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/india-accuses-us-eu-of-russia-trade-double-standards-who-is-right\">accusing the US of hypocrisy</a> – pointing out that it still trades with Russia, and that Washington had previously wanted New Delhi to buy Russian crude.</p><p>“One thing is clear: Trust in the United States has eroded sharply in recent days, casting a long shadow over the bilateral relationship,” Vaishnav told Al Jazeera.</p><p>To Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, the crisis in the relationship also reflects a dramatic turn in the personal equation between Modi and Trump. The state of ties, he said, is “a result of a clash of personalities between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi”.</p><p>India has previously faced the threat of US sanctions for its close friendship with Russia, when it decided to buy S-400 missile defence systems from Moscow. But in 2022, under the Biden administration, it secured a waiver from those proposed sanctions.</p><p>“Not long ago, India could avoid sanctions despite purchasing S-400 weapon systems from Russia. However, now, India’s policy of multi-alignment clashes with President Trump’s transactional approach to geopolitics,” said Donthi.</p><p>To be sure, he pointed out, America’s Cold War history of bonhomie with Pakistan has meant that “a certain distrust of the US is embedded in the Indian strategic firmament”. The Trump administration’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/trumps-pakistan-embrace-tactical-romance-or-a-new-inner-circle\">recent cosiness with Pakistan</a>, with its army chief visiting the US this year, even getting a rare meeting with the president at the White House, will likely have amplified those concerns in New Delhi.</p><p>But through ups and downs in India-US ties over the years, a key strategic glue has held them close over the past quarter century: shared worries about the rise of China.</p><p>“A certain bipartisan consensus existed in the US regarding India because of its long-term strategic importance, especially in balancing China,” said Donthi.</p><p>Now, he said, “the unpredictable Trump presidency disrupted the US’s approach of ‘strategic altruism’ towards India”.</p><p>It is no longer clear to Asian partners of the US, say experts, whether Washington is as focused on building alliances in their region as it once said it was.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3312522\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3312522\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3312522\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP19265688980585-1731163135.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi walk around NRG Stadium waving to the crowd during the \"Howdy Modi: Shared Dreams, Bright Futures\" event, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2019, in Houston.

The US withdrawal from the TPP in early 2017 removed the signature trade pillar, leaving behind a strategy that leaned heavily on military cooperation and less on binding economic partnerships.</p><p>Yet, he refrained from the bulldozing negotiations that have shaped his approach to tariffs, even with <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/3/us-japan-trade-deal-will-this-one-be-too-tricky-for-trump\">allies like Japan</a> and South Korea, and from the kind of tariffs Trump has imposed now on India.</p><p>“There is currently a period of churn and uncertainty, after which clarity will emerge,” Donthi said. “There might be some cautious rebalancing in the short term from the Asian powers, who will wait for more clarity.”</p><p>India, which, unlike Japan and South Korea, has never been a treaty ally to the US – or any other country – might already be taking steps towards that rebalancing.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3889279\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3889279\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3889279\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP16243221138351-1755222012.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt='FILE - In this Sunday, Jan. 25, 2015 file photo, President Barack Obama, left, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have coffee and tea in the gardens of the Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India.

Foreign Minister S Jaishankar is scheduled to travel to the Russian capital later this month. Also in August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is expected to visit New Delhi. And at the end of the month, Modi will travel to China for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, his first trip to the country in seven years.</p><p>India has also indicated that it is open to considering the revival of a Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral mechanism, after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov proposed the platform’s resurrection.</p><p>The concept of trilateral cooperation was first proposed in the 1990s and formally institutionalised in 2002, an idea Lavrov credited to the late Yevgeny Primakov, former chair of the Russian International Affairs Council.</p><p>Although the RIC met regularly in the years following its creation, there has been a gap in recent times, with the last meeting of RIC leaders in 2019, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan.</p><p>India’s Modi faces some “very difficult choices”, said Michael Kugelman, a senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation. “Clearly, India is not going to turn on Russia, a very special partner. And India does not turn on its friends.”</p><p>But doubling down on its strategic independence from the US – or multi-alignment, as India describes it – could come with its costs, if Trump decides to add on even more tariffs or sanctions.</p><p>“The best outcome for India immediately is the Russians and Ukrainians agree to a ceasefire,” said Kugelman, “because at the end of the day, Trump is pressuring India as a means of pressuring Russia.”</p><p>Even as questions rise over Washington’s pivot to Asia under Trump, such a rebalance will not be easy for countries like India, say experts. Ultimately, they say, the US will find its longtime partners willing to return to the fold if it decides to reinvest in those relationships.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3267931\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3267931\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3267931\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-23T112332Z_1911926536_RC29QAAPW2ZV_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-BRICS-1729695647.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C487&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3267931\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi take part in a photo ceremony before a plenary session of the BRICS 2024 summit in Kazan, Russia, October 23, 2024 [Alexander Kazakov/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-cost-of-a-rebalance\">The cost of a rebalance</h2><p>An RIC troika would ultimately be “more symbolic than substantive”, Kugelman said.</p><p>That’s because one of the sides of that triangle is “quite small and fragile: India-China ties”.</p><p>While there have been “notable easing of tensions” in recent months, “India and China <a href=\"/news/2024/10/22/how-india-and-china-pulled-back-from-a-border-war-and-why\">remain strategic competitors</a>,” added Kugelman. After four years of an eyeball-to-eyeball standoff along their Himalayan border, they finally agreed to withdraw troops last year, with Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping meeting in Kazan.</p><p>But “they continue to have a long disputed border”, Kugelman said, and trust between the Asian giants remains low.</p><p>Vaishnav of the Carnegie Endowment agreed.</p><p>“There may be opportunistic venues and moments where the countries’ interests converge. But I think, beyond defence and energy, Russia has little to offer India,” he said. “With China, while we may see a thaw in economic relations, it’s difficult to see a path to resolving broader security and geostrategic disputes.”</p><p>Jon Danilowicz, a retired diplomat who worked in the US State Department, said that a total breakdown of the US-India partnership is in neither’s interest. “The cooperation in other areas will continue, perhaps with less open enthusiasm than had been the case in recent years,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Trump tariffs could help Modi domestically.</p><p>“Trump’s hardball tactics could bolster Modi’s domestic standing. They highlight Washington’s unreliability, allowing Modi to frame himself as standing firm in the face of the US pressure,” said Vaishnav.</p><p>Modi had been facing pressure from the opposition over the ceasefire with Pakistan after four days of military hostilities in May, after 26 civilians were killed in an attack by gunmen in Kashmir in April. The opposition has accused Modi of not going harder and longer at Pakistan because of pressure from Trump, who has claimed repeatedly that he brokered the ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad – a claim India has denied.</p><p>“Any further appearance of yielding – this time to the US – could be politically costly. Resisting Trump reinforces Modi’s image as a defender of national pride,” added Vaishnav.</p><p>Many analysts have said they see Trump’s tariffs also as the outcome of as-yet unsuccessful India-US trade talks, with New Delhi reluctant to open up the country’s agriculture and dairy sectors that are politically sensitive for the Indian government. Almost half of India’s population depends on farming for its livelihood.</p><p>Modi has in recent days said that he won’t let the interests of Indian farmers suffer, “even though I know I will have to pay a personal cost”.</p><p>“He is demonstrating defiance to the domestic electorate,” said Donthi, of the International Crisis Group.</p><p>Ultimately, though, he said, both India and the US would benefit if they strike a compromise that allows them to stop the slide in ties.</p><p>“But the warmth and friendliness won’t be present, and this will be evident for some time,” Donthi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2025/6/10/two-chinese-aircraft-carriers-seen-in-pacific-for-first-time-japan-says\">aircraft carriers into the Pacific together</a> for the first time.</p><p>Maritime expert and former United States Air Force Colonel Ray Powell described the “simultaneous deployment” of China’s two aircraft carriers east of the Philippines as a “historic” moment as the country races to realise Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ambition of having a world-class navy by 2035.</p><p>“No nation except the US has operated dual carrier groups at such distances since [World War II],” said Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project of the Gordian Knot Center at Stanford University.</p><p>“While it will take years for China’s still-nascent carrier capabilities to approach that of America’s, this wasn’t just a training exercise – it was China demonstrating it can now contest and even deny US access to crucial sea lanes,” Powell told Al Jazeera.</p><p>China’s state-run news agency Xinhua described the exercise by the aircraft carriers as a “far-sea combat-oriented training”, and the state-affiliated Global Times reported that China was soon poised to enter the “three-aircraft-carrier era”, when its Fujian carrier enters service later this year.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"east-asia-is-a-home-game-for-china\">East Asia is a ‘home game’ for China</h2><p>China currently has two operational aircraft carriers – the Liaoning and Shandong – and the Fujian is undergoing sea trials.</p><p>While the Chinese navy operates the world’s largest naval fleet with more than 370 ships compared with the US’s 251 active ships in commission, Beijing still lacks the global logistics network and advanced nuclear submarine technology required of a truly mature blue water force, Powell said.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Beijing’s three aircraft carriers run on diesel compared with Washington’s 11 carriers, all of which are nuclear powered.</p><p>But “gaps” in naval capabilities are <a href=\"/news/2021/3/13/chinas-next-aircraft-carrier-could-be-nuclear-powered-report\">closing between the US and China</a>.</p><p>“[China] fully intends to close these gaps and is applying tremendous resources toward that end, and with its rapidly improving technical prowess and vastly superior shipbuilding capacity, it has demonstrated its potential to get there,” Powell said.</p><p>Beijing’s more immediate focus is not directed towards competing with the US globally, Powell added.</p><p>Rather, China is focused on changing the balance of power and convincing its allies and adversaries to accept China’s dominance within its <a href=\"/news/2023/10/24/why-does-china-claim-almost-the-entire-south-china-sea\">chosen sphere of influence</a> in East Asia.</p><p>The second option, if ever necessary, is to defeat them.</p><p>“East Asia is a ‘home game’ for China – a place where it can augment its small carrier force through its far larger land-based air and rocket forces – including so-called [aircraft] ‘carrier killer’ missile systems that can strike targets up to 4,000km [2,485 miles] away,” Powell said.</p><p>Regionally, while the Philippines engages in increasingly frequent high seas confrontations with the Chinese coastguard, it is Japan that is <a href=\"/news/2025/6/12/japan-protests-to-china-after-dangerous-moves-by-warplanes-over-pacific\">watching China’s naval build-up with concern</a>, experts said.</p><p>Japan’s Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said in June – after confirming that China’s two carriers had operated simultaneously in the Pacific for the first time – that Beijing apparently aims “to advance its operational capability of the distant sea and airspace”.</p><p>With the US increasingly perceived as becoming more inward-looking under President Donald Trump, Japan is considered a growing force in the contested maritime terrain in the Asia Pacific region amid what Tokyo has called “the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"preparation-for-a-more-uncertain-future\">‘Preparation for a more uncertain future’</h2><p>Even before Trump’s second stint as US president, Japan had embarked on the most pivotal shift in post-World War II military spending.</p><p>Tokyo’s defence spending and related costs are expected to total 9.9 trillion yen (about $67bn) for fiscal year 2025, equivalent to 1.8 percent of Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP), and the government has committed to raising spending on defence to 2 percent of GDP by 2027, according to Japanese media reports.</p><p>“[Japan’s] naval capacity is growing steadily, not just in support of the US alliance but in quiet preparation for a more uncertain future – perhaps even one in which America withdraws from the Pacific,” said Mike Burke, lecturer at Tokyo-based Meiji University.</p><p>Collin Koh, senior fellow at the Singapore-based Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS), also said that China’s growing military might, assertiveness and proclivity to resort to coercive behaviour have “aggravated Japan’s threat perception”.</p><p>But Japan alone cannot guarantee security in such a regional hotspot as the South China Sea, said Burke.</p><p>Instead, Tokyo’s goal is to check Beijing’s growing power through a Japanese presence and building partnerships with other regional players.</p><p>This year alone so far, Japan has deployed two naval fleets to “realise” what Japanese officials describe as a free and open Asia Pacific region. The first fleet was deployed from January 4 to May 10 and docked in 12 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.</p><p>The second was deployed on April 21 and is ongoing until November, with port calls in some 23 countries, as well as roles in multilateral military exercises.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3889265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3889265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3889265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2015-10-15T000000Z_832463363_GF10000245611_RTRMADP_3_JAPAN-DEFENCE-1755219796.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sailors stand aboard the Kokuryu submarine of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) during its fleet review at Sagami Bay, off Yokosuka, south of Tokyo October 15, 2015.

The 64,000-acre outfit is a key US site for Arctic military drills and readiness.</p><p></p><p>When Trump visited the base during his first term, in 2019, he said the troops there “serve in our country’s last frontier as America’s first line of defence”.</p><p>But that wasn’t always the case. Indeed, the US government actually bought Alaska from Russia – separated by just 90km (55 miles) at the narrowest point of the Bering Strait – in 1867.</p><p>At a news briefing on August 9, Russian presidential assistant Yuri Ushakov pointed out that the two countries are neighbours.</p><p>“It seems quite logical for our delegation simply to fly over the Bering Strait and for such an important … summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,” Ushakov said.</p><h2 id=\"when-did-russia-assume-control-of-alaska\">When did Russia assume control of Alaska?</h2><p>When Russian Tsar Peter the Great dispatched the Danish navigator Vitus Bering in 1725 to explore the Alaskan coast, Russia already had a high interest in the region, which was rich in natural resources – including lucrative sea otter pelts – and sparsely populated.</p><p>Then, in 1799, Emperor Paul I granted the “Russian-American Company” a monopoly over governance in Alaska. This state-sponsored group established settlements like Sitka, which became the colonial capital after Russia ruthlessly overcame the native Tlingit tribe in 1804.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Russia’s Alaskan ambitions, however, quickly faced numerous challenges – the vast distance from then-capital St Petersburg, harsh climates, supply shortages, and growing competition from American explorers.</p><p>As the US expanded westward in the early 1800s, Americans soon found themselves toe to toe with Russian traders. What’s more, Russia lacked the resources to support major settlements and a military presence along the Pacific coast.</p><p>The history of the region then changed dramatically in the mid-19th century.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-russia-sell-alaska-after-the-crimean-war\">Why did Russia sell Alaska after the Crimean War?</h2><p>The Crimean War (1853-1856) started when Russia invaded the Turkish Danubian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, modern-day Romania. Wary of Russian expansion into their trade routes, Britain and France allied with the ailing Ottoman Empire.</p><p>The war’s main theatre of battle became the Crimean Peninsula, as British and French forces targeted Russian positions in the Black Sea, which connects to the Mediterranean through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits – previously controlled by the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>After three years, Russia humiliatingly lost the war, forcing it to reassess its colonial priorities. According to calculations by Advocate for Peace, a journal published by the American Peace Society in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Russia spent the equivalent of 160 million pounds sterling on the war.</p><p>Meanwhile, due to overhunting, Alaska yielded little profit by the mid-1800s. Its proximity to British-controlled Canada also made it a liability in any future Anglo-Russian conflict.</p><p>By the early 1860s, Tsar Alexander II concluded that selling Alaska would both raise funds Russia desperately needed and prevent Britain from seizing it in a future war. The US, which had continued to expand across the continent, emerged as a willing buyer, leading to the 1867 Alaska Purchase.</p><h2 id=\"how-was-the-sale-received-in-the-us\">How was the sale received in the US?</h2><p>After the American Civil War ended in 1865, Secretary of State William Seward took up Russia’s longstanding offer to buy Alaska. On March 30, 1867, Washington agreed to buy Alaska from Russia for $7.2m.</p><p>For less than 2 cents an acre (4 metres), the US acquired nearly 1.5 million sq km (600,000 square miles) of land and ensured access to the Pacific northern rim. But opponents of the Alaska Purchase, who saw little value in the vast ice sheet, persisted in calling it “Seward’s Folly” or “Seward’s Icebox”.</p><p>“We simply obtain by the treaty the nominal possession of impassable deserts of snow, vast tracts of dwarf timbers… we get… Sitka and the Prince of Wales Islands. All the rest is waste territory,” wrote the New York Daily Tribune in April 1867.</p><p>But in 1896, the Klondike Gold Strike convinced even the harshest critics that Alaska was a valuable addition to US territory. Over time, the strategic importance of Alaska was gradually recognised, and in January 1959 Alaska finally became a US state.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-its-economy-like-now\">What’s its economy like now?</h2><p>By the early 20th century, Alaska’s economy began to diversify away from gold. Commercial fishing, especially for salmon and halibut, became a major industry, while copper mining boomed in places like Kennecott.</p><p>Then, during World War II, the construction of military bases brought infrastructure improvements and population growth. The most transformative moment, however, came in 1968 with the discovery of vast oil reserves at Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic coast.</p><p>Oil revenues became the cornerstone of Alaska’s economy, funding public services as well as the Alaska Permanent Fund, which pays annual dividends – via returns on stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets – to residents.</p><p>These payments, known as the Permanent Fund Dividend, will ensure that Alaska’s oil wealth continues to benefit residents even after reserves run out. This system has allowed Alaska to have no state income tax or state sales tax, a rarity in the US.</p><p>More recently, tourism has surged in Alaska, drawing visitors to the state’s national parks and glaciers. Today, Alaska has transformed from a ridiculed purchase into a resource-rich state, built on a mix of natural resource extraction, fishing and tourism.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite Alaska’s history of trading land like currency, President Zelenskyy will <a href=\"/news/2025/8/13/what-are-zelenskyy-europe-demanding-of-trump-ahead-of-putin-summit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hope</a> that Friday’s meeting between Trump and Putin does not come at the expense of Ukrainian territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, it explained that the flight attendants suffered a 9-percent cut in their last contract, meaning that an 8-percent increase over the first year of the new deal is inadequate to recoup the costs.</p><p>“It is, in effect, a pay cut,” CUPE said in its statement.</p><p>The union also argues that Air Canada does not currently offer “ground pay”, an industry term that describes compensation given for all the services provided before a plane’s doors close.</p><p>That work can include assistance given to travellers in the airport, baggage handling and helping travellers get settled in their seats as the plane prepares to push back from the airport gate.</p><p>“[For] any of our federally regulated safety checks, which we do an hour before boarding, we are not compensated. We are not compensated for boarding and deplaning,” Shanyn Elliott, the chair of the CUPE strike committee, told the news outlet Global National.</p><p>“It averages about 35 hours a month that we are at work not paid.”</p><p>The union said that it is seeking full pay for all hours worked, along with cost-of-living increases.</p><p>Ground pay, also called “boarding pay”, has been a key issue in negotiations at US airlines as well, since many carriers do not compensate flight attendants at their hourly rate during crucial periods before or after the flight.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3888939\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3888939\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3888939 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-14T165720Z_2013197635_RC227GAKQZ5P_RTRMADP_3_AIR-CANADA-LABOR-STRIKE-1755196679.jpg?resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt='Union activists hold placards that read \"UnfAIR Canada\" and \"Poverty wages = unCanadian\"' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3888939\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Union activists hold placards as they interrupt a news conference by Air Canada executives on August 14 [Kyaw Soe Oo/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-many-passengers-will-be-affected-and-what-will-they-get-in-return\">How many passengers will be affected, and what will they get in return?</h2><p>The airline, which serves 64 countries with a fleet of 259 aircraft, said the shutdown poses “a major risk” to both the company and its employees.

It also provides domestic service to 50 Canadian airports and averages more than 500 daily flights.</p><p>The airlines said that passengers whose flights are cancelled will be notified and can receive a full refund online.</p><p>The airline has also arranged with other Canadian and international carriers to offer alternative travel options where possible. But it emphasised that some flight alternatives may not be feasible.</p><p>“Given other carriers are already very full due to the summer travel peak, securing such capacity will take time and, in many cases, will not be immediately possible,” the airline explained.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-government-responded\">How has the government responded?</h2><p>Air Canada has said it has sought government-directed arbitration to resolve the situation.</p><p>Under Canada’s Labour Code, the government’s labour minister has the power to intervene and trigger the imposition of a deal through the Canada Industrial Relations Board.</p><p>That, in turn, could force flight attendants back to work.

For many recipients, the payouts are a primary source of income during retirement.</p><p>The programme is considered widely popular: In 2024, the Pew Research Center found that 79 percent of Americans believe Social Security should not be cut in any way.</p><p>Additionally, four out of 10 people surveyed sided with the view that Social Security should be expanded to include more people and more benefits.</p><p>But the programme faces significant hurdles to its long-term feasibility.</p><p>Last year, the Social Security Administration (SSA) <a href=\"http://ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2024/tr2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published a report</a> that found the costs for old-age, disability and survivors’ insurance outstripped the programmes’ income.</p><p>It noted that the trust funds fuelling those programmes “are projected to become depleted during 2033” if measures are not taken to reverse the trend.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>At Thursday’s Oval Office appearance, Trump sought to soothe those concerns, while taking a swipe at the Democratic Party.</p><p>“ You keep hearing stories that in six years, seven years, Social Security will be gone,” Trump said.</p><p>“And it will be if the Democrats ever get involved because they don’t know what they’re doing. But it’s going to be around a long time with us.”</p><p>He added that Social Security was “going to be destroyed” under his Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, a frequent target for his attacks.</p><h2 id=\"criticism-of-trump-s-track-record\">Criticism of Trump’s track record</h2><p>But Trump himself has faced criticism for weakening Social Security since returning to the White House for a second term in January.</p><p>Early on, Trump and his then-adviser Elon Musk laid out plans to slash the federal workforce and reduce spending, including by targeting the Social Security Administration (SSA).</p><p>In February, the <a href=\"https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-announces-workforce-and-organization-plans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social Security Administration said</a> it would “reduce the size of its bloated workforce and organizational structure”, echoing Trump and Musk’s rhetoric.</p><p>The projected layoffs and incentives for early retirement were designed to cut Social Security’s staff from 57,000 to 50,000, a 12.3-percent decrease.</p><p>Under Trump, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has also announced plans to pare back Social Security’s phone services, though it has since backtracked in the face of public outcry.</p><p>In addition, Musk and Trump have attacked Social Security’s reputation, with the former adviser telling podcast host Joe Rogan, “Social Security is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.”</p><p>The two men even claimed Social Security is paying benefits to millions of long-dead individuals, though critics point out that those claims do not appear to be true.</p><p>The COBOL programming system used by the Social Security Administration marks incomplete entries with birthdates set 150 years back, according to the news magazine Wired. Those entries, however, generally do not receive benefits.</p><p>The Office of the Inspector General overseeing the Social Security Administration has repeatedly looked into these older entries. It confirmed that these entries are not active.</p><p>“We acknowledge that almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments,” a <a href=\"https://oig.ssa.gov/assets/uploads/a-06-21-51022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report from 2023</a> said.</p><p>It also indicated that the Social Security Administration would have to pay between $5.5m and $9.7m to update its programming, though the changes would yield “limited benefits” in the fight against fraud.</p><p>Still, Trump doubled down on the claim that dead people were receiving benefits on Thursday.</p><p>“We had 12.4 million names where they were over 120 years old,” Trump said. “There were nearly 135,000 people listed who were over 160 years old and, in some cases, getting payments. So somebody’s getting those payments.”</p><h2 id=\"questions-after-one-big-beautiful-bill\">Questions after ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’</h2><p>Critics have also questioned whether Trump’s push to cut taxes will have long-term effects that erode Social Security.</p><p>In July, Trump’s signature piece of legislation, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), cemented his 2017 tax cuts. It also increased the tax deductions for earners who rely on tips or Social Security benefits.</p><p>But groups like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan think tank, estimate that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will shorten the timeline for Social Security’s insolvency.</p><p>“The law dictates that when the trust funds deplete their reserves, payments are limited to incoming revenues,” <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/retirees-face-18100-benefit-cut-7-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the committee said</a> in late July.</p><p>“For the Social Security retirement program, we estimate that means a 24 percent benefit cut in late 2032, after the enactment of OBBBA.”</p><p>Still, Trump has repeatedly promised to defend Social Security from any benefit cuts. He reiterated that pledge in Thursday’s appearance.</p><p>“American seniors, every single day, we’re going to fight for them. We’re going to make them richer, better, stronger in so many different ways,” Trump said.</p><p>“But Social Security is pretty much the one that we think about, and we love it, and we love what’s happening with it, and it’s going to be good for 90 years and beyond.”</p><p>More than 69.9 million Americans received Social Security benefits as of July.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"131\" data-end=\"1030\">The humanitarian tragedy unfolding in the Gaza Strip must not be perceived merely as a conflict confined to a narrow strip of land; rather, it should be regarded as a deepening humanitarian catastrophe that wounds the collective conscience of humanity with each passing day. Israel’s months-long bombardments have targeted women, children, and the elderly, rendering cities uninhabitable. Homes, hospitals, schools, and places of worship have been reduced to rubble; essential services such as food, water, healthcare, and electricity have collapsed. Hunger, thirst, and the threat of epidemic disease are propelling Gaza towards a total humanitarian collapse. To date, more than 61,000 Palestinians — the majority of them women and children — have been killed in Israeli attacks. This picture is not only the mark of war, but also a stark testament to a systematic policy of annihilation.</p><p data-start=\"1032\" data-end=\"1911\">In the face of such a dire picture, the world’s silence or its feeble responses only deepen the suffering and pave the way for the continuation of oppression. The West’s double standards — rushing to act in other crises while adopting an ambivalent approach to Gaza — undermine the credibility of an international order purportedly founded upon principles and rules. It is a fact that had the swift and comprehensive sensitivity shown towards the crisis in Ukraine also been displayed in the face of the atrocities in Gaza, the landscape we confront today would be entirely different. Israel’s ability to act without the slightest sanction has accelerated the erosion of international law and human rights norms. The crisis in Gaza stands before us as a litmus test of whether the international community is willing and able to uphold the most fundamental human values.</p><p data-start=\"1913\" data-end=\"2763\">From the outset, Turkiye has demonstrated a resolute, consistent, and principled stance to end the atrocities and the worsening humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Our Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), the Turkish Red Crescent, and our civil society organisations are working actively on the ground, and despite all obstacles, food, medicines, and medical supplies are being delivered to the region with the support of brotherly nations in the vicinity. Wounded Gazans are being evacuated and treated in Turkiye. These relief efforts not only address urgent needs, but also proclaim to the world that the people of Gaza are not alone. On the diplomatic front, our calls for a ceasefire continue within the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and our mediation efforts between Palestinian groups are ongoing.</p><p data-start=\"2765\" data-end=\"3336\">At the NATO Summit held in The Hague on June 25, I underlined that the fragile ceasefire must be transformed into a lasting peace, warning that “Gaza has no time to lose.” I have openly defined Israel’s attacks and policy of collective punishment — in flagrant disregard for international law — as genocide. We are working closely, particularly with Qatar, on humanitarian access, ceasefire negotiations, and reconstruction. We value Qatar’s leading role in facilitating humanitarian aid and in advancing diplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing the massacre to an end.</p><p data-start=\"3338\" data-end=\"3907\">The violence in Gaza threatens not only the Palestinian people but also the stability of the entire region. Tensions between Israel and Iran heighten the risk of a broader conflict, with the potential to disrupt the security balance from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Gulf. The deepening of the crisis poses serious threats in the form of new waves of displacement, increased radicalisation, and risks to energy security. The Gaza question is, therefore, not solely a humanitarian crisis, but also a matter of strategic importance for global security and peace.</p><p data-start=\"3909\" data-end=\"4610\">The path to a solution is, in essence, clear. An immediate ceasefire must be declared, and all attacks must be halted unconditionally. Humanitarian corridors must be opened to ensure the unimpeded delivery of food, water, and medical aid, and international mechanisms must be established to protect civilians. Turkiye stands ready to serve as an actor in shaping this process. War crimes and human rights violations must be investigated before the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice; perpetrators must be held to account before the law. Sustainable resources must be secured for aid organisations — particularly the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) — which are being strangled by Israeli pressure.</p><p data-start=\"4612\" data-end=\"5249\">The reconstruction of Gaza must not be confined to rebuilding destroyed structures; it must evolve into a comprehensive process that safeguards the rights to education, healthcare, infrastructure, economic development, and political representation. This process should be conducted with the direct participation of the local population and under the oversight of the United Nations and regional organisations. The foundation of lasting peace lies in the recognition of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine with its territorial integrity safeguarded. A two-state solution is the sole key to peace and stability in the region.</p><p data-start=\"5251\" data-end=\"5967\">The events in Gaza once again demonstrate that war also targets those who pursue truth. In recent months, numerous journalists have been murdered simply for doing their duty, striving to bring the reality of conflict zones to the world. The losses suffered by Al Jazeera, in particular, rank among the most brutal assaults on press freedom and the right to information. The death of courageous individuals who strive to bring the truth to the world and to lift the veil of lies and propaganda that shrouds war is a profound loss for us all. Their memory will remain a symbol of the pursuit of justice. I extend my condolences to the families of the deceased, to their colleagues, and to the entire media community.</p><p data-start=\"5969\" data-end=\"6684\">The cause of Palestine and Gaza transcends borders; it is a common test for humanity. We must never forget the heavy price borne by human dignity when the world turned a blind eye to the tragedies of Bosnia and Rwanda. For this reason, Turkiye’s unwavering stance on Gaza is both a moral obligation and a strategic necessity. Together with all actors who believe in humanitarian diplomacy, foremost among them Qatar, we will continue our efforts towards a lasting, just, and honourable peace. We hold the view that achieving peace is not beyond reach, but rather an essential goal that has been awaited for far too long. We are committed to making every effort to achieve peace and will persist in our endeavours.</p><p data-start=\"6686\" data-end=\"6983\">History is bearing witness to those who took action and to those who turned away from the cruelty in Gaza. Gaza has no time to lose; the international community must heed the voice of the global conscience and act. The future of humanity will be shaped by the courage of the steps we take today.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"6686\" data-end=\"6983\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

I’m going home.”</p><p>That hedging represents a seeming cautiousness by Trump, who has spoken about being frustrated by Putin’s broken promises in the past.</p><p>Speaking from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi said Trump’s metric for success could be boiled down to what read he had on Putin.</p><p>“He very much made it clear that what success means in this context is him being convinced that Vladimir Putin is serious about peace, and then arranging a second meeting that would involve the Ukrainians,” he said.</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, <a href=\"/news/2025/8/14/starmer-hosts-zelenskyy-ahead-of-high-stakes-trump-putin-meeting\">Putin praised</a> Trump, saying he was “making quite energetic and sincere efforts to end the fighting”.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The words came shortly after Zelenskyy met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London, where they discussed security guarantees for Ukraine that could “make peace truly durable if the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killings and engage in genuine, substantive diplomacy”, Zelenskyy wrote on X.</p><p>The meeting, said Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, “was about a show of unity ahead of that summit in Alaska”.</p><p>Hull noted there was a “sense of some optimism” following <a href=\"/news/2025/8/14/ukraine-eu-us-leaders-speak-ahead-of-trump-putin-meeting-key-takeaways\">the Wednesday call</a> between Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders.</p><p>“[Trump] took a somewhat stronger line against Putin than was expected, saying the Russian president faced severe consequences if he didn’t meaningfully engage in ceasefire talks,” he noted.</p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

Sheinbaum, however, attempted to dispel concerns in a news conference: “There will be no invasion of Mexico,” she said.</span></p><p>Mexico, meanwhile, has also called on the US to take greater steps to restrict the massive flow of weapons from sellers and manufacturers north of the border. Mexican authorities and other experts have argued that those weapons fuel the violence committed by criminal groups.</p><p>But the US has rebuffed such efforts, and in June, the US Supreme Court struck <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/supreme-court-strikes-down-mexicos-lawsuit-against-us-gun-manufacturers\">down a lawsuit</a> from the Mexican government arguing that the flow of illicit firearms constituted negligence.</p></div></div></body></html>"
