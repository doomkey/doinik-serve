Explosions were reported before dawn on Saturday in the capital, Caracas, as well as at nearby Venezuelan military bases and some civilian areas.</p><p>Monday’s swearing-in ceremony was overseen by Rodriguez’s brother – the president of the National Assembly, Jorge Rodriguez – and Maduro’s son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, who held a copy of the Venezuelan Constitution.</p><p>Other members of Maduro’s inner circle, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino, were also in attendance.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The ceremony took place as Maduro, her predecessor and former boss, faced an arraignment proceeding in a New York City courthouse.</p><p>Federal prosecutors in the US have charged Maduro with four counts related to allegations he leveraged government powers to export thousands of tonnes of cocaine to North America.</p><p>The charges include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, the illegal possession of machine guns and other destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess such guns and devices.</p><p>Maduro and his wife have pleaded not guilty to the charges, and their allies, including Rodriguez, have denounced the pair’s abduction as a violation of international law, as well as Venezuelan sovereignty.</p><p>In court on Monday, Maduro maintained he remained the rightful leader of Venezuela, saying, “I am still president.”</p><p>The administration of US President Donald Trump, however, has signalled that it plans to work with Rodriguez for the time being, though Trump himself warned that her tenure as president could be cut short, should she fail to abide by US demands.</p><p>“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine in a Sunday morning interview.</p><p>A day earlier, in a televised address announcing the attack, Trump had said his administration plans “to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition”.</p><p>On Air Force One on Sunday, as he flew back to Washington, DC, Trump doubled down on that statement.</p><p>“Don’t ask me who’s in charge, because I’ll give you an answer that will be very controversial. We’re in charge,” he told reporters.</p><p>He added that Rodriguez is “cooperating” and that, while he personally has not spoken to her, “we’re dealing with the people who just got sworn in”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration’s seeming willingness to allow Rodriguez, a former labour lawyer, to remain in charge has raised eyebrows.</p><p>Rodriguez, who served as vice president since 2018, is known to be a stalwart “chavista”: an adherent of the left-wing political movement founded by Maduro’s mentor, the late Hugo Chavez. She has held various ministerial roles under Maduro, including leading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>But Trump’s allies in the Republican Party have argued that keeping Rodriguez in place is simply a practical reality.</p><p>“We don’t recognise Delcy Rodriguez as the legitimate ruler of Venezuela. We didn’t recognise Nicolas Maduro as a legitimate ruler,” Republican Senator Tom Cotton told CNN on Sunday.</p><p>“It is a fact that she and other indicted and sanctioned officials are in Venezuela. They have control over the military and security services. We have to deal with that fact. That does not make them a legitimate leader.”</p><p>While on Air Force One, Trump largely avoided committing to new elections in Venezuela, indicating he would instead focus on “fixing” the country and allowing US oil companies access to its vast petroleum reserves.</p><p>One reporter on the aeroplane asked, “How soon can an election take place?”</p><p>“Well, I think we’re looking more at getting it fixed, getting it ready first, because it’s a mess. The country is a mess,” Trump replied. “It’s been horribly run. The oil is just flowing at a very low level.”</p><p>He later added, “We’re going to run everything. We’re going to run it, fix it. We’ll have elections at the right time. But the main thing you have to fix: It’s a broken country. There’s no money.”</p><p>Recent presidential elections in Venezuela have been widely denounced as fraudulent, with Maduro claiming victory in each one.</p><p>The contested 2018 election, for example, led to the US briefly recognising opposition leader Juan Guaido as president, instead of Maduro.</p><p>Later, Maduro also claimed victory for a third term in office during the 2024 presidential race, despite election regularities.</p><p>The official vote tally was not released, and the opposition published documents that appeared to show that Maduro’s rival, Edmundo Gonzalez, had won. Protests erupted on Venezuela’s streets, and the nonprofit Human Rights Watch reported that more than 2,000 protesters were unlawfully detained, with at least 25 dead in apparent extrajudicial killings.</p><p>The opposition has largely boycotted legislative elections in Venezuela, denouncing them as rigged in favour of “chavistas”.</p><p>Monday’s swearing-in ceremony included the 283 members of the National Assembly elected last May. Few opposition candidates were among them.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Less than 24 hours later, US special forces attacked Caracas, abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from his home and took him to New York to face trial on “narcoterrorism” charges.</p><p>In showing that his administration can follow through on threats in Venezuela, Trump has escalated the psychological pressure on the Islamic Republic. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called his statement “reckless and dangerous”. Clearly, the Iranian government got the warning.</p><p>However, Iran is no Venezuela. What happened in Caracas on Saturday cannot really take place in Tehran.</p><h2 id=\"a-solid-military-infrastructure\">A solid military infrastructure</h2><p>The realities of operability, which allowed an invasion to occur in Venezuela, highlight why a similar intervention in Iran is simply out of the question for the US.</p><p>The CIA had operated in Caracas for half a year, preparing for the operation. The intelligence agency had an asset close to Maduro who helped track him down. In the early hours of Saturday, US fighter jets launched air strikes on military targets in and around Caracas. A US special forces team was dispatched afterwards to abduct Maduro from his residence.</p><p>What helped secure the success of the operation was that the Venezuelan military was in disarray and Maduro had been largely abandoned by his allies Russia and China.</p><p>Six months earlier, Iran made clear that it is not an easy regime change target. During the 12-day conflict with Israel in June, Tehran’s weaknesses were revealed but so was its resilience.</p><p>Despite Israel’s surprise attacks that eliminated some of the most important leaders of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iranian nuclear scientists as well as the Israeli psyop efforts threatening various officials and high-ranking military officers with death unless they defected, the Islamic Republic did not budge.</p><p>The US strikes on Iran’s underground nuclear sites using bunker buster bombs did not shake the regime either. In response, the Iranian military was able to fire hundreds of missiles in retaliation, piercing Israel’s Iron Dome and striking military targets.</p><p>This resilience stems from the regime’s self-imposed isolation from external shocks. The vast business empire of the IRGC in construction, telecommunications and exports, valued in the billions of dollars, provides its top commanders with a tangible personal interest in regime survival, irrespective of its ideological underpinnings.</p><p>Iran has the largest military in the region with one million active and reserve soldiers. The IRGC alone commands at least 150,000 soldiers, many of whom have been battle-hardened in the Middle East already. Then there is the Basij militia, which itself has hundreds of thousands of regular and reserve members.</p><p>An invasion of Iran would not be as easy as Venezuela; it would not even be comparable to Iraq, given the mountainous Iranian landscape and vast urban areas.</p><p>Furthermore, the Chinese and Russians are unlikely to abandon Iran, a much more important partner than Venezuela. They are likely to provide it with highly advanced intelligence and weaponry as well as political support and cover.</p><h2 id=\"social-upheaval\">Social upheaval</h2><p>In recent days, Iran has been experiencing mass protests fuelled by economic woes. But this may not turn out to be the opportunity that the US and Israel may think it is.</p><p>The upheaval is yet to come near the level of the rallies in 2022. Killings have been excessive – 20 protesters have been killed in the past few days – but we are yet to see any visible cracks in the regime. The IRGC, for example, has not had defections that could destabilise the corps and eventually lead to the fall of the regime.</p><p>Furthermore, history shows that external aggression tends to unite rather than fragment societies. This was made clear in the summer when Iranians did not fall for Israeli incitement against their government.</p><p>Despite their repressive tactics, the authorities in Tehran have also acknowledged protesters’ concerns. On Saturday, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, said that the “bazaaris’ protest…is a valid one” and that the government is “seeking to remedy the problem”.</p><p>Undoubtedly Iran’s crises are real: The severe economic downturn and inflation, the disputes over Iran’s nuclear plans, and the supreme leader’s poor health and the question of succession could create fissures in the regime.</p><p>But these are slow-burning crises and not the kind of vulnerabilities on which the Venezuela operation was based. The Iranian government has managed to endure four decades of sanctions, conflicts and internal upheavals because of its solid institutional frameworks, which can weather painful moments.</p><p>The Venezuela intervention, then, is more illustrative of the limit of US power rather than a model for what can be done in another country, such as Iran. Trump can isolate and remove individual leaders whose states are already empty shells, as in Venezuela. He and his generals cannot, however, control and transform a complex country like Iran. Any such project would undoubtedly lead to chaos and bloodshed in the region far more intense and lasting than in Iraq.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

One police officer was ordered to pay a fine for stealing an electric shaver. Khatami – now sidelined for years like all other presidents after his tenure – only lamented “riots” allegedly aimed at derailing his reforms, and expressed his strong support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p><p>The issue also received international attention, with a picture of a student holding up the bloodied shirt of his friend going viral.</p><p>Leaderless student protests were renewed near the 2003 anniversary of the initial demonstrations, but were clamped down on in confrontations and arrests for about a week.</p><p>In late June 2007, public anger erupted overnight in Tehran and cities across the country after <a href=\"/news/2024/6/2/irans-ex-president-ahmadinejad-disqualified-larijani-sign-up-for-election\">populist President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> imposed an abrupt petroleum rationing scheme to curb imports, which led to people forming long queues at fuel stations.</p><p>A number of fuel stations and some bank branches were set alight by angry protesters before calm was largely restored a day later.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4216663\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4216663\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4216663\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ap_695bdc45212f2-1767627845.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C554&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - In this July 12, 1999 file photo, an unidentified student at a rally in Tehran, Iran, holds up the bloody T-shirt of a friend who was injured sometime in the last few days during clashes between police and student demonstrators.

The 26-year-old philosophy student was filmed bleeding on the pavement in Tehran after being shot in the chest while protesting, with blood pouring out of her mouth and nose.</p><p>State television and authorities rejected eyewitness accounts that Agha-Soltan was shot by security forces, claimed the video was fabricated with “propaganda” at work to turn opinions, and tried to make her parents corroborate their version of events.</p><p>The protests eventually stopped in early 2010 after several thousand people were arrested, partial media blackouts imposed, and internet and mobile networks throttled. The movement’s figureheads were later put under house arrest, with Mousavi still confined to this day. The authorities have said they consider the Green Movement not as legitimate dissent, but as a “sedition”.</p><p>Iran’s internet crackdown significantly intensified amid the Green Movement, with many top international services such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube blocked in the aftermath along with thousands of websites.</p><p>In early 2011, several Iranian cities saw solidarity protests with Arab Spring demonstrators in Egypt, Tunisia and other countries.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For many years before becoming president, Donald Trump publicly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cheney-criticism-insurrection-capitol-election-cc4b74dcb34f1df516aa89169a8650d5\">criticised</a> the George W Bush administration over its decision to launch the war on Iraq. And yet, today, in his second term as president, he finds himself presiding over a military debacle that is quite reminiscent of Bush’s.</p><p>Trump ordered a military intervention to remove an antagonistic foreign leader, based on a flimsy argument of national security, with the goal of accessing that country’s oil. In both cases, we see a naive confidence that the United States can simply achieve its goals through regime change. US intervention into Venezuela reeks of the same <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hubris-Inside-Story-Scandal-Selling/dp/0307346811\">hubris</a> that surrounded the Iraq invasion two decades ago.</p><p>Yet there are also important differences to consider. The most important distinguishing feature of the operation in Venezuela is its lack of an overarching vision. On Saturday after Trump finished an hour-long news conference alongside his secretaries of defence and state, it was not clear what the plan was for Venezuela going forward, or if there was a plan at all. His statements threatening more attacks in the following days brought no clarity either.</p><p>Past instances of US-led regime change fit into the larger ideological visions of the incumbent US commander-in-chief. In 1823, President James Monroe declared the Western Hemisphere off-limits to European colonialism. As the United States spent the 20th century consolidating its sphere of influence across the Americas, the Monroe Doctrine would justify various interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Cold War added new justifications for the United States to overthrow leftist regimes and install friendly governments in the Americas.</p><p>As the Cold War ended, President George HW Bush sought to serve as a caretaker for a “new world order” in which the US had emerged as the world’s lone superpower. When Bush sent troops to Somalia in 1992 and his successor Bill Clinton reversed a military coup in Haiti in 1994, they did so under the paradigm of “humanitarian intervention”. When George W Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq, it was done under the umbrella of the post-9/11 “war on terror”. When President Barack Obama intervened against the forces of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, he was guided by the “<a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/19/remarks-president-libya\">responsibility to protect</a>” doctrine concerning civilians in danger.</p><p>But in the case of the US attack on Venezuela, there has been no ideological justification. Trump and his team have haphazardly thrown around references to humanitarianism, counterterrorism and more to justify the attack. The president even brought up the Monroe Doctrine. But just as it seemed that he was grounding his foreign policy in a larger ideology, albeit one borrowed from two centuries ago, he made a joke of the concept.</p><p>“The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal,” Trump explained on Saturday. “But we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a lot. They now call it the Donroe Doctrine.” Trump did not make up this pun; it was used by the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/cover/january-8-2025/\">New York Post</a> a year ago to describe Trump’s aggressive foreign policy as he threatened to annex Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal.</p><p>The president’s decision to embrace the tongue-in-cheek term illustrates a disturbing reality of his foreign policy: Any notion that he is promoting an ideological vision is a joke.</p><p>The truth is Trump is pursuing an increasingly aggressive and militaristic foreign policy in his second term, not because he wants to impose a grand vision, but because he has discovered he can get away with it.</p><p>Striking a variety of foreign “bad guys” who have little capacity to fight back – ISIL (ISIS) affiliates in Nigeria who are “persecuting” Christians and “narcoterrorists” in Latin America – appeals to members of Trump’s base.</p><p>After he mentioned the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua during Saturday’s news conference, he went on a minutes-long tangent to brag about his military interventions into US cities. While the president’s inability to stay on topic may be concerning for those questioning his health and mental fitness, this digression into domestic affairs had some relevance for his Venezuelan intervention, at least as far as he was concerned: His increasingly militarised war on drugs and crime abroad justifies an increasingly militarised war on drugs and crime at home.</p><p>Past presidents have used US power to pursue a wide variety of ideologies and principles. Trump appears to be paying lip service to past ideologies to justify the use of US power. Many times, the “good” intentions of previous  presidents paved the way to hellish outcomes for the peoples who found themselves on the receiving end of US intervention. But those intentions at least created a level of predictability and consistency for the foreign policies of various US administrations.</p><p>Trump, by contrast, seems driven solely by immediate political concerns and short-term prospects for glory and profit. If there is a saving grace of such an unprincipled foreign policy, it may be the ephemeral nature of interventions conducted without an overarching vision. An unprincipled approach to military intervention does not foster the kind of ideological commitment that has led other presidents to engage in long-term interventions like the Iraq occupation.</p><p>But it also means that Trump could conceivably use military intervention to settle any international dispute or to pursue any ostensibly profitable goal – say assuming control of Greenland from Denmark.</p><p>Last year, he decided <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/how-are-countries-and-markets-reacting-to-trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were a potent tool for asserting his interests and started applying them almost indiscriminately on allies and adversaries alike. Now that Trump has grown comfortable using the US military to achieve a range of goals – profit, gunboat diplomacy, distraction from domestic scandals, etc – the danger is that he will grow similarly haphazard in his use of force.</p><p>That does not bode well for the US nor for the rest of the world. At a time when multiple global crises are overlapping – climate, conflict and impoverishment – the last thing the world needs is a trigger-happy superpower without a clear strategy or a day-after plan.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 50 people, most of them Muslims, were killed in the worst violence in Delhi since the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.</p><p>In response, the police filed 758 criminal cases for investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. The Delhi Police, accused of bias against Muslims, blamed peaceful protest leaders, many of them young Muslim activists, of hatching a conspiracy to create religious tensions and to topple the elected government – a claim rubbished by legal and rights experts. At least 18 student leaders and activists were arrested in a case that came to be known as the “main conspiracy case”.</p><p>The students and activists were charged under an “anti-terror” law called the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which makes it virtually impossible to secure bail. This law allows authorities to declare individuals “terrorists” and detain them without trial for months, sometimes years.</p><p>India’s police have been accused of increasingly using “anti-terror” laws against marginalised people, including Muslims.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4216158\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4216158\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4216158\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2020-01-19T164355Z_2015526395_RC24JE9NIWKT_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-CITIZENSHIP-PROTESTS-1767610405.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C487&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"delhi riots\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4216158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Demonstrators attend a protest against a new citizenship law in Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, India, on January 19, 2020 [Danish Siddiqui/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-are-the-accused\">Who are the accused?</h2><p>Of the 18 students and activists arrested in the conspiracy case, six were released on bail over the years.</p><p>Today, the Supreme Court is deciding on the bail of seven of the defendants.
