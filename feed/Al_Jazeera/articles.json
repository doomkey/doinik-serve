opening salvo of a massive attack by the United States and Israel.</p><p>The mourners, who gathered on Sunday in Enghelab (Revolution) Square, dressed mostly in black and some crying, were waving

the Iranian government.</p><p>Iranian state television confirmed Khamenei’s death early on Sunday, hours after US President Donald Trump announced the killing of the 86-year-old cleric he described as “one of the most evil people in history”.</p><p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pledged “severe, decisive” punishment for Khamenei’s “murderers” in a statement.</p><p>The IRGC added that it would launch the “most ferocious” operation in history against Israel and US bases, which are located in Gulf countries that are already counting the cost of an unprecedented series of deadly Iranian strikes.</p><p>Trump threatened that any retaliation would lead to Iran being hit with a force that has “never been seen before”.</p><p>Meanwhile, more explosions were heard in Doha, Dubai and Manama on Sunday, and warning sirens sounded in central Israel, with the Israeli military saying it was responding to Iranian missile fire.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who had mediated the indirect talks, believed a deal to ensure peace was closer than ever.</p><p>“Pres Trump gave IRAN PLENTY OF NEGOTIABLE OPPORTUNITY,” Senator Chuck Grassley wrote on X.</p><p>Congressman Randy Fine, a Trump ally with a history of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/us-congressman-randy-fine-suggests-palestinians-should-be-destroyed-first\">anti-Muslim statements</a>, also expressed support for the strikes.</p><p>“We are with you, Mr. President,” Fine wrote on X.</p><p>“We will cut off the head of the snake of Muslim terror, Bring lasting peace to the Middle East, And save the Iranian People. Bombs away.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"minimal-dissent\">Minimal dissent</h2><p>Many Republican members of Congress also rushed to hail the killing of Iran’s Supreme Leader <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/irans-supreme-leader-ali-khamenei-killed-in-us-israeli-attacks-reports\">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a>.</p><p>“President Trump just changed ‘Death to America’ to ‘Death by America,'” Senator Bernie Moreno wrote on X.</p><p>Lindsey Graham, a hawkish senator and staunch advocate for government change in Iran, said “unleashing” Washington’s military powers against Iran sent a message to Russia and China.</p><p>“All I can say about President Trump, I’ve never met a man like him. I’ve never met anybody so determined to be a peacemaker, but you don’t want to get on his bad side,” Graham told Fox News.</p><p>Even conservative commentators who had warned against the war, such as podcaster Tucker Carlson, were largely muted on Saturday.</p><p>Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former Trump ally who fell out with the US president and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">quit Congress</a> earlier this year, shared several posts arguing that war with Iran does not advance US interests.</p><p>Greene noted that Trump had presented himself as a pro-peace candidate when running for president.</p><p>“Does war with Iran help the mental health crisis in America or help the drug addiction pandemic in America? Nope. Does war with Iran do anything to help American families stay together and survive? No, not at all,” she wrote.</p><p>“But within hours of war with Iran it was reported approximately 40 innocent girls, school children, in Iran were killed by bombs from Israel. And they don’t care; they killed thousands of innocent children in Gaza, and apparently our Pro-Peace administration doesn’t care either,” Greene added.</p><p></p><p>Congressman Tom Massie, whom Trump is trying to oust by backing a primary challenge against him, declared himself a rare Republican critic of the war.</p><p>“I am opposed to this War,” he wrote on X. “This is not ‘America First.'”</p><p>Massie promised to push forward with a bill to rein in Trump’s power to attack Iran when Congress reconvenes in the coming days.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"democrats-response\">Democrats’ response</h2><p>Many Democrats focused on the legal aspect of the attacks on Iran, arguing that Trump should have sought congressional approval. The US Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the authority to declare war.</p><p>Still, many welcomed the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/ayatollah-ali-khamenei-the-leader-who-shaped-irans-defiance\">death of Khamenei</a> while criticising Trump’s strategy.</p><p>“I’m not going to shed any tears as it relates to his death. He’s brutalised his own people and built an Iran that is the largest state sponsor of terror in the world,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told National Public Radio.</p><p>“But what comes next is unclear because the Trump administration has not been able to articulate a plan, one to ensure that US forces are not entangled in a forever war in the Middle East, which we know would be a disaster,” Jeffries said.</p><p>Democratic Senator Tim Kaine cast doubt over the assertions that Iran posed an imminent threat to the US, which will likely be cited as Trump’s legal argument for the attack.</p><p>“I’m on two committees that give me access to a lot of classified information; there was no imminent threat from Iran to the United States that warrants sending our sons and daughters into yet another war in the Middle East,” Kaine told CNN.</p><p>“I’m going to do everything I can to stop it.”</p><p>But some pro-Israel Democrats broke ranks with their party and praised the war without qualifications.</p><p>“President Trump has been willing to do what’s right and necessary to produce real peace in the region,” Senator <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/how-have-us-politicians-reacted-to-the-attack-on-iran\">John Fetterman</a> wrote on X.</p><p>“God bless the United States, our great military, and Israel,” he wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel has pushed the US to attack Iran for two decades, and they finally got it.”</p><p>Mortazavi highlighted Trump’s criticism of his predecessors, who had waged regime-change wars in the region.</p><p>“It is ironic, because this is a president who called himself the ‘<a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/5/trump-takes-the-spotlight-peace-prize-at-fifa-world-cup-draw\">president of peace</a>‘,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"history-of-warnings-of-the-iranian-threat\">History of warnings of the Iranian ‘threat’</h2><p>Netanyahu, who promoted the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, has been warning for more than two decades that Iran is on the cusp of acquiring nuclear weapons.</p><p>Iran denies seeking a nuclear bomb, and even Trump <a href=\"/video/compare-contrast/2025/6/22/tulsi-gabbard-on-irans-nuclear-capabilities\">administration officials</a> have acknowledged that Washington has no evidence that Tehran is weaponising its uranium enrichment programme.</p><p>After the US bombed Iran’s main enrichment facilities in the 12-day war in June last year – an attack that Trump says “obliterated” the country’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">nuclear programme</a> – Netanyahu pivoted to a new supposed Iranian threat: Tehran’s ballistic missiles.</p><p>“Iran can blackmail any American city,” Netanyahu told pro-Israel podcaster Ben Shapiro in October.</p><p>“People don’t believe it. Iran is developing intercontinental missiles with a range of 8,000km [5,000 miles], add another 3,000 [1,800 miles], and they can get to the East Coast of the US.”</p><p><span>Trump repeated that claim, which Tehran has vehemently denied and has not been backed by any public evidence or testing, in his <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/trumps-state-of-the-union-touts-economic-turnaround-as-approval-slumps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of the Union</a> address earlier this week.</span></p><p>“They’ve already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America,” he said of the Iranians.</p><p>Trump has been building the case for a wider war with Iran since the June conflict, repeatedly threatening to bomb the country again.</p><p>But the US president’s own <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">National Security Strategy</a> last year called for de-prioritising the Middle East in Washington’s foreign policy and focusing on the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US public, wary of global conflict after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has also been largely opposed to new strikes against Iran, public opinion polls show.</p><p>Only 21 percent of respondents in a recent University of Maryland <a href=\"https://sadat.umd.edu/sites/sadat.umd.edu/files/Questionnaire%20Prospects%20of%20War%20with%20Iran.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> said they favoured a war with Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The first day of the war saw Iran fire missiles against bases and cities that host US troops and assets across <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/multiple-gulf-arab-states-that-host-us-assets-targeted-in-iran-retaliation\">the Middle East</a> in retaliation for the joint US-Israeli strikes, plunging the region into chaos.</p><p>Trump acknowledged that US troops may suffer casualties in the conflict. “That often happens in war,” he said on Saturday. “But we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission.”</p><h2 id=\"ignoring-the-vast-majority-of-americans\">‘Ignoring the vast majority of Americans’</h2><p>The Trump administration had appeared to step back from the brink of conflict earlier this month by engaging in diplomacy with Tehran.</p><p>US and Iranian negotiators held three rounds of talks over the past week, with Tehran stressing that it is willing to agree to rigorous inspections of its nuclear programme.</p><p>Omani mediators and Iranian officials had described the last round of negotiations, which took place on Thursday, as positive, saying that it yielded significant progress.</p><p>The <a href=\"/editorial/2026/2/28/nine-months-after-12-day-war-us-israel-seek-to-topple-irans-leaders\">June 2025 war</a>, initiated by Israel without provocation, also came in the middle of US-Iran talks.</p><p>“Netanyahu’s agenda has always been to prevent a diplomatic solution, and he feared Trump was actually serious about getting a deal, so the start of this war in the middle of negotiations is a success for him, just like it was last June,” Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Trump’s embrace of regime change rhetoric is a further victory for Netanyahu, and loss for the American people, as it suggests the US may be committed to a long and unpredictable military boondoggle.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While announcing the strikes on Saturday, Trump said his aim is to prevent Iran from “threatening America and our core national security interests”.</p><p>But US critics, including some proponents of Trump’s “America first” movement, have argued that Iran – more than 10,000km (6,000 miles) away – does not pose a threat to the US.</p><p>Earlier this month, US Ambassador to Israel <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/absurd-and-provocative-huckabee-faces-firestorm-for-israel-border-stance\">Mike Huckabee</a> told conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that “if it were not for Iran, there wouldn’t be Hezbollah; we wouldn’t have the problem on the border with Lebanon”.</p><p>Carlson said, “What problem on the border with Lebanon? I’m an American. I’m not having any problems on the border with Lebanon right now. I live in Maine.”</p><p>On Saturday, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib stressed that the US public does not want war with Iran.</p><p>“Trump is acting on the violent fantasies of the American political elite and the Israeli apartheid government, ignoring the vast majority of Americans who say loud and clear: No More Wars,” Tlaib said in a statement.</p></div></div></body></html>"

war powers resolution, called <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/what-countries-has-trump-attacked-since-returning-to-office\">President Donald Trump’s order to attack Iran</a> a “colossal

Saturday. “Every single Senator needs to go on the record about this dangerous, unnecessary, and idiotic action.”</p><p>House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries echoed Kaine, saying that House Democrats are committed to forcing a floor vote on a measure to restrict Trump’s war powers regarding Iran.</p><p>“Donald Trump failed to seek Congressional authorisation prior to striking Iran. Instead, the President’s decision to abandon diplomacy and launch a massive military attack has left American troops vulnerable to Iran’s retaliatory actions,” he said in a statement. “The Trump administration must explain itself to the American people and Congress immediately.”</p><p>The push for a legislative check on Trump’s executive power has gained significant bipartisan momentum in the Senate, of which the Republican Party maintains a slim majority.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded on Saturday that Congress be briefed immediately about the Iran attacks, including an all-senators classified session and public testimony, criticising the administration for not providing details on the threat’s scope and immediacy.</p><p>“The administration has not provided Congress and the American people with critical details about the scope and immediacy of the threat,” he said in a statement.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, described the strikes in a statement posted on X as “a deeply consequential decision that risks pulling the United States into another broad conflict in the Middle East”.</p><p>He questioned the urgency and intelligence behind the attack, warning of repeating “mistakes of the past”, like the Iraq war.</p><p>“The American people have seen this playbook before – claims of urgency, misrepresented intelligence, and military action that pulls the United States into regime change and prolonged, costly nation-building,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"not-just-democrats\">Not just Democrats</h2><p>While the push to curb executive military authority is largely driven by the Democratic caucus, a growing contingent of Republican lawmakers has signalled a rare break from the White House to join the effort.</p><p>Republican representative Thomas Massie, one of the most outspoken critics, described the strikes as “acts of war unauthorised by Congress”.</p><p>“I am opposed to this War. This is not America First,” he wrote on X.</p><p>In the Senate, Republican Senator Rand Paul, who also co-sponsored the war powers resolution, said his opposition to the war is based on constitutional principles.</p><p>“My oath of office is to the Constitution, so with studied care, I must oppose another Presidential war,” he said on X.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Among Democrats and Independents, approval was just 10 percent and 21 percent, respectively, while 68 percent of Republicans expressed support.</p><p>Here’s how some of the US’s most prominent elected representatives and political figures have reacted.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>President Donald Trump:</strong> “A short time ago, the United States military started major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.”</p><p><strong>Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson:</strong> “Today, Iran is facing the severe consequences of its evil actions. President Trump and the Administration have made every effort to pursue peaceful and diplomatic solutions in response to the Iranian regime’s sustained nuclear ambitions and development, terrorism, and the murder of Americans—and even their own people.”</p><p><strong>Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune:</strong> “For years, Iran’s relentless nuclear ambitions, its expanded ballistic missile inventory, and its unwavering support for terror groups in the region have posed a clear and unacceptable threat to U.S. servicemembers, citizens in the region, and many of our allies. Despite the dogged efforts of the president and his administration, the Iranian regime has refused the diplomatic off-ramps that would peacefully resolve these national security concerns. I commend President Trump for taking action to thwart these threats.”</p><p><strong>Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries:</strong> “Donald Trump failed to seek Congressional authorization prior to striking Iran. Instead, the president’s decision to abandon diplomacy and launch a massive military attack has left American troops vulnerable to Iran’s retaliatory actions. We pray for the safety of the men and women of the US military as they have been put into harm’s way in a dangerous theatre of war.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer:</strong> “The administration has not provided Congress and the American people with critical details about the scope and immediacy of the threat. Confronting Iran’s malign regional activities, nuclear ambitions, and harsh oppression of the Iranian people demands American strength, resolve, regional coordination, and strategic clarity. Unfortunately, President Trump’s fitful cycles of lashing out and risking wider conflict are not a viable strategy.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib:</strong> “The American people do not want a war with Iran. Trump is acting on the violent fantasies of the American political elite and the Israeli apartheid government, ignoring the vast majority of Americans who say loud and clear: No More Wars.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:</strong> “The American people are once again dragged into a war they did not want by a president who does not care about the long-term consequences of his actions. This war is unlawful. It is unnecessary. And it will be catastrophic. Just this week, Iran and the United States were negotiating key measures that could have staved off war. The president walked away from these discussions and chose war instead.”</p><p><strong>New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani:</strong> “Today’s military strikes on Iran — carried out by the United States and Israel — mark a catastrophic escalation in an illegal war of aggression. Bombing cities. Killing civilians. Opening a new theatre of war.  Americans do not want this. They do not want another war in pursuit of regime change. They want relief from the affordability crisis. They want peace.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders:</strong> “This Trump–Netanyahu war is unconstitutional and violates international law. It endangers the lives of U.S. troops and people across the region. We’ve lived through the lies of Vietnam and Iraq. No more endless wars. Congress must pass a War Powers Resolution immediately.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen:</strong> “Trump is lying to the American people as he launches an illegal, regime-change war against Iran. This is endangering American lives and has already resulted in mass civilian casualties. This is not making us safer &amp; only damages the US and our interests. The Senate must immediately vote on the War Powers Resolution to stop it.”</p><p><strong>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham:</strong> “I fervently pray that the long-suffering people of Iran will have their oppression ended soon. I also fervently pray that we’re on the verge of a new dawn in the Middle East, with historic opportunity for lasting peace and prosperity. As to our allies in Israel, President Trump and all under his command, your bravery has set in motion the end of evil and darkness, and the beginning of the light. Well done.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Representative Ro Khanna:</strong> “Trump has launched an illegal regime change war in Iran with American lives at risk. Congress must convene on Monday to vote on Representative Thomas Massie and my WPR [War Powers Resolution] to stop this. Every member of Congress should go on record this weekend on how they will vote.”</p><p><strong>Republican Representative Thomas Massie:</strong> “I am opposed to this War. This is not “America First.” When Congress reconvenes, I will work with Representative Ro Khanna to force a Congressional vote on war with Iran. The Constitution requires a vote, and your Representative needs to be on record as opposing or supporting this war.”</p><p><strong>Republican Senator Tom Cotton:</strong> “Iran’s missile program poses an imminent threat to the United States and our allies. I’m thankful President Trump is taking necessary action to protect our homeland.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Senator Adam Schiff:</strong> “Trump is drawing our country into yet another foreign war that Americans don’t want and Congress has not authorised. The Iranian regime is a brutal and murderous dictatorship. But that does not give Trump the authority to unilaterally initiate a war of choice.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Democratic Senator John Fetterman:</strong> “Operation Epic Fury. President Trump has been willing to do what’s right and necessary to produce real peace in the region. God bless the United States, our great military, and Israel.”</p><p><strong>Former Democratic Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris:</strong> “Donald Trump is dragging the United States into a war the American people do not want. Let me be clear: I am opposed to a regime-change war in Iran, and our troops are being put in harm’s way for the sake of Trump’s war of choice.”</p><p><strong>Former Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene:</strong> “We said “No More Foreign Wars, No More Regime Change!” We said it on rally stage after rally stage, speech after speech. Trump, Vance, basically the entire admin campaigned on it and promised to put America FIRST and Make America Great Again. My generation has been let down, abused, and used by our government our entire adult lives and our children’s generation is literally being abandoned.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

US and Iran over the Iranian nuclear programme, the latest round of which concluded on Friday.</p><p>“If the main issue of the negotiations is not making nuclear weapons by Iran, this is in compliance with a religious decree issued by Iran’s leader and the country’s defence doctrine, and an immediate agreement is within reach,” Shamkhani said on Thursday.</p><p>Shamkhani had also been targeted in an Israeli strike in June 2025, during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel. There were reports that he had been killed in the attack, but he was later confirmed to have survived. He was pulled from the rubble of his home, and had sustained severe injuries.</p><p>He was recently appointed the secretary of Iran’s Defence Council, which was created after the war and coordinates Iran’s defence and national security policies, while mobilising resources to address threats.</p><p>In January, he warned that Iran’s response to any US military action would be “immediate, all out, and unprecedented, targeting the heart of Tel Aviv and all those supporting the aggressor”.</p><p>He led the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) for a decade until 2023, making him the second-longest-serving security chief since 1979 after former President Hassan Rouhani, who was SNSC secretary for nearly 16 years.</p><p>Born in Ahvaz in Iran’s Khuzestan, Shamkhani and his family moved to Los Angeles in the United States when he finished school. He later returned to Iran, where he studied engineering.</p><p>During the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, Shamkhani was a commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and went on to be a commander of both of Iran’s navies, the IRGC Navy and the Iranian Navy.</p><p>He was the minister of defence between 1997 and 2005, and was the first Iranian defence official to visit Saudi Arabia since the revolution. He also came third in the 2001 presidential elections before returning to his role as defence minister.</p></div></div></body></html>"

considered a violation of international law, mark the most aggressive escalation yet of Trump’s embrace of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-many-countries-has-trump-bombed-in-2025\">military power</a> to pummel foreign governments and extract concessions demanded by his administration.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Despite widespread scepticism among the US public about Trump’s military campaigns abroad, his administration has carried out brash attacks on the governments of Iran and Venezuela, while also stepping up US strikes in the name of counterterrorism in Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Here’s a quick look at Trump’s military actions abroad since returning to office in January 2025.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran\">Iran</h2><p>The joint US-Israeli <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/us-israel-bomb-iran-a-timeline-of-talks-and-threats-leading-up-to-attacks\">attacks on Iran</a> that began on Saturday morning Tehran time have so far killed at least 201 people, according to the Iranian Red Crescent, and fuelled fears about a widening war that could bring chaos and destruction to countries across the region.</p><p>The US strikes, which Trump said were “major combat operations” aimed at regime change in Tehran, appear far more extensive than a previous US attack on Iran in June 2025.</p><p>Those strikes, which, like the current attacks, took place as Iran was engaged in diplomatic talks with the US, targeted Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.</p><p>Trump said that the attacks, which took place during a 12-day war launched by Israel against Iran that killed more than 600 Iranians, had “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">obliterated” the country’s nuclear </a>capabilities.</p><p>Both US attacks on Iran are considered illegal under international law.</p><h2 id=\"venezuela\">Venezuela</h2><p>The Trump administration carried out an attack on Venezuela in January 2026, bombing the capital, Caracas, and abducting President Nicolas Maduro, a longtime figure of US ire.</p><p>The Venezuelan minister of defence said that 83 people were killed in the attack, including members of the Venezuelan and Cuban security services, as well as Venezuelan civilians.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"boat-strikes-in-latin-america\">Boat strikes in Latin America</h2><p>Since September, the US has carried out at least 45 strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in Latin America and the Caribbean, killing at least 151 people, according to a tally from the watchdog group Airwars.</p><p>Trump and his allies have framed the strikes as an effort to combat regional narcotics trafficking and have declared several criminal groups as foreign terrorist organisations, stating that drug trafficking is the equivalent of an armed attack on the US.</p><p>UN officials and international law experts have roundly rejected those arguments, stating that the strikes are a campaign of illegal <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/experts-say-us-boat-strikes-are-illegal-killings-can-they-be-stopped\">extrajudicial killings</a> that erase the distinction between criminal activity and armed conflict.</p><h2 id=\"nigeria\">Nigeria</h2><p>The Trump administration has also stepped up military operations in Africa, expanding collaboration with local governments and carrying out air strikes under the guise of counterterrorism.</p><p>In Nigeria, Trump has carried out a series of attacks and deployed <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/us-deploys-100-soldiers-to-nigeria-for-training-mission-nigerian-military\">100 US military personnel</a> to train Nigerian forces, threatening US strikes if the government does not do more to address what Trump says is a “genocide” of Christians in Nigeria by Muslim groups.</p><p>Nigerian officials say that the largely debunked claim miscasts widespread and violent civil conflict that has racked the country for years as a case of anti-Christian persecution.</p><p>Trump announced that the US had carried out “powerful and deadly” attacks targeting what he said were members of ISIL (ISIS) affiliates in northwestern Nigeria in December 2025, with the government’s cooperation.</p><p>Questions <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/us-bombs-target-isil-in-nigeria-whats-really-going-on\">have emerged</a> about whether the targets struck were in fact associated with ISIL, which is not known to operate in the region targeted in the strikes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"somalia\">Somalia</h2><p>The Trump administration has expanded US military engagement in Somalia, where it has long worked with the government to counter armed groups such as al-Shabab and a regional offshoot of ISIL.</p><p>The US has massively <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/us-dramatically-escalates-air-strikes-on-somalia-under-trump-this-year\">stepped up</a> air strikes in Somalia during Trump’s second term, with the New America Foundation finding that the US carried out at least 111 attacks in 2025. Monitors say the figure surpasses the total of attacks under the George W Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden administrations combined.</p><h2 id=\"yemen\">Yemen</h2><p>The US launched dozens of naval and air strikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebel group between March and May of 2025, destroying infrastructure and killing dozens of civilians.</p><p>The Houthis had carried out attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea as a form of pressure on Israel to end its genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Human Rights Watch said in June that a US strike on the country’s Ras Isa port in Hodeidah in April 2025 killed more than 80 civilians and should be investigated as a war crime.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2025/5/6/trump-says-bombing-of-yemen-to-stop-as-oman-confirms-us-houthi-ceasefire\">ceasefire brokered by Oman</a> was announced in May.</p><h2 id=\"syria\">Syria</h2><p>The US conducted strikes on ISIL targets in Syria in December 2025, following <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/joint-syrian-us-patrol-comes-under-attack-near-palmyra-state-media\">an attack</a> that killed two US soldiers and a translator in the city of Palymra.</p><p>Trump said the US was “inflicting very serious retaliation” on those responsible for the attack, which the Syrian government said was carried out by an employee of the state security services who was set to be expelled due to his hardline views.</p><h2 id=\"iraq\">Iraq</h2><p>The US killed a high-profile ISIL commander in a strike in the al-Anbar province of Iraq in March 2025.</p><p>The group’s second-in-command, Abdallah “Abu Khadijah” Malli Muslih al-Rifai, and another unnamed operative were reported to have been killed in the strikes.</p><p>“His miserable life was terminated, along with another member of ISIS, in coordination with the Iraqi Government and the Kurdish Regional Government,” Trump said in a social media post at the time. “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The grinding conflict, coupled with a sense of isolation among many Iranians as Western countries backed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, deepened Khamenei’s distrust of the West, generally, and the US, in particular, analysts say.</p><p>That sentiment would underpin his decades-long rule and cement the idea that Iran must remain in a constant state of defence against external and internal threats.</p><p>“People think [of Iran] as a theocracy, because he [Khamenei] wears the turban and the language of the state is the language of religion, but in reality, he was a wartime president that came out of war with the assumption that Iran is vulnerable and in need of security,” said Vali Nasr, Iranian affairs expert and author of Iran’s Grand Strategy: A Political History. “That the US is hostile to Iran; and that the revolution, the Islamic republic and nationalism, are not separated” and that so, they need to be protected.</p><p>Under this vision, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) evolved from a paramilitary force into a powerful security, political and economic institution that became central to broader Iran’s influence across the region. Khamenei also promoted a “resistance economy” to foster self-reliance in the face of punishing Western sanctions, maintained a strong scepticism of engagement with the West, and responded forcefully to critics who argued his focus on defence was blocking much-needed reforms.</p><p>But his rule was seriously tested over the years, including in 2009, when protesters who took to the streets over what they claimed was a rigged presidential election were met with a brutal crackdown, and in 2022 over women’s rights.</p><p>Possibly the biggest challenge to his rule came in January when protests triggered by economic hardship morphed into nationwide upheaval, with many protesters directly calling for the overthrow of the Islamic republic. The authorities’ response led to one of the most violent confrontations since the country’s 1979 revolution.</p><p>Critics saw him as being too out-of-touch with a young population seeking reforms and economic improvement over isolationism and forever shadow wars with the US and Israel.</p><p>“Iranians paid too high a cost for this degree of insistence on national independence – in the process, he lost the Iranian population because they no longer believed in the wisdom of this independence,” Nasr said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3859600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3859600\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3859600\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/afp_6885ea2da6df-1753606701.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - A demonstrator carries a portrait of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a rally in solidarity with Palestinians and in condemnation of Israel and the US, after Friday prayers in Tehran, on July 25, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3859600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A demonstrator carries a portrait of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a rally in solidarity with Palestinians and in condemnation of Israel and the United States, after Friday prayers in Tehran [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-early-years\">The early years</h2><p>Born in 1939 in the holy Shia city of Mashhad in northeast Iran, Khamenei was the son of a renowned Muslim leader and ethnic Azerbaijani from neighbouring Iraq. The family first settled in Tabriz in northwestern Iran before moving to Mashhad, a place favoured by religious pilgrims, where Khamenei’s father led an Azerbaijani mosque.</p><p>Khamenei described his mother, Khadijeh Mirdamadi, as an avid Quran and book reader who instilled in her son a love of literature and poetry, and later supported her son as he joined the movement against the Pahlavi dynasty’s rule.</p><p>Khamenei started his studies at age four, learning the Quran, and completed his primary education at the first Islamic school in Mashhad. He did not finish high school, instead attending theology schools and learning from renowned Islamic scholars of the time, like his father, and Sheikh Hashem Ghazvini. In the following years, he continued his studies at more prestigious Shia centres for higher education in Najaf and Qom.</p><p>In Qom, he learned from and became close to a number of other famous Muslim scholars, including Ayatollah Khomeini, who was popular among young seminarians for his defiance of the shah.</p><p>Khamenei taught jurisprudence courses and public theology interpretation classes, which also allowed him to gain access to a growing audience, especially young students who were beginning to become disillusioned with the monarchy.</p><p>The monarchy at the time had been reinstated to absolute power following an MI6 and CIA-orchestrated coup in 1953, which ousted democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh after he attempted to nationalise the Iranian oil industry.</p><p>As a political activist, Khamenei was repeatedly arrested by the shah’s secret police (SAVAK) and sentenced to exile in the remote city of Iranshahr in southeastern Iran, but returned to take part in the 1978 protests that led to the end of the Pahlavi rule.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4346258\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4346258\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4346258\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-20T084006Z_645212904_RC2CFN30PWGM_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-CRISIS-KHAMENEI-1772283540.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei (3rd from R) attends a memorial service for the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini alongside senior officials including Ayatollah Azari Ghomi and members of the Khomeini family in Tehran, Iran, June 7, 1989.

He served briefly as minister of defence in 1980 and later as the supervisor of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. A fiery orator, he also secured the influential post of Tehran’s Friday prayer leader.</p><p>1981 proved a momentous year for Khamenei. He lost the use of his right arm after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt by the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an opposition group that had started an <a href=\"/news/2018/3/29/meks-violent-past-looms-over-us-lobby-for-regime-change-in-iran\">armed uprising</a> against the newly established Iranian theocracy after falling out with Khomeini. In the same year, Khamenei won the presidency, becoming Iran’s first clerical president.</p><p>In 1989, the death of Khomeini was a turning point for the Islamic republic. Before his death, Khomeini had sidelined his long-time designated heir, Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, due to the latter’s criticism of the mass execution of prisoners in 1988.</p><p>A council that had been set up to revise the constitution appointed Khamenei instead. To make that happen, the council had to loosen the qualifications required to hold the country’s top job. Khamenei did not have the title of the hojatoleslam – a high-ranking Shia clerical title.</p><p>“I believe I do not deserve this position; perhaps you and I know this. This would be symbolic leadership, not real leadership,” Khamenei said at the time.</p><p>But his leadership has been anything but symbolic.</p><p>Khamenei’s early tenure as ayatollah was defined by efforts to rebuild a country shattered by eight years of war with Iraq. More than a million people were killed in the conflict, and the economy was left in ruins. The conflict had also fostered resentment towards the international community over its perceived inaction following Iraq’s use of <a href=\"/news/2021/4/29/visualising-chemical-weapon-attacks-in-the-middle-east\">chemical weapons</a> against Iranian forces and civilians. While still president, Khamenei would frequently visit the front lines, earning the loyalty of the IRGC and gaining a firsthand understanding of the realities of war.</p><p>“He is the leader whose formation was in the war with Iraq – that framed his outlook on domestic and foreign politics. Once he became the supreme leader, he focused on building the military and paramilitary apparatus for a siege, for constant resistance,” said Narges Bajoghli, an associate professor of anthropology and Middle East studies at John Hopkins University.</p><p>But the mood began to change in the 1990s. The country was in desperate need of investment, while the revolutionary fervour had begun to cool somewhat. Some, exhausted by the war, were eager to see Iran return to the international fold.</p><p>That sentiment translated into a landslide election victory for reformist Mohammad Khatami in 1997, an advocate for rapprochement with the West and promoter of a “dialogue among civilisations”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4346288\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4346288\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4346288\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2009-06-09T120000Z_893242440_GM1E56A02JT01_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-ELECTION-1772283787.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Supporters of Iran's presidential election candidate Mirhossein Mousavi carry posters with images of Mousavi (L) and former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami during a campaign rally in Tehran June 9, 2009.

He saw the vote for reform, including from within the ranks of the military and paramilitary apparatus, as a threat to the status quo. So he set off to create a stable voting bloc of loyal supporters against reformers, according to Bajoghli.</p><p>“Khamanei never had a natural base for himself compared to Khomeini,” said Bajoghli, also the author of Iran Framed. “So he put a lot of funding in redoing the education and training for the young generations [within the paramilitary system] that would then find their way up.”</p><p>That meant giving the IRGC a free hand to build a network of businesses that would allow them to dominate Iran’s economy while also intensifying training programmes, especially for younger members of its paramilitary volunteer force, the Basij. While it was a limited section of society, it was one that would grow in line with Khamenei’s posture of perpetual resistance against the West and one that was given great resources. More importantly, Bajoghli said, they were willing to fight and die.</p><p>These new ranks within the paramilitary force were the ones called upon to suppress the nationwide protests that erupted after the disputed presidential election victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a staunch opponent of the West, in 2009. By then, a new generation of Iranians – born after 1979 – were less attuned to the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial narrative that had inspired their parents’ revolution.</p><p>In what was then considered the strongest challenge to Khamenei’s leadership, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets under what the media dubbed the Green Movement to contest the election results and express support for the defeated reformist candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi. While protesters said the elections were rigged for Ahmadinejad to win, Khamenei endorsed the results. Thousands were arrested and dozens were killed, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/123/2009/en/\">according to Amnesty International</a>.</p><p>The Iranian leadership accused Western countries of stoking the unrest to topple the religious establishment. “You [the West] should be held accountable for your actions,” Ahmadinejad<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSHOS62783420090816/?sp=true\"> said</a>.</p><p>“The Iranian nation would … slap those with ill intentions so hard that they would lose their way home.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4346298\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4346298\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4346298\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2010-07-16T000000Z_634394359_GM1E67G1H0R01_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-1772283974.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1155&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An Iranian with his glasses decorated with photos of President Mohammad Khatami carries national flag during celebration in central Tehran June 9, 2001, a day after country's presidential elections.

And he believed the battle against the West had to be fought with different strategies: resisting but also negotiating, if that was necessary, observers said.</p><p>In 2015, the country was struggling under crippling international sanctions due to its nuclear programme. To maintain domestic stability and boost legitimacy, Khamenei recognised the need to ease economic pressure.</p><p>So he greenlit then-President Hassan Rouhani’s negotiations with the West that led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The landmark deal, signed by Iran and world powers, was designed to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>“It was a moment of pragmatism – sometimes protecting the state requires compromises,” Nasr said. “Khamenei favoured a policy of neither peace nor war with the US. He believed that Iran needed to pursue its independence against the US, which he believed is inherently against Iran.” Within this perspective, “the nuclear deal was not normalisation [with the US] but a narrow arms control deal like the one the US did with the Soviets,” Nasr said.</p><p>But three years after that accord was signed, President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement, bringing the rapprochement to an end. As Washington imposed a new set of sanctions on Iran, Khamenei returned to a more aggressive posture, ruling out negotiations with the US and backing a gradual breach of the deal. Over the following years, Iran resumed the enrichment of uranium to 60 percent, the level at which it becomes quicker to convert to 90 percent weapons-grade uranium. Iran has insisted — and continues to insist — that its nuclear programme is purely civilian in nature. In 2003, Khamenei had issued a <a href=\"https://farsi.khamenei.ir/newspart-index?tid=1322&amp;p=4#44141\">fatwa</a> prohibiting the manufacture, use and storage of nuclear weapons.</p><p>With Western sanctions biting and inflation rising, <a href=\"/news/2019/11/20/irans-protests-all-you-need-to-know-in-600-words\">protests erupted across Iran in 2019</a> following the government’s decision to hike petrol prices. Security forces were accused of violently cracking down on demonstrations where, according to Amnesty International, more than 100 people were killed. Khamenei dismissed the protesters as “thugs” and accused counterrevolutionaries and foreign enemies of fuelling the unrest.</p><p>Amid internal turmoil and growing isolation, the presidential elections saw the victory of Ebrahim Raisi – a senior prosecutor who had drawn <a href=\"/news/2021/6/21/irans-president-elect-raisi-addresses-links-with-mass-executions\">criticism for his links</a> with the mass executions of the late 80s – amid the lowest turnout in the Islamic republic’s history.</p><p>With a close ally such as Raisi at the presidency, Khamenei promoted the so-called “resistance economy” relying on Iran’s internal capabilities while also pivoting its business towards the East – an approach that failed to yield tangible results.</p><p>The 2022 nationwide <a href=\"/news/2022/9/28/what-we-know-after-11-days-of-protests-in-iran\">protests over Mahsa Amini’s death</a> in police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory hijab law marked another major challenge for Khamenei. The ayatollah drew criticism as the person responsible for social restrictions imposed on the population and the security forces’ <a href=\"/news/2022/9/20/iran-confirms-first-deaths-in-protests-over-mahsa-aminis-death\">brutal crackdown</a> on the ensuing demonstrations. More than 500 people were killed, according to Amnesty International.</p><p>Again, Khamenei saw the whole affair as a national security matter. He blamed Western and regional adversaries for fomenting the unrest, arguing that the protests were not about the death of Amini or the wearing of the hijab but rather the result of foreign intervention. “It is about Islamic Iran’s independence, resistance, strength and power,” he said. “That is what this is about.”</p><h2 id=\"axis-of-resistance\">‘Axis of resistance’</h2><p>Independence and power, in Khamenei’s view, were also required beyond the country’s borders to maintain a “forward defence” that would deter potential aggression or overreach by adversaries, including the US and Israel.</p><p>That translated into weaving a web of proxy relations and transfering weapons knowledge and resources to a constellation of allies outside Iran – the so-called “<a href=\"/program/start-here/2024/11/11/irans-axis-of-resistance-explained-start-here\">axis of resistance”</a>, Khamenei’s most impactful strategic project.</p><p>The master architect of this strategy was <a href=\"/news/2020/1/3/who-was-qassem-soleimani-irans-irgcs-quds-force-leader\">Qassem Soleimani</a>, a staunch Khamenei supporter and commander of Iran’s Quds forces, the elite wing of the IRGC responsible primarily for its foreign operations. Soleimani was <a href=\"/news/2020/1/3/irans-qassem-soleimani-killed-in-us-air-raid-at-baghdad-airport\">assassinated</a> by the US in 2020.</p><p>The alliance included Hezbollah in Lebanon, former President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Hamas in Palestine, the Houthis in Yemen, and armed groups in Iraq.</p><p>But the axis began unravelling following Hamas’s assault in southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Israel then unleashed a genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 70,000 people and turned most of the Palestinian territory into rubble. Many senior Hamas leaders have been killed in the war.</p><p>Israel also attacked Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing many figures in its senior leadership, including secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah. Then came the overthrow of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad regime in December 2024 by rebel forces. The corridor that Iran had been using to replenish Hezbollah — through Syria — ceased to be viable.</p><p>With Iran’s allies weakened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had been pushing for a strike on Iran’s nuclear programme <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/6/18/netanyahus-spent-33-years-warning-an-iran-nuke-is\">for decades</a>, seized the moment.</p><p>On June 13, 2025, the Israeli army – with the knowledge of the US – <a href=\"/tag/israel-iran-conflict/\">attacked Iran</a>, killing dozens of its senior commanders and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/13/israel-kills-nuclear-scientists-strikes-sites-in-iran-who-did-it-target\">top nuclear scientists</a>, striking several nuclear sites and civilian and military infrastructure. Israel maintained its attack was to prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, despite separate assessments by the US intelligence and the International Atomic Energy Agency that Tehran was not in the process of doing that. That attack occurred just as Tehran was engaged in negotiations with Washington about its nuclear programme.</p><p>Iran responded with a barrage of missiles striking Tel Aviv. A full-blown war ensued for nearly two weeks, culminating with the US dropping bunker busters on three key nuclear facilities.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4346314\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4346314\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4346314\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-06-22T114022Z_104271357_RC2N7FAQVOQZ_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-ISRAEL-MISSILES-1772284154.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Members of Israeli forces work at an impact site following a missile attack from Iran on Israel, amid the Iran-Israel conflict, in Tel Aviv, Israel, June 22, 2025.

Iranians defied calls by Israel to revolt against the Islamic republic.</p><p>But the rally around the flag effect did not last long.</p><p>Crippling sanctions weighed heavily on the country’s economy. In late December, protests over a currency collapse morphed into a nationwide upheaval calling for the end of Khamenei’s rule. That led to the most brutal crackdown in decades. Iranian authorities said more than 3,000 people were killed, but a US-based human rights group put that tally at more than 7,000. Al Jazeera is unable to independently verify those figures.</p><p>Following the upheaval, the country was at a crossroads. While during previous rounds of protests the state was able to either dispense some subsidies or loosen up social restrictions, this time it had few options for addressing the underlying economic grievances that sparked the demonstrations. Iran needed to make tough compromises to win sanctions relief and fix the economy – or face further upheaval, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/change-is-inevitable-what-is-next-for-iran\">experts said</a>.</p><p>That led to new rounds of negotiations between the US and Iran to limit Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Despite statements of “progress”, several rounds of talks in the United Arab Emirates and in Geneva failed to reach any breakthrough. The US said it wanted Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies. While Tehran has shown flexibility about discussing limitations on the enrichment of uranium for civilian use, it has so far treated missiles and proxies as non-negotiables.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p><p>On February 28, Trump announced that the US had begun a “major combat operation” in Iran. In his speech, the American president made it clear that the US was seeking regime change.</p><p>“The hour of your freedom is at hand,” Trump said, speaking to the Iranian people at the end of his Saturday morning address. “When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will probably be your only chance for generations.”</p><p>He said he was “willing to do” what no previous American president had done.</p><p>“So let’s see how you respond”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Baghaei said the country’s armed forces “are defending national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Iran against these barbaric acts of aggression”.</p><p>The US-Israeli attacks came after a third round of indirect negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme between the US and Iran ended on Friday.</p><p>“We were supposed to meet on Monday to talk about technical aspects of any possible deal on [the] nuclear issue,” Baghaei said. “And the Americans themselves acknowledged that these negotiations went quite well. The mediator, [the] foreign minister of Oman, qualified this round of negotiations as being of significant progress.”</p><p>It was the second time in less than a year that diplomacy had been scuttled by an attack on Iran, Baghaei noted. Iran and the US had engaged in several rounds of negotiations last year, when Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran in June, which the US briefly joined, despite Trump saying he was committed to a diplomatic resolution.</p><p>Baghaei said the US “launching an act of aggression against another member of the United Nations” also threatened the international body, as its main pillar, “the UN Charter, is the provision of the use of force.”</p><p>“So, I think what is at stake is not only the security and peace of the region and that of Iran, but also the whole fabric of international law. And the normative system that has been created by the United Nations Charter,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"friends-in-the-region\">Friends in the region</h2><p>Baghaei defended Iran’s retaliatory attacks in several countries across the region.</p><p>“Under international law, any place, any location, any logistical support that are given to the aggressor [is a] legitimate target for the victim state,” he said. “So, we are not attacking any country in the region. We are friendly with all countries of the region. What we are doing is just taking defensive actions.”</p><p>“We have proven that we trust our friends in the region,” Baghaei said. “That’s why we try to get together with the countries of the region in furtherance of this diplomatic process. The problem is that the United States is conducting this war of aggression at the cost of everyone, including the countries of the region.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

At the end of a third round of nuclear talks in Geneva on Thursday, Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi, acting as a mediator, announced that “significant progress” had been achieved and said technical talks were expected to resume on Monday.</p><p>“Iran has agreed to give up its stockpile of enriched material – zero accumulation and allow for full verification by the IAEA of its nuclear programme,” CBS News reported, quoting Albusaidi as saying. “With zero stockpiling, it becomes impossible to build a bomb regardless of enrichment levels,” he added, according to CBS.</p><p>Tehran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, has repeatedly said its nuclear programme was intended for civilian purposes and it has no intention to build atomic weapons.</p><p>Netanyahu has been calling for military action to destroy Iran’s nuclear capabilities, saying that Tehran’s atomic facilities constitute an existential threat to Israel.</p><p>US and Israeli officials have said the attacks on Saturday targeted Iranian officials, missile storage and launching sites, and Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>Iranian media reported strikes on the Ministry of Intelligence, the Ministry of Defence, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran and the Parchin military complex.</p><p>Iran responded with attacks on Israel, as well as on bases used by the US military across the Gulf region, including in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p><strong>Negotiations under threat</strong></p><p>Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history, has long built his career around an objective of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p><p>In 2015, he vehemently opposed a nuclear deal that then US President Barack Obama had reached, together with Western allies, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for easing of sanctions imposed on Tehran.</p><p>Trump officially withdrew from the agreement in 2018, calling it a horrible deal, and reimposed sanctions on Tehran as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign to force Iran to renegotiate the deal.</p><p>Netanyahu found his opportunity to move against Tehran after Trump won his second term in office. With Israel embroiled in its genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, raid on Israel, Netanyahu, with a green light from the United States, launched his attack on Iran on June 13, 2025. The US briefly joined in the campaign, bombing several nuclear facilities.</p><p>Although Trump had proclaimed that US strikes had destroyed Iran’s nuclear capabilities, he had pushed for Iran to completely dismantle its nuclear programme, a demand Tehran rejects.</p><p>The US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford.</p><p>Analysts say that while Trump had spoken about the need to ensure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon, Netanyahu was pushing for Tehran to agree to negotiate its missile capabilities, including reducing their range to a “300-kilometre (185-mile) red line”.</p><p>Netanyahu also demanded that the United States push Tehran to stop supporting proxy allies in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.</p><p>While Israel says it emerged from the 12-day war in June with a strategic victory, Iranian missiles also inflicted heavy damage on Israeli cities. Up to 33 people were killed in the attacks, compared with more than 600 Iranians, while more than 3,000 others were hospitalised.</p><p><strong>What’s next</strong></p><p>While it is clear that Iran’s military capabilities do not compare with those of the United States and Israel, it is too early to predict how this confrontation will end.</p><p>US officials have been wary of the possibility of being drawn into a prolonged conflict in the Middle East, like the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Trump had criticised as a “disastrous mistake”, while Iranian officials have said that the US would find itself in a quagmire if it attacked.</p><p>The Washington Post has reported that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine had warned him of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/iran-says-ready-for-talks-but-will-defend-itself-against-us-aggression\">potential risks of attacking Iran</a>, including becoming entangled in a prolonged conflict and the possibility of US casualties.</p><p>On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance was quoted by The Washington Post as saying that there is “no chance” that US strikes on Iran would result in the United States becoming involved in a years-long, drawn-out war.</p><p class=\"speakable\">“The idea that we’re going to be in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight — there is no chance that will happen,” Vance said on Thursday, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/26/vance-no-chance-us-will-be-drawn-out-war-middle-east/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the outlet</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"
