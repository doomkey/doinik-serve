            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"210\" data-end=\"403\">In December 2025, I was elected president of the Oxford Union, the world-famous debating society. I made history as the first Palestinian to hold the role in the institution’s 203-year history.</p><p data-start=\"405\" data-end=\"804\">I won the presidency by a significant margin, in an election that saw turnout far exceed recent contests. Throughout my campaign, I was open about my background as a Palestinian from Gaza, and about how my identity and family history have shaped my understanding of the importance of representation and debate. That openness, however, quickly became the basis for sustained attempts to discredit me.</p><p data-start=\"806\" data-end=\"1045\">Rather than engaging with my stated platform or my record, early press reporting questioned my suitability for office purely on the basis of who I am. The aim was clear: to portray me as a radical, an extremist, someone inherently suspect.</p><p data-start=\"1047\" data-end=\"1506\">These reports did not emerge in isolation. They formed part of a wider smear campaign that accompanied my presidential run, in which I was cast as an extremist and a security concern. Within that framing, false rumours began circulating that students who supported my campaign could face consequences themselves, including the loss of visas, placement on security watchlists or formal investigations. No evidence was ever produced to substantiate any of this.</p><p data-start=\"1508\" data-end=\"1813\">I always expected student politics to involve a certain level of hostility. What shocked me was the extent to which supposedly reputable outlets adopted these narratives without basic due diligence, and in some cases went further, presenting insinuations as fact in order to depict me as unfit for office.</p><p data-start=\"1815\" data-end=\"2247\">That pattern became unmistakable when I received an email from the Jewish Chronicle seeking my response to a forthcoming article, a month after I had already been reported on by the Jerusalem Post. The email was framed as an opportunity for a “right of reply”, but in practice it set out a series of claims and insinuations, presented as evidence of extremism. The most glaring of these was a supposed family link to a Hamas member.</p><p data-start=\"2249\" data-end=\"2625\">The claim referred to Mohammed Al-Rayis, a man killed in an Israeli drone strike in Beirut in January 2024. He is not related to me. The suggestion relied on pairing one of the most common first names in the Arab world with a widely shared family name from Gaza. My father, Mohammed Elrayess, who bears the same name, is a scientist at Qatar University and is very much alive.</p><p data-start=\"2627\" data-end=\"2784\">Other points raised in the same email were not allegations of wrongdoing at all, but descriptions of my speech and activities, reframed to appear suspicious.</p><p data-start=\"2786\" data-end=\"3080\">One concerned a social media post in which I mourned the killing of Saleh Aljafarawi, a Palestinian journalist killed in Gaza in October 2025, shortly after the announcement of the latest “ceasefire”. In the email, the Jewish Chronicle journalist described Aljafarawi as a “Hamas propagandist”.</p><p data-start=\"3082\" data-end=\"3274\">Israel’s assault on Gaza has been the deadliest conflict for journalists in recorded history. My post was a defence of press freedom and a tribute to a media worker killed in the line of duty.</p><p data-start=\"3276\" data-end=\"3597\">Another concerned my involvement in a documentary I helped produce, Heart of a Protest, which followed pro-Palestine demonstrations across the UK. It was a zero-budget film that allowed protesters to explain why they continued to mobilise and the obstacles they faced in doing so. All proceeds went to families in Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"3599\" data-end=\"3894\">Another line of attack focused on a speech I made at the Oxford Union in November 2024, in favour of the motion, “This house believes that Israel is an apartheid state responsible for genocide”. There was no interest in the substance of what I said. The objection was to my participation itself.</p><p data-start=\"3896\" data-end=\"4208\">I am proud that I spoke at that debate to rebut arguments that justified or supported the genocide in Gaza. I am proud that I was able to speak about my relative, Maisara Al-Rayis, who was killed alongside his family in an Israeli air strike on his home. If that is an allegation, I accept it without hesitation.</p><p data-start=\"4210\" data-end=\"4555\">For me, these patterns of attack do not reflect strength. They reflect weakness. If the concerns raised about me were genuine, if I truly posed a danger to the institution I now lead, there would be no need to recast lawful and legitimate political expression as evidence of extremism, or to imply guilt through invented family associations.</p><p data-start=\"4557\" data-end=\"4742\">These attempts to discredit me sit within a broader effort to silence Palestinians in public life, and to discourage Palestinian participation altogether. They are meant to warn us off.</p><p data-start=\"4744\" data-end=\"4758\">They will not.</p><p data-start=\"4760\" data-end=\"4960\">Let a hundred articles be written to mischaracterise or defame us. We have long passed the point where this can intimidate us into silence. If anything, it makes the need to speak all the more urgent.</p><p data-start=\"4760\" data-end=\"4960\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

United States presidents conduct unilateral military actions abroad. Congress shrugs.</p><p>On Saturday, in the hours after the US military <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abducted</a> Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, Democrats in the Senate pledged to raise yet another <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/what-is-the-war-powers-act-and-can-it-stop-trump-from-attacking-iran\">resolution</a> to rein in US President Donald Trump’s military actions.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has said the party will push for a vote within the week. By all accounts, the odds of its success remain long.</p><p>Since Trump took office for a second term in 2025, Congress has weighed multiple bills that would force him to seek legislative approval before initiating a military strike.</p><p>But the latest attack on Venezuela offers a stark instance of presidential overreach, one that is “crying out for congressional action”, according to David Janovsky, the acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight.</p><p>Experts say it is also one of the clearest tests in recent history of whether Congress will continue to cede its authority to check US military engagement abroad.</p><p>“There are a lot of angles where you can come at this to say why it’s a clear-cut case,” Janovsky told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He pointed out that, under the US Constitution, Congress alone wields the authority to allow military action. He also noted that the Venezuela attack “is in direct contravention of the UN Charter, which is, as a treaty, law in the United States”.</p><p>“Any of the fig leaves that presidents have used in the past to justify unilateral military action just don’t apply here,” Janovsky added. “This is particularly brazen.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"an-uphill-battle\">An uphill battle</h2><p>Since August, the Trump administration has signalled plans to crank up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela.</p><p>That month, Trump reportedly signed a secret memo calling on the US military to prepare for action against criminal networks abroad. Then, on September 2, the Trump administration began conducting dozens of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts.</p><p>That deadly bombing campaign was itself condemned as a violation of international law and an affront to Congress’s constitutional powers. It coincided with a build-up of US military assets near Venezuela.</p><p>Trump also dropped hints that the US military campaign could quickly expand to alleged drug-trafficking targets on Venezuelan soil. “When they come by land, we’re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats,” Trump said on September 16.</p><p>The strikes prompted two recent votes in the House of Representatives in December: one that would require congressional approval for any land strikes on the South American country, and one that would force Trump to seek approval for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats.</p><p>Both resolutions, however, failed roughly along party lines. A similar resolution in the Senate, which would have required congressional approval before any more attacks, also fell short in November.</p><p>But speaking to reporters in a phone call just hours after the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/how-the-us-attack-on-venezuela-abduction-of-maduro-unfolded\">US operation</a> on Saturday, Senator Tim Kaine said he hoped the brashness of Trump’s latest actions in Venezuela would shock lawmakers into action.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Republicans, he said, can no longer tell themselves that Trump’s months-long military build-up in the Caribbean and his repeated threats are a “bluff” or a “negotiating tactic”.</p><p>“It’s time for Congress to get its a** off the couch and do what it’s supposed to do,” Kaine said.</p><p>In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, US Senator Chris Murphy also agreed that it was “true” that Congress had become impotent on matters of war, a phenomenon that has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p><p>Bash pointed to former President Barack Obama’s 2011 military deployment to Libya, which went unchecked by Congress.</p><p>“Congress needs to own its own role in allowing a presidency to become this lawless,” Murphy responded.</p><h2 id=\"republicans-ho-hum-about-resolutions\">Republicans ho-hum about resolutions</h2><p>Under the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war, something it has not done since World War II.</p><p>Instead, lawmakers have historically passed Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to approve committing troops to recent wars, including the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the strikes on alleged al-Qaeda affiliates across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p><p>No AUMFs have been passed that would relate to military action in Venezuela.</p><p>When lawmakers believe a president is acting beyond his constitutional power, they can pass a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-curb-trumps-power-to-go-to-war-with-iran\">war powers resolution</a> requiring Congressional approval for further actions.</p><p>Beyond their symbolism, such resolutions create a legal basis to challenge further presidential actions in the judiciary.</p><p>However, they carry a high bar for success, with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress needed to override a presidential veto.</p><p>Given the current makeup of Congress, passage of a war powers resolution would likely require bipartisan support.</p><p>Republicans maintain narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, so it would be necessary for members of Trump’s own party to back a war powers resolution for it to be successful.</p><p>In November’s Senate vote, only two Republicans — co-sponsor Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska — split from their party to support the resolution. It failed by a margin of 51 to 49.</p><p>December’s vote on a parallel resolution in the House only earned 211 votes in favour, as opposed to 213 against. In that case, three Republicans broke from their party to support the resolution, and one Democrat opposed it.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump’s abduction of Maduro has so far only received condemnation from a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/us-republicans-back-trump-on-venezuela-amid-faint-maga-dissent\">tiny fragment</a> of his party.</p><p>Overall, the response from elected Republicans has been muted. Even regular critics of presidential adventurism have instead focused on praising the ouster of the longtime Venezuelan leader, who has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.</p><p>Senator Todd Young, a Republican considered on the fence ahead of November’s war powers vote, has praised Maduro’s arrest, even as he contended the Trump administration owed Congress more details.</p><p>“We still need more answers, especially to questions regarding the next steps in Venezuela’s transition,” Young said.</p><p>Some Democrats have also offered careful messaging in the wake of the operation.</p><p>That included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents a large Venezuelan diaspora community in Florida.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/DWStweets/status/2007515364553568526?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Saturday, Wasserman Schultz focused on the implications of Maduro’s removal, while avoiding any mention of the military operation that enabled it. Instead, she asserted that Trump owed Congress an explanation about next steps.</p><p>“He has failed to explain to Congress or the American people how he plans to prevent the regime from reconstituting itself under Maduro’s cronies or stop Venezuela from falling into chaos,” she wrote.</p><p>In December, however, Wasserman Schultz did join a group of Florida Democrats in calling for Congress to exercise its oversight authority as Trump built up military pressure on Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>For its part, the Trump administration has not eased up on its military threats against Venezuela, even as it has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/fact-checking-trump-following-us-capture-of-venezuelas-maduro\">sought to send</a> the message that Maduro’s abduction was a matter of law enforcement, not the start of a war.</p><p>Trump has also denied, once again, that he needed congressional approval for any further military action. Still, in a Monday interview with NBC News, he expressed optimism about having Congress’s backing.</p><p>“We have good support congressionally,” he told NBC. “Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn’t they support us?”</p><p>Since Saturday’s attack and abduction, Trump has warned that a “second wave” of military action could be on the horizon for Venezuela.</p><p>That threat has extended to the potential for the forced removal of Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, who was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/delcy-rodriguez-sworn-in-as-venezuelas-president-after-maduro-abduction\">formally sworn in</a> as the country’s interim president on Monday.</p><p>“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine.</p><p>The administration has also said that strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela will continue and that US military assets will remain deployed in the region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Constitutional expert Janovsky, however, believes that this is a critical moment for Congress to act.</p><p>Failure to rein in Trump would only further reinforce a decades-long trend of lawmakers relinquishing their oversight authorities, he explained. That, in turn, offers tacit support for the presidency’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/2025-trumps-year-of-emergency-invasion-and-narcoterrorism\">growing power</a> over the military.</p><p>“To say this was a targeted law enforcement operation — and ignore the ongoing situation — would be a dangerous abdication of Congress as a central check on how the United States military is used,” Janovsky said.</p><p>“Continued congressional inaction does nothing but empower presidents to act however they want,” he added.</p><p>“To see Congress continue to step back ultimately just removes the American people even farther from where these decisions are actually being made.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

His contract with the club expires at the end of the current season, and the Austrian has indicated that talks on a new contract are currently on hold.</p><p>The 51-year-old has an 11-year managerial experience, having coached two teams in the Austrian top tier, as well as Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt in the German league.</p><h3 id=\"darren-fletcher\">Darren Fletcher</h3><p>The former United midfielder, who graduated from the Manchester United Academy to first time in 2003 and spent 12 years playing under Ferguson, is among the favourites after landing the interim manager’s role.</p><p>Fletcher has been the head coach of United’s academy since July and was the first choice to steer the ship after Amorim’s exit.</p><p>A firm fan favourite during his playing days, the 41-year-old could take the route of his former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who earned the full-time manager’s role after coming on as interim manager.</p><h3>Enzo Maresca</h3><p>While Maresca’s departure from Chelsea was similar to Amorim’s at United, the Italian had a successful first season in London, winning the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup.</p><p>The former Manchester City U-23 and Parma manager led Leicester City back to the Premier League in 2024 before being snapped up by Chelsea.</p><p>Maresca has been favoured to swiftly find a role in the top tier of European football, and Old Trafford could be his next stop.</p><h2 id=\"ole-gunnar-solskjaer\">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h2><p>Solskjaer’s playing and managerial spells at United have endeared him to the club’s faithful, who insist that his knowledge of the “Fergie Way” could bring back the glory days.</p><p>In terms of results, the Norwegian did not land any major trophies during his reign at United but managed to lead the team to a Europa League final and a second-place finish in 2021.</p><p>Solskjaer is currently out of work, having been sacked by Turkish side Besiktas after eight months in charge, and any long-term appointment would most likely require another successful interim period first.</p><h2 id=\"thomas-tuchel\">Thomas Tuchel</h2><p>The current England manager is focused on leading the Three Lions at the upcoming World Cup, but his name is being thrown around for the job at United before the new season’s beginning in August 2026.</p><p>The German is no stranger to winning trophies at major European clubs, having done it at Chelsea, PSG and Bayern Munich.</p><h2 id=\"gareth-southgate\">Gareth Southgate</h2><p>Often regarded as a serious candidate for the role of manager of Manchester United during his England tenure, Southgate’s stock appears to have fallen of late.</p><p>The former Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and England defender’s only management experience at club level came with Middlesbrough from 2006 to 2009. He then took charge of the England under-21 side in 2013 before being appointed manager of the full national team in 2016, a role he held until he stood down in 2024.</p><p>United fans, however, appeared consistent in their concerns about Southgate throughout all his previous links to the job over his pragmatic approach to the game. The 54-year-old was perceived by vocal United fans as stifling the attacking talents of the English team, something not in keeping with the United philosophy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,” he said through an interpreter, before he was cut off by US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan federal court.</p><p>Maduro called himself a POW, a person captured and held by an enemy during an armed conflict.</p><p>Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, who appeared in court on Monday as a codefendant, also pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Other Venezuelan leaders have echoed Maduro’s position. On Saturday, his then-deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on state television alongside her brother, National Assembly chief Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, declaring that Maduro was still Venezuela’s sole legitimate president.</p><p>However, on Monday, the day when Rodriguez took over as Venezuela’s interim president, she posted a statement on social media offering to cooperate with Trump. In the statement, she invited Trump to “collaborate” and sought “respectful relations”.</p><p>“President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war,” she wrote.</p><p>The Venezuelan ambassador to the United Nations, Samuel Moncada, said, “We cannot ignore a central element of this US aggression.”</p><p>“Venezuela is the victim of these attacks because of its natural resources,” Moncada said, according to the UN website.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-us-position\">What is the US position?</h2><p>The US has described the January 3 special operation in Caracas during which Maduro was abducted as a law enforcement operation.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Kristen Welker of NBC’s Meet the Press on Monday that the US and Venezuela were not at war.</p><p>“We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That’s not a war against Venezuela,” he said.</p><p>The US ambassador to the UN, Michael Waltz, said the operation was necessary to combat narcotics trafficking and transnational organised crime threatening US and regional security.</p><p>“There is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying a country,” Waltz said, according to the UN website. “This was a law-enforcement operation in furtherance of lawful indictments that have existed for decades.”</p><p>However, Rubio’s words contradicted Trump’s statements.</p><p>During a news conference on Saturday, Trump said the US would “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be carried out.</p><p>On Sunday, Trump told reporters that the US is ready to carry out a second military strike on Venezuela if its government refuses to cooperate with his plan to “resolve” the situation there.</p><p>“Marco Rubio is not the President. Trump has declared unequivocally that the United States is engaged armed conflict with Venezuela to justify more than 100 murders of alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific,” constitutional law expert Bruce Fein told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Starting in September, the US military launched a series of strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific on boats that it claimed were carrying narcotics. More than 100 people have been killed in at least 30 such boat bombings, but the Trump administration has yet to present any public evidence that there were drugs on board, that the vessels were travelling to the US or that the people on the boats belonged to banned organisations as the US has claimed.</p><p>“If the United States were not a war, Trump would confess he is engaged in mass murder of civilians.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-significance-of-maduro-s-pow-claim\">What is the significance of Maduro’s POW claim?</h2><p>If Maduro is indeed a POW, then protections under international law apply to him.</p><p>The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 mandates humane treatment, respect and protection for POWs.</p><p>According to the convention, a POW can be tried and sentenced in another country, particularly the detaining power, but only for certain crimes such as war crimes.</p><p>Maduro, however, has been charged with narcotics-related offences, not with war crimes.</p><p>And in general, the Third Geneva Convention requires that POWs must be returned “without delay” to their nation as soon as the conflict ends.</p><p>“According to President Trump, Maduro is a prisoner of war because Trump declared Maduro had initiated war against the United States via drug trafficking leading to overdose deaths. That would mean the Geneva Conventions would apply but which Trump will certainly disregard,” Fein said.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-other-experts-say\">What do other experts say?</h2><p>Susanne Gratius, a professor of political science and international relations at the Autonomous University of Madrid, told Al Jazeera that the US attempts to portray Maduro’s abduction as a law-and-order exercise did not hold up in the face of facts.</p><p>“They sell the operation as a domestically motivated drugs issue, but it is clearly not. They violated national sovereignty. Even though Maduro is a dictator, there is no legal argument to hijack him and his wife through a US military operation,” Gratius said, referring to Maduro’s refusal to quit office despite widespread accusations that he lost controversial elections in 2024.</p><p>The US attack, she said, was a violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter, which decrees that all members are sovereign equals. “Regime change or access to oil do not justify unilateral military interventions.”</p><p>Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that the US involvement in Venezuela was “less about Maduro as it is about access to Venezuela’s oil deposits”.</p><p>Venezuela is home to the world’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">largest proven oil reserves</a> – at an estimated 303 billion barrels as of 2023 – it earns <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/venezuela-has-the-worlds-most-oil-why-doesnt-it-earn-more-from-exports\">only a fraction</a> of the revenue it once did from exporting crude.</p><p>According to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), Venezuela exported just $4.05bn worth of crude oil in 2023. This is far below the leading exporters, including Saudi Arabia ($181bn), the US ($125bn) and Russia ($122bn). This is largely because of US sanctions on Venezuelan oil.</p><p>“This [oil] is the number one target. Trump is not content with just allowing US oil firms to get concessions but to ‘run’ the country, which entails absolute and indefinite control over Venezuela’s resources,” Bantekas said.</p><p>Experts also point to the months-long military campaign that the Trump administration waged against Venezuela before Maduro’s abduction — including the bombing of boats — to underscore why it is hard to justify the US attack as a law-and-order operation.</p><p>“Trump’s seizure of Venezuelan oil and displacement of Venezuelan sovereignty are acts of war,” Fein said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Last year, the US designated it as a “terrorist” group.

There are some key differences in what Trump and Rubio have said.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-rubio-said\">What has Rubio said?</h2><p>Rubio spoke to multiple news outlets on Sunday and Monday, as he defended the US actions and spelled out the reasoning behind the operation that has been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/us-critics-and-allies-condemn-maduros-abduction-at-un-security-council\">condemned</a> by the United Nations Security Council.</p><p>In an interview with Kristen Welker of NBC’s Meet the Press, Rubio said: “We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That’s not a war against Venezuela.”</p><p>The seizure of “drug boats” will continue, he said, referring to the dozens of strikes on vessels near the Venezuelan coast since September that have killed more than 100 people.</p><p>“No more drug trafficking … and no more using the oil industry to enrich all our adversaries around the world and not benefitting the people of Venezuela or, frankly, benefitting the United States and the region,” Rubio told NBC on Sunday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Additionally, Rubio told NBC that the US does not need Venezuelan oil and has plenty of its own oil. “What we’re not going to allow is for the oil industry in Venezuela to be controlled by adversaries of the United States,” he said, naming Russia, Iran and China.</p><p>“This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live. And we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operations for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States, simple as that.”</p><p>Rubio told NBC’s Welker that since 2014, about eight million Venezuelans have fled the country, driven by the systematic theft and mismanagement of the country’s oil wealth by Maduro and his inner circle, instead of it being used to benefit the Venezuelan people. He said the migration was “destabilising” the region.</p><p>According to a report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees updated in May 2025, nearly 7.9 million people have left Venezuela. Analysts point out that the punitive US sanctions played a significant role in the collapse of Venezuela’s economy, which worsened the migrant crisis.</p><p>Rubio on Sunday reiterated that the US will continue to enforce an existing “oil quarantine”.</p><p>“We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking,” Rubio told a local news outlet.</p><p>Accusations that Venezuela is the main source of drugs entering the US are false, experts say.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said\">What has Trump said?</h2><p>Rubio’s recent statements differ from what Trump has said about Venezuela.</p><p>While Rubio said the US does not want to govern Venezuela and is not interested in its oil, Trump suggested different ideas a day earlier.</p><p>During a news conference on Saturday, Trump said the US would “run” Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could be carried out.</p><p>Trump added that US oil companies would fix Venezuela’s “broken infrastructure” and “start making money for the country”.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-s-the-plan\">So what’s the plan?</h2><p>Elvira Dominguez-Redondo, a professor of international law at Kingston University in the United Kingdom, told Al Jazeera that there is no basis to comment on whether Washington has a coherent plan.</p><p>“From the outside, it is impossible to know what the next steps of the US will be, particularly given the contradictory public statements coming from senior figures.”</p><p>She added: “What I can say, based on observable facts, is that there is no full-scale military invasion or formal assumption of governmental authority by the US. What appears to have occurred instead is the removal of Maduro while allowing the rest of the governing apparatus to remain in place, under conditions that are not publicly known. Whether and how this was negotiated is unclear.”</p><p>Dominguez-Redondo said the US cannot legally invade and govern Venezuela, since this would amount to occupation under international law.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-latest-political-situation-in-venezuela\">What’s the latest political situation in Venezuela?</h2><p>Sworn in as the interim leader on Monday, Rodriguez, 56, told the National Assembly, “I come with pain over the kidnapping of two heroes who are being held hostage: President Nicolas Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores.”</p><p>“I swear to work tirelessly to guarantee the peace, spiritual, economic and social tranquillity of our people.”</p><p id=\"interim-venezuelan-leader-invites-trump-to-collaborate-and-seeks-respectful-relations-in-newly-conciliatory-message\">A day earlier, she had offered to work with Trump and sought “respectful relations” in a conciliatory message.</p><p>“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” Rodriguez wrote on social media.</p><p>“President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war.”</p><p>On Saturday, Rodriguez had appeared on state television alongside her brother, National Assembly chief Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, declaring that Maduro was still Venezuela’s sole legitimate president.<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4219110\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-venezuela_leaders-1767699346.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - venezuela_leaders-1767699346\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-key-leaders-in-venezuela-s-chavista-government\">Who are the key leaders in Venezuela’s Chavista government?</h2><p id=\"it-will-also-include-key-personalities-currently-present-in-caracas\">The key leaders shaping Venezuela’s next political chapter include acting President Rodriguez, who was part of Maduro’s inner circle. Her brother Jorge is also an important leader.</p><p>The other key leaders include Interior Minister Cabello – considered powerful in the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela – and Defence Minister Lopez.</p><p>When asked what action the Venezuelan government and the military could take against any US intervention, Kingston University’s Dominguez-Redondo said, “In practical terms, very little.”</p><p>“If the Venezuelan military were capable of mounting a meaningful response, it would likely have done so already.”</p><p>She pointed out how the US involvement in Venezuela did not begin with the abduction of Maduro, but with attacks on boats in Venezuelan waters that the US alleged were carrying drugs.</p><p>“These were Venezuelan boats, and even if they were engaged in trafficking, the killings were extrajudicial executions. From a legal perspective, those incidents could have been characterised as an armed attack, potentially triggering a right of self-defence by Venezuela.</p><p>“Yet Venezuela did not respond militarily and limited itself to condemnation. The escalation then continued through the seizure of Venezuelan oil, and finally, the capture of Maduro.

China and South Korea have their own differences too, over Taiwan, trade tensions, and maritime claims.</p><h2 id=\"why-south-korea-needs-china\" data-start=\"1214\" data-end=\"1605\">Why South Korea needs China</h2><p data-start=\"1214\" data-end=\"1605\">Against that backdrop, the timing of Lee’s visit is significant, say analysts: Reports suggest that the South Korean president is expected to visit Japan later this month, but he chose to travel to China first.</p><p data-start=\"1214\" data-end=\"1605\">Money clearly matters.</p><p data-start=\"1214\" data-end=\"1605\">China is South Korea’s largest economic partner, its top destination for exports, and a primary source of imports.</p><p data-start=\"1214\" data-end=\"1605\">But Seoul needs Beijing for more than economic reasons.</p><p data-start=\"1214\" data-end=\"1605\">Beijing is important to Seoul because of the influence it wields over North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un.</p><p data-start=\"1607\" data-end=\"1863\">The urgency of regional security was underscored by North Korea firing hypersonic missiles over the sea east of its territory just hours before Lee departed for China.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-discussed-at-the-xi-lee-summit\">What was discussed at the Xi-Lee summit?</h2><p data-start=\"1909\" data-end=\"1970\">Monday’s summit opened with warm remarks from both leaders. Xi emphasised that the two nations “highly prioritise the South Korea-China relationship”.</p><p data-start=\"1909\" data-end=\"1970\">“Friends grow closer with each meeting, and neighbours grow closer with each visit,” said Xi, whose visit to South Korea for the APEC summit was the first by a Chinese president since 2014. “As friends and neighbours, South Korea and China must interact more frequently and communicate diligently.”</p><p data-start=\"2368\" data-end=\"2571\">Lee echoed Xi’s sentiments.</p><p data-start=\"2573\" data-end=\"3237\">Mason Richey, a professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS) in Seoul, described the summit as the first true “test of Lee’s ability to navigate the tricky South Korean relationship with China”.</p><p data-start=\"2573\" data-end=\"3237\">“This trip is significantly important to South Korea after Lee focused so much on the US over the first seven months of his term,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"2573\" data-end=\"3237\">But for all the cordial talk, “several critical, contentious issues were not addressed in any serious way,” he said. “In particular, Chinese hybrid threats against South Korea in the Yellow Sea, as well as Chinese coercion of Taiwan and the Philippines.” China insists that self-governing Taiwan belongs to it, and has not ruled out taking it by force. Beijing also held major wargames off Taiwan in December. China and the Philippines, meanwhile, have been locked in tense ties over competing claims to parts of the South China Sea.</p><p data-start=\"3239\" data-end=\"3573\">Lee Dong-gyu, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, added that “both sides [China and South Korea] share a consensus that relations should be restored, and that economic cooperation is the way forward.</p><p data-start=\"3239\" data-end=\"3573\">“In reality, however, it does not seem easy to find common ground in external relations or in the domains of diplomacy and security.”</p><h2 id=\"north-korea\">North Korea</h2><p data-start=\"3599\" data-end=\"3801\">During the 90-minute summit, Lee stressed the importance of working with China to bring North Korea back to the dialogue table, at a time when Pyongyang has shown little sign of engaging in diplomacy.</p><p data-start=\"3803\" data-end=\"4165\">China remains North Korea’s principal ally and economic lifeline. Xi has promised economic support to the North – still technically at war with the South. Kim appeared alongside Xi during the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/3/chinas-xi-oversees-massive-military-parade-with-putin-kim-in-attendance\">Victory Day military parade</a> in Beijing last year. Meanwhile, North Korea has dismissed Lee’s outreach, calling him a “hypocrite” and “confrontational maniac”.</p><p data-start=\"4167\" data-end=\"4408\">“(I) will work together (with China to) explore viable alternatives for peace on the Korean Peninsula so that both countries can jointly contribute to peace, the basic foundation for prosperity and growth,” Lee said in his opening remarks at the summit.</p><p data-start=\"4410\" data-end=\"4627\">While North Korea’s denuclearisation was not directly mentioned, Xi noted that the two countries “bear important responsibilities in safeguarding regional peace and promoting global development, and share broad common interests”.</p><p data-start=\"4629\" data-end=\"4964\">South Korea’s national security adviser Wi Sung Lac told reporters that “the two leaders underscored the importance of resuming dialogue with North Korea,” and said Lee and Xi had agreed to hold annual meetings and expand communication among defence authorities to “build mutual trust and contribute to regional peace and stability”.</p><h2 id=\"silence-on-taiwan\">Silence on Taiwan</h2><p data-start=\"4991\" data-end=\"5297\">In an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV last week, Lee said South Korea believed in “respecting the ‘one China’ principle” – the tenet under which countries must reject diplomatic ties with Taiwan to work with Beijing.</p><p data-start=\"4991\" data-end=\"5297\">However, he has previously advocated a more balanced stance, arguing that South Korea should not directly engage militarily over the Taiwan Strait, a conflict between two outside states.</p><p data-start=\"4991\" data-end=\"5297\">The issue has become more sensitive after statements made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in November. She warned that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could pose an “existential crisis for Japan” and might compel Tokyo to use its military. China-Japan tensions soared as Beijing accused her of interfering in its internal affairs. China issued a travel advisory for Japan and suspended a number of its imports from the country.</p><p data-start=\"5299\" data-end=\"5529\">During Monday’s summit, Xi told Lee that “both countries, with broad common interests, should stand firmly on the right side of history and make correct strategic choices.” Direct mentions of Taiwan were absent from discussions.</p><p data-start=\"5531\" data-end=\"5790\">Instead, Xi highlighted the shared Chinese and Korean experience of resisting Japan during World War II: “More than 80 years ago, China and South Korea made tremendous national sacrifices and won the victory against Japanese militarism,” Chinese state media Xinhua reported.</p><p data-start=\"5792\" data-end=\"6051\">Lee also noted the two neighbouring countries have maintained friendly ties for thousands of years and share a history of resisting the loss of sovereignty and fighting for independence, an apparent reference to Japan’s early 20th-century colonial expansion.</p><h2 id=\"us-countermeasures\">US countermeasures</h2><p data-start=\"6083\" data-end=\"6343\">For all of the apparent bonhomie on display in Beijing, South Korea must maintain a tricky balance, analysts said.</p><p data-start=\"6083\" data-end=\"6343\">The US continues to deepen its military presence in the Asia Pacific, strengthening ties with countries including South Korea, Japan and the Philippines, while conducting joint exercises near the South China Sea, where Chinese territorial claims have been contested for decades.</p><p data-start=\"6345\" data-end=\"6449\">South Korea hosts the largest US military base in Asia with roughly 28,500 soldiers stationed there.</p><p data-start=\"6615\" data-end=\"6840\">Richey from HUFS said: “Lee will ultimately privilege the relationship with the US more than China because he has no choice – neither as a matter of international relations nor domestically, where China is very unpopular.”</p><p data-start=\"6842\" data-end=\"7172\">In November, South Korea and the US agreed to build nuclear-powered submarines. This came after the US lowered tariffs on South Korean products in exchange for $350bn in US industrial investments and cooperation on the “Make American Shipbuilding Great Again” initiative, aimed at countering China’s dominance in the sector.</p><p data-start=\"7174\" data-end=\"7298\">China has previously expressed concern over South Korea acquiring nuclear capabilities although this topic was not discussed at the summit.</p><p data-start=\"7300\" data-end=\"7631\">Lee Dong-gyu from the Asan Institute for Policy Studies noted that China may seek common ground with South Korea regarding the Korean Peninsula and regional security to counter growing US influence in the region.</p><p data-start=\"7300\" data-end=\"7631\">“This is especially true in the period of the Trump administration when the US is increasingly demanding greater responsibility and contributions from its Asian allies to its containment of China. Given this situation, China may look to restore relations with South Korea to ease US-led efforts in the region,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"7300\" data-end=\"7631\">“Especially in the period of the Trump administration, China looks to counter the US’s increasing presence in the region, using its regional allies to continue pressing on China,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"south-china-sea-drama\">South China Sea drama</h2><p data-start=\"7667\" data-end=\"7847\">The summit also addressed sensitive maritime issues, particularly concerns over Beijing’s steel structures in a jointly managed Provisional Maritime Zone (PMZ) in the Yellow Sea, a shallow water body between mainland China and the Korean Peninsula.</p><p data-start=\"7849\" data-end=\"8045\">Since 2018, China has installed steel structures in the area, which Beijing claims are for fish farming, though concerns persist about territorial assertiveness in the South and East China Seas.</p><p data-start=\"8047\" data-end=\"8327\">Both sides agreed that turning the Yellow Sea into “a peaceful and co-prosperous sea” is essential for stable, long-term relations and that they would continue “constructive” consultations, South Korea’s national security adviser Wi Sung Lak said. They also agreed to hold vice-ministerial talks on the maritime boundary within this year.</p><h2 id=\"shared-economic-prosperity\">Shared economic prosperity</h2><p data-start=\"8368\" data-end=\"8567\">Lee was accompanied by heads of South Korean conglomerates, including Samsung, SK Group, and LG, as the two sides signed 14 memorandums of understanding in trade, technology, and environmental areas.</p><p data-start=\"8569\" data-end=\"8761\">Nearly half of South Korea’s rare earth minerals, essential for semiconductor production, come from China. China also accounts for a third of Seoul’s annual chip exports, its largest market.</p><p data-start=\"8763\" data-end=\"8921\">Meanwhile, Chinese firm Huawei plans to launch its Ascend 950 AI chips in South Korea next year, providing an alternative to US-based Nvidia for Korean firms, CEO Balian Wang said.</p><p data-start=\"8923\" data-end=\"9138\">China is also South Korea’s largest source of foreign tourists.</p><p data-start=\"9140\" data-end=\"9458\">Under former President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea-China relations were strained due to Yoon’s closer alignment with the US, amid intensifying US-China rivalry. But in an era of Trump’s tariffs, Seoul is seeking more of a balance between security ties with Washington and economic links with Beijing.</p><p data-start=\"9140\" data-end=\"9458\">“South Korea and China are like ships sailing in the same sea toward the same direction,” Lee said at a bilateral business forum before his summit with Xi.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4218506\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4218506\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4218506\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695cb1693205-1767682409.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung (L) and his wife Kim Hea Kyung (2nd L) take a selfie with China's President Xi Jinping (2nd R) and his wife Peng Liyuan (R) after a dinner at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 5, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4218506\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung (L) and his wife Kim Hea Kyung (2nd L) take a selfie with China’s President Xi Jinping (2nd R) and his wife Peng Liyuan (R) after a dinner at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"continuation-of-cultural-exchanges\">Continuation of cultural exchanges</h2><p data-start=\"9507\" data-end=\"9691\">While Beijing does not formally acknowledge restrictions, the two leaders discussed repairing cultural ties to expand Korean entertainment content access in China, which has faced unofficial bans.</p><p data-start=\"9693\" data-end=\"9837\">However, South Korean Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hoon Sik told a radio interview that Beijing was unlikely to lift the informal ban anytime soon.</p><p data-start=\"9839\" data-end=\"10087\">And while their leaders might have exchanged warm words, the mood on the streets of China and South Korea isn’t very favourable for strong ties, point out analysts, citing anti-China rallies in South Korea and reports referring to anti-Korean sentiment in China.</p><p data-start=\"10251\" data-end=\"10492\">Still, Lee and Xi appeared to make an effort this week to present a different side to bilateral relations.</p><p data-start=\"10251\" data-end=\"10492\">After a state banquet, Lee took a selfie of the presidential couples, including a smiling Xi, using a Chinese-produced Xiaomi smartphone given to him by Xi during his visit to South Korea last year.</p><p data-start=\"10494\" data-end=\"10665\">“The image quality is certainly good, right?” Lee posted on social media, adding a beaming face emoji. “Thanks to you, I got the picture of a lifetime haha,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

out of his bedroom</a> by United States Delta Force commandos on Saturday and is now awaiting trial in New York on <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/what-is-the-us-charging-nicolas-maduro-with\">drug trafficking charges</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Before <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduction\">abducting</a> him, US military forces struck the Buk-2MA air defence systems and radars Russia supplied to Venezuela and installed at seaports and airports as part of their “strategic alliance”.</p><p>However, Moscow’s defence cooperation treaty with Caracas was vague and did not envisage immediate military aid in case of a foreign invasion.</p><p>And even though Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/world-reacts-to-reported-us-bombing-of-venezuela\">called</a> Maduro’s capture an “unacceptable act of armed aggression”, Putin refrained from saying anything at all – let alone meddling militarily.</p><h2 id=\"putin-s-prestige-and-reputation-suffered-a-blow\">‘Putin’s prestige and reputation suffered a blow’</h2><p>The consequences for Russia are two-pronged, observers told Al Jazeera.</p><p>There is immediate damage to the Kremlin’s already-tarnished international reputation but long-term benefits for Moscow’s insistence on having carte blanche in Ukraine and the former Soviet Union, including energy-rich Central Asia.</p><p>“On the one hand, Putin’s prestige and reputation suffered a blow as Maduro was his most loyal ally in Latin America,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of the London-based Central Asia Due Diligence think tank, told Al Jazeera. “Far more important to Putin is that with his actions, Trump is establishing a new world order.”</p><p>But this ally’s value cannot possibly outweigh the importance of a new world order that US President Donald Trump is establishing, he said.</p><p>“And this new world order is now based on the priority of force, not on the international law whose cornerstone was the sovereignty of nations,” he said.</p><p>What happened with Maduro resembles Moscow’s military inaction after al-Assad’s panicked flight from Damascus to Moscow in December 2024 during the takeover of Syria by opposition forces.</p><p>One theory is that Trump and Putin wrote Maduro off during their August summit in Anchorage, Alaska.</p><p>“Perhaps in Anchorage or even earlier, there was a conversation about the limitation of spheres of interest in the world,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia researcher with Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The agreement may have included concessions from Trump on Ukraine for the sake of future, post-war joint development of hydrocarbons in Russia’s Arctic regions while Washington gains control over Greenland.</p><p>“Trump’s persistent desire to take over <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/danish-pm-says-us-attack-on-greenland-would-be-the-end-of-nato\">Greenland</a> is made from the same cloth,” Mitrokhin said. “From there, he’d want to control the northern part of ‘his part of the world’.”</p><p>And after Russia’s existing oilfields are tapped out, US companies could also be instrumental in the development of the Bazhenovska Svita, the world’s largest shale oil deposits in the swampy plains of western Siberia.</p><p>US oil companies pioneered the extraction of shale oil and gas while Russian firms lack the technologies and expertise.</p><p>Control over Bazhenovska Svita would help the White House kill a much bigger geopolitical bird with the same stone.</p><p>“The United States needs Bazhenovska Svita to prevent China from getting there as it could form Beijing’s energy independence,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Meanwhile, the loss of Maduro does not pose any peril to Russia as media and public figures influenced by the Kremlin use the brazen capture of a foreign president to lambast Washington’s “imperialism”, he said.</p><h2 id=\"putin-will-not-get-closer-to-trump\">‘Putin will not get closer to Trump’</h2><p>Another expert said giving up on Maduro will not help Putin to mend ties with Trump right away.</p><p>On Monday, Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/trump-spurns-kremlins-putin-residence-attack-claim-russia-kills-2-in-kyiv\">said</a> he “didn’t believe” Putin’s claim that Ukraine had tried to kill the Russian president at his Valdai residence in northwestern Russia in late December.</p><p>“By closing his eyes on Maduro’s capture, Putin will not get closer to Trump,” Galiya Ibragimova, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Putin is most frightened by the fact that in Maduro’s coterie, there was a person who leaked information to Americans, and now Putin – with his paranoid conviction that everyone is after him – will firstly boost his own security,” she said.</p><p>Maduro’s “extraction” may even inspire Putin to plan the kidnapping of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, she said.</p><p>At the dawn of his presidency in the early 2000s, Putin developed ties with Maduro’s socialist predecessor and mentor Hugo Chavez despite Moscow’s growing political tilt to rightward nationalism.</p><p>Chavez paid billions for Russian-made weapons such as tanks, helicopters, fighter jets and missiles, and Moscow even opened a factory in Venezuela to manufacture AK-47 assault rifles.</p><p>Russian experts played a key role in Venezuela’s economic lifeline – the processing of heavy, hard-to-extract crude.</p><p>However, their outdated technologies could not possibly prevent the decline in Venezuela’s crude production, which helped cause a years-long economic nosedive, hyperinflation and brain drain of oil experts from geologists to engineers.</p><p>After coming to power in 2013, Maduro met with Putin a dozen times, and each of his visits to Moscow was a red-carpet, pompous affair full of rhetoric and mutual assurances of “eternal friendship”.</p><p>In October, Maduro sent a plea to Putin, urging him to send missiles for Russia-supplied S-300 air defence systems, repair Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, and supply radars and other unspecified “logistical support”, The Washington Post reported.</p><p>He also asked for a “financing plan”, the newspaper said, adding that it was not clear whether Moscow replied to the plea.</p><p>Meanwhile, pro-Kremlin voices present Maduro’s fall as part of an anti-Moscow plan that will certainly “fail.”</p><p>“We simply have to fathom that the collective West will never give up on its attempts to defeat Russia,” analyst Kirill Strelnikov wrote in an opinion piece for the RIA Novosti news agency on Tuesday. “You can try – and will fall from far above and painfully.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We demanded that humanitarian aid is not used as a political blackmail,” al-Ansari said.</p><p>He added that there are a number of “complications” that require effort from all parties to resolve.</p><p>This comes amid Israeli reports that Israel and the United States may consider refraining from reopening the crucial crossing on the border with Egypt until the body of the last Israeli held in Gaza is discovered and handed over to Israel.</p><p>Reopening the Rafah crossing was a condition of the first phase of the ceasefire that went into effect on October 10. But it has remained closed as humanitarian groups say Israeli restrictions continue to hamper aid deliveries, a clear violation of the agreement.</p><p>The crossing had long been Gaza’s only connection to the outside world until the Israeli military occupied the Palestinian side in May 2024.</p><p>The latest rumour of a potential reopening came on Thursday when the Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported that Israeli authorities were preparing to reopen the crossing in “both directions” following pressure from US President Donald Trump.</p><p>A two-way reopening would mark a shift from an earlier Israeli policy that stated the crossing would open “exclusively for the exit of residents from the Gaza Strip to Egypt”. The policy drew condemnation from regional governments, including Egypt and Qatar as officials warned against the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hope-and-trepidation-over-potential-reopening\">Hope and trepidation over potential reopening</h2><p>Although many Palestinians expressed relief at the thought of the Rafah crossing reopening for medical treatment and education, others fear it will indeed be used to ferry Palestinians permanently out of Gaza under the guise of fulfilling the ceasefire.</p><p>Tasnim Jaras, a student in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera that it was her “dream that the crossing opens so we can continue our education”.</p><p>Moaeen al-Jarousha, who was wounded in the war, said he needed to leave Gaza to receive medical treatment abroad. “I need immediate medical intervention. I live in very difficult conditions,” he said.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said many families see Rafah as “an opportunity to reunite with family members who have been separated for too long”.</p><p>“But hope here is never simple,” he added. “People here have heard about these announcements numerous times, and many recall how quickly it shut again.”</p><p>Although Palestinians hope the crossing will allow for movement both in and out of Gaza, “we know the Israeli military is pushing for Rafah to be just a one-way exit,” Mahmoud said.</p><p>Israel, meanwhile, has kept up its bombardment of Gaza in violation of the ceasefire. On Monday, Israeli forces <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/israel-kills-two-in-gaza-as-palestinians-call-for-rafah-crossing-to-open\">bombed a tent</a> where displaced Palestinians were sheltering, killing a five-year-old girl and her uncle, officials said. Four other people, including children, were wounded.</p><p>The killings brought the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the truce came into effect to at least 422, according to Gaza health authorities.</p></div></div></body></html>"
