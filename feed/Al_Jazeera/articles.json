The new political attack called ‘Atarot’ is planned to be built in the heart of the Palestinian state that will be established alongside Israel. This involves 9,000 housing units that Israel will have to evacuate. Isn’t it a shame?</em></p><p class=\"s3\">The organisation said the far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seizing every moment to bury chances for a future of peace and compromise.</p><p class=\"s3\">“Especially now, when it is clear to everyone that the ideas of ‘managing the conflict’ and ‘decisive victory’ have led to a security disaster for Israel, we must act to resolve the conflict.”</p><p class=\"s3\">The plan’s advancements date back to early 2020, when Israel’s Housing Ministry sent it to the Jerusalem municipality to prepare it for approval. It completed the bureaucratic preparation process within months, but faced objections from the Environmental Protection and Health ministries, according to Peace Now, which said the administration of United States President Barack Obama had also opposed it.</p><p class=\"s3\">It would need further government consideration and approval before being given legal effect and moving towards tender processes to select construction contractors.</p><p class=\"s3\">Most of the plan area is designated as “state land” by Israeli authorities, meaning they would not have to seek permission from Palestinian landowners.</p><p class=\"s3\">Israel has been quickly advancing with several major projects to build illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian territory and pursuing annexation of the occupied West Bank, alongside its <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/17/live-another-gaza-home-caves-in-as-israel-keeps-blocking-shelter-supplies\">genocidal war on Gaza</a> that started in October 2023 and has now killed more than 70,000 people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"s3\">The E1 plan, which would see the construction of thousands of illegal Israeli homes in the occupied West Bank, is hailed by Israeli officials <a href=\"/news/2025/8/15/how-the-world-is-reacting-to-israels-settlement-plan-in-occupied-west-bank\">despite international condemnation</a>.</p><p class=\"s3\">Israel’s security cabinet last week signed off on plans to formalise 19 illegal settlements across the West Bank.</p><h2 id=\"demolitions-and-widespread-arrests\" class=\"s3\">Demolitions and widespread arrests</h2><p class=\"s3\">Israeli forces continue to launch raids across the occupied West Bank and support violent settlers in attacking Palestinian lands while issuing permits to demolish Palestinian homes.</p><p class=\"s3\">Israeli authorities began carrying out demolition operations Wednesday morning in the town of Biddu, located northwest of occupied East Jerusalem, under the pretext that the Palestinian buildings lacked permits.</p><p class=\"s3\">In the central part of the West Bank, settlers, who have been rampaging with impunity often backed by the Israeli military, burned Palestinian vehicles and wrote racist slogans in the village of Ein Yabrud in Ramallah on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"s3\">Several Palestinians were also arrested during raids across the West Bank, including in Nablus.</p><p class=\"s3\">Local authorities said the Israeli military <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/israel-to-demolish-25-homes-in-occupied-west-bank-nur-shams-camp\">plans to demolish 25 residential buildings</a> in the Nur Shams refugee camp this week.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-04T001516Z_402782222_RC2AOHARVXQR_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-NIGERIA-MILITARY-1764197877.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"195\" data-end=\"518\">In early November, United States President Donald Trump declared that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria”. In a series of posts on his Truth Social platform, he accused “radical Islamists” of “mass slaughter” and warned that the US “may very well go into that now disgraced country, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/11/6/why-has-trump-threatened-to-attack-nigeria-guns-a\">guns-a-blazing</a>“.</p><p data-start=\"520\" data-end=\"668\">The claim rested on a familiar assumption: that violence in Nigeria is driven by religious ideology, with Christians targeted by Islamist militants.</p><p data-start=\"670\" data-end=\"1077\">In mid-November, a new wave of school abductions revealed how perilous parts of northern Nigeria have become for children of all faiths. On November 17, armed men raided Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, killing a vice principal and abducting 25 students. The school was state-run, and the victims were Muslim girls. One escaped, and the remaining 24 were later rescued.</p><p data-start=\"1079\" data-end=\"1533\">Days later, in the early hours of November 21, gunmen stormed St Mary’s Catholic Primary and Secondary School in Papiri, Niger State, abducting pupils and teachers. While some captives later escaped or were released, many remained missing into mid-December, leaving families in agonising uncertainty. Parents continue to wait without answers, their desperation and anguish hardening into anger as official assurances fade.</p><p data-start=\"1535\" data-end=\"1795\">Taken together, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/nigeria-school-kidnapping-whos-behind-it-why-were-children-targeted\">these attacks</a> do not reflect a campaign of religious persecution. They follow a pattern that has become increasingly familiar across northern Nigeria: mass kidnapping for ransom, striking opportunistically rather than along religious lines.</p><p data-start=\"1797\" data-end=\"2107\">Trump’s remarks do more than misdiagnose this violence. They reimagine it. With a few lines of incendiary rhetoric, a country grappling with criminal insecurity and institutional collapse is recast as a front line in a civilisational struggle — a place where force, not reform, becomes the implied solution.</p><p data-start=\"2109\" data-end=\"2225\">Once framed that way, Nigeria is no longer a society in need of protection and repair, but a battlefield-in-waiting.</p><p data-start=\"2227\" data-end=\"2448\">That shift matters. When violence is described as religious war rather than organised crime, responsibility moves outwards, solutions become militarised, and foreign intervention begins to sound not reckless but righteous.</p><p data-start=\"2450\" data-end=\"2484\">This pattern is hardly surprising.</p><p data-start=\"2486\" data-end=\"2631\">American power has a habit of transforming complex foreign crises into apocalyptic moral dramas, and then acting on the story it has told itself.</p><p data-start=\"2633\" data-end=\"2972\">Nonetheless, Nigerian church leaders, who know the terrain and the people intimately, reject Washington’s narrative. The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Matthew Kukah, a leading figure in Nigeria’s peacebuilding efforts, for example, <a href=\"https://www.aciafrica.org/news/18981/nigerian-foundation-defends-catholic-bishop-after-remarks-on-genocide-targeting-christians?utm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cautioned</a> against interpreting the violence as religious warfare, pointing instead to criminal motives and state failure.</p><p data-start=\"2974\" data-end=\"3126\">Analysts concurred, emphasising that attacks fall on Christians and Muslims alike and often follow patterns of banditry and ransom rather than theology.</p><p data-start=\"3128\" data-end=\"3439\">In Kebbi State, the victims were Muslim schoolgirls taken from a state-run boarding school. In Niger State, the targets were pupils and teachers at a Catholic mission school. Across Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, Kaduna, Niger and Plateau states, villages have been raided, farms abandoned and populations displaced.</p><p data-start=\"3441\" data-end=\"3539\">This violence is driven primarily by profit-driven criminal violence rather than religious belief.</p><p data-start=\"3541\" data-end=\"3726\">Chronic poverty, rural neglect and youth unemployment — with about 72 percent of rural Nigerians living in multidimensional poverty — fuel recruitment into criminal and armed networks.</p><p data-start=\"3728\" data-end=\"4067\">True to Bishop Kukah’s analysis, ideology accounts for far less of this violence than predatory criminal behaviour and opportunism. What flourishes instead is organised crime in areas where the state barely functions. The principal threat now stems from armed “bandit” networks rather than a single ideologically driven insurgent movement.</p><p data-start=\"4069\" data-end=\"4328\">These criminal militias kidnap schoolchildren and commuters for ransom, rustle cattle, extort villages, attack highways and, according to multiple reports, increasingly tap into illegal mining economies, often operating from forest bases across the northwest.</p><p data-start=\"4330\" data-end=\"4665\">At the same time, Nigeria is not confronting one armed threat but several. Across the northeast, Boko Haram and the ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in West Africa Province (ISWAP) remain active. In the northwest and north-central regions, armed bandit networks dominate. Further south, in the middle belt, militia violence feeds on land disputes and communal tensions.</p><p data-start=\"4667\" data-end=\"4748\">The outcome has been mass displacement and civilian death on a devastating scale.</p><p data-start=\"4750\" data-end=\"5211\">Amnesty International estimates that more than 10,000 civilians were killed in armed attacks in the two years after May 29, 2023, when President Bola Tinubu took office. Hundreds of villages have been destroyed or emptied. Thousands of children have abandoned school. In parts of the northwest, attacks are reported to occur weekly and, at times, even daily. More disturbingly, kidnapping now reaches highways and commuter routes in and around the capital, Abuja.</p><p data-start=\"5213\" data-end=\"5312\">To treat this catastrophe as religious persecution is not just inaccurate but profoundly dangerous. This false framing transforms organised crime and state collapse into a myth of religious war, one that obscures causes and invites disastrous cures.</p><p data-start=\"5465\" data-end=\"5529\">That is why language matters: it shapes intent and consequences.</p><p data-start=\"5531\" data-end=\"5731\">When Washington defines domestic collapse as moral failure, Nigeria ceases to be seen as a country in need of reconstruction and starts to look like an international threat to be managed from outside.</p><p data-start=\"5733\" data-end=\"5866\">Global attention shifts from strengthening local institutions towards employing financial leverage, coercive tools and military force.</p><p data-start=\"5868\" data-end=\"5917\">Communities become talking points in US politics.</p><p data-start=\"5919\" data-end=\"6145\">In the process, Nigerian citizens are reduced to abstractions rather than treated as living human beings with rights, and localities like Kebbi and Niger are recast as conflict zones instead of places in need of urgent repair.</p><p data-start=\"6147\" data-end=\"6216\">When powerful states define a crisis, they begin shaping the outcome.</p><p data-start=\"6218\" data-end=\"6248\">History offers no reassurance.</p><p data-start=\"6250\" data-end=\"6399\">From Iraq to Libya, US-led interventions have ushered in untold devastation, leaving in their wake public institutions in ruins and wars without end.</p><p data-start=\"6401\" data-end=\"6465\">Crucially, every military campaign promised peace and stability. Over time, every mission has killed thousands of civilians and left entire countries in ruins.</p><p data-start=\"6561\" data-end=\"6772\">If US forces entered Nigeria, even in small numbers, foreign troops would quickly become magnets for attack and targets for retaliation, turning villages and forest communities into potential battlefields.</p><p data-start=\"6774\" data-end=\"6915\">Communities would be squeezed between bandits and foreign firepower, as criminal networks splinter, rebrand and adapt to the new battlefield.</p><p data-start=\"6917\" data-end=\"7021\">This is the architecture of the US’s war cycle: an excuse first, force second, and civilian lives last.</p><p data-start=\"7023\" data-end=\"7242\">Nigeria should not assume immunity from this great power logic, as countries do not become warzones overnight. They are first described as failures, then reframed as threats, before being treated as acceptable targets.</p><p data-start=\"7244\" data-end=\"7292\">Nigeria’s institutional weakness is no accident. It is rooted in years of protecting assets instead of people, while neglecting policing, justice and basic services.</p><p data-start=\"7412\" data-end=\"7684\">Colonial and post-colonial rule built systems for natural resource extraction rather than citizen protection. For many decades, often under military rule, securing oil revenue and political control mattered more than effective governance, public welfare or human security.</p><p data-start=\"7686\" data-end=\"7847\">In the Niger Delta, this approach has meant environmental ruin, loss of livelihoods and institutional neglect — the true cost of protecting wealth before people.</p><p data-start=\"7849\" data-end=\"8008\">Today, that systemic design persists: the state still defends assets more effectively than lives, while inequality and neglect have deepened civilian exposure.</p><p data-start=\"8010\" data-end=\"8045\">Even so, Nigeria still has options.</p><p data-start=\"8047\" data-end=\"8353\">In late November, Tinubu declared a nationwide security emergency, ordered the recruitment of 20,000 additional police officers as part of a broader expansion plan, redeployed VIP escorts to front-line duties, and authorised the deployment and expansion of DSS forest guards to hunt bandits and rebels.</p><p data-start=\"8355\" data-end=\"8460\">Whether these moves produce results depends not on announcements but on enforcement and extensive reform.</p><p data-start=\"8462\" data-end=\"8627\">Police and intelligence services must be strengthened and reoriented towards community protection, with proper oversight and resourcing, not merely expanded on paper.</p><p data-start=\"8629\" data-end=\"8806\">Only about 15 percent of Nigerians say they trust the police, while many view officers as corrupt or violent, leaving communities fearful of both criminals and law enforcement.</p><p data-start=\"8808\" data-end=\"8953\">Courts and financial regulators need the capacity to dismantle ransom and extortion networks as business systems, not only to chase their gunmen.</p><p data-start=\"8955\" data-end=\"9156\">Regionally, Nigeria must push for serious cooperation on intelligence sharing, border control and joint operations, or armed groups will continue to move freely across borders with near-total impunity.</p><p data-start=\"9158\" data-end=\"9215\">From Washington, Nigeria does not need troops or threats.</p><p data-start=\"9217\" data-end=\"9429\">It requires support to rebuild the institutions that keep citizens safe: forensic capacity, actionable intelligence, training and diplomatic backing that strengthens Nigerian sovereignty instead of overriding it.</p><p data-start=\"9431\" data-end=\"9609\">With about 61 percent of Nigerians reporting that they have felt unsafe in their communities in recent years, this must be a national wake-up call for Nigeria’s political class.</p><p data-start=\"9611\" data-end=\"9712\">Only a comprehensive solution can deliver peace and protect besieged communities in northern Nigeria.</p><p data-start=\"9714\" data-end=\"9769\">Trump must de-escalate. Tinubu must act decisively.</p><p data-start=\"9771\" data-end=\"9918\">What will determine Nigeria’s future is not foreign firepower, but whether its institutions are rebuilt to protect citizens rather than assets.</p><p data-start=\"9771\" data-end=\"9918\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he was “alarmed by the further intensification in hostilities” and warned that targeting medical facilities violates international humanitarian law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Six Bangladeshi peacekeepers serving with the UN mission were killed when drones hit their base in Kadugli, South Kordofan’s capital, on December 13. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned what he termed “horrific drone attacks”, noting that attacks on peacekeepers “may constitute war crimes under international law”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">A day later, Dilling Military Hospital came under fire, with casualty figures varying. The Sudan Doctors Network reported nine deaths and 17 injuries, calling it “systematic targeting of health institutions”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">UN officials said six people were killed and 12 wounded, many of them medical staff.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) has blamed the RSF for the attacks, though the paramilitary group has not responded to the accusations.</p><h2 id=\"epidemics-on-the-rise\">Epidemics on the rise</h2><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The violence has created severe humanitarian consequences beyond the immediate death toll. North Kordofan’s Health Minister Iman Malik reported that the state has recorded 13,609 cholera cases and 730 dengue fever infections, with 30 percent of health facilities no longer functioning due to the conflict.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">More than 40,000 people have fled North Kordofan, while civilians remain trapped in besieged cities, including Kadugli and Dilling.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">In nearby Heglig, which the RSF captured before handing it to South Sudan’s army under a tripartite agreement with the army, nearly 2,000 people were displaced to White Nile state.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The fighting in Kordofan represents a significant expansion of the conflict following the RSF’s October seizure of el-Fasher, the army’s last stronghold in Darfur. Researchers at Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/yale-report-unveils-rsf-attempt-to-cover-up-sudan-atrocities-mass-burials\">found</a> in a new report that the RSF killed civilians attempting to flee the city, then systematically began destroying evidence by burying, burning and removing bodies.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The escalation comes as international efforts to broker peace have restarted. SAF chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on December 15, expressing readiness to work with United States President Donald Trump on peace efforts.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The following day, Egypt and the US jointly rejected “any attempts to divide Sudan” and called for a comprehensive ceasefire.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Sudan has topped the International Rescue Committee’s Emergency Watchlist for three consecutive years. The war, which began in April 2023, has killed more than 40,000 people according to UN figures, though aid groups believe the true toll is far higher. More than 14 million people have been displaced in what the UN calls the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The exercise will be repeated in the remaining states in phases.</p><p>According to a handbook for BLOs on the ECI’s website, their responsibilities range from doing house visits to identifying existing and dead voters, collecting their photos and other relevant documents, and uploading them on a designated portal. The BLOs, who are mostly government teachers or junior officials, have complained of their immense work pressure. A single mistake means the entire process of filling out the forms and uploading them has to be done again.</p><p>A report last week by the Spect Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank, said at least 33 BLOs have died across India since November 4, at least nine of whom took their own lives and left desperate accounts of their work pressure in their suicide notes.</p><p>Vijay did not die by suicide. He collapsed on November 14 while completing SIR work late at night at his home in Lucknow’s Sarava village, and was rushed to hospital. He died of a brain haemorrhage 10 days later.</p><p>“Since he had joined the BLO duty, his phone continuously rang. We saw him working from morning till late night,” Vijay’s sister-in-law, Shashi Verma, told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4178017\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4178017\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4178017\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1708-1765895718.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"India BLO deaths\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4178017\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A photo of Vijay Kumar Verma, a booth-level officer who died of a brain haemorrhage, at his home near Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh [Sumaiya Ali/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Harshit, 20, said he had read text messages sent by district officials to his father, repeatedly telling him to do more work or “face consequences”.</p><p>“Quickly complete 200 forms. If it’s less than that, you will be charged,” he recalled one of the messages as saying.</p><p>“We have received no support from the government,” Harshit told Al Jazeera, as he stood with his mother, Sangeeta Rawat, outside the Lucknow offices of the Samajwadi Party, an opposition party supporting their protest.</p><p>“The senior district magistrate visited us after my father’s death, but only paid condolences and told me to focus on my studies,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"barely-two-hours-of-sleep-every-day\">‘Barely two hours of sleep every day’</h2><p>Al Jazeera spoke to two other BLOs in Lucknow who refused to reveal their identities over fears it could invite the wrath of the government and jeopardise their jobs.</p><p>“I have been functioning with barely two hours of sleep every day. On many days, I didn’t even sleep at all,” said a 45-year-old BLO who works as a teacher at a government school in Lucknow.</p><p>Another BLO, also a teacher at a village school in the same district, said her phone numbers have been made public and her devices now ring at odd hours. “People call me late at night and ask me to correct their details or find if their name is in another list,” she said.</p><p>The BLO said that most people in villages do not keep an electronic version of their documents, unlike residents in cities. “Quite often, when we visit these villagers to collect their details, they would take a long time going through their trunks or cupboards to find their papers. It is a common problem.”</p><p>She said BLOs return to their homes in the evening after a long day of work and continue to upload forms online until late into the night. “Quite often, the server does not work, and I upload forms at 4 in the morning to avoid this issue,” the 35-year-old said.</p><p>“I would get worried that my mobile phone’s battery will run out, so I would always keep plugging it in to charge whenever possible,” she added.</p><p>The BLOs’ biggest concern, she said, was to complete their work within the one-month deadline given by the ECI, a process for which she said they were not given proper training.</p><p>“It was just a two- [to] three-hour briefing in which we were told how to collect and upload data. That’s it,” the BLO in rural Lucknow said.</p><p>In Uttar Pradesh, the deadline to finish the SIR process has been extended twice: first to December 11, and then to December 26. The exercise ended in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat states on December 14, and will end in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, and Andaman and Nicobar on December 18.</p><h2 id=\"controversial-exercise\">Controversial exercise</h2><p>The eastern state of Bihar was the first to go through a revision of its electoral rolls this year, after a gap of more than two decades. In July, the SIR was launched in Bihar before its <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/bihar-2025-election-result-who-won-who-lost-why-it-matters\">legislative assembly elections</a> in November, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged for the first time as the single largest party.</p><p>In the run-up to the polls, Bihar’s opposition parties had demanded a rollback of the SIR, accusing the ECI of rushing through a mammoth electoral exercise that could render vast numbers of citizens unable to vote. In September, the ECI published its final voter list for Bihar, removing 4.7 million names from the rolls.</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/2025/10/8/muslims-in-indias-poll-bound-bihar-battle-bangladeshi-infiltrator-tag\">Seemanchal, a Muslim-majority region</a> in Bihar’s northeast, voter removals exceeded the state average, prompting allegations by opposition parties and Muslim groups that the ECI was especially targeting Muslim voters, who generally do not vote for the BJP, for removal.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The BJP’s thumping win in Bihar triggered accusations by the losing coalition of a “vote chori” (“chori” means stealing in Hindi). Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress party, last month called the SIR “a sinister plan of the Election Commission to destroy democracy”.</p><p>In response, Union Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah said in a speech in parliament that the real “vote chori” happened under Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi’s great-grandfather and grandmother who were also former Indian prime ministers.</p><p>As the political debate over the electoral exercise ramped up, it continued to destroy lives. In Bihar, at least two BLOs died during the revision of the electoral rolls.</p><p>On November 9, five days after the SIR was announced in a dozen other Indian states and federal territories, Namita Hansda, a 50-year-old rural health worker, died of a stroke while she was on duty in West Bengal’s East Burdwan district. Her husband, Madhab Hansda, blamed the SIR workload for her sudden death.</p><p>On November 22, Rinku Tarafdar, a 53-year-old biology teacher recruited as a BLO, was found dead at her residence in Nadia district of West Bengal.</p><p>In her two-page suicide note, Tarafdar blamed the ECI. “I do not support any political party, but I cannot handle this inhumane pressure anymore”, she wrote, adding that she was threatened with an “administrative process” if she failed to do the required work.</p><p>At least four BLOs died during the SIR in West Bengal. On Monday, the ECI published a draft voter list for the state, which removed about 5.8 million people. The deleted names were marked as absent, shifted, dead or duplicate voters.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4178022\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4178022\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4178022\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1727-1765895736.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"India BLO deaths\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4178022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sangeeta Rawat, the wife of Vijay Kumar Verma, talks to reporters in Lucknow after her husband’s death while he was working on the SIR [Sumaiya Ali/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"barely-ate-or-slept\">‘Barely ate or slept’</h2><p>Anuj Garg worked as a teacher in a government school in Dholpur city in the western state of Rajasthan. On the night of November 30, he fell to the ground while working at his laptop at his home and died of cardiac arrest. He was 44 and had two children.</p><p>“He asked for tea at around 1am, but by the time it came, we had lost him,” his sister, Anjana Garg, told Al Jazeera. “In the last month, he barely ate or slept. We only saw him working without a break.”</p><p>Anuj had previously worked as a BLO. But Anjana said the pressure this year was extraordinary. Despite working around the clock, he had received notices from his supervisors warning him to meet his targets, she said, adding that the death by suicide of another BLO in the state had added to his stress.</p><p>On the night of December 1, Sarvesh Singh, a 46-year-old BLO in Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad district, died by suicide while his wife and four daughters were sleeping in another room. Singh left a note and a final video, purportedly recorded by his wife.</p><p>“I failed in this election,” he said in the video, adding that he was losing his mental stability due to a lack of sleep and excessive pressure. In the note, he wrote: “I used to work day and night, but still could not finish my target.”</p><p>The ECI has rejected accusations of workloads leading to the deaths of dozens of BLOs across the country.</p><p>“The SIR work is very normal. It is not that the BLOs are doing it for the first time,” ECI spokesman Apurva Kumar Singh told Al Jazeera, calling the deaths unfortunate. He said the work was “not overburdening at all”, adding that the ECI was taking required action, without specifying what that action is.</p><p>The commission recently doubled the compensation for BLOs to 1,000 rupees ($11) in addition to their salaries, and announced an incentive of 6,000 rupees ($66) upon the completion of an election cycle.</p><p>Sapan Mondal, the general secretary of the Kolkata-based Election Staff and Booth Level Officer Forum, said the Election Commission provided no training to the BLOs before pushing them into the enormous exercise.</p><p>“When the BLO duty was assigned, nothing was provided, not even devices or data entry operators to help those who don’t know how to work online,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>As criticism mounted, the ECI on December 1 posted a video on its X account showing a group of BLOs dancing to “relieve their stress”.</p><p></p><p>The video added to the outrage. Social media users called the commission’s move insensitive. The ECI has not officially responded to the criticism.</p><p>Meanwhile, petitions have been filed in several courts against the SIR by opposition politicians, victims’ families and the Association for Democratic Reforms, a prominent watchdog on India’s election processes.</p><p>Many affected families said they have been waiting for government support after losing their loved ones, who were often their sole breadwinners.</p><p>“We want the money we spent on our father’s untimely death, and a government job for me. Are we asking for a lot?” Harshit asked as he held a 200,000-rupee ($2,200) cheque given to his family by the opposition Samajwadi Party.</p><p><em>If you or someone you know is at risk of suicide, these <a href=\"https://findahelpline.com/i/iasp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">organisations</a> may be able to help. In India, New Delhi-based Sumaitri (+91-11-23389090) and Chennai-based Sneha Foundation (+91-44-24640050) are important helplines.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"
