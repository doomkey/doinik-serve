PolitiFact, however, did not find any <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/how-donald-trump-shifted-on-releasing-the-jeffrey-epstein-files\">proof</a> that he met Epstein that day.</p><p>There are different accounts of when Trump and Epstein had their falling out, with <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/how-well-did-trump-and-epstein-really-know-each-other-a-timeline\">periods</a> ranging from 2004 to 2007. The Miami Herald reported that Trump barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in October 2007, a decade before the Thanksgiving Day in question.</p><p>In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from a minor.</p><p>Two of the three people Epstein mentioned in his 2017 email as being “down there” are people who had property in South Florida at the time. It is unclear who he was referring to when he mentioned “Hanson”. It is possible Epstein was not foretelling a specific Thanksgiving Day plan but answering another New Yorker’s question about who among the people in their social circle would also be in the Florida area during that period.</p><p>Trump arrived in West Palm Beach, Florida, on November 21, 2017, and stayed there for several days, according to the president’s public schedules documented in Roll Call’s FactBase.</p><p>On Thanksgiving morning, he spoke to members of the military via video conference and visited coastguard members at the Lake Worth Inlet Station in Riviera Beach, Florida. The White House published transcripts of Trump’s remarks to both groups. Trump also issued a Thanksgiving message to the country and went to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.</p><p>Photographers for The Associated Press news agency, The Palm Beach Post and Getty Images, among others, captured photos of Trump’s activities.</p><p>A CNN report said Trump held an “opulent” dinner at the Mar-a-Lago members-only club. PolitiFact did not find reports listing who was in attendance, but the White House told CNN the first family would be having “a nice Thanksgiving dinner with all the family”.</p><p>Trump was also active on social media. In a November 22, 2017, post on X, then known as Twitter, he said he “will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida [Mar-a-Lago]”. He did not specify whom he would be meeting. On Thanksgiving morning, he said in part: “HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well.”</p><p></p><p>Trump left Mar-a-Lago and returned to the White House on November 26, 2017, the Sunday after Thanksgiving.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He described the way news of the plan had emerged as a “Russian information operation rather than the basis of reality, which Western media has willingly bought into yet again” in an interview with Al Jazeera.</p><p>In a response to a post on X with the link to the Axios story, Witkoff said on Wednesday: “He must have got this from K.” He did not explicitly confirm or deny the existence of the 28-point plan.</p><p>The post, which Witkoff may have “thought was a direct message” to someone else, Giles said, has since been deleted.</p><p>Giles said that “K” could refer either to Putin ally and head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill Dmitriev; or Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>The Financial Times report names Dmitriev as one of the “architects” of the new proposal.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4119668\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4119668\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4119668\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-20T094123Z_251138549_RC280IAG6SYG_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-TERNOPIL-1763641994.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ternopil\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4119668\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students preparing to be firefighters gather in front of an apartment building that was hit on Wednesday by a Russian missile in Ternopil, Ukraine, November 20, 2025 [Thomas Peter/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"us-and-ukrainian-officials-said\">What have US and Ukrainian officials said?</h2><p>The White House has declined to comment on the matter.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X that the US “will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict”.</p><p>Rubio added: “Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas. And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions.”</p><p>Zelenskyy, who was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/ukraines-zelenskyy-headed-to-turkiye-in-bid-to-resuscitate-peace-talks\">holding talks in Turkiye</a> with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday, has also not commented on the alleged proposal.</p><p>“The main thing for stopping the bloodshed and achieving lasting peace is that we work in coordination with all our partners and that American leadership remains effective, strong,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram after his meeting with Erdogan in Ankara.</p><p>Zelenskyy said that only the US and Trump “have sufficient strength for the war to finally come to an end”.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-been-reported-about-the-terms-of-the-plan\">What has been reported about the terms of the plan?</h2><p>According to Axios, the plan spans 28 specific but unknown points. Overall, it would give Russia full control over both Crimea in the south – which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014 but which remains in dispute – and the Donbas region, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>In Donbas, Russia currently controls all of Luhansk and most of Donetsk. According to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas region including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.</p><p>Ukraine would be required to withdraw its troops from the Donbas altogether, and it would become a demilitarised zone, with Russia also unable to place its troops there.</p><p>Axios quoted an unnamed Ukrainian official saying the plan also imposes longer-term limits on the size of Ukraine’s military and its possession of long‑range missiles.</p><p>In addition to Crimea and the majority of the Donbas region, Russia also now controls 75 percent of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/russia-gains-ground-in-zaporizhzhia-in-southeastern-ukraine\">Zaporizhia</a> and <a href=\"/features/2025/9/15/russian-occupiers-brought-death-and-intimidation-to-kherson-ukrainian-teen\">Kherson</a> in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea. According to the plan, the existing battle lines in these two areas would be frozen in place. The return of any of this territory to Ukraine would be subject to later negotiations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"would-this-plan-be-good-for-ukraine\">Would this plan be good for Ukraine?</h2><p>Analysts said, on face value, this plan does not favour Ukraine at all. “If the plan, as has been suggested to media were implemented, this would leave Ukraine defenceless against the next Russian attack,” Giles said.</p><p>He added that a reduction in the size of its army and limitations on its long-range weapons would leave Ukraine too vulnerable. He described the plan as “catastrophic to European security”.</p><p>“It seems that Ukrainian armed forces will have to be reduced by 2.5 times [reduced by 60 percent] of its size – that means Ukraine cannot have more than 400,000 personnel,” Marina Miron, a postdoctoral researcher at the defence studies department at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera, based on what she has read about the plan. “It also says Ukraine shouldn’t have any long-range capabilities that would be able to strike Russia. Then the territories under Russian control would be officially recognised as well as Crimea.”</p><p>“This plan seems to obviously favour Russia, and it is interesting to see whether the United States can exert enough leverage on Ukraine and on Zelenskyy to accept this plan,” Miron said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109941\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109941\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109941\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1763294067.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1763294067\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109941\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><figure id=\"attachment_4109937\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109937\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109937\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-EASTERN-UKRAINE-copy-1763294058.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN EASTERN UKRAINE copy-1763294058\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-s-position-changed-over-time\">How has Trump’s position changed over time?</h2><p>Trump has flip-flopped on the issue of Ukraine ceding land to Russia several times this year.</p><p>Late last month, Trump suggested <a href=\"/news/2025/10/20/trump-calls-on-russia-and-ukraine-to-freeze-war-at-current-battle-lines\">freezing the war</a> in Ukraine at its current battle lines.</p><p>“You leave it the way it is right now. They can … negotiate something later on down the line,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One in October. This plan was rejected by Russia, which has made clear it is determined to achieve its war goal of the withdrawal of Ukraine’s military from the eastern regions that Moscow lays claim to.</p><p>Ukraine and its European allies <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/trump-wants-to-freeze-russia-ukraine-war-who-gets-what-if-that-happens\">supported this plan</a> at the time. “The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,” they said in a joint statement. This marked a shift for Ukraine, which had previously insisted on reclaiming all of its land.</p><p>It was also a change in stance by Trump, who on September 23, said Ukraine could <a href=\"/news/2025/9/23/in-major-shift-trump-says-ukraine-can-win-back-all-territory-from-russia\">win back all its territory</a> captured by Russia since the beginning of the <a href=\"/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/\">war</a> with help from the European Union and NATO.</p><p>“With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform back then.</p><p>Before that, on August 11, Trump said both Russia and Ukraine would have to cede territory to end the war. He told reporters that Russia had taken some of Ukraine’s “very prime territory” and “we’re going to try to get some of that territory back”. At this point, Zelenskyy rejected the idea of conceding any land.</p><p>In February this year, Trump met with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy during this meeting for not being “grateful” enough for American support in the war so far.</p><p>Trump indicated that ending the war would require Ukraine to give up some territory, telling Zelenskyy: “You should be grateful. You’re not in a strong position – you’re trapped there, your people are dying, and you’re running out of soldiers.”</p><p>On the campaign trail ahead of the US election last year, Trump promised to end the Ukraine war in the first 24 hours of his presidency. Trump was inaugurated in late January this year, and about 11 months later, all his attempts at peace talks have been unsuccessful.</p><p>The war in Ukraine has been dragging on since February 2022. On Wednesday, a Russian <a href=\"/gallery/2025/11/20/russian-air-strikes-kill-26-in-devastating-attack-on-ukraines-ternopil\">aerial attack on Ternopil</a> in western Ukraine killed at least 26 people and injured several others, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>Miron said she believes that if this plan is presented, Ukraine and Europe will reject it due to its heavy favouring of Russia.</p><p>“We will get into another cycle of rewriting the plan, and Ukraine and Europe will have their own demands. Allegedly, Zelenskyy had a plan of his own in Turkiye which was put together with his European allies,” Miron said.</p><p>If the reports about the plan are true, the plan will likely set off a “diplomatic game”, she added.</p><p>“If Ukrainians and Europeans reject the plan, then Trump can always say, ‘Well, we came with a plan to you and you rejected it. And so you are in the way to achieve a lasting peace’.”</p><p>Miron added: “The Europeans plus Ukraine and the Russians have been playing this game, each of them kind of presenting something that they know the other side will reject. So then the ball will be in Europe’s and Ukraine’s court.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Yet even at this pivotal moment, one major highway is still missing from that roadmap that could undermine the progress made in Brazil: the carbon emissions of the military.</p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, governments are not required to report their militaries’ emissions, and most simply don’t. Recent analysis by the<a href=\"https://militaryemissions.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Military Emissions Gap</a> project shows that what little data exists is patchy, inconsistent or missing entirely. This “military emissions gap” is the gulf between what governments disclose and the true scale of military pollution. The result is stark: militaries remain largely invisible in the Belem negotiations, creating a dangerous blind spot in global climate action.</p><p>The size of that blind spot is staggering. Militaries account for an estimated 5.5 percent of global emissions. This share is set to rise further as defence spending surges while the rest of society decarbonises. If militaries were a country, they would be the fifth-largest emitter on Earth, ahead of Russia with 5 percent. Yet only five countries follow the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) voluntary reporting guidelines for military emissions, and those cover fuel use alone. The reality is far broader: munitions production and disposal, waste management and fugitive emissions from refrigeration, air-conditioning, radar and electrical equipment are left out. And operations in international waters and airspace are not reported at all, leaving massive gaps in both climate accountability and action.</p><p>The military emissions gap widens further still when we consider the climate impact of armed conflicts. As if the horror and human suffering from fighting wars were not enough, wars also destroy ecosystems, leave a toxic legacy on lands for decades to follow, and result in significant CO2 emissions, including from the rebuilding following the destruction of buildings and infrastructure. But without any internationally agreed framework to measure conflict emissions, these additional emissions risk going unreported, meaning that we don’t know how much wars are setting back climate action.</p><p>But despite this, momentum for accountability is finally building. Nearly 100 organisations have signed the<a href=\"https://www.thewaronclimate.org/cop\"> War on Climate initiative’s pledges</a> ahead of COP30, and protesters and civil society groups in Belem are demanding the UNFCCC confront this long-ignored source of pollution. Policymakers are starting to shift, too. The European Union has taken steps towards more transparent reporting and decarbonisation in the defence sector, though this progress is now threatened by rapid rearmament. Combined with NATO’s new target for members to spend 5 percent of gross domestic product on militaries, these pledges could produce up to 200 million tonnes of CO2 and trigger as much as $298bn in climate damages annually, putting Europe’s own climate goals at risk.</p><p>International law reinforces the urgency and demand for accountability. <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/case/187\">The International Court of Justice’s </a>recent landmark advisory opinion reminded states that they are obliged under climate treaties to assess, report and mitigate harms, including those caused by armed conflict and military activity. Ignoring these emissions doesn’t just undercount global warming; it masks the scale of the crisis and weakens the world’s ability to tackle its root causes.</p><p>The gap between current emission-reduction plans and what is needed to stay below the 1.5C limit remains catastrophic. If COP30 negotiators agree on a roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels, what happens next will determine whether it delivers real progress or remains symbolic. No sector can be exempt from climate action, and military emissions cannot continue to remain hidden.</p><p>Mandatory reporting of all military emissions to the UNFCCC – from combat and training activities to the long-lasting climate damage inflicted on communities – is essential.  That data must form the baseline for urgent, science-aligned reductions, embedded in national climate plans, and consistent with the 1.5C limit.</p><p>Security cannot come at the cost of the climate. Tackling climate change is now essential to our collective safety and the survival of our planet.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the EU should stop sending money to Ukraine in seeming reference to an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/ukraine-suspends-justice-minister-for-alleged-link-to-100m-corruption-case\">ongoing corruption probe</a> involving an alleged $100m energy kickback scheme.</p><p>Last week, Ukraine’s Justice Minister German Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk submitted their resignations as anticorruption authorities said they had detained five people suspected of an alleged plot to control procurement at nuclear agency Energoatom.</p><p class=\"p1\">“There’s a war mafia, a corrupt system working in Ukraine, and then the European Commission president … instead of stopping the payments and demanding for immediate financial clearance, she wants to send another 100 billion to Ukraine. That is insane,” Szijjarto said.</p><p>Hungary’s right-wing populist leader Victor Orban, who counts Russian Putin as an ally, has been <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/ukraines-zelenskyy-calls-on-hungarys-orban-to-stop-blocking-eu-bid\">blocking Ukraine’s EU bid,</a> received an <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/hungarian-leader-viktor-orban-to-meet-us-president-donald-trump\">exemption</a> on Russian energy sanctions from Trump and a “<a href=\"/economy/2025/11/9/hungarian-leader-orban-says-he-secured-financial-shield-from-trump\">financial shield</a>” to safeguard its economy in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The time is not on the side of Ukraine. It is an illusion to say that the time is on the side of Ukraine,” Szijjarto said, adding that he would support Trump’s peace initiatives.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was designed to silence and intimidate any possible opposition.</p><p>The number of victims who were summarily executed is estimated at 130,000 to 200,000.</p><p>In the half-century since Franco's demise, exhumations have been slow and beset by logistical, financial and legal challenges. There are an estimated 6,000 unmarked mass graves dotted around the country, including everywhere from wells and woodlands to gardens, cemeteries and remote hillsides.</p><p>But as Spain remembers the era's victims and analyses exhumation efforts, it is grappling with the steady recent rise of a far-right party, Vox, and nostalgia for the ideals of the dictatorship among young people who did not endure it.</p><p>A recent CIS poll suggested that 20 percent of those aged 18 to 24 believed the dictatorship was \"good\" or \"very good\".</p><p>According to secondary schoolteachers, social media is driving pro-Franco support among teenagers.</p><p>“They talk like they are really in favour of the dictatorship and of obligatory military service as well,” Jose Garcia Vico, a secondary school economics teacher in Andalusia, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The majority of the teachers I know are very worried because even if we’ve explained the difference between dictatorship and democracy, the students are so overrun with content from TikTok and they’re so p***** off with the world in general, they don’t know what they want.”</p><p>“The content they get from the hard-right parties on social media aimed at adolescents is considerable, and it has a lot of effect on how they relate to each other.”</p><p>While emphasising “not everybody in the class” is attracted to the far right, Garcia Vico points to a parallel sharp rise in Islamophobic and anti-transgender comments.</p><p>“Above all, it’s the boys who feel superior to the rest. But it’s a problem which involves some of the parents as well. A couple of years ago, some parents told me that it was OK that their child had interrupted me by shouting, 'Viva Franco!’ ['Long Live Franco!'] because that was freedom of expression.”</p><p>Hundreds of kilometres north in the capital, Madrid, Sebastian Reyes Turner, a 27-year-old teacher, said he has also noticed the impact of hard-right social media influencers.</p><p>“In schools, people only see Franco’s dictatorship as one of several topics to mindlessly memorise to pass a history exam they don’t really care about to begin with.</p><p>“On the other hand, details are cherry-picked by the far right to make them think it was a better time in which they didn’t face problems like they do today - like how hard it is to find jobs even if they’ve been studying well into their 20s or the housing crisis.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
