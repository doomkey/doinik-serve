This is what you could expect when salaries went unpaid,” Mbappe’s lawyer Frederique Cassereau told reporters.</p><p>The court found PSG had failed to pay three months of Mbappe’s salary, an ethics bonus and a signing bonus due under his employment contract.</p><p>Those sums were recognised as due by two decisions of the French Professional Football League in September and October 2024, and the judges said PSG had not produced any written agreement showing Mbappe had waived his entitlement.</p><p>The judges rejected PSG’s arguments that Mbappe should forfeit his unpaid wages entirely but also dismissed several of the player’s additional claims, including allegations of concealed work, moral harassment and breach of the employer’s duty of safety.</p><p>The court did not view Mbappe’s fixed-term contract as a permanent one, a decision that limited the scale of potential compensation related to dismissal and notice pay.</p><h2 id=\"labour-law-applies-to-everyone\">‘Labour law applies to everyone’</h2><p>“This judgment confirms that commitments entered into must be honoured. It restores a simple truth: even in the professional football industry, labour law applies to everyone,” Mbappe’s legal team said in a statement.</p><p>“Mr. Mbappe, for his part, scrupulously respected his sporting and contractual obligations for seven years, right up to the final day.”</p><p>PSG had argued that Mbappe acted disloyally by concealing for nearly a year his intention not to renew his contract, preventing the club from securing a transfer fee similar to the 180 million euros ($212m) they paid to sign him from AS Monaco in 2017.</p><p>Mbappe’s representatives said the dispute concerned the strict application of French labour law and unpaid remuneration rather than transfer policy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

On the afternoon of August 11, they walked past a riot squad on the streets of Minsk when helmeted officers suddenly jumped out of a bush. The pair said they were thrown to the ground and hauled off in a van, where they were beaten en route to a detention centre.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>At the detention centre, they were beaten again and forced to kneel in stress positions, they said. Eventually, they were released without charge after the Russian embassy intervened.</p><p>So after all they had endured together, Vazhenkov was shocked to hear Rogov had been arrested in Poland for espionage.</p><p>“When I read the posts of some of our acquaintances, who write ‘I knew everything as soon as I saw him,’ this is, of course, complete b******t,” Vazhenkov told Al Jazeera from Germany. “I had a pleasant impression [of Igor], so I was shocked, surprised and upset with these thoughts.”</p><p>According to an indictment seen by The Guardian, 30-year-old Rogov has admitted to Polish investigators that he had been working for Russian intelligence for years. He has also been accused of involvement in a plot to detonate incendiary devices across Europe.</p><p>The first hearing in the case was held on December 8. If found guilty, he would be the first known Kremlin asset within the opposition movement granted shelter in Europe.</p><p>His case comes at a sensitive time, as Europe suffers a wave of sabotage, arson attacks, drone incursions and other forms of <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/europe-lacks-coordination-as-russia-prepares-for-war-with-nato-experts\">hybrid warfare</a> blamed on Russia, while Russian passport holders fall under heightened suspicion.</p><p>But neither the Rogov case, nor the apparent dangers of allowing Russians into Europe, are straightforward.</p><h2 id=\"i-am-very-sceptical\">‘I am very sceptical’</h2><p>Rogov was born and raised in Saransk, a city 630 kilometres (390 miles) east of Moscow. There, he spent some time working at the regional headquarters of the late opposition leader Alexey Navalny, before becoming a local coordinator for Open Russia.</p><p>“He was a nice, sociable, kind-hearted young man,” Vazhenkov recounted.</p><p>“He liked to hang out, to go for a walk, to drink, and so on. He didn’t seem to have any distrust or antipathy towards me.”</p><p>After the Minsk incident, Rogov ran for office in his hometown. After that political bid failed, he applied for a computer science scholarship in Poland. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent suppression of dissent that followed hastened those plans, and he rushed into exile. In Poland, his wife reportedly outed him in a WhatsApp chat with fellow Russian exiles after an argument, before hastily deleting the messages and trying to laugh it off as a joke.</p><p>Then, in July 2024, Rogov’s flatmate texted him with a warning. The police had come looking for him after a package filled with explosive material addressed to him was found in a shipping warehouse. But Rogov was on holiday in Montenegro at the time. He was immediately arrested on his return. Rogov’s wife was arrested, too, as well as a Ukrainian woman.</p><p>He reportedly admitted to investigators that he had been passing information to the FSB – Russia’s successor to the KGB – for years. After moving to Poland, he tried leaving that life behind, but his old handlers threatened to have his father conscripted and sent to fight in Ukraine, he said.</p><p>As far as Vazhenkov knew, if Igor was indeed a spy, he was not privy to much sensitive information.</p><p>“If we talk about the hierarchy of Open Russia, I know what Igor was allowed to do, and by and large, there wasn’t anything that wasn’t in the public domain,” he said.</p><p>“That is, he could say who [slept with] whom, who got drunk with whom at what conference, and that’s it. Maybe some internal squabbles, as well, since every organisation has those, but this is hardly valuable information.”</p><p>It’s not clear why Rogov returned to Poland from Montenegro if he knew police were seeking him. Another co-accused in the explosives case, Emil Garayev, fled back to Russia.</p><p>“There was information that he confessed to working for the FSB, that he was an informant, a spy – I do not rule out that this is true,” Vazhenkov said. “[But] I am very sceptical about the accusation of preparing a terrorist attack in Poland.”</p><p>The apparent bomb plot fits in with a pattern of attacks blamed on Russia since before the war: for example, a deadly explosion at a Czech arms depot in 2014 pinned on Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. These attacks have escalated since the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>In November, the EU announced it was tightening visa restrictions for Russians, citing security risks. Russian citizens are no longer allowed multi-entry visas. Antiwar Russians abroad criticised the step as unfairly prejudicial and counterproductive to building a movement against the Kremlin.</p><p>“Travelling to the EU is a privilege, not a given,” said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.</p><h2 id=\"gamifying-espionage\">Gamifying espionage</h2><p>Elena Grossfeld, a researcher into Russian and Soviet spycraft at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera that Russian spies have historically operated within the diaspora.</p><p>“Anyone is a potential security threat, including Ukrainian refugees or whoever else, can be collaborating with Russian intelligence,” she said. “But if you’re running counterintelligence in a European country, you have to look at the propensity or the likelihood. And Soviet intelligence and Russian intelligence have been known to recruit emigres.</p><p>“It’s been their mode of operation after the 1917 revolution and beyond … I don’t want to paint everybody in black-and-white, but I understand the concern.”</p><p>But relatively few Russian nationals have been arrested over hybrid warfare attacks. Rather than the old Cold War strategy of deploying long-term sleeper agents, the focus now seems to be on hiring inexperienced local operatives for one-off jobs for cash, usually between a few hundred to a few thousand dollars in cryptocurrency. Teenagers, especially, are easily manipulated into becoming saboteurs-for-hire.</p><p>“A lot of people have been recruited on Telegram when they go to those channels that advertise all kinds of occasional jobs,” Grossfeld explained.</p><p>“One teenager goes to a Russian-speaking Telegram channel, and then he brings on friends. And when the assignment is gamified – ‘You have to take this item from this place to that location, photograph it and send it’ – and there’s [an element of] competition, it is enticing to teenagers and others, as well.”</p><p>The youngest such suspect was an 11-year-old girl arrested by Ukrainian police in Odesa. Ukrainian intelligence has been accused of similar tactics for hiring saboteurs in Russia.</p><p>Individuals linked to the criminal underworld, particularly from the former USSR, have also been sought after, though Grossfeld pointed out that organised crime and Russian communities might be monitored by the authorities already.</p><p>“If you look at the trials in the UK, British people have been recruited, as well as Bulgarians,” she said.</p><p>Earlier this year, a group of minor league criminals were convicted of setting fire to a London warehouse containing communication supplies for Ukraine on behalf of a Telegram account linked to the Russian mercenary firm Wagner, although they never got paid for the arson since they rushed into it without getting their handler’s green light.</p><p>The gang also considered kidnapping exiled Russian businessman Evgeny Chichvarkin, who personally delivered aid to Ukraine, although the scheme was never realised.</p><p>“I believe that Russian citizens still need to be granted visas, because if you believe the general information from open sources, then the special services are behaving a little differently, and those who arrange acts of subversion are mostly citizens of the European Union, or even Ukraine or third countries, and very rarely they are political refugees,” said Vazhenkov.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, [Rogov] is the only case where a political activist given asylum has been accused of spy activity. Therefore, I believe that visas still need to be given, and their absence does more harm than the possible harm from issuing visas to the wrong people.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Israel may look to many like a winner, a de facto hegemon in the Middle East. It has waged war on several fronts simultaneously, dealing deadly blows on its enemies. In parallel, it continues to enjoy much support from various Western constituencies and leaders, particularly those who face real challenges from the hard right in their countries.</p><p>But under the surface, Israel is imploding. An international coalition, led by the United States with the participation of Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye, is gradually removing Gaza from Israel’s control, as well as pressuring Israel out of its territorial escapades in Syria and Lebanon.</p><p>This is being publicly opposed by the Israeli government, but it appears to be carried out with the tacit acceptance of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has now realised that he is better served by the threat of war rather than by war itself. This is especially after he failed to accomplish his own “war goals” – the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages alive; it seems the Israeli army may have killed many more hostages than initially assumed.</p><p>The unconditional support Israel once received from the US and Europe is dwindling, and so is cooperation with Gulf states. The Palestinians, just like the Muslim Brotherhood, were for decades perceived as a greater threat to the regional status quo than the Israelis.</p><p>Where Western leaders once competed over who would be quickest to condemn Hamas and commend Israel’s fight for “Western values”, these same leaders are much quieter now that constant evidence of the Israeli genocide is pouring out of Gaza. Even US President Donald Trump has much less to say about Hamas than he once did.</p><p>It is clearly difficult for Western leaders to acknowledge that Israel has become an agent of regional chaos. It is much easier to gradually, discretely, remove its levers and make it come to terms with the emerging reality without forcing Israeli leaders to publicly lose face. There is no need to confront Israel directly. It is enough to give it the occasional cold shoulder and to make it wait.</p><p>Despite protestations to the contrary, Israel needs international cooperation to attack and occupy in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Iran. That is why its operations are gradually shrinking. The Israeli army is now busy “hunting” individuals who once participated in attacks on Israelis, rather than engaging in strategic expansion. These are Israel’s capabilities in this new order.</p><p>Israel may be losing on the diplomatic front, too. Hamas is negotiating while the Israeli government is stalling. If this continues, Israel will be faced with a reality it did not actively shape. There is talk, for example, of Israelis being forced to pay for the removal of the rubble that the Israeli army created over more than two years of annihilating Gaza.</p><p>While Israel may be on its way to losing its status as a hegemon of the Middle East, Israeli society is devoting all of its considerable energy to internal squabbles “over Israel’s soul” and to intensifying its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. Israelis are losing their faith in the existence of a world outside Israel’s borders. If there is such a world, many believe, it hates Israel with a passion regardless of its actions.</p><p>The Israeli discourse is focusing more and more on issues ranging from threats to Jews to the Israeli collective, abandoning talk of “geostrategic” upheavals that were quite common only six months ago. There is also an overwhelming disregard for global realities and public opinion.</p><p>Take the new scandal plaguing the Israeli Air Force (IAF). Future fighter pilots, on the verge of graduating from two years of training, underwent a weeklong “imprisonment simulation”, generally considered to be the most difficult part of their training. Afterwards, they were sent to a hotel in a secret location in order to recuperate.</p><p>The cadets revealed the location of the hotel to their families, who visited their sons over a weekend; some of them drank alcohol. Their commanding officer even allowed them to imbibe.</p><p>The cadets will all face disciplinary action. IAF commander Tomer Bar clarified that “no leniency will be given on value‑based matters that are a foundation of the corps’ ethos.”</p><p>This is implosion. The IAF is responsible for most of the devastation in Gaza, including the bombing of civilian housing and infrastructure, which has horrified the world and stripped the Israeli army of its “most moral” claim. And yet, the IAF still talks about “values” and “ethos”. The pilots are the main arm of the genocide, but what matters is unauthorised alcohol consumption.</p><p>The cadets and pilots in general were cast by the media as representatives of the old Israeli elites, morally bankrupt and rudderless, spoiled in comparison with the new elites who torched Gaza and died for their efforts on behalf of the “People of Israel”.</p><p>In response, the pilots as a collective praised their own loyalty to the government and the security of the Israeli state and their commitment to continue the genocide for as long as the “democratically elected government” – which they themselves have repeatedly <a href=\"/news/2023/3/6/israel-air-force-reservists-to-skip-training-in-netanyahu-protest\">protested against</a> – instructs them to.</p><p>Perhaps even more importantly, Israel is losing its internal coherence. Unvaccinated children are dying of measles and the flu. Roving gangs of teenagers are attacking Palestinians who drive buses or clean streets. Palestinian citizens of Israel are murdered in criminal gang shootouts. Veterans of the Gaza “war” are committing suicide in unprecedented numbers.</p><p>The public mental health system has already collapsed under the burden, with appointments scheduled more than a year in advance. Classes in state schools are cancelled daily as teachers find themselves caring for their own children, left teacherless in their turn. The Ministry of Education has seen 25 senior professional leaders resign during the reign of the current Netanyahu government, most of them citing political interference in their work. In Tel Aviv, municipal employees have been encouraged to volunteer once a week at city kindergartens and nursery schools because there are no qualified personnel to be found.</p><p>There is a dearth of judges because the minister of justice isn’t speaking to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and both their approvals are necessary for the appointment of new judges. Two government ministers hold nine ministerial portfolios because the ultra-Orthodox parties left the coalition and would not come back unless the government they formed rejects a compulsory military draft law for Haredi Jews.</p><p>The Israeli state is quickly becoming a hollowed-out shell. Institutions are failing, public servants are leaving and political appointees serving their patrons are the only ones left to step in and fill the gaps. The Israel that emerges is bound for institutional, financial and cultural poverty – or implosion.</p><p data-start=\"7823\" data-end=\"7904\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The move risks derailing an accord that has been 25 years in the making.</p><p>The EU’s trade agreement with Mercosur, which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, was concluded a year ago but still awaits ratification. It is intended to expand access to overseas markets for European exporters struggling with tariffs imposed recently by the United States and rising competition from China.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>However, the pact has met strong opposition from farmers across Europe, who worry that a flood of cheap agricultural imports produced under the more relaxed environmental and agricultural standards of some South American countries will put them under too much pressure.</p><p>Securing a resolution to this is viewed by some as a test of Europe’s ability to act as a unified bloc, shortly after US President <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/trump-slams-europes-immigration-policies-calls-continent-weak\">Donald Trump hit out at EU leaders</a> for being “weak” and warning of “civilisational erasure” across the bloc.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-in-the-eu-mercosur-trade-deal\">What is in the EU-Mercosur trade deal?</h2><p>Once ratified, the trade deal between the European and South American blocs would be the largest free-trade agreement brokered by Brussels in terms of tariff relief.</p><p>While talks initially began in 1999, progress has been repeatedly stalled by competing interests. For years, EU farmers voiced concerns about excessively cheap agricultural imports, while environmentalists have raised objections over deforestation in the Amazon.</p><p>Designed to cut tariffs and boost trade in goods and services between the two blocs, Mercosur would allow the EU to export more vehicles, machinery and wines to South America, in exchange for easing the entry of beef, sugar, soya beans and rice from the region into Europe.</p><p>At present, tariffs between the two blocs are high – Mercosur levies up to 35 percent on EU cars, machinery and food, while the EU imposes steep duties of up to roughly 15 percent on South American farmed goods.</p><p>This agreement would phase out most of these tariffs over time, but not all. Several key agricultural products would be managed through quotas and partial tariff reductions. Still, critics worry that it gives away too much to the Mercosur countries and would flood Europe’s markets with cheap South American commodities.</p><p>The EU is Mercosur’s second-largest trading partner in goods, with exports worth 57 billion euros ($67bn) in 2024, according to the European Commission. The EU is also the biggest foreign investor in Mercosur, with a stock of 390 billion euros ($458bn) in 2023.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is due to travel to Brazil on Monday next week to sign the agreement and create the world’s largest free-trade area.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-france-hoping-to-delay-ratification\">Why is France hoping to delay ratification?</h2><p>France, the EU’s largest agricultural producer, has been trying to rally other EU member states to form a blocking minority against the deal. It wants more robust safeguards for farmers added to the accord<span>.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, as many as 10,000 farmers are expected to descend on Brussels, the Belgian capital and the de facto capital of the EU, to protest against the deal during the bloc leaders’ summit on Thursday and Friday.</p><p>The European Commission proposed protective measures, such as the suspension of Mercosur imports if inbound goods volumes rose by more than 10 percent or prices fell by the same amount. However, France describes these safeguards as “incomplete”.</p><p>On Sunday, in an interview with the German financial daily Handelsblatt, French Economy Minister Roland Lescure said the treaty, as it stands, “is simply not acceptable”.</p><p>The same day, French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu called on the EU to delay a vote planned in Brussels, ahead of von der Leyen’s visit to Brazil on December 20, where she is expected to sign the agreement.</p><p>The timing of the Mercosur vote coincides with efforts by Lecornu’s minority government to secure <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/frances-prime-minister-faces-crunch-vote-in-parliament\">parliamentary approval for a budget</a>, including suspending President Emmanuel Macron’s controversial <a href=\"/news/2023/3/7/pension-reforms-protests-in-france-what-you-need-to-know\">pension reform</a>, before the end of 2025.</p><p>It also follows an outbreak of lumpy skin disease – a highly contagious livestock virus – in France over the summer, which has resulted in animal culls and protests by cattle farmers against what they see as overly strict measures.</p><p>Opposition to the trade deal is deeply rooted in France, with both far-right and far-left parties presenting it as evidence that Paris is yielding to Brussels at the expense of rural communities.</p><p>France has set out three conditions for approving the agreement: safeguard mechanisms allowing imports to be stopped in cases of dumping, “mirror clauses” requiring Mercosur products to comply with EU rules on pesticides, and tighter food safety inspections.</p><p>But if France’s terms are not met, it could try to block the agreement altogether.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-could-the-deal-be-blocked\">How could the deal be blocked?</h2><p>By voting it down.</p><p>Denmark, which currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency under which member states take turns setting the collective agenda, will have to decide whether to press ahead with a vote this week as planned.</p><p>If Denmark defies the dissenting countries, the agreement could be shot down. A blocking minority requires support from at least four member states representing 35 percent of the EU’s population. Ireland, Poland, Hungary and Austria have openly opposed the Mercosur deal.</p><p>Together with France, this group of countries represents more than one-third of the EU’s population – enough to form a minority bloc.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-other-eu-member-states-saying\">What are other EU member states saying?</h2><p>Elsewhere in Europe, reactions reflect existing splits. Poland, Hungary, Austria and Ireland have voiced support for France’s position. “Any postponement is a very good signal,” said Polish Agriculture Minister Stefan Krajewski.</p><p>The Netherlands has yet to declare its position.</p><p>European Commission deputy chief spokesperson Olof Gill told reporters on X: “In the view of the Commission signing the deal now is a matter of crucial importance economically, diplomatically, and geopolitically, but also in term of our credibility on the global stage.”</p><p>Echoing that sentiment, Volker Treier of the German Chamber of Commerce, DIHK, said: “The EU must not miss the opportunity to strengthen ties with key trade and raw material partners in South America and to reduce existing trade barriers.”</p><p>Responding to France’s stance, the European Commission said it still expects to sign the deal by the end of the year. “In the view of the Commission, signing the deal now is a matter of crucial importance – economically, diplomatically and geopolitically,” it said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"have-eu-members-objected-to-the-deal-on-other-grounds\">Have EU members objected to the deal on other grounds?</h2><p>Yes. Several EU members have also objected to the deal on environmental grounds, arguing that Brazil has failed to do enough to protect the Amazon rainforest. Critics point to recent spikes in deforestation rates and forest fires, and warn that boosting beef exports could lead to more land clearing.</p><p>At the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, in August 2019, the then‑European Commission President, Donald Tusk, said: “It is hard to imagine a harmonious process of ratification [of the deal] … as long as the Brazilian government allows for the destruction of the green lungs of Planet Earth.”</p><p>France, Austria and others have also said they will not back the deal without stronger, enforceable safeguards on climate and biodiversity. In response, the EU has sought additional assurances and side instruments committing Mercosur countries to uphold the 2015 <a href=\"/news/2025/1/21/drill-baby-whats-the-paris-climate-deal-why-does-trump-want-out\">Paris climate agreement</a>, to which nearly all United Nations member states are signatories.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

We’re working directly with organizers to ensure funds safely reach Ahmed &amp; his family.

And so deeply inspired by his example.”</p><p>New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani also held al-Ahmed up as an example of courage against hate.</p><p>“On Bondi Beach today, as men with long guns targeted innocents, another man ran towards the gunfire and disarmed a shooter,” Mamdani wrote.</p><p>“Tonight, as Jewish New Yorkers light menorahs and usher in a first night of Hanukkah clouded by grief, let us look to his example and confront hatred with the urgency and action it demands.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The small group of putschists, on the one hand, declared victory, but Benin’s forces and government officials said the plot had failed.</p><p>By evening, the situation was clear – Benin’s government was still standing. President Patrice Talon and loyalist forces in the army had managed to hold control, thanks to help from the country’s bigger neighbours, particularly its eastern ally and regional power, Nigeria.</p><p>While Talon now enjoys victory as the president who could not be unseated, the spotlight is also on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The regional bloc rallied to save the day in Benin after their seeming resignation in the face of the crises rocking the region, including just last month, when the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/guinea-bissau-coup-what-happened-why-it-matters-what-happens-next\">military took power in Guinea-Bissau</a>.</p><p>This time, though, after much criticism and embarrassment, ECOWAS was ready to push back against the narrative of it being an ineffective bloc by baring its teeth and biting, political analyst Ryan Cummings told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It wanted to remind the region that it does have the power to intervene when the context allows,” Cummings said. “At some point, there needed to be a line drawn in the sand [and] what was at stake was West Africa’s most stable sovereign country falling.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169470\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169470\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-09T174949Z_676862623_RC20DIAXBN12_RTRMADP_3_BENIN-SECURITY-1765553206.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Benin coup\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People gather at the market of Dantokpa, two days after Benin’s forces thwarted the attempted coup against the government, in Cotonou, December 9, 2025 [Charles Placide Tossou/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-a-new-ecowas-on-the-horizon\">Is a new ECOWAS on the horizon?</h2><p>Benin’s military victory was an astonishing turnaround for an ECOWAS that has been cast as a dead weight in the region since 2020, when a coup in Mali spurred an astonishing series of military takeovers across the region in quick succession.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2025, nine coup attempts toppled five democratic governments and two military ones. The latest successful coup, in Guinea-Bissau, happened on November 28. Bissau-Guineans had voted in the presidential election some days before and were waiting for the results to be announced when the military seized the national television station, detained incumbent President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, and announced a new military leader.</p><p>ECOWAS, whose high-level delegation was in Bissau to monitor the electoral process when the coup happened, appeared on the back foot, unable to do much more than issue condemnatory statements. Those statements sounded similar to those it issued after the coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Guinea. The bloc appeared a far cry from the institution that, between 1990 and 2003, successfully intervened to stop the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and later in the Ivory Coast. The last ECOWAS military intervention, in 2017, halted Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh’s attempt to overturn the election results.</p><p>Indeed, ECOWAS’s success in its heyday hinged on the health of its members. Nigeria, arguably ECOWAS’s backbone, whose troops led the interventions in Liberia and Sierra Leone, has been mired in insecurity and economic crises of its own lately. In July 2023, when Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu was the ECOWAS chair, he threatened to invade Niger after the coup there.</p><p>It was disastrous timing. Faced with livelihood-eroding inflation and incessant attacks by armed groups at home, Nigerians were some of the loudest voices resisting an invasion. Many believed Tinubu, sworn in just months earlier, had misplaced his priorities. By the time ECOWAS had finished debating what to do weeks later, the military government in Niger had consolidated support throughout the armed forces and Nigeriens themselves had decided they wanted to back the military. ECOWAS and Tinubu backed off, defeated.</p><p>Niger left the alliance altogether in January this year, forming the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) with fellow military governments in Mali and Burkina Faso. All three share cultural and geographic affinities, but are also linked by their collective dislike for France, the former colonial power, which they blame for interfering in their countries. Even as they battle rampaging armed groups like Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), the three governments have cut ties with French forces formerly stationed there and welcomed Russian fighters whose effectiveness, security experts say, fluctuates.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169474\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169474\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169474\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-01T191504Z_2111235108_RC2Q7IAOJIOJ_RTRMADP_3_BISSAU-SECURITY-1765553510.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ecowas\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio, who chairs ECOWAS, walks with Guinea-Bissau’s transitional president, Major-General Horta Inta-A, during a meeting in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, on December 1, 2025 [Delcyo Sanca/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>But Benin was different, and ECOWAS appeared wide awake. Aside from the fact that it was one coup too far, Cummings said, the country’s proximity to Nigeria, and two grave mistakes the putschists made, gave ECOWAS a fighting chance.</p><p>The first mistake was that the rebels had failed to take Talon hostage, as is the modus operandi with putschists in the region. That allowed the president to directly send an SOS to his counterparts following the first failed attacks on the presidential palace at dawn.</p><p>The second mistake was perhaps even graver.</p><p>“Not all the armed forces were on board,” Cummings said, noting that the small group of about 100 rebel soldiers had likely assumed other units would fall in line but had underestimated how loyal other factions were to the president. That was a miscalculation in a country where military rule ended in 1990 and where 73 percent of Beninese believe that democracy is better than any other form of government, according to poll site Afrobarometer. Many take particular pride in their country being hailed as the region’s most stable democracy.</p><p>“There was division within the army, and that was the window of opportunity that allowed ECOWAS to deploy because there wasn’t going to be a case of ‘If we deploy, we will be targeted by the army’. I dare say that if there were no countercoup, there was no way ECOWAS would have gotten involved because it would have been a conventional war,” Cummings added.</p><p>Quickly reading the room, Benin’s neighbours reacted swiftly. For the first time in nearly a decade, the bloc deployed its standby ground forces from Nigeria, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, and Sierra Leone. Abuja authorised air attacks on rebel soldiers who were effectively cornered in a military base in Cotonou and at the national TV building, but who were putting up a last-ditch attempt at resistance. France also supported the mission by providing intelligence. By nightfall, the rebels had been completely dislodged by Nigerian jets. The battle for Cotonou was over.</p><p>At least 14 people have since been arrested. Several casualties were reported on both sides, with one civilian, the wife of a high-ranking officer marked for assassination, among the dead. On Wednesday, Beninese authorities revealed that the coup leader, Colonel Pascal Tigri, was hiding in neighbouring Togo.</p><p>At stake for ECOWAS was the risk of losing yet another member, possibly to the landlocked AES, said Kabiru Adamu, founder of Abuja-based Beacon Security intelligence firm. “I am 90 percent sure Benin would have joined the AES because they desperately need a littoral state,” he said, referring to Benin’s Cotonou port, which would have expanded AES export capabilities.</p><p>Nigeria could also not afford a military government mismanaging the deteriorating security situation in northern Benin, as has been witnessed in the AES countries, Cummings said. Armed group JNIM launched its <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/al-qaeda-linked-jnim-says-one-killed-in-its-first-nigeria-attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first attack</a> on Nigerian soil in October, adding to Abuja’s pressures as it continues to face Boko Haram in the northeast and armed bandit groups in the northwest. Abuja has also come under diplomatic fire from the US, which falsely alleges a “Christian genocide” in the country.</p><p>“We know that this insecurity is the stick with which Tinubu is being beaten, and we already know his nose is bloodied,” Cummings said.</p><p>Revelling in the glory of the Benin mission last Sunday, Tinubu praised Nigeria’s forces in a statement, saying the “Nigerian armed forces stood gallantly as a defender and protector of constitutional order”. A group of Nigerian governors also hailed the president’s action, and said it reinforced Nigeria’s regional power status and would deter further coup plotters.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169468\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169468\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169468\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1996-05-04T120000Z_572182307_PBEAHUMUGDL_RTRMADP_3_LIBERIA-1765553188.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C496&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ECOMOG\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169468\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nigerian ECOWAS Ceasefire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) soldiers guard a corner in downtown Monrovia during fighting between militias loyal to Charles Taylor and Roosevelt Johnson in Liberia in 1996.

The bloc still has much to do before it can be taken seriously again, particularly in upholding democracy and calling out sham elections before governments become vulnerable to mass uprisings or coups, Beacon Security’s Adamu said.</p><p>In Benin, for example, ECOWAS did not react as President Talon, in power since 2016, grew increasingly autocratic, barring opposition groups in two previous presidential elections. His government has again barred the main opposition challenger, Renaud Agbodjo, from elections scheduled for next April, while Talon’s pick, former finance minister Romuald Wadagni, is the obvious favourite.</p><p>“It’s clear that the elections have been engineered already,” Adamu said. “In the entire subregion, it’s difficult to point to any single country where the rule of law has not been jettisoned and where the voice of the people is heard without fear.”</p><p>ECOWAS, Adamu added, needs to proactively re-educate member states on democratic principles, hold them accountable when there are lapses, as in the Benin case, and then intervene when threats emerge.</p><p>The bloc appears to be taking heed. On December 9, two days after the failed Benin coup, ECOWAS declared a state of emergency.</p><p>“Events of the last few weeks have shown the imperative of serious introspection on the future of our democracy and the urgent need to invest in the security of our community,” Omar Touray, ECOWAS Commission president, said at a meeting in the Abuja headquarters. Touray cited situations that constitute coup risks, such as the erosion of electoral integrity and mounting geopolitical tensions, as the bloc splits along foreign influences. Currently, ECOWAS member states have stayed close to Western allies like France, while the AES is firmly pro-Russia.</p><p>Another challenge the bloc faces is managing potential fallout with the AES states amid France’s increasing closeness with Abuja. As Paris faces hostility in Francophone West Africa, it has drawn closer to Nigeria, where it does not have the same negative colonial reputation, and which it perceives as useful for protecting French business interests in the region, Cummings said. At the same time, ECOWAS is still hoping to woo the three rogue ex-members back into its fold, and countries like Ghana have already established bilateral ties with the military governments.</p><p>“The challenge with that is that the AES would see the intervention [in Benin] as an act not from ECOWAS itself but something engineered by France,” Adamu said. Seeing France instigating an intervention which could have benefitted AES reinforces their earlier complaints that Paris pokes its nose into the region’s affairs, and could push them further away, he said.</p><p>“So now we have a situation where they feel like France did it, and the sad thing is that we haven’t seen ECOWAS dispel that notion, so the ECOWAS standby force has [re]started on a contentious step,” Adamu added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the third wave of such formalisations this year by the government, which considers settlement expansion and annexation a top priority. During an earlier ceremony of formalisation, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said, “We are advancing de facto sovereignty on the ground to prevent any possibility of establishing an Arab state in [the West Bank].”</p><p>Settlement outposts, which are illegal under international law, are set up by a small group of settlers without prior government authorisation. This does not mean that the settlers, who are often more ideological and violent, do not enjoy government protection. Israeli human rights organisations say that settlers in these so-called outposts enjoy protection, electricity and other services from the Israeli army. The formalisation opens the door to additional government funds, infrastructure and expansion.</p><p>Many of the settlement outposts formalised in this latest decision are concentrated in the northeastern part of the West Bank, an area that traditionally has had very little settlement activity. They also include the formalisation of two outposts evacuated in 2005 by the government of Israeli then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While these government decisions may seem bureaucratic, they are in fact strategic in nature. They support the more ideological and often more violent settlers entrenching their presence and <a href=\"/features/2025/12/15/night-guardians-of-the-mountain-in-the-occupied-west-bank\">taking over</a> yet more Palestinian land, and becoming more brazen in their attacks against Palestinians, which are unprecedented in scope and effect.</p><p>The Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem estimates that settler attacks against Palestinians have forcibly displaced 44 communities across the West Bank in the past two years. These arson attacks, vandalism, physical assault and deadly shootings are done under the protection of Israeli soldiers. During these settler attacks, 34 Palestinians were killed, including three children. None of the perpetrators has been brought to justice. In fact, policing of these groups has dropped under the direction of Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is a settler himself.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently sounded the alarm about Israel’s record-breaking expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank and the unprecedented levels of state-backed settler violence. In a briefing to the UN Security Council, Guterres reminded states that all settlements are illegal under international law. He also warned that they erode Palestinian rights recognised under this law, including to a state of their own.</p><p>In September, United States President Donald Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/9/26/trump-says-he-will-not-allow-israel-to-annex-occupied-west-bank\">said</a> he “will not allow” Israel to annex the West Bank, without offering details of what actions he would take to prevent such a move.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Israel is undeterred. The government continues to pursue its agenda of land grab, territorial expansion and annexation by a myriad of measures that fragment, dispossess and isolate Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and continues its genocidal violence in Gaza.</p><p>More than 32,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced from their homes in three refugee camps in the occupied West Bank for nearly a year. The Israeli army continues to occupy <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/israel-to-demolish-25-homes-in-occupied-west-bank-nur-shams-camp\">Nur Shams</a>, Tulkarem and Jenin refugee camps and ban residents from returning. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have demolished and damaged 1,460 buildings in those camps, according to a preliminary UN estimate. This huge, destructive campaign has changed the geography of the camps and plunged more families into economic and social despair.</p><p>This is the state hundreds of thousands of Palestinians across the West Bank find themselves in because of Israeli restrictions, home demolitions and land grabs. The Israeli army has set up close to 1,000 gates across the West Bank, turning communities into open-air prisons. This has a direct and devastating effect on the social fabric, economy and vitality of these communities, which live on land that is grabbed from under them to execute the expansion of illegal settlements, roads and so-called buffer zones around them.</p><p>According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development, Israeli practices and policies over the past two years have cost the Palestinian people 69 years of development. The organisation recently reported that the Palestinian gross domestic product (GDP) has shrunk to 2010 levels. This is visible most starkly in Gaza, but it is palpable in the West Bank as well.</p><p>The results of these policies and this reality are Palestinians leaving their homes and Israel expanding. During the summer, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a local news station he was on a “historic and spiritual mission”, in reference to the vision of the Greater Israel that he said he was “very” attached to.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Officials said additional charges are expected.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desert-meeting\">Desert meeting</h2><p>The suspects, who are all from the Los Angeles area, were arrested on Friday in the Mojave Desert as they were working on the plot, First Assistant US Attorney Bill Essayli told a news conference.</p><p>Officials showed reporters’ surveillance footage of the suspects in the desert moving a large black object to a table. The group was arrested before they had the opportunity to build a functional bomb, the officials said.</p><p>Essayli said Carroll had created a detailed plan to bomb at least five locations. The plot included the targeting of two “Amazon-type” logistics centres operated by US companies in the Los Angeles area on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>Backpacks filled with IEDs that were to be detonated simultaneously at midnight were to be left at the locations. The group believed the explosions would be less likely to be noticed due to fireworks detonated during the celebrations.</p><p>Two of the suspects had discussed plans for attacks targeting ICE agents and vehicles with pipe bombs early next year, according to the complaint.</p><p>Officials said the suspects were an offshoot of a group dubbed the Turtle Island Liberation Front, which says it is for the “liberation of all colonised peoples”.</p><p>The group, which has a small social media following, describes itself on Facebook as a political organisation advocating for the “Liberation of occupied Turtle Island and liberation of all colonized peoples across the world”.</p><p>The term “Turtle Island” is used by some Indigenous peoples to describe North America in a way that reflects its existence outside the colonial boundaries put in place by the US and Canada. It comes from Indigenous creation stories where the continent was formed on the back of a giant turtle.</p><p>Activists affiliated with the group have previously organised campaigns against detentions and deportations by ICE, as well as anti-colonial issues.</p><p>Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said while federal and local officials disagree on the Trump administration’s immigration raids, they still come together to protect residents.</p></div></div></body></html>"
