The court remanded the case to the US Court of International Trade (CIT) to <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/20/tariff-refunds-could-take-years-amid-us-supreme-court-ruling-experts-warn\">oversee a refund process</a>.</p><p>Here is what we know:</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-supreme-court-decided\">What has the Supreme Court decided?</h2><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"155\">The court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"155\">“Our task today is to decide only whether the power to ‘regulate … importation,’ as granted to the president in IEEPA, embraces the power to impose tariffs. It does not,” Roberts wrote in the ruling.</p><p data-start=\"157\" data-end=\"412\">In its decision, the justices said the 1977 law was designed to allow presidents to respond to specific national emergencies, such as freezing assets or blocking transactions, but not to overhaul US trade policy through broad, across-the-board tariffs.</p><p data-start=\"414\" data-end=\"611\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The majority concluded that using IEEPA in this way went beyond the authority Congress intended to grant.</p><p>“What it means first and foremost is that Donald Trump acted illegally. He was breaking the law,” Chris Edelson, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Donald Trump said the emergency law allowed him to use tariffs and the Supreme Court said, ‘Actually, Congress didn’t say that,’” he added.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-was-trump-s-legal-reason-for-imposing-tariffs-in-2025\">What was Trump’s legal reason for imposing tariffs in 2025?</h2><p data-start=\"112\" data-end=\"272\">Trump argued that the tariffs were justified under the IEEPA, saying the US faced six national emergencies.</p><p data-start=\"274\" data-end=\"436\">He described the long-running US trade deficit, which the country has recorded every year since 1975, as one national emergency that threatened economic security.</p><p data-start=\"438\" data-end=\"630\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">He also cited the surge in overdoses linked to the powerful opioid fentanyl, arguing that the flow of the drug into the US constituted a separate national emergency requiring executive action.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"42\">In the end, the case he presented centred on two tariff groups.</p><p data-start=\"44\" data-end=\"170\">One set was imposed on nearly every country, with Trump arguing they were necessary to address persistent US trade deficits.</p><p data-start=\"172\" data-end=\"304\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The other targeted Mexico, Canada and China, which he said were responsible for the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-money-is-at-stake\" data-start=\"438\" data-end=\"630\">How much money is at stake?</h2><p data-start=\"67\" data-end=\"150\">The Trump administration has not released tariff collection data since December 14.</p><p data-start=\"152\" data-end=\"320\">However, Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, estimates that more than $130bn in tariffs have already been collected under the emergency declarations.</p><p data-start=\"322\" data-end=\"428\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">He said the ruling is likely to trigger a prolonged legal battle over whether that money must be refunded.</p><p data-start=\"322\" data-end=\"428\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">“What happens? Do they get this money back? The companies are going to want it back. I don’t know how that’s going to work,” Edelson said.</p><h2 id=\"which-judges-dissented-against-the-ruling\">Which judges dissented against the ruling?</h2><p data-start=\"582\" data-end=\"674\">Three conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, opposed the decision.</p><p>They wrote that the ruling did not necessarily foreclose Trump “from imposing most if not all of these same sorts of tariffs under other statutory authorities”.</p><p>“In essence, the court today concludes that the president checked the wrong statutory box by relying on IEEPA rather than another statute to impose these tariffs,” Kavanaugh wrote.</p><p>Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, both appointed by Trump during his first term, joined Chief Justice Roberts’s majority opinion in full.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4327141\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4327141\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4327141\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25276586814241-1771614990.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Members of the Supreme Court sit for a new group portrait at the Supreme Court building i\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4327141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of the Supreme Court sit for a new group portrait at the Supreme Court building in Washington [File: J Scott Applewhite/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"can-trump-still-impose-tariffs-after-the-supreme-court-ruling\">Can Trump still impose tariffs after the Supreme Court ruling?</h2><p data-start=\"95\" data-end=\"302\">The president still has <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/20/tariff-refunds-could-take-years-amid-us-supreme-court-ruling-experts-warn\">other legal avenues</a> to pursue trade restrictions.</p><p data-start=\"304\" data-end=\"520\">One option is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows tariffs on national security grounds. This authority was used during Trump’s first term to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.</p><p data-start=\"522\" data-end=\"775\">Another is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which permits the US to impose tariffs in response to unfair trade practices by other countries.</p><p data-start=\"522\" data-end=\"775\">This was the legal basis for many of the tariffs placed on China during Trump’s earlier trade disputes.</p><p data-start=\"777\" data-end=\"969\">He could also pursue more targeted trade actions through existing anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-trump-s-reaction\">What was Trump’s reaction?</h2><p data-start=\"2329\" data-end=\"2447\">Trump criticised the ruling, arguing that presidents should have sweeping trade authority.</p><p data-start=\"2452\" data-end=\"2538\">“I can destroy the trade, can destroy the country. I can do anything I want,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"2543\" data-end=\"2659\">He complained that while he could impose an embargo, the court’s interpretation meant he could not even “charge $1″.</p><p data-start=\"2664\" data-end=\"2698\">“How ridiculous is that?” he said.</p><p data-start=\"2709\" data-end=\"2838\">Trump also praised <a href=\"/news/2018/10/7/who-is-brett-kavanaugh-us-supreme-courts-new-judge\">Justice Brett Kavanaugh</a>’s dissent, saying it suggested he could rely on other legal authorities in the future.</p><p data-start=\"2843\" data-end=\"2923\">“He’s right,” Trump said. “In fact, I can charge much more than I was charging.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"why-does-this-ruling-matter\">Why does this ruling matter?</h2><p data-start=\"286\" data-end=\"447\">Beyond Trump’s specific tariffs, the ruling could influence how future presidents deploy emergency powers, potentially narrowing the scope for unilateral action.</p><p data-start=\"449\" data-end=\"640\">“The Supreme Court will follow the law, and that doesn’t mean that Donald Trump will get a blank cheque to do whatever he wants,” Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said, reporting from Washington, DC.</p><p data-start=\"642\" data-end=\"832\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Bruce Fein, a former US associate deputy attorney general and constitutional lawyer, described the ruling as a “clear signal” that the president does not have unlimited unilateral authority.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In his dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that issuing refunds would present practical challenges and said it would be “a mess”.</p><p>The case will now return to the Court of International Trade to oversee the refund process.</p><p>More than 1,000 lawsuits have already been filed by importers in the trade court seeking refunds, and a wave of new cases is expected. Legal experts say the administration will likely require importers to apply for refunds individually. That process could disproportionately <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/9/i-dont-have-the-cash-to-pay-for-these-tariffs-us-small-biz-suffers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">burden smaller businesses</a> affected by the tariffs.</p><p>“The government is probably not going to voluntarily pay back the money it unlawfully took. Rather, the government is going to make everyone request a refund through different procedures by filing formal protests. They’re going to delay things procedurally as long as they can. Hiring lawyers and going through these procedures costs money and time,” Greg Shaffer, a law professor at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“I imagine the largest companies, who have been prepared for this eventuality, will eventually get their money back. But smaller importers, it’s a cost-benefit analysis where they might shrug their shoulders and say it’s not worth going through the hassle to get the unlawfully imposed taxes paid back to them.”</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-path-forward\">Trump’s path forward</h2><p>Despite Friday’s ruling, other sweeping levies remain in place. Trump had invoked Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act to impose sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminium, cars, copper, lumber, and other products, such as kitchen cabinets, worldwide.</p><p>On Friday, Trump said he would impose a 10 percent global tariff for 150 days to replace some of his emergency duties that were struck down. The order would be made under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and the duties would be over and above tariffs that are currently in place, Trump said.</p><p>The statute allows the president to impose duties of up to 15 percent for up to 150 days on any and all countries related to “large and serious” balance of payments issues. It does not require investigations or impose other procedural limits.</p><p>The president also has other legal avenues available to continue taxing imports aggressively.</p><p>“Our trading partners were well aware of the risks the President faced in using IEEPA as the basis for reciprocal and other tariffs. Nevertheless, they chose to conclude deals with Washington, convinced by Washington that other statutes would be utilised to keep the tariffs in place,” Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>“With respect to China, USTR [United States trade representative] still has an active Section 301 investigation on China’s compliance with the Phase One agreement, which could be a major feature of the back-up plan for Beijing.”</p><p>The president is expected to travel to Beijing next month to meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to discuss trade.</p><p>“The two main options include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the traditional mechanism for imposing tariffs in response to unfair trade practices by other countries. It requires an investigation and a report, but ultimately gives the president considerable discretion to impose tariffs. It has been used in the past and will likely be the most frequently used measure going forward,” Shaffer, the law professor, said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He noted, however, that the administration’s tariff options could not be applied retroactively, meaning any new tariffs would apply only to future imports rather than covering duties already paid.</p><p>Raj Bhala, professor of law at The University of Kansas School of Law, argues there are remedies at the president’s disposal in addition to Section 122. Bhala said that Trump could use Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (also known as the Smoot-Hawley Act). That allows the president to impose a 50 percent tariff to challenge discriminatory trade practices from other countries.</p><p>“Each option involves procedural hurdles,” Bhala said.</p><h2 id=\"congressional-pressure\">Congressional pressure</h2><p>Roberts wrote that the president must “point to clear congressional authorization” to impose tariffs. The ruling has increased pressure on both Trump’s allies and critics in Congress to clarify the scope of executive trade authority.</p><p>“What a fantastic ruling for a feckless branch of government. While its current tendency is to abdicate, the court has told Congress to do its job,” a former official in the White House Office of Management and Budget told Al Jazeera in response to the decision.</p><p>“Congress must either act with specific legislation, or declare war, which would grant the President the emergency powers to levy tariffs.”</p><p>“Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a post on the social media platform X.</p><p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, by contrast, welcomed the ruling, saying it will “finally give families and small businesses the relief they deserve” and that Trump should end “this reckless trade war for good.”</p><p>But how that money will get paid back, and if it was already spent, will require Congress to step in.</p><p>“If it has been spent, the money will have to be reallocated by Congress. Congress will have to determine how much is owed to importers, pass a law to fund it, and create a mechanism for repayment. There’s also the question of who is entitled to it. Is it only the importer, or does it extend to the end consumer? Where does the line stop?” Babak Hafezi, professor of international business at American University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is not something that will be fixed in 24 hours. It will most likely take years, possibly even a decade, to resolve all the issues this less-than-a-year-old law has imposed on Americans.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The new 10 percent tariff would go into effect in about three days.</p><p>Trump called the court’s liberal justices a “disgrace to our nation” and denounced the conservatives who sided with them as “unpatriotic and disloyal” to the US Constitution.</p><p>The court ruled, in a 6-3 decision, that Trump cannot use emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from countries worldwide without the consent of Congress.</p><p>The decision was a major blow to Trump’s economic agenda as the tariffs were expected to total $3.6 trillion over 2026-2035, as per estimates by Oxford Economics. Friday’s ruling sharply lowers the effective tariff rate immediately to 8.3 percent from 12.7 percent, according to Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics.</p><p>But the US president has argued that he has found a loophole to maintain the levies and even raise them by 10 percent – relying on other existing laws that give him powers over trade.</p><p>“In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past period of a year under the various tariffs authorities,” Trump said.</p><p>“So we can use other of the statutes, other of the tariff authorities, which have also been confirmed and are fully allowed.”</p><h2 id=\"tariff-cudgel-diminished\">‘Tariff cudgel diminished’</h2><p>That will be easier said than done, warned experts.</p><p>“Overall, it’s still a block to the Trump administration as it is harder to announce and implement tariffs quickly,” Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Al Jazeera. “But the administration, as expected, is trying to patch together via existing tools a set of measures that will maintain tariff revenue and some leverage. But it is a time of uncertainty.”</p><p>Kimberly Clausing, researcher at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, in a note emailed to Al Jazeera agreed that with the ruling, “the strength of the president’s tariff cudgel is diminished. Governments abroad and businesses at home can both expect, somewhat, less mercurial US tariff processes.”</p><p>But the uncertainty that US consumers and businesses have faced over the past year is far from over as the administration has already indicated that it plans to pivot to a “plan B” that would use other authorities to levy similar tariffs. “This means that Trump’s tariffs will continue to burden the US economy, even if alternative instruments are not as agile or broad as the IEEPA tariffs,” Clausing said.</p><p>Over the last year, Trump has used tariffs to not only raise revenues for the US and push businesses to increase manufacturing in the US with the aim of eventually creating more jobs, but has used them as a catchall to pressure countries over a range of issues including to toe the line for US foreign policy. For instance, he slapped India with a punitive 25 percent tariff for buying Russian oil.</p><p>With tariffs now no longer available as a cudgel for wide-ranging issues, it’s possible that Trump leans on other actions like sanctions, and even military action, to push some agendas.</p><p>“He was already using military force including to enforce sanctions in Venezuela and Iran,” pointed out Ziemba. “The bigger issue is if he tries to continue to pressure friend and foe alike and to change US friends. It’s too soon to tell on this but his escalate to de-escalate strategy has its costs,” she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is expected to become law before the end of the month, after the Senate reviews modifications to the version it first passed last week.</p><p>Members of La Libertad Avanza say the legislation will modernise the labour market by making it easier for companies to hire and fire workers, including through limits on severance pay and collective bargaining.</p><p>It also allows employers to extend the workday from 8 to 12 hours, creates a “time bank” to replace paid overtime and reduces the amount of uninterrupted holiday a worker can take, among other provisions.</p><p>Supporters <a href=\"https://x.com/PatoBullrich/status/2021837703709446374\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">argue</a> the changes are essential to boost productivity, attract foreign investment and limit labour lawsuits.</p><p>They have also praised provisions that offer new tax incentives for hiring and pathways to legally register Argentina’s large population of informal workers.</p><p>“We have labour modernisation. Javier Milei gives answers to the millions of Argentines who are currently in the informal economy,” Bornoroni posted on social media after the vote.</p><p>Since the bill was first drafted, business leaders have been divided over its potential effectiveness.</p><p>Some warned that its provisions, including those affecting collective bargaining and contract stability, could generate feelings of uncertainty among employees.</p><p>Others questioned how much it would boost hiring. Ricardo Diab, president of the Argentinian Confederation of Medium-Sized Enterprises (CAME), said in an interview with Cadena 3 that a law alone is not enough to create jobs.</p><p>“To hire [people], I need to have a need, and for there to be a need, there must be production and consumption,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, opposition politicians and trade unionists argue that the law will strip workers of their basic rights.</p><p>“Workers were already under pressure, and this just delivers another heavy hit, leaving them with very little room to negotiate anything,” Roxana Monzon, a national deputy for the opposition party Union por la Patria, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It means job insecurity for workers, and it will affect the most vulnerable even more.”</p><p>She pointed to the “time bank” as an example of the bill’s problematic proposals.</p><p>Instead of mandating paid overtime, the legislation would allow employers to compensate workers with time off later on, subject to the company’s approval.</p><p>That system, Monzon explained, is ripe for exploitation, since some workers rely on overtime to pay the bills.</p><p>“The hour bank, for example, will affect women in particular, as employers can decide what hours they must work, regardless of other responsibilities they have, such as caring,” Monzon said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326996\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326996\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326996\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Patricio-A.-Cabezas-%E2%80%93-View-of-the-National-Congress-of-Argentina-after-the-repression-of-the-march-against-the-Labor-Reform-08-1771611706.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Police stand behind a metal barricade around Argentina's Congress\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326996\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Law enforcement erects a barricade around Argentina’s Congress in Buenos Aires [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"anxiety-among-workers\">Anxiety among workers</h2><p>As members of Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies debated the bill on Thursday, thousands of people protested outside Congress in solidarity with a nationwide strike organised by the country’s main unions.</p><p>Gabriela Quiroz, a 31-year-old primary school teacher from Villa Soldati, near Buenos Aires, said she already works two jobs to make ends meet. She described the bill as an “abysmal step backwards”.</p><p>“I’m very concerned and anxious about what could happen. As a teacher, I do many extra hours, and now they won’t be paid in cash,” Quiroz said. “I barely make it to the end of the month as it is, and there are many people like me.”</p><p>She added that slashing overtime pay could have wider impacts on Argentina’s economy, with consumers spending less.</p><p>“When people don’t have money, everybody is affected,” she said. “If I don’t have money to spend, I don’t shop in my local shops, so they start to struggle. It’s a vicious circle.”</p><p>Quiroz was among the thousands of people who made their way to Congress, undeterred by the heat and the lack of public transport, one of the services disrupted by the strike.</p><p>The general strike also left airports empty, as hundreds of flights were cancelled. Factories and banks also shuttered for the day, and hospitals only provided emergency services.</p><p>As demonstrations in Buenos Aires drew to a close in the evening, security forces used water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters, a violent response that has become <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/10/14/they-could-have-killed-me-protesters-condemn-state-violence-in-argentina\">increasingly common</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326975\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326975\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Josefina-Salomon-Gabriela-Quiroz-with-sign-is-the-first-formally-employed-woman-in-her-family-at-the-march-against-the-Labor-Reform-1771610980.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gabriela Quiroz holds a sign protesting Argentina's labour reform\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gabriela Quiroz holds up a sign that says, ‘I am the first formal worker in my family.

The bill tries to tackle the issue from several angles.</p><p>Think tanks like the Argentina Institute of Fiscal Analysis have reported that the companies face high costs in hiring new workers, and as many as 40 percent of Argentina’s workers work in the informal sector, without job protections.</p><p>The bill offers incentives to address those issues. But analysts say what is needed is a broader look at the country’s economy.</p><p>While economic activity in Argentina has increased overall, that growth has been uneven. While sectors such as banking and agriculture have improved, manufacturing and commerce have experienced sharp declines in recent years.</p><p>More than <a href=\"https://centrocepa.com.ar/informes/725-analisis-de-la-dinamica-laboral-y-de-empleadores-datos-a-septiembre-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20,000</a> businesses with registered employees shut down between November 2023 and September 2025, at a pace of roughly 30 a day, according to the Center for Political Economics in Argentina (CEPA), a think tank.</p><p>During that same period, CEPA added, about 280,000 workers lost their jobs.</p><p>Stagnant salaries have also struggled to keep up with price increases for basic products and services <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/16/in-argentina-locals-are-taking-loans-to-buy-food\">like food</a>.</p><p>“While in Congress, we are debating the cost of employing people, in many homes, families are discussing whether their children can continue to go to school or need to find any job to help pay for rent and food.

Argentina will be great again,” he wrote, offering his twist on a slogan made famous by United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>Andres Malamud, a senior research fellow at the University of Lisbon’s Institute of Social Sciences, said that for a country like Argentina, with a heavily regulated economy, the labour reform is not the most important bill, but it is the most symbolic.</p><p>It offers a blow to the historical power of Argentina’s unions, long associated with Peronism, the political movement that has governed since 1946, Malamud explained.</p><p>Milei, meanwhile, has rejected Peronism, and his party notched a decisive victory against the left-wing Peronist movement in October during Argentina’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/mileis-party-wins-big-in-argentina-midterm-elections-early-results-show\">midterm elections</a>.</p><p>“If international conditions do not worsen and social patience holds, Milei will have achieved what no president since 1983 has: governing longer than non-Peronists while reforming more than Peronists,” Malamud said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Buenos Aires, Susana Amatrudo, 54, a nurse from Avellaneda, told Al Jazeera she fears the changes will have a trickle-down effect across society.</p><p>“When factories close, and people lose their jobs, it affects everybody. People have less money, and they can buy less. This has been happening for a while and will only get worse,” Amatrudo said, tears streaming down her eyes, as she waved a large Argentinian flag in front of Congress.</p><p>“I’m OK, but I know a lot of people who are not, and that’s why we need to keep fighting.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The reports related to investment opportunities in Afghanistan and assessments of Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited.</p><p>Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement on Thursday that officers had now opened a full investigation into the offence of misconduct in public office.</p><p>A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which handle the most serious criminal offences.</p><p>Thames Valley Police has previously said it was also reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Andrew. Thursday’s arrest was not related to that allegation.</p><p>In 2022, the king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the US by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.</p><p>Other police forces are also conducting their own investigations into Epstein’s links to the UK, including the assessment of flight logs at airports. They are coordinating their work within a national group.</p><p>On Friday, London’s Metropolitan Police said it was assessing, with the help of US counterparts, whether the capital’s airports, which include Heathrow, “may have been used to facilitate human trafficking and sexual exploitation”.</p><p>It also said that it is asking past and present officers who protected Mountbatten-Windsor to “consider carefully” whether they saw or heard anything that may be relevant to the investigations.</p><p>As of now, it said no new criminal allegations have been made regarding sexual offences within its jurisdiction.</p><p>The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.

The opposition, meanwhile, published evidence suggesting its candidate had won by a considerable margin.</p><p>That prompted a sweeping government crackdown on dissenters.</p><p>In December 2024, Armas was arrested. He said he was taken to a house where he was blindfolded, tied to a chair for days and suffocated with a plastic bag.</p><p>Later, he shared a dingy cell with dozens of other prisoners – and rats. Once he was transferred to El Helicoide, his friends and family had no contact with him for 10 months.</p><p>His release, however, has not meant freedom. The day he stepped out of prison, he celebrated by joining a motorcycle parade with Juan Pablo Guanipa, a prominent politician who had also been freed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325401\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325401\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325401\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26039811205752-1771525517.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Juan Pablo Guanipa and Jesus Armas ride on the backs of motorcycles in a parade\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325401\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Opposition leader Juan Pablo Guanipa, right, and political activist Jesus Armas ride on the backs of motorbikes after their release [Cristian Hernandez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>There was a feeling of energy and optimism, Armas recalled, as they visited the families of other political prisoners. But within hours, Guanipa was abducted by masked individuals. No one knew where he had been taken.</p><p>\"I couldn’t sleep because I was scared,\" he said. His first night home was spent lying in bed, checking for news about Guanipa.</p><p>\"I had all this adrenaline, all these mixed emotions. I was happy because I was with my parents, but there was also fear.\"</p><p>Officials accused Guanipa of breaching the rules of his release, although it is not clear what those limits were. He was held incommunicado for hours before being fitted with an electronic ankle monitor and placed under house arrest.</p><p>Only after the passage of the amnesty bill on Thursday was Guanipa released from house arrest, according to a statement from his brother Tomas Guanipa.</p><p>Still, Guanipa himself warned that the amnesty law would not end the government's oppressive tactics. He highlighted its exclusions and loopholes.</p><p>\"What was approved today in the legislative palace is no amnesty,\" Guanipa <a href=\"https://x.com/JuanPGuanipa/status/2024710922296500571\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media after his second release in less than two weeks.</p><p>\"It is a flawed document intended to blackmail many innocent Venezuelans and excludes several brothers and sisters who remain unjustly behind bars.\"</p><p>For Tineo, cases of re-arrest like Guanipa's show that Venezuela is not sincere about ending government repression.</p><p>\"As long as judicial restrictions remain in place for those released and the 'revolving door' practice continues – new detentions following releases – it can’t be said that there is an end to the policy of persecution,\" she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A small portion will come to Gaza so they can say they supported Gaza and justify the continuation of their luxury club called the Board of Peace .”&lt;/ p&gt;</p><p>“So this project is a failure from the start and unclear in vision, like the failure of the aid distribution foundation established by America a year ago, which became death traps for thousands.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326497\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326497\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4326497 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A5988-copy-1771587431.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jamal Abu Mukhda from Deir al-Balah believes that the Peace Council and its decisions are merely lies for media consumption [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jamal Abu Mukhda from Deir el-Balah believes that the Board of Peace and its decisions are merely lies for media consumption [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Jamal Abu Makhdeh agrees.</p><p>“They won’t do anything for Gaza. It’s all lies,” the 66-year-old man says. “Anything Israel agrees to certainly won’t be in our interest,” he tells Al Jazeera in Deir el-Balah.</p><p>“Trump, together with Israel, wants to use the Board of Peace to impose their decisions on the world by force. This is about power, control, and domination, without regard for weaker nations like us,” he added.</p><p>Over the past two years, reconstruction plans have been discussed after every ceasefire deal in Gaza. However, Israeli restrictions on the entry of construction materials have hindered the full implementation of those pledges.</p><p>“Even if the board decides to rebuild Gaza, this is unlikely and won’t happen. We’ve heard this many times and nothing happened,” he adds.</p><p>“How can we trust a peace board in which Israel is a member? It is the one that killed us, destroyed us, and committed genocide.”</p><p>While Abu Makhdeh insists he is not optimistic about the board’s decisions, he also expresses concern about Trump and Israel’s insistence on disarming Hamas. Under the truce accord, Hamas is required to hand over its weapons.</p><p>“Their main goal is to disarm Hamas so that we drown in internal and civil disputes,” he adds.</p><p>He said he sees talk of peace as deceptive, pointing to ongoing violations in the occupied West Bank, including the destruction of Palestinian houses and property, settlement expansion, and restrictions on normal life, alongside the deepening tragedy in Gaza.</p><p>“There is no optimism in American decisions. This is just media talk.”</p><p>Al-Ghoul expressed cautious optimism over the idea of sending an international peacekeeping force to Gaza.</p><p>“Personally, I hope this force is sent, but it must act as a deterrent to Israel’s continued attacks, like UNIFIL in Lebanon. I don’t imagine Israel would attack a force imposed by a Board of Peace managed by Trump,” he says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326493\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326493\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4326493 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A6017-copy-1771587425.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Amal Jouda, displaced from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza to Deir al-Balah two years ago, says all she asks for is a dignified life for herself and her children, no matter which party delivers it [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326493\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amal Jouda, displaced from Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza to Deir el-Balah two years ago, says all she asks for is a dignified life for herself and her children, no matter which party delivers it [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"reconstruction-the-biggest-absence-in-the-speech\">Reconstruction: The biggest absence in the speech</h2><p>Despite talk of “stability” and “peace”, the board’s announcement did not include any concrete decision on reconstruction in Gaza or its infrastructure destroyed over two years of war.</p><p>For al-Ghoul, reconstruction is not the priority if Israel continues to violate the truce.</p><p>“Reconstruction has no value if Israel’s hand continues destroying and killing.

But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful,” Kavanaugh wrote in the dissent.</p><p>The majority did not address whether companies could get refunded for the billions they have collectively paid in tariffs. Many companies, including the big-box warehouse chain Costco, have already lined up for refunds in court, and Kavanaugh noted the process could be complicated.</p><p>“The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,’ as was acknowledged at oral argument,” he wrote.</p><p>Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Al Jazeera that the court ruling was “definitely a big repudiation of Trump’s tariff agenda and will force him to rely more on other tools, most of which require more public comment period and Congressional authorisation”.</p><p>Friday’s ruling will also, in particular, “rein in Trump’s ability to threaten tariffs against any country for any reason”, Ziemba told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"additional-tariffs\">Additional tariffs</h2><p>Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate, over the next decade, trillions of dollars in revenue for the US, which possesses the world’s largest economy.</p><p>Trump’s administration has not provided tariff collection data since December 14. But Penn Wharton Budget Model economists estimated on Friday that the amount collected in Trump’s tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) stood at more than $175bn. That amount likely would need to be refunded with the Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about a third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.</p><p>Ziemba said she expects Congress to support tariffs on China and perhaps approve secondary tariffs, but many other tariffs, like fentanyl tariffs on Canada and Mexico or broad reciprocal tariffs, “are unlikely to pass”.</p><p>Trump described the tariffs as vital for US economic security, predicting that the country would be defenceless and ruined without them. In November, he told reporters that without his tariffs, “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they’ve used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us.” Trump said the US was abused by other countries, including China, the world’s second-largest economy.</p><p>After the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we’ll have to develop a ‘game two’ plan.”</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the US would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump’s tariffs as possible.</p><p>Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten US national security, and another that allows retaliatory actions, including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the US Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against US exporters.</p><p>None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and they may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.</p><p>But, “the administration is likely to rebuild tariffs through other, more durable, means, [and] the overall tariffs rate may yet end up settling close to current levels,” warned Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. That said, the by-sector and by-country implications could end up looking very different, “which will create another bout of trade policy uncertainty for business, investors, and households. This uncertainty is a key downside risk that could ding, rather than derail, growth this year,” Pearce added.</p></div></div></body></html>"
