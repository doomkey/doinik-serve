Ventura trailed at 34 percent, still likely to secure a much stronger result than the 22.8 percent his anti-immigration Chega party achieved in last year’s general election. Ballots in large cities such as Lisbon and Porto are counted towards the end.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Two exit polls have placed Seguro in the 67-73 percent range, and Ventura at 27-33 percent.</p><p>A succession of storms in recent days has failed to deter voters, with turnout at about the same level as in the first round on January 18, even though three municipal councils in southern and central Portugal had to postpone voting by a week due to floods. The postponement affected some 37,000 registered voters, or about 0.3 percent of the total, and is unlikely to influence the overall result.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Portugal’s presidency is a largely ceremonial role, but it holds some key powers, including the ability to dissolve parliament under certain circumstances.</p><p>Ventura, 43, who had trailed Seguro in opinion polls, had argued that the government’s response to the fierce gales and floods was “useless” and called for the entire election to be postponed.</p><p>However, the authorities rejected the demand.</p><p>Seguro, during his last campaign rally on Friday, accused Ventura of “doing everything to keep the Portuguese from turning out to vote”.</p><p>Despite his loss on Sunday, Ventura, a charismatic former television sports commentator, can now boast increased support, reflecting the growing influence of the far right in Portugal and much of Europe. He is also the first extreme-right candidate to make it through to a run-off vote in Portugal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Seguro has cast himself as the candidate of a “modern and moderate” left, who can actively mediate to avert political crises and defend democratic values. He received backing from prominent conservatives after the first round amid concerns over what many see as Ventura’s populist, hardline tendencies.</p><p>But Prime Minister Luis Montenegro – whose minority centre-right government has to rely on support from either the Socialists or the far right to get legislation through parliament – declined to endorse either candidate in the second round.</p><p>While the role is largely ceremonial, the head of state has the power to dissolve parliament and call early elections.</p><p>The new president will succeed outgoing conservative Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in early March.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But both showed the flaws that have opened the door for Arsenal to potentially end their long wait to be crowned champions once again.</p><p class=\"p1\">Haaland has scored just once from open play in his last 13 games, and an uncharacteristic lack of confidence from the Norwegian showed with the best chance of the first half inside the opening two minutes.</p><p class=\"p1\">Silva’s clever pass split the Liverpool defence, but Haaland’s shot lacked conviction under pressure from Milos Kerkez, and Alisson Becker was able to save low to his left.</p><p class=\"p1\">Haaland hooked another effort straight at Alisson among 10 first-half City attempts without a breakthrough.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Second-half slumps have been a consistent feature of City’s season, and the visitors again faded in the second period until a late flurry saved their title challenge.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hugo Ekitike should have opened the scoring when he completely miscued his header just before the hour mark after a lightning-fast Liverpool break.</p><p class=\"p1\">Marc Guehi was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card when he dragged down Mo Salah just outside the box.</p><p class=\"p1\">But it was City who were left fuming at the award of the free kick that led to the opener when Ryan Gravenberch went down under minimal contact.</p><p class=\"p1\">Szoboszlai scored the only goal with an outrageous free kick when Arsenal visited Anfield in August and produced another stunning strike that clipped the inside of the post before finding the net.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, the Hungarian went from hero to villain when City levelled six minutes from time.</p><p class=\"p1\">Szoboszlai played Silva onside as he slid in to volley home Haaland’s header for City’s first second-half goal in the Premier League this year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Alisson then wiped out Matheus Nunes to concede a penalty and Haaland kept his cool from the spot to put City in front.</p><p class=\"p1\">Pep Guardiola’s men still needed a stunning save from Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip behind Alexis Mac Allister’s deflected shot.</p><p class=\"p1\">With Alisson remaining forward from the resulting corner, the Liverpool goal was open when Cherki took aim from the halfway line to roll the ball into an empty net.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, Haaland and Szoboszlai’s grappling as the ball trickled towards the goal saw the strike ruled out, with a free kick awarded to City instead, and the Liverpool player given his marching orders.</p><p>Silva, who was named player of the match, told Sky Sports that it was a vital win for City.</p><p>“I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over. We felt like we needed to win,” he said.</p><p>“The hope is there, and we are going to fight until the end. We need to keep doing our job that we haven’t lately.”</p><p>Liverpool boss Arne Slot said he was disappointed not to come away with a result and claimed that several key decisions had gone against his side.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“You cannot compare this game with three or four months ago. We have improved so much – but we need to improve the results,” he told Sky.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“So many times this year we haven’t got what I think we deserve, and this is another time.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"palace-end-dire-run-at-brighton\">Palace end dire run at Brighton</h2><p class=\"p1\">Earlier on Sunday, Crystal Palace ended a 12-game winless run in all competitions by beating rival Brighton 1-0.</p><p class=\"p1\">Ismaila Sarr scored the only goal of the match at the Amex Stadium to move Palace nine points clear of the relegation zone and leapfrog Brighton into 13th place.</p><p class=\"p1\">“It was an unbelievable atmosphere and what a way to start my Palace career, a win in a derby,” said Palace’s record signing Jorgen Strand Larsen, who joined from Wolves on deadline day. “It was really important to win, as there has been a run without wins before I joined.</p><p class=\"p1\">“This is the most intense game I have ever played, so I’m tired now, but it is worth it.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Sarr’s winner came after running through in the 61st minute and firing past goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen. It was his second goal in as many games and his 10th of the season.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

She arrived on a visitor’s visa, staying with her mother, a US citizen, in Paterson, New Jersey, home to one of the largest Arab communities in the country.</p><p>She later transitioned from a tourist visa to a student visa, according to her habeas corpus petition.</p><p>After her mother applied for Kordia to remain in the US as the relative of a citizen, her green card application was approved in 2021. However, she received incorrect advice from a teacher that led to her student visa expiring in 2022, according to her lawyers.</p><p>Before her arrest, Kordia worked as a server at a Middle Eastern restaurant on Palestine Way in New Jersey and helped to care for her autistic half-brother.</p><p>Kordia was moved to protest against Israel’s war due to personal loss. Since the start of the war in October 2023, Kordia said, more than 200 of her relatives have been killed.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 170,000 in a war that human rights groups, a United Nations commission and a growing number of scholars said amounts to genocide. Since a “ceasefire” began in October, Israel has killed more than 500 Palestinians and continues to impose curbs on the entry of aid into Gaza.</p><p>If deported, Kordia would be handed over to the Israeli government.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3852409\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852409\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852409\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-05-07T232621Z_1067079386_RC28DEAXD5K3_RTRMADP_3_USA-COLUMBIA-PROTESTS-1753273385.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C524&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pro-Palestinian protesters take over Butler Library on the campus of Columbia University on May 7, 2025 [Ryan Murphy/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-was-kordia-arrested\">Why was Kordia arrested?</h2><p>She was first arrested in April 2024 during a protest outside the gates of Columbia University, but the case was soon dropped.</p><p>On March 13, 2025, Kordia showed up at the ICE headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, for what she believed to be routine immigration questions. She was detained there, “thrown into an unmarked van and sent 1,500 miles [more than 2,400km] away”, Kordia wrote in the USA Today newspaper last month.</p><p>Kordia was neither a student at Columbia University nor a part of political circles.</p><p>“Though I was not a student, I felt compelled to participate. After all, Israel, with the backing of the United States, has laid waste to Gaza, forcibly displacing my family, killing nearly 200 of my relatives,” she wrote in USA Today.</p><p>Today, Kordia is the only person who remains in detention from the Columbia campus demonstrations. She has been held at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas.</p><p>A leader of the protests, Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student with Algerian citizenship and a US green card, and others have been released. Khalil, however, is still in a legal battle to remain in the US with his American wife and child. Last month, an appeals court panel <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-court-hands-trump-victory-against-pro-palestine-activist-mahmoud-khalil\">dismissed</a> a lawsuit Khalil filed challenging his detention and deportation order.

I’m a Palestinian woman who enjoys playing the oud, making pottery and hiking,” Kordia wrote. “Speaking out against what rights groups and experts have called a genocide is my moral duty and – I thought – a constitutionally protected right for all in this country. Except, it seems, when that speech defends Palestinian life.”</p><p>An immigration judge has called for Kordia’s release twice. However, it has been repeatedly blocked through a series of procedural and administrative moves.</p><p>“[The] Trump administration has exploited rarely used procedural loopholes to keep me confined, a practice now being challenged in federal district courts across the country, with many finding the practice unconstitutional,” Kordia wrote.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3572245\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3572245\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3572245\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-10T213424Z_864996646_RC2LADATKEHN_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-COLUMBIA-1741720849.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Demonstrators hold banners as they march during a protest following the arrest by US immigration agents of Palestinian student protester Mahmoud Khalil at Columbia University, in New York City, U.S., March 10, 2025.

Privacy does not exist here.”</p><p>Last year, when Kordia’s cousin Hamzah Abushaban visited her a week after her arrest, he told The Associated Press news agency in an interview that he was taken aback by the dark circles under her eyes and her state of confusion.</p><p>“One of the first things she asked me was why she was there,” Abushaban said. “She cried a lot. She looked like death.”</p><p>Rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders have called her a “political prisoner”, condemning the way her case has proceeded.</p><p>State Representative Salman Bhojani said the conditions at the detention facility were “suffocating”.</p><p>Kordia’s dorm, he said, had 60 mattresses crammed into a space designed for 20 women.</p><p>“She does not even have clothing that fully covers her body. Community organizations have tried to provide more appropriate clothing and have been turned away,” Bhojani said. “Male staff enter the dorm at any time, leaving her body exposed in violation of her religious obligations.”</p><p>Calling for her release, Amnesty International noted that ICE has “repeatedly violated” Kordia’s religious rights. “She has been served almost no halal meals, forcing her to eat food that doesn’t meet her dietary requirements and causing significant weight loss,” the human rights group said in a statement.</p><p>“During Ramadan, staff refused to let her save food for when she could break her fast, forcing her either to go hungry or to break her fast early,” Amnesty said. “She has not been provided with clothing suitable for prayer or a clean prayer space.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4297367\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4297367\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4297367\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-05T225526Z_1154928823_RC2VFJAS7L42_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-NEW-YORK-PROTEST-1770550377.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ICE columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4297367\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People participate in a protest organised by Columbia University students and professors against President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and demand that the school establish itself as a sanctuary campus [File: Amr Alfiky/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-was-kordia-hospitalised\">Why was Kordia hospitalised?</h2><p>On Friday, Abushaban said he heard about Kordia’s hospitalisation in the morning from a person formerly detained with his cousin.</p><p>Kordia had fallen, hit her head and suffered a seizure in a bathroom at the Prairieland Detention Center, he told The Dallas Morning News newspaper.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday, Kordia’s attorneys and family members demanded answers from the Department of Homeland Security and Prairieland Detention Center regarding her health and whereabouts.</p><p>“[Kordia] was reportedly hospitalised yesterday morning after fainting and having a seizure at the Prairieland Detention Center,” the statement said, adding: “Neither her legal team nor family have been provided answers about where she has been hospitalised, the specifics of her health status, and whether and how ICE will ensure her health upon discharge from the undisclosed, off-site hospital.”</p><p>“We have since learned that she is expected to spend another night there, but we still have not been able to speak with her directly or have any confirmation of what brought her to the hospital in the first place,” the statement said.</p><p>The family members told US media that they called all hospitals in the vicinity but could not locate Kordia.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4297369\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4297369\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4297369\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-07T200014Z_173659322_RC277HAZJUAD_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-USA-PROTEST-1770550438.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4297369\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students protest outside Columbia University on the two-year anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel and start of Israel’s war on Gaza [File: Ryan Murphy/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-were-the-columbia-protests-about\">What were the Columbia protests about?</h2><p>In 2024, pro-Palestinian student encampments at Columbia University helped ignite a global movement against Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>The protest sites, however, were broken up after Columbia University allowed hundreds of New York City police officers on campus, leading to dozens of arrests.</p><p>The student protesters demanded an end to Israel’s war in Gaza and the university’s divestment from companies linked to the Israeli military.</p><p>Columbia University imposed severe punishments, including expulsion and revocation of academic degrees, on dozens of students who participated in the protests.

He said China and Russia have also been informed of the content of the talks.</p><p class=\"s6\">“Being afraid is lethal poison in this situation,” Araghchi said about Washington amassing what US President Donald Trump has called a “beautiful armada” near Iran’s waters.</p><h2 id=\"push-the-region-back-years\" class=\"s3\">‘Push the region back years’</h2><p class=\"s6\">Iran’s top military commander on Sunday issued a new warning that the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">entire region will be engulfed in conflict</a> if Iran is attacked.</p><p class=\"s6\">“While being prepared, we genuinely have no desire to see the outbreak of a regional war,” Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi told a gathering of air force and air defence commanders and personnel.</p><p class=\"s6\">“Even though aggressors will be the target of the flames of regional war, this will push back the advancement and development of the region by years, and its repercussions will be borne by the warmongers in the US and the Zionist regime,” he said in reference to Israel.</p><p class=\"s6\">According to Mousavi, Iran “has the necessary power and preparedness for a long-term war with the US”.</p><p class=\"s6\">But many average Iranians are left in limbo without much hope that the talks with the US will lead to results, including for the country’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/protests-grow-as-irans-government-makes-meager-offer-amid-tanking-economy\">heavily declining economy</a>.</p><p class=\"s6\">“I was 20 when the first negotiations with the West over Iran’s nuclear programme were held about 23 years ago,” Saman, who works at a small private investment firm in Tehran, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"s6\">“Our best years are behind us. But it’s even more sad to think that some of the youth who were born at the start of the negotiations were killed on the streets during the protests last month with many hopes and dreams.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"they-never-returned\" class=\"s3\">‘They never returned’</h2><p>Iran is witnessing tense time and threats of a massive US military strike. But the Islamic Republic has not overcome anti-government protests that shook the nation, denouncing the collapse of the national currency, soaring prices and economic hardship.</p><p class=\"s6\">State television continues to broadcast confessions of Iranians arrested during the nationwide protests, many of whom are accused by the state of working in line with the interests of foreign powers.</p><p class=\"s6\">In a report aired late on Saturday, a woman and multiple men with blurred-out faces and in handcuffs could be seen saying they were led by a man who allegedly received weapons and money from Mossad operatives in neighbouring Iraq’s Erbil.</p><p class=\"s6\">“He only wanted more people to die; he shot at everyone,” one of the confessing men said about what allegedly transpired during unrest in the Tehranpars district in the eastern part of the capital, backing the state’s claim that “terrorists” are responsible for all deaths.</p><p>Iranian authorities have accused the US, Israel and European countries of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/trump-cancels-iran-meetings-urges-protesters-to-take-over-institutions\">instigating the protests</a>.</p><p class=\"s6\">But international human rights organisations and foreign-based opposition groups accuse state forces of being behind the unprecedented killings during the protests, which were carried out mostly on the nights of January 8 and 9.</p><p class=\"s6\">The Iranian government claims <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/questions-after-irans-government-releases-victim-list-in-protest-killings\">3,117 people were killed</a>, but the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has documented nearly 7,000 fatalities and is investigating more than 11,600 cases. The United Nations special rapporteur on Iran, Mati Sato, said more than 20,000 may have been killed as information trickles out despite <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/irans-economy-falters-as-internet-shutdown-hits-people-businesses-hard\">heavy internet filtering</a>.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot independently verify these figures.</p><p class=\"s6\">Amid numerous reports that dozens of medical staff were arrested for treating wounded protesters and remain incarcerated in harsh conditions, Iran’s judiciary issued a rejection of the allegations late Saturday. It claimed that only “a limited number of medical personnel were arrested for participating in riots and playing a role in the field”.</p><p class=\"s6\">A large number of schoolchildren and university students were also reportedly among tens of thousands arrested during and in the aftermath of the nationwide protests. The Ministry of Education claimed last week that it did not know how many schoolchildren were arrested, but could confirm that all have since been released.</p><p>The Coordinating Council of Iranian Teachers’ Trade Associations on Sunday released the four-minute video below, titled “200 empty school desks”, which shows the schoolchildren and teenagers confirmed killed during the protests. Many were accompanied by their parents when killed.</p><p></p><p class=\"s6\">One month after the killings, countless families are left grieving and continue to release videos commemorating their loved ones online.</p><p class=\"s6\">A message on Instagram calling on the international community to keep talking about the people of Iran has now been shared more than 1.5 million times.</p><p class=\"s6\">“One month ago today, thousands woke up and ate breakfast for the last time without knowing it, and kissed their mother for the last time without knowing it,” the message reads. “They lived for the last time and never returned.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The PM called Sunday’s snap elections only after three months, in hopes of turning the party’s political fortunes.</p><p>However, Takaichi’s election promise to suspend the eight percent sales tax on food to help households cope with rising prices has spooked investors, who are concerned about how the nation with the heaviest debt burden among advanced economies will fund the plan.</p><p>Nevertheless, residents trudged through winter weather to cast their ballots, with record snowfall in parts of the country snarling traffic and requiring some polling stations to close early.</p><p>“It feels like she’s creating a sense of direction – like the whole country pulling together and moving forward. That really resonates with me,” Kazushige Cho, 54, told Reuters news agency.</p><p>Meanwhile, Niigata resident Mineko Mori, 74, padding through the snow with her dog, said she worried that Takaichi’s tax cuts could saddle future generations with ‌an even bigger burden.</p><h2 id=\"she-can-push-any-legislation\">‘She can push any legislation’</h2><p>Craig Mark, a lecturer at Hosei University, says Takaichi’s apparent success likely gives the LDP the ability to “override the opposition parties”.</p><p>“Essentially, she can push through any legislation she wants, whether it’s <a href=\"/news/2022/12/16/pacifist-japan-unveils-unprecedented-320bn-military-build-up\">the record budget</a> that was recently approved or defence spending,” Mark told Al Jazeera from the capital Tokyo.</p><p>It is also the “greatest chance” for Takaichi to change the country’s image as a pacifist nation, he added. Japan’s post-World War II constitution does not officially recognise the military, and limits it to nominally self-defensive capabilities.</p><p>The head of Japan’s top business lobby, Keidanren, welcomed the result as restoring political stability.</p><p>“Japan’s economy is now at a critical juncture for achieving sustainable and strong growth,” Yoshinobu Tsutsui said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"china-tensions\">China tensions</h2><p>China will also be keeping a close eye on ‌the results.</p><p>Weeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with China in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.</p><p>A strong mandate could accelerate her plans to bolster military defence, which Beijing has cast as an attempt to revive Japan’s militaristic past.</p><p>“Beijing will not welcome Takaichi’s victory,” said David Boling, principal at the Asia Group, a firm that advises companies on geopolitical risk.</p><p>“China now faces the reality that she is firmly in place – and that its efforts to isolate her completely failed.”</p><h2 id=\"takaichi-thanks-trump\">Takaichi thanks Trump</h2><p>On Thursday, US President Donald Trump delivered his endorsement of Takaichi via social media and also took the unusual step of announcing before the results of the voting that she would visit the White House on March 19.</p><p>Trump said the United States and Japan have been working to strike a “very substantial” deal on trade, as well as collaborating on national security. Trump offered his “Complete and Total Endorsement” of Takaichi.</p><p>On Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also hailed a “big victory” for Takaichi and declared that a strong Japan makes the United States “strong in Asia”.</p><p>Takaichi thanked Trump for his “warm words” endorsing her as her party romped to a landslide victory in elections on Sunday.</p><p>“I look forward to visiting the White House this spring and to continuing our work together to further strengthen the Japan–U.S. Alliance,” she wrote on X.</p><p>Underlining that the partnership is “built on deep trust and close, strong cooperation”, she added that “the potential of our Alliance is LIMITLESS”.</p><p>US-Japan trade was $317bn in 2024, and the two nations also have a longstanding security alliance, with some 50,000 US forces based in Japan, a lynchpin of the US military presence in the Asia-Pacific.</p></div></div></body></html>"

One troy ounce is equal to 31.1035 grammes.</p><p>At $5,000 per troy ounce, 1 gramme of gold is worth about $160, and a standard 400-troy-ounce (12.44kg) gold bar costs $2m.</p><p>Troy ounces are different from regular ounces, which weigh 28.35 grammes and are used to measure everyday items including foods.</p><h3>Purity (in karats)</h3><p>Karat or carat (abbreviated as “K” or “ct”) measures the purity of a gold item. Pure gold is 24 karats, while lower karats such as 22, 18, and 9 indicate that the gold is mixed with less expensive metals like silver, copper, or zinc.</p><p>To determine the purity of gold, jewellers are required to stamp a number onto the item, such as 24K or a numeric value like 999, which indicates it is 99.9 percent pure. For example, 18K gold will typically have a stamp of 750, signifying that it is 75 percent pure.</p><p>Some typical values include:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>24 karat – 99.9% purity</strong> – A deep orange colour, is very soft, never tarnishes and is most commonly used for investment coins or bars</li>\n<li><strong>22 karat  – 91.6% purity</strong> – A rich orange colour, moderate durability, resists tarnishing and most often used for luxury jewellery</li>\n<li><strong>18 karat – 75% purity</strong> – A warm yellow colour, high durability, will have some dulling over time and most often used in fine jewellery</li>\n<li><strong>9 karat – 37.5%</strong> <strong>purity</strong> – A pale yellow colour, has the highest durability, dulls over time, used in affordable jewellery</li>\n</ul><p>Other karat amounts such as 14k (58.3% purity) and 10k (41.7% purity) are often sold in different markets around the world.</p><p>When you buy jewellery, the price usually depends on the day’s gold spot price, how much it costs to make, and any taxes.</p><p>If you know the item’s exact weight in grammes and the gold’s purity in karats, you can calculate the craftsmanship cost on top of that.</p><p>You typically cannot negotiate the spot gold price, but you can often haggle over the craftsmanship costs.</p><h2 id=\"the-price-of-gold-has-quadrupled-over-the-past-10-years\">The price of gold has quadrupled over the past 10 years</h2><p>Gold has been valued for thousands of years, serving various functions, from currency to jewellery. The precious metal is widely regarded as a safe haven asset, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or market volatility.</p><p>Up until 1971, the United States dollar was physically defined by a specific weight of gold. Under the classical gold standard, for nearly a century, from 1834 until 1933, you could walk into a bank and exchange $20 for an ounce of gold.</p><p>In 1933, amid the Great Depression, the price was raised to $35 per ounce to stimulate the economy.</p><p>In 1971, under President Richard Nixon, gold was decoupled from the dollar, and its price began to be determined by market forces.</p><p>Over the past 10 years, the price of gold has quadrupled from $1,250 in 2016 to around $5,000 today.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4297179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4297179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4297179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Timeline-of-price-of-gold-1770547790.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Timeline of price of gold-1770547790\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4297179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-the-price-of-gold-determined-in-different-countries\">How is the price of gold determined in different countries?</h2><p data-start=\"99\" data-end=\"726\">Gold is priced globally based on the spot market, where one troy ounce is traded in US dollars on exchanges such as London and New York. Local prices vary as the dollar rate is converted into domestic currencies, and dealers add premiums for minting, distribution and demand.</p><p data-start=\"99\" data-end=\"726\">Taxes and import duties further influence the final cost: India adds 3 percent GST, while the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates impose none on gold investments.</p><p data-start=\"99\" data-end=\"726\">Different countries produce unique gold bullion coins and bars, each with its own distinct features and cultural significance.

A United Nations Development Programme report released in November painted a grim picture: The debris generated by the war creates an “unprecedented obstacle” that could take seven years to clear – and that is only under “ideal conditions”.</p><p>“Gaza stands as one of the most devastated places on earth,” the report said.</p><p>Faced with this reality, Palestinian experts rejected the top-down models for reconstruction proposed in Davos. Abdel Rahman Kitana, professor of architecture at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank, pointed to the <a href=\"https://gaza-city.org/media-center/war_details/59\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Phoenix Plan”</a>, a framework developed by the Union of Gaza Strip Municipalities, as a viable local alternative.</p><p>“Reconstruction is not just about restoring what was destroyed. It is about reshaping life,” Kitana told Al Jazeera Arabic as he warned against disconnected solutions for Gaza. He instead advocated for an “integrated approach” rooted in the Phoenix Plan, under which rubble is not treated as waste but as a resource that could be recycled for land reclamation.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"خبير هندسة معمارية يوضح للجزيرة سبل إعادة إعمار غزة والاستفادة من الركام\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uW2WYUrAbLg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><p>Kitana insisted that any successful plan for Gaza’s reconstruction must be bottom-up. “We cannot succeed without the people themselves. … They know their needs and their dreams,” he said, warning that ignoring local agencies will lead to a “fragile, alienating environment”.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-dual-use-rule\">Israel’s ‘dual use’ rule</h2><p>However, both the UN’s seven-year reconstruction timeline and the “Phoenix Plan” face a critical hurdle: Israel’s “<a href=\"/news/2025/2/3/gaza-authorities-plead-for-tents-accuse-israel-of-obstructing-aid\">dual use</a>” list.</p><p>Historically, Israel has banned items such as fertilisers and steel pipes under the pretext that they could be used for military purposes. Today, that list has expanded to include more essential items, including oxygen cylinders, cancer medicines and water filters.</p><p>Jabareen says the blockade is no longer a pretext for security but a “philosophy of governance”.</p><p>“Israel has turned the ‘dual use’ excuse into a mechanism of indefinite delay,” he said.</p><p>By requiring project-by-project approval for every sack of cement, Israel ensures that reconstruction remains a perpetual “project” that keeps donor countries and agencies exhausted and the Palestinian administration in “a state of constant begging”, Jabareen said.</p><h2 id=\"silent-demographic-engineering\">‘Silent demographic engineering’</h2><p>While Israel blocks key materials on the ground, the Trump administration is creating a “political fantasy” abroad, experts said. Gaza’s Board of Peace, pushed by Trump, promises a $10bn gross domestic product boost to Gaza and a “New Rafah” with 100,000 housing units.</p><p>Jabareen viewed the plans, which include “waterfront properties” and “industrial zones”, as a form of “silent demographic engineering”.</p><p>“They are trying to shift the Palestinian cause from a national rights issue to a real estate problem,” he said. The goal, he argues, is to design a Gaza that is “economically useful” to the region but “nationally hollowed out”.</p><p>By focusing on “investments” and “tourism” while ignoring the rubble and the mass graves, the plan seeks to “legitimise a political fantasy”, Jabareen said. “If you can’t displace the Palestinian by force, you displace his idea of home by re-engineering his space.”</p><p>So who will eventually build this “New Gaza”? Jabareen warned of a “privatisation of occupation” even if Israeli companies do not enter Gaza directly.</p><p>“Reconstruction is a chain of indirect profits,” he noted, adding that the logistics of inspection, the security firms managing the crossings and the insurance companies covering the risks will all generate revenue for Israeli or allied firms.</p><p>The contracts for reconstruction themselves become a political filter. “This creates an international ‘market of obedience’,” Jabareen said. “The donor who objects is excluded, and the contractor who asks questions on sovereignty is replaced.”</p><h2 id=\"silent-transfer\">‘Silent transfer’</h2><p>Jabareen said the most dangerous aspect of such a policy is the “weaponisation of time itself”.</p><p>With UN assessments indicating that removing debris alone could last until 2032 and a full reconstruction of Gaza stretching to 2040, the “wait” becomes a policy of displacement.</p><p>“Time decomposes societies,” Jabareen said.</p><p>He said Israel is betting on “rational emigration” – after living for years in tents, Palestinians will leave, not because they were forced by tanks, but because they were exhausted by fears over their future.</p><p>“The long wait is not condemned by the international community. Israel realises that bombing brings condemnation, but bureaucratic delay brings only silence,” Jabareen said. “If the fighter jets failed to displace them, the waiting might succeed.”</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Who pays to rebuild Gaza after Israel's devastating war? | Counting the Cost\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXYBb_7_Esk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p></div></div></body></html>"

Cuba relied on foreign allies for oil shipments, such as Mexico, Russia, and Venezuela.</p><p>However, after the US forces abducted Venezuelan President Maduro, Washington blocked any Venezuelan oil from going to Cuba. Trump now says the Cuban government is ready to fall.</p><p>Under Trump, Washington has pivoted to the Western Hemisphere, which it wants to dominate. The military actions in Venezuela, the pledge to take over Greenland and changing the government in Cuba are part of the new policy.</p><p>Last month, Trump signed an executive order – labelling Cuba a threat to national security – imposing tariffs on any country that sells or provides oil to the island nation. Further pressure on the Mexican government reportedly led to oil stocks reaching a record low in Cuba.</p><p>“It looks like it’s something that’s just not going to be able to survive,” Trump told reporters last month, when questioned about the Cuban economy. “It is a failed nation.”</p><p>Havana has rejected accusations that it poses a threat to US security. Last week, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling for dialogue.</p><p>“The Cuban people and the American people benefit from constructive engagement, lawful cooperation, and peaceful coexistence. Cuba reaffirms its willingness to maintain a respectful and reciprocal dialogue, oriented toward tangible results, with the United States government, based on mutual interest and international law,” <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/cuba-denies-security-threat-accusations-as-us-raises-pressure\">a statement from the ministry said</a> on February 2.</p><p>Trump’s goals in Cuba remain unclear; however, US officials have noted on multiple occasions that they would like to see the government change.</p><p>Responding to a question during a US Senate hearing on Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “We would like to see the regime there change. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to make a change, but we would love to see a change.”</p><p>Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, is one of the most powerful figures in Trump’s administration.</p><p>“The Cuban-American lobby, which Rubio represents, is one of the most powerful foreign policy lobbies in the United States today,” Ed Augustin, an independent journalist in Havana, told Al Jazeera’s <em>The Take</em>.</p><p>“In the new Trump administration, [with] an unprecedented number of Cuban Americans, the lobbyists have become the policymakers,” he said, adding that Rubio has built firm control over the lobby.</p><p>On January 31, Trump told reporters, “It doesn’t have to be a humanitarian crisis.

Two years later, US President Barack Obama travelled to Havana to meet Raul Castro.</p><p>However, during his first term as president, Trump reversed the historic move in 2017. Since then, the US has reimposed a raft of sanctions against Cuba, especially economic restrictions, leading to one of the worst economic crises in the island nation’s history.
