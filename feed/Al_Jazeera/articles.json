            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"292\" data-end=\"500\">“I don’t want them in our country. I’ll be honest with you, OK. Somebody will say, ‘Oh, that’s not politically correct.’ I don’t care. I don’t want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason …”</p><p data-start=\"502\" data-end=\"1049\">This is what United States President Donald Trump had to say about Somali migrants on the first day of an immigration crackdown targeting their community. He insisted that Somali migrants have turned the US state of Minnesota, where some 2 percent of the population is of Somali descent, into a “hellhole” and should be “out of here”. Then, directing his ire at his vocal critic, Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born Democratic representative from Minnesota, Trump said, “She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people who work. These aren’t people who say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great. ’”</p><p data-start=\"1051\" data-end=\"1585\">Of course, none of this is new or surprising. Hatred of migrants and asylum seekers has always been the glue that holds Trump’s MAGAverse together. Who can forget that, before his cordial meeting with Trump at the White House, several MAGA Republicans made serious efforts to revoke the US citizenship of New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Since Trump’s rise to power, hostility to migrants has become not just a mainstream component of contemporary politics in the United States but a governing principle.</p><p data-start=\"1587\" data-end=\"1901\">But the rise in anti-migrant sentiment, and its validation and promotion by those in positions of power, is not exclusive to Trump’s increasingly insular America. Similar rhetoric and tactics are gaining ground elsewhere, revealing a global trend that extends far beyond the United States. Denmark is one such example.</p><p data-start=\"1903\" data-end=\"2459\">Beneath its long-cultivated image as a progressive, humane and orderly society built on universal healthcare, Lego, highly liveable cities and minimalist designer aesthetics, Denmark has in recent years become one of Europe’s most restrictive states on immigration and asylum. During the recently concluded local elections, Islamophobic rhetoric was on full display, and in the lead-up to the 2026 national elections, the ruling Social Democrats have placed their commitment to tackling the so-called problem of immigration at the centre of their campaign.</p><p data-start=\"2461\" data-end=\"3251\">Across the pond, in the United Kingdom, the supposedly progressive Labour government seems eager to follow the Danish example. Under pressure from the far right and Reform UK’s enduring rise in the polls, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is eager to convince people that he can be trusted to take back control of our borders and close the book on a squalid chapter of Britain’s immigration policy. He has warned that the UK risks becoming an island of strangers unless immigration is sharply reduced, and has promised that his government’s reforms will ensure that migration will fall. That is a promise. Most strikingly, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood recently sent officials to Denmark to study its immigration and asylum regime, a gesture that underscores how dramatically Labour’s stance has hardened.</p><p data-start=\"3253\" data-end=\"3450\">Xenophobia is also on the rise outside the Western world. It is a staple of policy and practice from Libya to South Africa, a reminder that anti-migrant politics is now a global tool of governance.</p><p data-start=\"3452\" data-end=\"4213\">Europe-bound migrants in Libya face horrific levels of violence and abuse. According to Amnesty International, they are subjected to prolonged arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture, rape, unlawful killings, extortion and forced labour. These abuses occur within a system effectively underwritten by European governments, which have funnelled funding, training and equipment to Libyan coastguard units tasked with intercepting migrants before they reach international waters. Keen to stem the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean, European Union states have outsourced border control to Libya despite knowing the consequences, supporting the authorities’ ability to continue with measures the United Nations says could very likely amount to crimes against humanity.</p><p data-start=\"4215\" data-end=\"5002\">Further west, in Tunisia, Black African migrants have faced sporadic violence for years. In early 2023, President Kais Saied claimed there was a criminal plan to change Tunisia’s demographic makeup through irregular migration, turning it into a purely African country that has no affiliation to the Arab and Islamic nations. His remarks triggered a surge in mob attacks on Black migrants, students and asylum seekers. There was also an increase in arrests, and the police appeared to be targeting Black African foreigners based on their appearance. Those detained included undocumented migrants, registered refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with valid credentials, a stark demonstration of how state practices can shift once xenophobia is given political sanction.</p><p data-start=\"5004\" data-end=\"5625\">Similarly, xenophobia targeting migrants from other African countries has been a constant feature of life and politics in post-apartheid South Africa. According to Xenowatch, a project hosted by the University of the Witwatersrand that tracks xenophobic discrimination and violence, there have been 1,295 recorded incidents since 1994, including displacement, looting of migrant-owned businesses and killings. Deaths peaked in 2008 with 72 fatalities and 150 incidents. In 2025, while 16 people were killed, the overall number of xenophobic incidents again reached 2008 levels, underscoring the persistence of the crisis.</p><p data-start=\"5627\" data-end=\"6366\">During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government systematically overlooked migrant communities, excluding many from relief programmes and framing protection of South Africans as the priority. The state also constructed a 40-kilometre fence along the border with Zimbabwe to block infected or undocumented persons, despite Zimbabwe having only 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time compared with South Africa’s 1,845. Politicians reinforced existing myths about foreign-owned businesses posing health risks. When announcing that spaza shops could remain open, the then-Minister of Small Business Development, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, declared that only South African-owned, managed and run shops would remain open.</p><p data-start=\"6368\" data-end=\"6776\">South Africa has also seen the rise of explicitly anti-immigrant mobilisation. The Put South Africans First movement, a coalition of civil society groups advocating the mass deportation of African migrants, organised a march to the Nigerian and Zimbabwean embassies on September 23, 2020, claiming that foreigners contribute to South Africa’s social ills such as drugs, human trafficking and child abductions.</p><p data-start=\"6778\" data-end=\"7229\">The vigilante group Operation Dudula emerged from this movement in 2021, following the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma. Although it claims to address crime and drug use in Gauteng communities, its name, Dudula – meaning “force out” in isiZulu – captures its true focus. The group is better known for calling for mass deportations, blocking migrants from accessing hospitals and clinics, and raiding or shutting down foreign-owned businesses.</p><p data-start=\"7231\" data-end=\"7718\">Of course, I could keep going, from increasing restrictions in countries like Colombia, Peru, Chile and Ecuador aimed at stemming the influx of Venezuelan migrants, to Indian authorities forcibly expelling ethnic Bengali Muslims to Bangladesh without due process, domestic guarantees and international human rights standards, claiming that they are undocumented. Xenophobia is not confined to any region or ideology; it is now woven into the political life of countries across the globe.</p><p data-start=\"7720\" data-end=\"8130\">Why are we so keen to give in to xenophobic narratives and policies? In part because they are convenient. They allow governments and societies to externalise domestic failures, offering an easy explanation for problems that are far more complex and often rooted in political and economic mismanagement at home, in austerity, deepening inequality and precarious work rather than in the arrival of strangers.</p><p data-start=\"8132\" data-end=\"8504\">In this logic, the migrant becomes a ready-made scapegoat, a figure onto whom we project all the ills we believe threaten who we are or what we stand for. It then becomes effortless to claim that migrants subscribe to dangerous ideologies, strain national resources, carry diseases or form part of some insidious plan to alter the country’s demographic or cultural fabric.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\">Perception becomes reality. Blaming those beyond our borders allows us to imagine the threat lies elsewhere, reassuring us that we are not the problem. The tragedy is that the dysfunctions and corruptions embedded in our own systems remain untouched. And scapegoating the supposed outsider does nothing to make our societies fairer, safer or more humane; it merely buys time for leaders unwilling to confront the crises they helped create.</p><p data-start=\"8506\" data-end=\"8949\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

We can no longer trust federal health authorities when it comes to vaccines,” Michael Osterholm, the director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told the news agency Reuters.</p><p>“In voting to eliminate the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, ACIP ignored decades of evidence confirming its strong safety profile and effectiveness. Its decision will result in more hepatitis B infections and more people with chronic liver disease.”</p><p>He added that, if ACIP continues to ignore the evidence about vaccine efficacy and safety, “parents and clinicians must ignore ACIP”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-hepatitis-b\">What is hepatitis B?</h2><p>Each year, around the world, 1.2 million people become newly infected with hepatitis B. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.1 million deaths in 2022 were also linked to the virus.</p><p>Hepatitis B is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and children could potentially acquire the virus through activities as simple as sharing a toothbrush.</p><p>Infections are known to shorten life spans and can potentially lead to fatal conditions like cirrhosis — a kind of tissue scarring that causes liver failure — and liver cancer.</p><p>For most people, the hepatitis B vaccine confers lifelong protection against the virus.</p><p>The first shot in the three-dose regimen is usually given shortly after birth. For a healthy baby, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had previously advised that doctors administer the first dose within 24 hours of birth.</p><p>For a child born to a parent who tests positive for hepatitis B, the first vaccination should be even sooner, 12 hours after birth.</p><p>For children born premature and underweight, the advice was formerly to wait a month before administering the first dose.</p><p>The third and final dose typically comes before the infant reaches 18 months old.</p><p>Prior to Friday’s announcement, health experts in the US government had also recommended vaccination for all infants. Those guidelines had been in place for decades, stretching back to 1991, and the vaccine itself has been available since the 1980s.</p><h2 id=\"changing-health-guidelines\">Changing health guidelines</h2><p>But Kennedy has pushed to review vaccination guidelines since taking office as part of President Donald Trump’s second-term cabinet.</p><p>The son of former Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, the younger Kennedy is an environmental lawyer and former presidential candidate who gained notoriety as a vaccine sceptic.</p><p>While he has repeatedly claimed he is not “anti-vaccine”, he has been accused of spreading vaccine conspiracy theories.</p><p>In 2021, for instance, he told an audience of Louisiana politicians that the COVID-19 shot was the “deadliest vaccine ever made”. In 2005, he also published an article linking vaccines to autism and other neurological disorders, promoting a widely discredited theory. That article was later retracted by its publishers.</p><p>In February, Kennedy was confirmed as Trump’s health and human services secretary, despite having no professional medical experience. The position oversees a range of health and welfare agencies, including Medicaid, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Under his leadership, the US government swiftly changed its approach to certain vaccines.</p><p>In August, for example, the FDA limited its guidance for who should take the COVID-19 vaccine. Only people aged 65 and up, or people with health conditions, were recommended for the vaccine.</p><p>Critics warned that change could limit the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine and force younger people to get a prescription and pay out of pocket for the preventive care.</p><p>Last month, the CDC under his leadership also removed assurances that vaccines do not cause autism from its website.</p><p>Meanwhile, he has pulled government funding from research into mRNA vaccines — the technology used for the COVID-19 vaccination — and changed the standards for vaccine development.</p><h2 id=\"shakeup-at-acip\">Shake-up at ACIP</h2><p>One of the most prominent changes Kennedy has made, however, has been at the ACIP, a panel focused on vaccines that has been in existence since 1964.</p><p>In June, Kennedy fired the 17-member committee and replaced them with figures that critics say are largely sceptical of vaccination or have little research background in the area.</p><p>Kennedy defended the mass firing as necessary to maintain the independence of the panel and defend “unbiased science”.</p><p>“Today we are prioritizing the restoration of public trust above any specific pro- or anti-vaccine agenda,” he said in a statement.</p><p>But public health experts expressed outrage that trusted officials were fired and replaced with those who seemed to reflect Kennedy’s own beliefs.</p><p>Despite the shake-up on the panel, its membership was nevertheless split over the issue of changing the recommendation for the hepatitis B vaccine.</p><p>A vote on the issue had been delayed twice since September. During Friday’s vote, one ACIP member, paediatrics professor Cody Meissner, cited the medical duty to “do no harm”.</p><p>“We are doing harm by changing this wording. And I vote no,” he said in his vote.</p><p>But the majority of the ACIP panel ultimately decided to back the change, citing the “flexibility” it offered to new parents. The CDC’s guidelines, however, were not previously binding.</p><p>Industry groups responded with grave concerns about the ambiguity the change would create.</p><p>“The science is clear: the hepatitis B birth dose saves lives, and there is no new evidence to justify delaying or removing this critical protection,” the American Pharmacists Association said in a statement.</p><p>A former CDC director, Thomas Frieden, called on the public to stand against the change.</p><p>“Now obstetricians, pediatricians, insurers, state health departments and others should stand up for fact-based care, protect our children, and not mess with success — not accept this misguided and dangerous recommendation,” he wrote.</p><p>The ACIP decision is now set to go before the director of the CDC, Jim O’Neill, for final approval.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It reflected Trump’s disdain for multilateralism and international organisations, saying that the “world’s fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state”.</p><p>Here are five key takeaways from the document.</p><h2 id=\"hemispheric-dominance\">Hemispheric dominance</h2><p>The US is seeking to “restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” by reinforcing the <a href=\"/news/2019/6/19/trump-revives-monroe-doctrine-as-warning-to-china-and-russia\">Monroe Doctrine</a> – a 19th-century US policy in opposition to European colonisation and interference in the Americas.</p><p>Other than deterring foreign influence in the hemisphere, it will push to combat the drug trade and irregular migration while encouraging “private economies”.</p><p>“We will reward and encourage the region’s governments, political parties, and movements broadly aligned with our principles and strategy,” the document reads.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has already put this approach into action by publicly backing conservative politicians in Latin America and bailing out the Argentinian economy under right-wing President <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/us-buys-argentinian-pesos-finalises-20bn-currency-swap-says-us-treasury\">Javier Melei</a> with $40bn.</p><p>“We will deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere,” the document says.</p><p>“This ‘Trump Corollary’ to the Monroe Doctrine is a common-sense and potent restoration of American power and priorities, consistent with American security interests.”</p><p>The NSS also calls for shifting US military assets to the Western Hemisphere, “away from theatres whose relative import to American national security has declined in recent decades”.</p><p>The strategy comes as the US ramps up its deadly <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/us-military-kills-four-in-latest-strike-on-boat-in-the-caribbean\">attacks on boats</a> in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean that it says are carrying drugs.</p><p>The Trump administration has also ordered a military buildup around Venezuela, raising speculations that Washington may be looking to topple left-wing President <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/maduro-rejects-a-slaves-peace-for-venezuela-as-us-ramps-up-pressure\">Nicolas Maduro</a> by force.</p><h2 id=\"deterring-conflict-over-taiwan\">Deterring conflict over Taiwan</h2><p>The last two National Security Strategies, including the one released during Trump’s first term in the White House, described the <a href=\"/news/2022/5/26/blinken-lays-out-us-strategy-to-counter-china-as-rivalry-grows\">competition with China</a> as the top priority for the US.</p><p>But the rivalry with Beijing was not put front and centre in this NNS.</p><p>Still, the document highlighted the need to win the economic competition in Asia and to rebalance trade with China. To that end, it stressed the need to work with Asian allies to provide a counterweight to Beijing, singling out India.</p><p>“We must continue to improve commercial (and other) relations with India to encourage New Delhi to contribute to Indo-Pacific security,” it said.</p><p>The document spelt out the risks of China seizing Taiwan by force, noting that the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own, is a major producer of computer chips.</p><p>It also underscored that <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/china-warns-foreign-interference-in-taiwan-will-be-crushed\">capturing Taiwan</a> would give China access to the Second Island Chain in the Asia Pacific and bolster its position in the South China Sea, a vital artery for global trade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Hence deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority,” the NNS says.</p><p>The strategy called on US partners in the area to increase their military spending to deter conflict.</p><p>“We will build a military capable of denying aggression anywhere in the First Island Chain,” it said.</p><p>“But the American military cannot, and should not have to, do this alone. Our allies must step up and spend—and more importantly do—much more for collective defence.”</p><h2 id=\"berating-europe\">Berating Europe</h2><p>Although Trump has <a href=\"/news/2025/5/9/tufts-university-student-rumeysa-ozturk-ordered-released-from-ice-detention\">cracked down on speech</a> critical of Israel in the US and ordered the Department of Justice to target his political rivals, the NNS scorned Europe over what it called “censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition”.</p><p>The strategy proclaimed that Europe is facing the “prospect of civilizational erasure” due to migration policies and “failed focus on regulatory suffocation”.</p><p>It also hit out at European officials’ “unrealistic expectations” for the war between Russia and Ukraine, saying that the US has a “core interest” in ending the conflict.</p><p>A US proposal to end the war, which would allow Russia to hold on to large territories in eastern Ukraine, garnered <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/us-ukraine-talks-why-are-european-leaders-opposing-trumps-peace-plan\">rare criticism</a> from some European leaders last month.</p><p>The NNS blamed, without providing examples, the “subversion of democratic processes” for what it described as some European governments’ unresponsiveness to their people’s desire for peace.</p><p>The document also suggested that the US may withdraw the security umbrella it has long held over the old continent.</p><p>Instead, Washington would prioritise “enabling Europe to stand on its own feet and operate as a group of aligned sovereign nations, including by taking primary responsibility for its own defence, without being dominated by any adversarial power”, the NNS reads.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"switching-focus-from-the-middle-east\">Switching focus from the Middle East</h2><p>The NSS stresses that the Middle East is no longer the top strategic priority for the US.</p><p>It says that past considerations that made the region so important – namely, energy production and widespread conflict – “no longer hold”.</p><p>With the US ramping up its own energy production, “America’s historic reason for focusing on the Middle East will recede,” the strategy says.</p><p>It goes on to argue that the conflict and violence in the region are also subsiding, citing the ceasefire in Gaza and the US attack on <a href=\"/news/2025/11/6/trump-says-he-was-very-much-in-charge-of-israels-june-13-attack-on-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iran in June</a>, which it said “significantly degraded” Tehran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>“Conflict remains the Middle East’s most troublesome dynamic, but there is today less to this problem than headlines might lead one to believe,” it reads.</p><p>The US administration envisioned a rosy future for the region, saying that instead of dominating Washington’s interests, the Middle East  “will increasingly become a source and destination of international investment”, including in artificial intelligence.</p><p>It describes the region as an “emerging as a place of partnership, friendship, and investment”.</p><p>But in reality, the Middle East continues to be beset by crises and violence. Despite the truce in Gaza, near-daily Israeli attacks have continued as deadly <a href=\"/news/2025/7/12/family-of-american-citizen-killed-by-israeli-settlers-demands-us-probe\">raids by settlers</a> and soldiers against Palestinians escalate in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Israel has also been stepping up its air strikes in Lebanon, augmenting fears of another all-out assault against the country to disarm a weakened Hezbollah by force.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Syria, a year into the fall of the government of former President Bashar al-Assad, Israel has pushed on with incursions <a href=\"/news/2025/11/30/israel-attacks-on-syria-what-happened-who-did-israel-claim-it-was-after\">and strikes</a> in an effort to militarily dominate the south of the country beyond the occupied Golan Heights.</p><p>And with its uncompromising commitment to Israel’s security, the US remains deeply entrenched in the region with continuing military presence in Syria, Iraq and the Gulf area.</p><p>The NSS acknowledges that the US continues to have key interests in the Middle East, including ensuring “that Israel remains secure” and protecting energy supplies and shipping lanes.</p><p>“But the days in which the Middle East dominated American foreign policy in both long-term planning and day-to-day execution are thankfully over – not because the Middle East no longer matters, but because it is no longer the constant irritant, and potential source of imminent catastrophe, that it once was,” it says.</p><h2 id=\"flexible-realism\">‘Flexible realism’</h2><p>The US will pursue its own interests in dealing with other countries, the document says, suggesting that Washington will not push for the spread of democracy and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/2/restricted-nearly-7-billion-people-worldwide-lack-full-civil-rights\">human rights</a>.</p><p>“We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world without imposing on them democratic or other social change that differs widely from their traditions and histories,” it said.</p><p>“We recognise and affirm that there is nothing inconsistent or hypocritical in acting according to such a realistic assessment or in maintaining good relations with countries whose governing systems and societies differ from ours even as we push like-minded friends to uphold our shared norms, furthering our interests as we do so.”</p><p>However, the strategy suggests the US will still press some countries – namely Western partners – over what it sees as important values.</p><p>“We will oppose elite-driven, anti-democratic restrictions on core liberties in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world, especially among our allies,” it said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Warner CEO David Zazlav will also step down following the completion of the merger.</p><p>The deal would give Netflix ownership of iconic franchises such as “Game of Thrones”, “DC Comics” and “Harry Potter”. It is also expected to raise antitrust concerns in Europe and the United States that the purchase would greatly increase the buying power of Netflix, which is already a dominant force in Hollywood.</p><p>Netflix has said that the deal would create more jobs and opportunities for talent. Representatives for the company were unable to provide details to Al Jazeera on how that would happen.</p><p>“If I was tasked with doing so, I could not think of a more effective way to reduce competition in Hollywood than selling WBD to Netflix,” Jason Kilar, the former CEO of Warner Media, <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonkilar/status/1996704106489205074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in a post on the social media platform X.</p><p>“The potential Netflix/Warner Bros transaction is a consolidation that may serve the financial interests of shareholders of both companies, but which raises many serious questions about its impact on the future of the entertainment industry, and especially the human creative talent whose livelihoods and careers depend on it,” the Screen Actor’s Guild (SAG-AFTRA) said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Al Jazeera also reached out to the Writer’s Guild but the group did not respond to request for comment.</p><p>The merger, if approved, will add HBO Max’s 128 million subscribers to Netflix’s more than 300 million, creating a formidable player.</p><p>Cinema United, a global exhibition trade association, has said the deal poses an “unprecedented threat” to movie theatres worldwide.</p><p>“In light of the current regulatory environment, this will raise eyebrows and concerns. The combined dominant streaming player will be heavily scrutinised,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"scrutiny-from-washington\">Scrutiny from Washington</h2><p>Even before the bids were in, some members of Congress said a Netflix–Warner Bros Discovery deal could harm consumers and Hollywood. The White House also weighed in, with the administration viewing it with “heavy scepticism”, according to CNBC, which cited an unnamed senior administration official.</p><p>US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said the move will be an “anti-trust nightmare” and stressed that the merger would limit choice for consumers.</p><p>“A Netflix-Warner Bros would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said.</p><p>US Representative Pramila Jayapal, who co-chairs the House Monopoly Busters Caucus, also called the deal a “nightmare”.</p><p>“It would mean more price hikes, ads, &amp; cookie cutter content, less creative control for artists, and lower pay for workers,” Jayapal said in a post on the social media site X. “The media industry is already controlled by a few corporations with too much power to censor free speech. The gov’t must step in,” she added.</p><p>Republicans, too, said the deal would reduce choice for consumers and give Netflix an unacceptably high share of the streaming industry.</p><p>The proposed merger is underscored by US President Donald Trump’s view of the news organisations that cover his administration. CBS News, which is owned by Paramount-Skydance, has close ties to the Trump administration.</p><p>Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison’s son, David Ellison, leads Paramount-Skydance. The elder Ellison is considered to be close to Trump. Paramount-Skydance has been accused of making choices that align with the White House’s wishes, including the cancellation of The Late Show with <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/18/cbs-cancels-colberts-late-show-amid-pending-paramount-skydance-merger\">Stephen Colbert,</a> as host Stephen Colbert was critical of the president. The network has said that the decision was not political in nature.</p><p>In September, the network appointed Kenneth Weinstein as ombudsman and to review allegations of bias, even though Weinstein has no background in journalism, has been a Trump donor and had earlier headed a conservative think tank. In October, the network appointed conservative opinion writer Bari Weiss, who previously had no experience in television, to lead the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/conservative-writer-bari-weiss-named-editor-in-chief-of-cbs-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legacy broadcaster’s news division.</a></p><p>Warner Bros Discovery owns news network CNN, and there were concerns that, should Paramount own it, it could bring in leadership that is aligned with Trump and the Republican Party, as have been the concerns about CBS.</p><p>On Wall Street, Netflix is down 0.8 percent in midday trading while Warner Bros Discovery is up 3.5 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, they have attracted rising numbers of accusations of gross violations, ranging from killings to neglectful disposal of military grade chemicals. The most notorious case was the murder of a 21-year-old Kenyan woman, <a href=\"/news/2025/9/20/kenya-court-orders-uk-soldiers-arrest-for-agnes-wanjiru-death-all-we-know\">Agnes Wanjiru</a>, which gained international media attention.</p><p>Community activists who have for years sought redress in Kenyan courts told Al Jazeera the report’s publication represented an “enormous victory” not just for Kenya, but for other African countries which host foreign military bases on their territory, but are wary of regulating them.</p><p>“The Kenyan parliament has demonstrated that the British Army is not above the law,” said James Mwangi, founder of the grassroots advocacy group, Africa Centre for Corrective and Preventive Action (ACCPA), which has been at the forefront of bringing community grievances to Kenyan courts, and which advised lawmakers during their investigation.</p><p>“The impunity that has been perpetrated by these forces has been appalling.

It has been stationed there since Kenyan independence from the UK in 1963 and has about 100 permanent staff and some 280 rotating short-term troops from the United Kingdom.</p><p>The unit trains British troops and provides anti-terrorism training for Kenyan troops fighting the al-Shabab armed group, as agreed in the UK-Kenya Defence Cooperation Agreement, which, since 2015, allows both armies to share intelligence and training.</p><p>In 2022, the UK government reported that BATUK had contributed more than 5.8 billion Kenyan shillings ($45m) to the local economies in which its garrisons are based, and that it employed more than 550 local staff. Local businesses close to BATUK training sites also benefit from the unit’s presence, it said.</p><p>However, there have been numerous complaints from local people about the conduct of the troops. They say mishandling of dangerous training material and unexploded bombs left in the ground have caused serious injuries, and they have complained about how British soldiers behave towards Kenyan women in the area.</p><p>Many Kenyan women say they have been left to care for children alone after British soldiers they began relationships with left the country at the end of their training.</p><p>There has been no mechanism within the UK or Kenyan justice systems to hold British soldiers under BATUK to account. On that basis, the UK government initially pushed back against Kenyan authorities’ attempts to investigate the troops’ behaviour.</p><p>In April 2024, therefore, the Kenyan parliament voted to amend the defence agreement with the UK to allow for local prosecutions of British soldiers.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-new-report-say\">What does the new report say?</h2><p>The 94-page inquiry into the conduct of BATUK troops was released following a one-and-a-half-year investigation by the Kenyan parliament’s defence, intelligence and foreign relations committee.</p><p>The report examined complaints from residents in Laikipia and Samburu counties in central Kenya, close to where the BATUK camp is. Lawmakers began conducting public hearings to hear evidence in June 2024, with victims detailing harrowing accounts of mistreatment by BATUK soldiers. BATUK did not cooperate with the parliamentary investigation, the committee noted.</p><p>The report found that BATUK soldiers showed a “disturbing trend” of sexual misconduct, including rape, assault and the neglect of children fathered by the troops.</p><p>It found that an internal inquiry by BATUK in 2003 had mishandled evidence and failed to provide justice for women who brought complaints.</p><p>BATUK, which the report said does not conduct environmental impact assessments for its field exercises, has also caused serious environmental damage. In at least one case, a major fire killed livestock and destroyed 4,900 hectares (12,000 acres) of vegetation. BATUK also illegally dumped military waste and toxic materials openly, breaking Kenyan environmental law, the report concluded.</p><p>Additionally, the Kenyan parliament said British troops showed “gross negligence” in the way they handled unexploded ordnance during their training and that their neglect had led to multiple deaths and injuries.</p><p>Communities were routinely not informed about loud training drills, leading to shock, injury or trauma in some cases.</p><p>Kenyan workers hired to clean up ammunition debris were not provided with protective gear in line with Kenyan labour laws, the report added.</p><p>Complainants who brought claims of injuries to BATUK were not fairly compensated, the report found.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152404\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152404\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152404\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-05T125730Z_410950668_RC2M9IAA8GPL_RTRMADP_3_KENYA-BRITAIN-MILITARY-1764941955.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C491&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"BATUK\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152404\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) signage stands next to the road, as Kenya’s parliament accuse British soldiers of decades of sexual abuse, killings, human rights violations and environmental destruction while training in the country, in Nanyuki, Laikipia County, Kenya, December 4, 2025 [Monicah Mwangi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-other-abuses-is-batuk-accused-of\">What other abuses is BATUK accused of?</h2><p>Thousands of serious allegations against BATUK members have been made by locals. At the public hearings which parliament conducted, the mother of a young woman testified in June 2024 that her daughter had been the victim of a hit-and-run incident involving a BATUK truck, which left her wheelchair-bound. BATUK paid for the daughter’s hospital bills for two years, but did not compensate the family beyond that, she said.</p><p>Another mother, who attended a hearing holding her five-year-old daughter, narrated how she had been abandoned by a British soldier with whom she had been in a consensual relationship when he discovered she was pregnant. The soldier is believed to have since left Kenya. The woman said she needed child support.</p><p>Survivors of a huge March 2021 wildfire, which started at the privately-owned Lolldaiga Conservancy nature reserve in Laikipia, where BATUK carries out trainings, also brought complaints. The nature reserve houses wildlife like elephants, buffalo, lions, and the endangered Grevy zebra.</p><p>The blaze, which raged for four days, is believed to have started after BATUK used white phosphorus, a lethal chemical, during a training exercise. The resulting fire ripped through the nature reserve’s grounds, burning 4,900 hectares (12,000 acres). It killed livestock and pushed fleeing wild animals to swaths of farm land further afield. Community members said the smoke was so heavy that it lingered for days and caused eye and breathing problems.</p><p>One man named Linus Murangiri was crushed by a moving vehicle as he rushed to help put out the fire, the BBC reported.</p><p>In 2022, the UK’s Ministry of Defence claimed that the fire was likely caused by a camp stove that had been knocked over during an exercise.</p><p>In August 2025, the UK agreed to pay what it called a “generous” settlement to the 7,723 claimants who sued BATUK over the incident with the help of organisations like ACCPA. The BBC reported that compensation amounted to just 2.9 million pounds ($3.9m).</p><p>The British government has also supported the restoration of burned areas on the conservancy where BATUK exercises continue to be held.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-to-agnes-wanjiru\">What happened to Agnes Wanjiru?</h2><p>Agnes Wanjiru’s killing in March 2012, allegedly by a British soldier, was the most high-profile BATUK case.</p><p>Wanjiru, the mother of a five-month-old girl, disappeared on the night of March 31, after last being seen with British soldiers at the Lion Court Hotel bar in Nanyuki. Her naked body was found two months later in a septic tank on the hotel grounds, close to the room where the BATUK soldiers had been staying. The group of soldiers had left Kenya by the time her body was discovered.</p><p>A post-mortem determined Wanjiru had been stabbed in the chest and abdomen, had a collapsed lung, and had suffered from blunt force injury to her chest. She had been beaten and was likely still alive when she was placed in the tank, it said. It was not clear whether she had been sexually assaulted.</p><p>In June 2012, the Kenyan police asked that nine soldiers be questioned by the British Royal Military Police, but say they did not receive a response. Wanjiru’s family attempted to sue BATUK in Kenya, but the UK government argued the Kenyan court had no jurisdiction over UK troops.</p><p>Wanjiru’s murder case <a href=\"/opinions/2021/11/8/the-killing-of-agnes-wanjiru\">resurfaced</a> in October 2021 after a Sunday Times investigation revealed that a British soldier had murdered her, and that BATUK bosses knew about the involvement of the soldier in her killing, but tried to cover it up.</p><p>One soldier who went to top officials after hearing a colleague, identified at the time as Soldier X, confess to the killings was told to “shut up”. The soldier said Soldier X took him to the septic tank and showed him Wanjiru’s body. Soldier X, who was not among the nine soldiers the Kenyan police initially identified, also poked fun at the murdered woman in Facebook posts, the Times reported.</p><p>The revelation brought renewed attention to the case and, this time, UK government officials agreed to cooperate with a new investigation.</p><p>In September 2025, a Kenyan court <a href=\"/news/2025/9/20/kenya-court-orders-uk-soldiers-arrest-for-agnes-wanjiru-death-all-we-know\">ordered the arrest</a> and extradition of a British national, and in November, the UK government arrested a 38-year-old suspect, Robert Purkiss. The case could mark the first time a former or current British soldier will be extradited to face trial in a foreign country, according to the UK’s Guardian newspaper.</p><p>Purkiss served as a medic in the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, an Infantry Regiment based in the northwest of England, and was in Kenya for a six-week training exercise at the time of Wanjiru’s death.</p><p>He appeared in a Westminster court on November 7, where a prosecutor alleged that Purkiss and others had regularly paid local women for sex and that they had been “drinking heavily” the night of Wanjiru’s murder, The Guardian reported.</p><p>Friends of Wanjiru, a hairdresser, reported that she had told them she was going out to “hustle” (earn extra money) for her daughter, prosecutors told the UK court.</p><p>The court also heard that Purkiss confessed to a colleague that he murdered Wanjiru over “sex that went wrong”.</p><p>Purkiss denied the allegations. His next hearing is set for December 9.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3964044\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3964044\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3964044\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25097492852907-1758299480.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Agnes Wanjiru photos\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3964044\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rose Wanyua Wanjiku, elder sister to Agnes Wanjiru, 20, holds photographs of Agnes at Rose’s house in the Majengo informal settlement in Nanyuki, Kenya, November 4, 2021 [File: Brian Inganga/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-has-the-uk-government-responded-to-the-report\">How has the UK government responded to the report?</h2><p>The British High Commission in Kenya responded in a statement on Wednesday, claiming that BATUK had not been sufficiently represented during the parliamentary hearings.</p><p>The commission said it had submitted written statements which were not taken into consideration in the report, and added that it was ready to investigate new allegations against BATUK “once evidence is provided”.</p><p>“While we deeply regret the challenges which have arisen in relation to our defence presence in Kenya, we are disappointed our submission to the Committee was not incorporated into the report’s conclusions,” the statement said.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>The parliamentary report recommended that Kenya’s Attorney General should immediately work with the UK government to extradite Purkiss to Kenya for the ongoing trial of Wanjiru’s murder. It also ordered inquiries into other deaths of local people suspected to have involved BATUK soldiers.</p><p>Negotiations should begin with the UK within three months to hold ex-BATUK soldiers who have neglected their children to account, the report said, and compensation and psychosocial support should be provided to victims of sexual offences committed by BATUK soldiers.</p><p>More broadly, the parliamentary report also recommended that government agencies should have more direct oversight over foreign troops stationed in the country by developing a code of conduct highlighting zero tolerance of gender-based violence and environmental degradation.</p><p>Kenya similarly hosts two US military bases with fluctuating numbers of personnel. The country often hosts US-Africa military drills along with several other African countries.</p><p>Mwangi of ACCPA told Al Jazeera that the parliament’s move was a step forward for communities which have to deal with foreign militaries in Kenya and elsewhere. Injustices committed by BATUK towards local communities, he said, dated back to Kenya’s colonial history with the UK, but officials have historically been wary of interrogating soldiers due to fears that development aid from the UK government could be affected.</p><p>Kenya is a top recipient of British aid, which mostly supports healthcare and humanitarian efforts. The country was also allocated a 24.6-million-pound ($33m) development budget in 2023.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The countries have agreed on an ambitious trade target of $100bn.</p><p>And, in a major signal to the West, Putin said: “Russia is ready for uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India.” Importing Russian crude has put India in a geopolitical bind and soured relations with the US, which believes it is financing the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump hit India with an additional trade tariff of 25 percent – bringing the total to 50 percent on Indian goods exported to the US – because of its continuing purchase of Russian oil.</p><p>So, what were the main takeaways from this summit?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152028\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152028\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152028\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-05T093531Z_2096572935_RC29AIAUUWBJ_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-RUSSIA-1764932101.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands as they attend a presentation of a joint statement after talks at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, on December 5, 2025 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-and-russia-affirmed-their-deep-ties\">India and Russia affirmed their deep ties</h2><p>The summit provided a platform for the two countries to reach a slew of trade agreements spanning jobs, health, shipping and chemicals.</p><p>However, analysts said the summit was more important as a show of political messaging.</p><p>“The biggest takeaway from the summit is the signalling that neither side has any intention to dilute this relationship, and is ready to withstand any external pressure,” said Harsh Pant, a geopolitics analyst at New Delhi-based think tank, the Observer Research Foundation.</p><p>Moreover, Pant said: “The attempt is to build the economic partnership, beyond oil and defence.” And without that, he added, “the bilateral relationship is not responsive to today’s realities”.</p><p>Robinder Sachdev, president of the Imagindia Institute, a Delhi-based think tank, said that the summit holds “extreme importance for the greater willingness on the part of both Russia and India to turbocharge this relationship”.</p><p>“Both sides want to increase their engagement beyond just government-to-government deals, in oil and defence sectors, and boost people-to-people ties,” said Sachdev. “That can be the biggest string in this bilateral relationship.”</p><p>Neither leader took questions after their media statements, which Putin concluded by saying that the Russian delegation was pleased with agreements that will “deepen” the bilateral partnership.</p><p>Putin added that, along with other BRICS countries – a growing bloc of emerging economies – India and Russia are promoting a “more just” and “multipolar” world. Putin also underlined the close bond that he shared with Modi by referring to their “close working dialogue” and “regular” phone calls.</p><p>In his statement, Modi said the two countries’ “Economic Cooperation Programme” is designed to diversify, balance, and make trade and investment sustainable, and further expand export, co-production, and co-innovation opportunities.</p><p>“Both sides are working towards the early conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union,” Modi added.</p><p>Modi also said that increasing the “connectivity” between Moscow and New Delhi is a “major priority for us”, noting that energy security has been a “strong and important pillar” of bilateral relations.</p><p>Modi also mentioned the opening of two new Indian consulates in Russia last month, and introduced two new 30-day visa schemes that would be made available for Russian tourists in India soon.</p><p>Modi said he had discussed the war in Ukraine with Putin and conveyed that India has “stood for peace since the beginning”.</p><p>“India and Russia have long supported each other, and worked shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism,” said Modi, mentioning the April attack in Kashmir and the attack on Crocus City Hall in Moscow in 2024.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152034\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152034\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152034\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-05T092604Z_1467307034_RC25AIA9VJTQ_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-RUSSIA-1764932208.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin is received by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India’s President Droupadi Murmu after he arrived to attend his ceremonial reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan presidential palace in New Delhi, India, on December 5, 2025 [Altaf Hussain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-did-not-pressure-russia-over-ukraine\">India did not pressure Russia over Ukraine</h2><p>Russia and India have held an annual bilateral summit since 2000, for which the Indian prime minister visits Russia one year, and the Russian president returns the visit the following year. It was paused following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and only resumed in 2024 when Modi visited Russia.</p><p>Ultimately, the Russian president’s 30-hour flying visit to Delhi sends a clear message to other world leaders amid growing pressure on him to conclude a peace deal with Ukraine. Putin is saying: “Moscow is not alone, and the efforts to isolate the Kremlin have failed”, experts say.</p><p>Ukraine’s allies in Europe and the US had hoped New Delhi would persuade Putin to agree to a peace deal. However, India did not call on Russia to end the war, although PM Modi appeared to reiterate his earlier position that “this is not an era of war”.</p><p>“India is on the side of peace,” the Indian prime minister said during discussions between the two leaders at Hyderabad House in Delhi on Friday.</p><p>“The world should return to peace, and we support every effort towards peace,” said Modi, adding, “India-Russia relations should grow and touch new heights.”</p><p>Expressing his gratitude to Modi, Putin said, “The two nations also have relations in the military sphere, in space development, artificial intelligence, and other areas … and we intend to move forward in all these areas.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152015\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152015\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152015\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251205__877G4BC__v1__MidRes__IndiaRussiaPolitics-1764931967.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152015\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Birds fly past a digital billboard displaying India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shaking hands with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, in Bengaluru on December 5, 2025 [(Idrees Mohammed/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-is-walking-a-tightrope-between-russia-and-the-west\">India is walking a tightrope between Russia and the West</h2><p>New Delhi is currently caught in a precarious geopolitical equation, a reality that has starkly tested the scope of India’s foreign policy.</p><p>On one side, India faces an increasingly coercive United States and its punitive trade tariffs. The Trump administration accuses India of effectively financing Putin’s war machine in Ukraine by buying crude oil.</p><p>The war in Ukraine, however, has tested the friendship between Moscow and New Delhi – a relationship that goes back decades.</p><p>Since its independence from Britain in 1947, India has avoided becoming locked into formal alliances with any superpower, leading the non-aligned movement during the Cold War. In reality, however, it drifted closer to the then-Soviet Union from the 1960s.</p><p>Since the end of the Cold War, India has deepened strategic and military ties with the US while trying to keep its friendship with Russia afloat.</p><p>India remains the top buyer of Russian arsenal. And India’s dependence on the Russian military sector was recently made apparent during New Delhi’s four-day clashes with Pakistan, with real-time reliance on Russian platforms such as the S-400 missile system and Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighters.</p><p>Investing in ties with Moscow and hosting Putin at this time allows New Delhi some leverage in a fragmented global order and maintains what it calls “strategic autonomy” to pursue its “multi-alignment” foreign policy.</p><p>The Delhi summit allowed the leaders to double down on that “neither side wants to bring this relationship down, and both sides want to invest diplomatic capital,” said Pant, of the ORF.</p><p>“The more Trump and his administration target India, the more it makes the case in India as to why the relationship with Russia is important,” he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152026\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152026\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152026\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-05T065445Z_191480038_RC26AIAOMWDK_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-RUSSIA-1764932094.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152026\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives to receive Russia’s President Vladimir Putin ahead of their meeting at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, on December 5, 2025 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"putin-was-defiant-over-us-pressure-on-oil\">Putin was defiant over US pressure on oil</h2><p>The Russian president said that despite Western sanctions against Moscow and the imposition of the White House’s punishing tariffs on India for importing Russian oil, the bilateral energy cooperation largely “remains unaffected”.</p><p>Putin told broadcaster India Today that Washington continues to buy Russian nuclear fuel for power plants.</p><p>“That is also fuel; uranium for the reactors operating in the US. If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn’t India have the same privilege?” said the Russian president. “This question deserves thorough examination, and we stand ready to discuss it, including with President (Donald) Trump.”</p><p>India-Russia trade has undergone a major shift since 2022, ballooning from a modest $10bn to a record nearly $69bn this year, primarily fuelled by New Delhi’s appetite for discounted Russian crude oil.</p><p>However, these numbers remain lopsided: Indian exports, largely pharmaceuticals and machinery, stand at roughly $5bn, resulting in a widening $64bn trade deficit.</p><p>Furthermore, the latest official data from India’s commerce ministry reveals that India reduced its crude imports from Russia by 38 percent in value compared with last year, down from a record high $5.8bn last year to $3.55bn this October.</p><p>Despite all this, Russia still accounts for just above 30 percent of India’s total oil imports by value and volume.</p><p>While noting that the import numbers have come down, Putin stressed that trade remains “unaffected by current conditions, fleeting political swings or the tragic events in Ukraine” and added that Russian businesses had built a solid and efficient commercial relationship with India, one based on mutual trust.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152040\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152040\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152040\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-05T084808Z_1288280898_RC28AIAS1YPU_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-RUSSIA-1764932333.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russia’s President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting in New Delhi, India, on December 5, 2025 [Alexander Kazakov/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-else-was-discussed-on-the-sidelines-of-the-summit\">What else was discussed on the sidelines of the summit?</h2><p>Putin landed in New Delhi with an entourage which included Andrei Belousov, his defence minister, and a large delegation from business and industry, including top executives of Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport.</p><p>Belousov met his Indian counterpart, Rajnath Singh, at New Delhi’s Manekshaw Centre on Thursday, before the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit.</p><p>While Singh looked to further the Indian government’s aim to build capacity in its indigenous defence industry, the Russian defence minister emphasised “the Russian defence industry’s [readiness] to support India towards becoming self-reliant in the field of defence production”, a joint statement read.</p><p>A Russian delegation also expressed interest in importing fishery and meat products from India and resolving market access issues, the Indian government said in a separate statement following a meeting between agriculture ministers on the sidelines.</p><p>India exported fishery products worth $7.45bn last year; however, a smaller share of $127m headed to Russia.</p><p>Geopolitical analysts noted that the summit leaves New Delhi hoping for a quicker peace deal on Ukraine, in order to free its strategic partner from global pressure.</p><p>And when that happens, “peace in the region would provide a window of opportunity for India to move fast and expand exports and business deals with Russia”, said Sachdev. “And beat Western nations to the race, who would also eventually return to Russia.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
