Our tents are just made of fabric. Our children are drowning. There’s nothing for us to wear, no clothes to put on,” Assmaa Fayad, a displaced Palestinian, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"thousands-of-tents-damaged\">Thousands of tents damaged</h2><p>The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) last week said the downpours have damaged at least 13,000 tents.</p><p>“Many of these displacement sites are pitched in open areas or the ruins of many of the destroyed buildings here [in Gaza],” said Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud.</p><p>The problem with these buildings is that “they’re cracked in the walls … in the ceilings”, which also makes the living conditions in these buildings difficult, said Mahmoud.</p><p>Under a United States-brokered ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, and which <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">Israel has violated hundreds of times</a>, aid deliveries were supposed to be significantly ramped up, with at least 600 trucks a day due to enter Gaza to fulfil the population’s needs.</p><p>However, Gaza’s Government Media Office has said only an average of 145 trucks have been entering Gaza since the ceasefire.</p><p>The UNHCR said in a post on social media that “thousands of internally displaced people in the Gaza Strip are struggling to find safe shelter in preparation for the coming cold weather”. “More shelter materials are still needed,” it added.</p><p>Aid organisations say that at least 300,000 mobile homes and tents are needed to house displaced people.</p><p>The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has said that more than 79,000 displaced people are living in 85 UNRWA-run shelters in the Gaza Strip.</p><h2 id=\"siege-policy\">‘Siege policy’</h2><p>The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement issued a statement, condemning the lack of supplies to help Palestinians as winter approaches.</p><p>“The suffering of our people in Gaza, especially the displaced, has worsened amid the cold and rainy weather. The flooding of the displaced persons’ tents is a direct result of the Zionist [Israeli] siege policy and the prevention of the entry of basic necessities, all while the world remains silent”.</p><p>The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement also called on the international community to “take immediate action and pressure the Zionist enemy to open the crossings and allow the entry of aid and essential supplies”.</p><p>Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem wrote a message on Telegram: “All the world’s efforts to alleviate the disaster have failed because of the Israeli siege.”</p><p>The sunny and dry weather conditions on Wednesday provide little relief, said Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud, as “a lot of people worry that by the evening, winds will pick up again”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

By the early 1960s, the US was worried about the pro-Cuba policies of President Jose Velasco Ibarra and his Vice President Carlos Julio Arosemena, who advocated for closer relations with Soviet bloc nations.</p><p>The CIA, using US labour organisations as its conduits, financed the spread of anti-communist sentiment in the country.</p><p>“In the end, they [the CIA] owned almost everybody who was anybody [in Ecuador],” a CIA agent told analyst Roger Morris later, in a 2004 CIA-approved appraisal of the agency’s activities in Latin America.</p><p>Arosemena first staged a coup against Ibarra, and initially turned further to the left, before trying to moderate his positions. Then, in 1963, the military staged a coup against him, banning the Communist Party and severing ties with Cuba, aligning with US interests.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127716\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127716\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4127716 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-517818004-1763993704.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C656&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ecuador\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Student protesters overturn a car in downtown Guayaquil, Ecuador, on November 6, 1961, during a demonstration against the government of President Jose Velasco Ibarra [Bettmann collection/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1960s-and-70s-in-bolivia\">1960s and 70s in Bolivia</h2><p>Between 1963 and 1964, the US used covert funding, largely through the CIA, to influence Bolivia’s politics.</p><p>The funding backed leaders who were friendly to the US, and supported a military coup in November 1964 led by General Rene Barrientos Ortuno against elected President Victor Paz Estenssoro. The coup was successful and forced Paz Estenssoro into exile.</p><p>But the US was not done interfering in Bolivia.</p><p>By the early 1970s, Washington had its eye on another regime change. This time, the target was President Juan Jose Torres, who had come to power in 1970 and had nationalised multiple US companies in the country.</p><p>According to the US State Department’s official <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve10/d76a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">history</a>, the US ambassador in La Paz, in June 1971, told Washington that it needed to support Torres’s opponents. The White House secretly sought, and received, $410,000 ($3.3m in today’s money) in what critics within the administration described as “coup money” to finance military leaders and political leaders opposed to Torres.</p><p>Two months later, senior military officer Hugo Banzer led a successful coup against Torres. The US continued to fund Banzer’s government, which ruled until 1978. Nearly two decades later, Banzer would return to power once again, after actually winning an election in 1997.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127725\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127725\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4127725\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-3269528-1763994070.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C573&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Banzer\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bolivia’s President Hugo Banzer, whom the US supported, wearing a uniform and decorations at his desk in April 1978 [Keystone/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1970s-in-chile\">1970s in Chile</h2><p>The CIA provided funding to help end the presidency of Salvador Allende, an elected leftist leader.

This spiralled into the 1973 military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet.

This began during the US presidency of Gerald Ford.</p><p>Targeted countries included Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. The operation was aimed at crushing political dissidents, leftists and communist sympathisers. The dictatorships used a shared database to monitor dissidents and their families across state borders.</p><p>They used tactics such as exchanging intelligence, information, prisoners and torture techniques. Under the operation, at least 97 people were killed, according to Plan Condor, a joint initiative by Latin American organisations and the University of Oxford.</p><h2 id=\"1980s-in-el-salvador\">1980s in El Salvador</h2><p>In December 1981, the Salvadoran military’s elite Atlacatl Battalion conducted a deadly massacre in the village of El Mozote, killing about 1,000 civilians, including women and children. This was during El Salvador’s civil war of 1980-92.</p><p>The battalion was trained and equipped by the US under its larger Cold War policy of suppressing leftist rebellions in Latin America. The US government greatly increased military aid to El Salvador between 1980 and 1982.</p><h2 id=\"1980s-in-grenada\">1980s in Grenada</h2><p>It was a familiar story by now. Maurice Bishop, the prime minister of the tiny Caribbean island, had adopted Marxist-Leninist policies after seizing power himself in 1979 when the previous premier, Eric Gairy, was out of the country.</p><p>By the early 1980s, the US was worried about Cuban influence in Grenada. As bloody infighting broke out within Bishop’s party over a leadership struggle in October 1983, the US swooped in an operation codenamed Operation Urgent Fury, invading the country, capturing Cubans in Grenada and ensuring that the country’s future was aligned with US priorities.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4127746\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4127746\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4127746\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-105202493-1763994952.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Grenada\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4127746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US Marines take a break during the US invasion of Grenada in 1983, codenamed Operation Urgent Fury [Archive Photos/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1980s-in-panama\">1980s in Panama</h2><p>The US invaded Panama in 1989 during the US presidency of George HW Bush, a Republican.

announced a $40bn budget for defence spending over the next eight years, to get “closer to the vision of an unassailable Taiwan, safeguarded by innovation and technology”.</p><p>Taiwan has been ramping up defence spending over the past decade, but United States President Donald Trump’s administration has pushed the self-ruled island to further increase its defence spending as a means to deter a potential Chinese attempt to regain control over the territory.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Lai said on Wednesday that the military aimed to have a “high level” of joint combat readiness against China by 2027 – which US officials have previously cited as a possible timeline for a Chinese military operation on the island.</p><p>“The ultimate goal is to establish defence capabilities that can permanently safeguard democratic Taiwan,” Lai said at a news conference in Taipei after announcing the $40bn spending plan in an opinion piece in The Washington Post newspaper.</p><p>Lai’s announcement came as Tokyo and Beijing were locked in a weeks-long diplomatic spat that followed <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/china-suspends-japanese-film-releases-amid-diplomatic-row-over-taiwan\">remarks by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi</a> suggesting Japan could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.</p><p>China claims the island is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to regain control over it.</p><h2 id=\"us-reaction\">US reaction</h2><p>The US’s top envoy in Taiwan, Raymond Greene, said he “welcomes” the government’s spending plan and urged the island’s rival political parties to “find common ground” on boosting its defences.</p><p>Lai said the extra spending would go towards new arms purchases from the US, as well as enhancing Taiwan’s ability to wage asymmetrical warfare.</p><p>But he said the spending was not tied to Taiwan’s ongoing tariff negotiations with the US, insisting the main goal was to “demonstrate Taiwan’s determination to defend” itself.</p><p>His comments also follow <a href=\"/news/2018/9/25/us-approves-330m-military-sale-to-taiwan-draws-chinese-anger\">US approval earlier this month</a> for $330m of parts and components in Washington’s first military sale to Taiwan since Trump’s return to the White House.</p><p>Lai, who leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), previously laid out plans to boost annual defence spending to more than 3 percent of gross domestic product next year and 5 percent by 2030.</p><p>Trump has demanded Taiwan raise its defence spending to as much as 10 percent of GDP, a proportion well above what the US or any of its key allies spend.</p><p>The government has proposed $949.5bn New Taiwan dollars ($30bn), or 3.32 percent of GDP, for defence spending next year.</p><h2 id=\"higher-than-expected\">Higher than expected</h2><p>The additional spending plan announced on Wednesday exceeds the $32bn previously revealed to the AFP news agency by a senior DPP politician.</p><p>Speaking earlier in Beijing, Peng Qingen, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan was allowing <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/china-warns-foreign-interference-in-taiwan-will-be-crushed\">“external forces”</a> to dictate its decisions.</p><p>In the opinion piece, Lai said he would accelerate the development of the so-called “T-Dome” – a multi-layered air defence system – which will “bring us closer to the vision of an unassailable Taiwan, safeguarded by innovation and technology”.</p><p>But the government may struggle to get the proposed spending approved by parliament, where the main opposition Kuomintang party, which advocates closer ties with China, controls the purse strings with the help of the Taiwan People’s Party.</p><p>Recently elected Kuomintang chairperson Cheng Li-wun has previously opposed Lai’s defence spending plans, saying Taiwan “doesn’t have that much money”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and owned by Elon Musk, has launched a new “transparency feature” which provides a greater level of information about accounts, including the locations of the users behind them.</p><p>X says the move will provide greater transparency and address concerns about “bots” that spread misinformation by enabling users to identify where they are based.</p><p>But it has raised concerns about safety and privacy for users worldwide.</p><p>Here is a closer look at what is happening.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-happening-at-x\">What is happening at X?</h2><p>Nikita Bier, head of product at the social media platform, announced the new feature, which will be rolled out globally, in a post on the platform on November 22.</p><p>“In a couple hours, we’ll be rolling out About This Account globally, allowing you to see the country or region where an account is based. This will be accessible by tapping the signup date on profiles,” Bier wrote.</p><p></p><p>X account profiles include a clickable “About This Account” page, which is accessible from the user menu. Until now, this page has displayed only the creation date of the account publicly.</p><p>Now, it also shows details such as the country the account holder is based in, the date the account was created, the number of times the username has been changed – and when – and the country of origin at the time of creation. It also indicates whether the app has been installed on an Android device or via the iOS App Store and in which country.</p><p>If the account is verified, it also displays the date it was verified. For some verified profiles, company affiliation also shows, such as X for Musk or the United States State Department for US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>X said this is necessary to ensure content posted on the platform is “authentic” and transparent.</p><p>“This is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square. We plan to provide many more ways for users to verify the authenticity of the content they see on X,” Bier said.</p><h2 id=\"can-users-opt-out-of-this\">Can users opt out of this?</h2><p>On the whole, no. On Tuesday, the platform did not appear to provide an option to hide this information from other users. For private accounts, which users must request permission from the account holder to follow, the new information is only accessible to users who have been approved to follow them.</p><p>Bier added that for users who are located in countries with restrictions on free speech, “we’ve included privacy toggles to only show your region”. He did not specify which countries he was referring to or why this feature was being offered to users there.</p><h2 id=\"could-this-compromise-users-safety\">Could this compromise users’ safety?</h2><p>Mark Owen Jones, an associate professor of media analytics at Northwestern University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that the new feature could enable people or agencies to cross-check the location of an anonymous account with data from other accounts, potentially allowing bad actors to identify or narrow down the location of someone requiring privacy because of security concerns.</p><p>It could also provoke attacks on people who are wrongly accused of falsifying their locations, he added.</p><p>“For example, saying that a journalist has been lying about their location in Poland, could lead to attacks on that person online, maybe in person, accusations of fraud that might have knock-on consequences on their personal and professional life,” Jones said.</p><p>“In that case, it risks causing damage to a person in terms of, you know, their wellbeing and their reputation and other forms of harassment.”</p><h2 id=\"who-could-be-badly-affected-by-this\">Who could be badly affected by this?</h2><p>Palestinians in Gaza are one group who could be particularly vulnerable to these sorts of claims, Jones said, because it is very difficult to verify who is telling the truth and who is not.</p><p>Since the feature was rolled out, some X users have claimed that accounts purporting to be of Palestinians in Gaza are in fact based in other countries. For instance, an account called @yasminemuhamsd, which was created last month, appears to belong to a Palestinian mother in Gaza, but the account is based in India, according to the About This Account page.</p><p>Another verified page, @sam_uel_best appears to be of a woman named Sarah Ali, whose bio reads “a Gazan woman, still resilient”. The account reposts links to different fundraisers, not just for Gaza, but also for local causes in the US. Most of these links are inactive. The About This Account page says that this account is based in Nigeria.</p><p>The Israeli Foreign Ministry has responded to these claims in an X post, stating: “New X feature ripped mask off countless fake ‘Gazan’ accounts. Some chap posting from Pakistan, another in London. Another manipulative abuser somewhere else. All claiming to be suffering in Gaza while in the comfort of some coffee shop far away.”</p><p>However, many people use VPN [virtual private network] services, which mask their IP addresses and hide their locations when they are browsing the internet. This can also spoof the location online and show it to be different from the actual location of the user.</p><p>Jones said that the feature is, therefore, of limited value because it only provides location information without confirming its accuracy.</p><p>“Of course, we know there are people scamming and pretending to be Palestinians to get money,” Jones said. However, he said, the creation of these sorts of accounts is just as likely to be a ploy to discredit genuine X users in Gaza.</p><p>“What if you created a bunch of accounts that were fake and obviously scammy and then made it look like they’re in Gaza and then they use that to say that Palestinians are scamming. You could easily engineer that situation, and I’m sure there’s some people doing that. If your job is to basically make Palestinians look bad and you don’t have any scruples, that’s exactly what you’d do.”</p><p>Jones said that pro-Israeli accounts have long been undermining the credibility of Palestinian content on social media via conspiracy theories, such as one about what they term “Paliwood”.</p><p>Using terms like “Paliwood” or “Gazawood”, pro-Israeli users claim that videos of atrocities in Gaza have been staged and are fake.</p><p>Jones said that if pro-Israeli accounts can claim that Palestinian influencers and journalists are also lying about their location, “it’s another piece of ‘evidence’ saying that they are just misleading the public”.</p><p>“This is the most dangerous aspect [of] these reputational attacks on Palestinians which will fuel into legitimising further the Israeli occupation and genocide.”</p><h2 id=\"will-this-feature-really-help-to-root-out-actual-bots\">Will this feature really help to root out actual ‘bots’?</h2><p>It’s debatable.</p><p>Since the feature was introduced on November 22, several Donald Trump supporters’ accounts, such as those called <a href=\"https://x.com/MAGANationX\">@MAGANationX</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/MAGAStormX\">@MAGAStormX</a>, have been shown to be based in Eastern Europe, according to their About This Account pages.</p><p>Similar pages appear to be based in Thailand and Bangladesh, reigniting concerns among users about the suspected high number of “bots” in foreign countries that are spreading political and election-related misinformation about the US on the platform.</p><p>However, because of the widespread use of VPNs, which mask users’ true locations, people cannot confirm the information they see, Jones said. As a result, X is effectively passing the responsibility for detecting fraud, spam bots or state-backed information operations on to users.</p><p>“All it is doing is providing location information without actually giving people the ability to determine if that location data is accurate. What’s the point of rolling out a feature when you also roll out a qualifier saying, well, the accuracy of this information cannot be trusted?</p><p>“It should be on the companies to stop people [from] abusing the platform and having accounts rather than crowdsourcing the policing of accounts. Again, it’s just companies being lazy, not doing due diligence on their side and then passing that responsibility onto the consumer.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"can-about-this-account-pages-be-doctored\">Can ‘About this Account’ pages be doctored?</h2><p>Images and screen grabs of them can.</p><p>Some X users have already started sharing doctored images and videos purporting to show the “About This Account” pages of other users. One <a href=\"https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1992382852328255743\">post</a> on X, for example, accused the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) account of being based in Israel.</p><p>Bier stepped in to refute this, saying, “the DHS has only shown IPs from the United States since account creation”.</p><p>When Al Jazeera checked on Tuesday, the location for the department’s account showed as the US.</p><p>On November 23, the department posted on its X account: “I can’t believe we have to say this, but this account has only ever been run and operated from the United States. Screenshots are easy to forge, videos are easy to manipulate. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"could-information-on-the-about-this-account-page-be-wrong\">Could information on the ‘About This Account’ page be wrong?</h2><p>The feature is very new on X and Bier acknowledged that his team is ironing out a few “rough edges” which would be resolved by Tuesday this week.</p><p>“If any data is incorrect, it will be updated periodically based on best-available information. This happens on a delayed and randomised schedule to preserve privacy,” he added, without giving further details.</p></div></div></body></html>"

democratically-governed island.</p><p>“We have a firm will, strong determination and a strong ability to defend our national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Peng Qingen, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, told a news conference on Wednesday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“We will crush all foreign interference,” Peng said, speaking in response to a question on the planned deployment of

region</a> is extremely dangerous, deliberately creating regional tensions and provoking military confrontation,” Peng said.</p><p>The comments follow Japan’s Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi’s announcement on Sunday that Tokyo was moving forward with plans to deploy a missile system on Yonaguni, the country’s westernmost island located 110km (68 miles) off Taiwan’s east coast, which has hosted a Japanese military base since 2016.</p><p>Koizumi said the deployment of the medium-range surface-to-air missile system on Yonaguni would enhance Japan’s security.</p><p>“We believe that having this unit in place will actually lower the chances of an armed attack against our country,” he said.</p><p>China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs blasted the announcement, describing Japan’s plan as a “deliberate attempt to create regional tension and provoke military confrontation”.</p><p>Koizumi pushed back, saying the Type 03 guided missile system was purely defensive and “intended to counter aircraft and missiles invading our nation”.</p><p>“They are not intended to attack other countries, are deployed throughout Japan, and clearly do not heighten regional tensions,” he told reporters.</p><p>Taiwan has welcomed Japan’s announcement of increased military capability on Yonaguni, saying it “helps maintain security in the Taiwan Strait”.</p><p>“Of course, this is helpful to our national interests as Japan has no territorial designs or hostility towards Taiwan,” Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Francois Wu said.</p><p>On Wednesday, Taiwan’s President William Lai Ching-te said the island will introduce a $40bn supplementary defence budget to defend itself in the face of a rising threat from China.</p><p>The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai had already pledged to raise defence spending to 5 percent of the island’s gross domestic product (GDP).</p><h2 id=\"only-plunge-taiwan-into-disaster\">‘Only plunge Taiwan into disaster’</h2><p>Beijing views Taiwan as its own territory and has promised to unite the island with the Chinese mainland, an aspiration that Taipei says infringes on its sovereignty and that only Taiwan’s citizens can decide their future.</p><p>Unveiling the almost $40bn defence spending package on Wednesday, President Lai said history had proven that trying to compromise in the face of aggression brought nothing but “enslavement”.</p><p>“National sovereignty and the core values of freedom and democracy are the very foundation of our nation,” Lai said, adding that Taiwan’s spending showed its determination to defend itself.</p><p>Wellington Koo, Taiwan’s defence minister, said the $40bn package was an upper limit for the special budget, and it would be used to buy precision-strike missiles as well as investments in joint development and procurement between Taiwan and the United States.</p><p>China’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson greeted news of Taipei’s increased spending on weapons as a waste.</p><p>“They squander funds that could be used to improve people’s livelihoods and develop the economy on purchasing weapons and currying favour with external powers,” Peng told reporters.</p><p>“This will only plunge Taiwan into disaster,” he added.</p><p>Amid growing tension in the Taiwan Strait, Japan said on Tuesday it had scrambled aircraft after detecting a suspected Chinese drone off Yonaguni.</p><p>“We confirmed that an unmanned aerial vehicle believed to be Chinese, passed between Yonaguni Island and Taiwan on Monday,” Japan’s Defence Ministry said on X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Relations between Tokyo and Beijing have recently <a

Takaichi, who suggested that Tokyo could intervene militarily in any Chinese attack on Taiwan.</p><p>Takaichi’s off-the-cuff remark in the Japanese parliament about a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan triggering Japanese military action prompted a furious response from Beijing that has included a boycott by Chinese citizens on travelling to Japan.</p><p>Takaichi has declined Beijing’s demands to retract her remarks on Taiwan, while Tokyo has said it is willing to hold talks with Beijing at all levels to ease tensions.</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Bonnie

He described losing 30 members of his extended family in February 2024, including his parents and his brother’s children, after an Israeli strike on a house they were all staying in. The strike severely injured his wife, forcing doctors to amputate one of her fingers.</p><p>“My mother and father were killed, my brother’s son, my aunt, my cousins … the whole family was gone,” Faiq recalled.</p><p>Faiq has since moved his family across Gaza City and to central Gaza to escape Israeli forces, all in search of “a safety that doesn’t exist”, as he puts it.</p><p>Since October, he has been trying to adapt to what he calls “the so-called ceasefire”, but says there is still no safety.</p><p>“Every few days, there’s a wave of bombardment and targeted strikes, and everything is turned upside down without warning.”</p><p>“We are exhausted,” he added. “Life in Gaza is 99 percent dead, and the ceasefire was just 1 percent of an attempt to revive it. But we have lost hope in everything.”</p><p>Faiq used to work with his father in the clothing trade, but the war has meant that they have lost everything. He can’t reach his home, which is inside what Israel terms the “yellow line”, under total Israeli control, with access for Palestinians heavily restricted.</p><p>“There’s no construction there, no work, no infrastructure, no life, and no safety,” Faiq said. “So, where is the end of the war?”</p><p>“Today I just sit at home 24 hours a day, and there’s no sign of life,” he added. “We’re surviving on bitterness … We’re not just frustrated. We’re in a catastrophe.

However, since then, Israel has continued to periodically attack Lebanon, including on Sunday, when a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel\">Hezbollah military commander</a> was killed in Beirut, and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/israeli-attack-on-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon-kills-at-least-13\">at least 13 people</a> were killed in an attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon on November 18.</p><p>Farwana believes that Israeli attacks in Gaza are not merely a military tactic, but part of a long-term vision to perpetuate chaos and avoid any upcoming political obligations.</p><p>“Netanyahu does not want to move to the second phase,” the analyst told Al Jazeera, referring to the next phase of the ceasefire, where sensitive topics such as the reconstruction and administration of Gaza would be addressed. Instead, he thinks that Israel plans to expand the area under its control “to seize as much land as possible from the Gaza Strip so that it has the upper hand in any future arrangements” for the enclave.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4131379\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4131379\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4131379\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/873A8132-1764112674.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Woman collects water from a tank\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4131379\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Raghda Obeid spends her days searching for food and water for her family [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"internal-motives\">Internal motives</h2><p>Many observers believe that Netanyahu’s desire to avoid moving forward with the ceasefire deal is partly the result of domestic political calculations.</p><p>With Israeli politics divided more by whether a politician’s stance is for or against Netanyahu, rather than left or right, the prime minister knows that a fall from power could spell the end of his political career and lead to investigations into his role in the failures that allowed for the October 7 attack. He currently faces multiple trials for corruption, a legal process that would likely speed up should he lose the upcoming elections, expected sometime before October 2026.</p><p>But despite the Netanyahu government’s evasion tactics when it comes to the ceasefire, Farwana says it is unlikely that the scale of Israel’s attacks in Gaza will return to what they were before the implementation of the agreement.</p><p>“There are significant pressures, especially from the US administration,” said Farwana. “Donald Trump wants his plan – the so-called [board of peace], stability forces, and other components – to succeed.”</p><p>“The situation will remain limited to expanding the yellow zone and to ongoing targeted attacks every now and then. It may expand gradually, but not to the point of returning to square one.” But that state of limbo, Farwana said, means that the people of Gaza will ultimately not be able to feel “any real calm”.</p><p>It is a situation Raghda Obeid, a 32-year-old mother of four, knows all too well.</p><p>She has already been through endless cycles of displacement, and her home in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City is completely destroyed. Now, what terrifies her the most is that the war will return.</p><p>Raghda is currently living with her family in a tent in western Gaza City. An Israeli strike hit the area last week.</p><p>“The moment of the last strike was terrifying, just like the first day of the war,” Raghda said, recounting how her children were terrified. “We could see the smoke from afar, people were running and screaming in the streets, carrying the killed and their torn bodies.”</p><p>“I was also terrified. I’m an adult, and I was scared. I said, ‘That’s it, the war is back, and it’s our turn now,'” she added with a sad smile.</p><p>Like most of the population of Gaza, Raghda and her family are at the mercy of aid organisations, relying on them for food, with few opportunities for work available.</p><p>The reality is that they will be living in a tent for the foreseeable future, including during the winter, and the harsh weather it will bring.</p><p>Each day, Raghda and her husband’s mission is to find food and fetch water. Their children run from place to place looking for a community kitchen to secure a meal.</p><p>“I don’t know what is expected of us. It’s been more than two years, and we are entering the third, displaced and broken like this. Isn’t there any solution for us?”</p><p>“We have no income,” Raghda said. “Our life is nonexistent. We live off the community kitchen and water. Our life is a war without an actual war.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It claimed that these boats were involved in drug trafficking, but authorities have released no evidence showing narcotics were present, and legal scholars argue that even if drugs were found, the attacks would likely still violate international law.</p><p data-start=\"1019\" data-end=\"1321\">The US military footprint in the region is now the largest it has been in decades, with roughly 15,000 US personnel stationed across the Caribbean.</p><p data-start=\"1643\" data-end=\"1729\">Trump has repeatedly insisted he is not seeking to topple the Venezuelan government.</p><p data-start=\"1731\" data-end=\"2062\">Still, recent developments have heightened concerns about potential US intervention. On Saturday, the Reuters news agency reported – citing four US officials – that Washington was preparing to enter a new phase of operations related to Venezuela, and two of those officials said the options included attempting to overthrow Maduro.</p><p data-start=\"2064\" data-end=\"2310\">Last month, Trump authorised the CIA to conduct <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/trump-seems-to-confirm-report-that-he-greenlit-cia-operations-in-venezuela?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">covert operations</a> in Venezuela.

Cartel de los Soles is a term that Venezuelans use to describe high-level corruption by the country’s senior officials and leaders, but it isn’t an organised cartel, per se.</p><p data-start=\"2654\" data-end=\"2760\">Trump told advisers on Monday that he intends to speak directly with Maduro at a date yet to be announced.</p><h2 id=\"a-caribbean-tour\">A Caribbean tour</h2><p data-start=\"2792\" data-end=\"2903\">Amid the soaring tensions, top US military officials began a tour of the Caribbean this week, meeting with leaders in the region.</p><p data-start=\"2905\" data-end=\"3303\">Dan Caine, the top US military officer, travelled to Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday for talks with Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar. According to a summary released by Caine’s office, the two reaffirmed bilateral ties and “exchanged views on challenges affecting the Caribbean region, including the destabilizing effects of illicit narcotics … and transnational criminal organization activities”.</p><p data-start=\"3305\" data-end=\"3503\">Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also assured Persad-Bissessar of Washington’s commitment to “address shared threats and deepen collaboration across the Caribbean”, the Pentagon said.</p><p data-start=\"3505\" data-end=\"3587\">He began his tour of the Caribbean on Monday with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/top-us-military-adviser-tours-caribbean-as-pressure-on-venezuela-deepens\">a stop in Puerto Rico</a>, where he met US troops.</p><p data-start=\"3589\" data-end=\"3940\">Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to continue the diplomatic push on Wednesday in Santo Domingo, where he will meet Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader and Defence Minister Carlos Antonio Fernandez Onofre.

Persad-Bissessar, however, has openly supported the attacks.</p><p data-start=\"4142\" data-end=\"4377\">In early September, she said she had no sympathy for drug traffickers, declaring that “the US military should kill them all violently”.

And that decision will be made by the career agents and analysts here at the FBI.”</p><p>In the video, lawmakers said they needed troops to “stand up for our laws … our Constitution”. Kelly, who was a fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut and then retiring at the rank of captain, told troops that “you can refuse illegal orders”.</p><p>The lawmakers did not mention specific circumstances in the video.</p><p>At an event in Michigan on Tuesday, Slotkin pointed to the Trump administration ordering the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, which officials accuse of ferrying drugs, and continued attempts at deploying National Guard troops into US cities despite some legal setbacks.</p><p>“It wasn’t that there was any one incident; it was the sheer number of people coming to us and saying, ‘I’m worried. I am being sent to Washington’ or ‘I’m being sent to LA or Chicago, North Carolina now, and I’m concerned I’m going to be asked to do something that I don’t know if I should do,'” said Slotkin. “So that’s where it came from.”</p><p>Troops, especially uniformed commanders, do have specific obligations to reject orders that are unlawful, if they make that determination.</p><p>Broad legal precedence also holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defence”, as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, does not absolve troops of responsibility.</p></div></div></body></html>"
