We’re taking it back,” Trump said.</p><p>“Under the authorities vested in me as the President of the United States, I’m officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act… and placing the DC Metropolitan and Police Department under direct federal control,” he said.</p><p>He also announced the deployment of the National Guard.</p><p>“I’m deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC, and they’re going to be allowed to do their job properly,” he said.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Trump also said that he intends to remove the capital’s homeless population, but did not provide details on how the plan would be carried out.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-home-rule-act-of-1973\">What is the Home Rule Act of 1973?</h2><p>The Home Rule Act of 1973 is a <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/can-donald-trump-take-federal-control-of-washington-dc\">US federal law</a> that gave Washington, DC, a significant degree of self-government for the first time.</p><p>Washington, DC, is the seat of the federal government and the only US city that is not part of the 50 states. As a result, it has no voting representation in Congress.</p><p>For about a century, up until 1973, the city was run by three presidentially appointed commissioners. That was until then-President Richard Nixon signed the Home Rule Act, enabling district residents to elect a mayor and city council.</p><p>But the Home Rule Act also says the president can take control of the city’s police force if “special conditions of an emergency nature exist”.</p><p>This is something Trump threatened to do in 2020, amid nationwide protests over the killing of <a href=\"/news/2020/6/11/a-timeline-of-the-george-floyd-and-anti-police-brutality-protests\">George Floyd</a>. The city’s police can be used for “federal purposes”.</p><p>The president can use the DC police force for 48 hours, or up to 30 days if he notifies Congress.</p><p>Trump said he plans to keep the federal takeover of the force going past the first 48 hours, and will officially inform the appropriate parties.</p><p data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7987um00093b6nu7igawbw@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">The mayor of Washington, DC, Muriel Bowser, is adamant that the city still has control: “Let me be clear.

In this status, they are not bound by the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars US service members from engaging in law enforcement activities.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that the Guard would begin flowing into DC this week.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">According to a report by CNN, deployed troops are not expected to openly carry rifles as they patrol the streets. Instead, they will probably keep their weapons nearby, for example, in their trucks, so they can access them if necessary for self-defence, the official said.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Hegseth said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units – other specialised units”, but did not offer any further details.</p><p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7qesig00013b6nxxgxce30@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">When asked whether the military would assist with clearing homeless people from the city, Hegseth said that the soldiers would assist local law enforcement.</p><p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7qesig00013b6nxxgxce30@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">“Our job is to stand alongside law enforcement,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-trump-taking-these-measures\" class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7987um00093b6nu7igawbw@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">Why is Trump taking these measures?</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">In the executive order, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/declaring-a-crime-emergency-in-the-district-of-columbia/\">states that rising violence</a> in the capital has become an emergency.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The “rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government”, the order states.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“The magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States.”</p><p>It also says that the attorney general shall regularly update the president “on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia”.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"35\" data-end=\"348\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">According to reports, the move seems to have been triggered by an assault involving Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer and protege of Elon Musk, who previously led DOGE. Police say 10 teenagers attacked the 19-year-old and his partner early on August 3.

It is also true that we experienced a crime spike post-COVID, but we worked quickly to put laws in place and tactics that got violent offenders off our streets, and gave our police officers more tools,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"558\" data-end=\"616\">According to Bowser, violent crime is now at a 30-year low in Washington, DC.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3883415\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3883415\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3883415\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-11T195640Z_7063520_RC275GA5S6DN_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CRIME-1754959311.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"D.C.

Such a move would <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/can-donald-trump-take-federal-control-of-washington-dc\">likely require</a> Congress overturning the Home Rule Act.</p><p>“I came out today because I was really scared about the potential that DC could lose any autonomy it has,” Jack told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“I feel like as DC natives, born and raised, we need to be able to represent ourselves and enrich our communities. We can’t just have a president come in and rule over our home.”</p><h2 id=\"crime-as-a-pretext\">Crime as a pretext?</h2><p>For his part, in an order declaring the “emergency”, Trump decried what he called the “city government’s failure to maintain public order and safety”, claiming crime rates posed “intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”.</p><p>Speaking to reporters from the White House, Trump vowed to “take our capital back”, outlining what he described as “massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”.</p><p>Trump further claimed he was “getting rid of the slums”, and would clear homeless people from the city, without offering further details of his plans.</p><p>Among those pushing back on the characterisation was the District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.”</p><p>“There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia,” he said.</p><p>While DC crime rates are typically higher than the national average, violent crime rates have dropped significantly in recent years, plummeting 35 percent from 2023 to 2024 and another 26 percent this year compared to the same period last year, according to Metropolitan Police data.</p><p>Early this year, the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/violent-crime-dc-hits-30-year-low\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that violent crime in DC had hit a 30-year low.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Groups like the Center for American Progress have <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-dcs-local-leaders-are-keeping-residents-safe/\">attributed</a> the decline to both local law enforcement strategies, as well as “investments in crime prevention and resources such as housing and education and employment supports”.</p><p>Twenty-year-old Radha Tanner, like many gathered, saw Trump as using the pretext of crime to enact a wider political mission, one that paints Democrat-dominated cities like DC as “unsafe and riddled with crime”.</p><p>Over 90 percent of DC voters supported Trump’s Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. Trump, in turn, won about 6.5 percent of the vote.</p><p>Tanner saw Monday’s moves as in line with Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/9/what-is-the-national-guard-at-the-heart-of-trumps-los-angeles-standoff\">deployment</a> of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, California to aid in immigration crackdowns and the protests they spurred.</p><p>“He’s doing this to make an example out of a city full of Democrats that is vulnerable because we don’t have representation,” Tanner said.</p><h2 id=\"best-place-for-us-to-resist\">‘Best place for us to resist’</h2><p>Maurice Carney, 60, saw a similar goal in Trump’s actions, arguing that long-term investment, not a short-term commandeering of local law enforcement or the deployment of the National Guard, would actually show a real commitment to addressing crime.</p><p>“When you see this increase in militarisation, whether it’s in DC or on the African continent or anywhere else in the world, you always see an increase in violence, either from resistance or from creating an environment that’s unstable,” said Carney, who works with a DC-based group that advocates for citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Like it or not, DC is seen as the capital of the empire, the capital of the world,” Carney told Al Jazeera. “So if Trump wants to show he’s this ‘law and order’ guy, DC is the best place for him to do that.”</p><p>“It’s also the best place for us to resist,” he said, “for us to stand up and let the rest of the world know that even right in the heart of the empire, the people – local residents of DC – resisted.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Most have been brought under control, localised and extinguished, but the situation remains “very challenging”, said Alexander Dzhartov, head of Bulgaria’s national fire safety unit.</p><p>Hungary on Sunday recorded a new national high of 39.9C (104F) in the southeast, breaking a record set in 1948. Budapest also recorded a city record at 38.7C (101.6F).</p><p>Wildfires destroyed several homes in Albania as firefighters battled blazes in sweltering conditions on Monday. According to Albania’s Ministry of Defence, firefighters and soldiers subdued most of the close to 40 fires that flared up within 24 hours but more than a dozen were still active.</p><p>In Croatia, about 150 firefighters spent the night defending homes from a blaze near the port city of Split.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Despite this, I have never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification. May God be a witness against those who remained silent and accepted our killing, and against those who choked our breath and whose hearts were not moved by the scattered remains of our children and women, and who did nothing to stop the massacre our people have faced for more than a year and a half.”</p><p>This is what Anas al-Sharif wrote in his “will” prepared four months before his martyrdom. It was posted on his social media account several hours after an Israeli strike killed him and journalists Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa at a media tent near al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.</p><p>Anas al-Sharif was one of Gaza’s heroes. He was – without a doubt – the journalist closest to all our hearts.</p><p>People here in Gaza often hate the media. They see journalists either exaggerate and portray us as superhumans, able to withstand relentless bombing, the deprivation of food and water, and the loss of loved ones; or demonise us as “terrorists”, justifying the killing of our families and the destruction of our homes.</p><p>Anas was different; he did not distort the truth. He was one of us: raised in our refugee camps, suffering with us under bombs and amid starvation, mourning his loved ones, refusing to leave his community. He stayed behind in Gaza, steadfast like an olive tree, a living example of a true Palestinian.</p><p>Anas started reporting for Al Jazeera at the start of the genocide, but he quickly became a familiar face. He and Ismail al-Ghoul did not stop broadcasting from northern Gaza even when they faced constant threats. Their warm friendship, and the funny and sad moments they shared, made us feel closer to them.</p><p>After the martyrdom of Ismail last year – may God have mercy on him – we felt we had lost a dear brother, and were left only with Anas.</p><p>Last month, when Anas broke down on camera while reporting on the starvation, people <a href=\"https://x.com/AnasAlSharif0/status/1946897874559668383\">told</a> him: “Keep going, Anas, don’t stop, you are our voice.”</p><p>And indeed, he was our voice. We often imagined that when the end of the genocide comes, we will hear it announced by Anas al-Sharif’s voice. There was no journalist in the world more deserving of declaring that moment than Anas.</p><p>For me, Anas was more than just a reporter. He was an inspiration. He was the reason I picked up my pen every time I lost hope that anything would change because of what I write. I saw Anas reporting tirelessly – hungry or full, in summer or winter, threatened with death or surrounded by cameras.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>His persistence convinced me I was wrong to believe that documenting the genocide was not moving anyone outside. Anas made me believe our story can reach where we cannot, crossing seas and oceans to every part of the world. And his resilience, working every day, every hour, forced me to hope … hope that if we kept speaking, someone might listen.</p><p>Anas is now gone, and I feel I was wrong to hope, wrong to believe in the justice of this world, watching him appeal – with eyes overflowing with tears – to a global conscience that proved to be low and selective.</p><p>They did not deserve your tears, Anas! They did not deserve your self-sacrifice so they would know our story. They do not hear because they refuse to.</p><p>You raised your voice, Anas, but you were calling out to those without conscience.</p><p>I wished the war had ended before you were martyred so I could go find you in Gaza and tell you that our voices had succeeded, they had reached to the outside world and driven change. I would have told you that you were my role model and your work kept me going. And if at that moment, you had smiled and called me your colleague, I would have cried with joy.</p><p>Your coverage ended, Anas, but the genocidal war did not. Today, we look helplessly at the vile occupation boasting about targeting you before the entire world – the same world you pleaded with until your last breath. Countries around the world remain silent; for them, economic deals and political interests are worth more than human lives.</p><p>Yet, the occupation will not silence us, Anas. It wants us to die without a voice because our voice, while we groan in pain and cry from loss, disturbs it, interferes with its genocidal drive.</p><p>Gaza will not give birth to another like you, Anas, nor someone like writer and poet Refaat Alareer, nor like hospital director Marwan al-Sultan. The occupation is targeting the best and brightest, those who have raised their voices and shown the world what Palestinians of dignity and integrity can do.</p><p>But we will not stay silent after these violent murders. Even if we know the world will not listen, we will keep speaking – because it is our fate and duty. We, the living Palestinians who survived this genocide, have to carry the legacy of our martyrs.</p><p>For me, that means speaking, writing, and exposing the crimes of this bloody and brutal occupation … until the day you dreamed of, Anas – the day this genocide, the most horrific in modern history, ends. The day you return to your ancestral home in al-Majdal and I return to my village, Yibna.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
