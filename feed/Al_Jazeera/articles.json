We have not done anything yet,” Regragui insisted after the quarterfinal win.</p><p>Captain and current African Player of the Year Achraf Hakimi is fit again after injury, and in Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, scorer of five goals in five games, they have probably the tournament’s outstanding player.</p><p>“He can become the best player in the world if he wants to,” remarked Regragui after the Cameroon game.</p><p>Regragui has angrily <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/10/morocco-coach-angrily-rejects-afcon-ref-bias-ahead-of-semifinals\">rejected</a> suggestions his team is benefitting from favourable refereeing decisions as the hosts.</p><p>“We’re the team to beat. As the team to beat, people will try to find all sorts of reasons to say Morocco has an advantage,” Regragui said after his team’s win over Cameroon.</p><p>“The only advantage that Morocco has at this Africa Cup is playing in front of 65,000 spectators. The rest is on the field, we speak on the field.”</p><p>Morocco are Africa’s leading power right now and, unlike Nigeria, are gearing up for the FIFA World Cup 2026.</p><p>The Atlas Lions recently won the <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/18/tannane-halfway-line-goal-sends-morocco-on-way-to-fifa-arab-cup-2025-title\">FIFA Arab Cup 2025</a> in Qatar, but their AFCON record down the years has been underwhelming. This is their first semifinal since 2004, when they lost the final to Tunisia.</p><p>Going further back, Morocco beat Nigeria en route to lifting the trophy in 1976 – half a century on, that remains their only continental title.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"can-improved-nigeria-stop-morocco-s-march\">Can ‘improved’ Nigeria stop Morocco’s march?</h2><p>Nigeria returned to Morocco with much to prove after a penalty shootout defeat by the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a November playoff in Rabat ended their hopes of World Cup qualification.</p><p>There might be 10 African countries participating in the World Cup, and it is remarkable that Nigeria, despite their footballing pedigree and the largest population on the continent, will not be among them.</p><p>However, their performances over the last three weeks have shown that to be an anomaly.</p><p>Nigeria were runners-up at the last AFCON in 2024. Led by two former African Players of the Year in Osimhen and Ademola Lookman, they are this tournament’s top scorers with 14 goals.</p><p>So what has changed from the failed World Cup qualifying campaign?</p><p>“Nothing,” said coach Eric Chelle, appointed exactly a year ago. “This is the same team. The difference is just that they have improved because they know what I want.”</p><p>Nigeria’s masked Galatasaray striker Osimhen had gone seven AFCON matches without finding the net before scoring against Tunisia in the group stage.

We have three players playing abroad, but all of them are in a difficult situation – none of them are playing for their clubs just now,” he added, with a nod to his own problems at Anfield.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Even applications such as corporate email cannot be accessed without connecting to the VPN. It also restricts access to external platforms, allowing only authorised organisation systems and thereby limiting exposure to the outside world.”</p><p>Banday’s fears are compounded by a security crackdown that followed the government order.</p><p>Multiple videos shared on social media by Indian media outlets and individual users showed policemen in riot gear gesturing to pedestrians or those driving vehicles to stop, and asking for their mobile devices. If the devices were locked, people were instructed to unlock them as officers shuffled through them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4231328\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4231328\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4231328\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/13627193-1768142860.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kashmir security forces\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4231328\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian soldiers stand guard on the banks of Srinagar’s Dal Lake, January 7, 2026 [Farooq Khan/EPA]</figcaption></figure><p>Police said they have taken action against more than 100 people across the region since December 29 for violating the ban orders, adding that “security proceedings” were initiated against the “violators”. Those who were initially “identified” for violations were let go only after their “antecedents” were verified to confirm they had no connections with a “terrorist”, the term the government uses for Kashmiri rebels.</p><p>“Genuine users were released after detailed device analysis with a strict warning to refrain from VPN usage in the future,” a statement issued by the police said on January 2.</p><p>An estimated 20 percent of India’s 800 million internet users use VPNs. Surfshark, a cybersecurity company based in Amsterdam, estimates that India has the world’s largest number of VPN users, with a market size worth $17bn.</p><h2 id=\"frequent-disruptions\">Frequent disruptions</h2><p>Internet restrictions in Indian-administered Kashmir are <a href=\"/news/2023/2/28/in-2022-the-world-saw-187-internet-shutdowns-84-by-india-alone\">not new</a>.</p><p>Of the 901 <a href=\"/news/2020/3/5/india-restores-internet-in-kashmir-after-7-months-of-blackout\">internet shutdowns</a> the Indian government has periodically imposed across the country, Kashmir accounts for nearly 50 percent of them, according to a monitor which started recording the blackouts in 2012. However, the intensity of such blackouts in the region has come down in the last few years.</p><p>When the Indian subcontinent won its independence from British rule in 1947, the Himalayan region of Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan, though the nuclear-armed neighbours claim it in full and have fought three wars over it. China also controls a sliver of Kashmir’s land.</p><p>In the late 1980s, an armed rebellion against New Delhi’s rule erupted to seek independence for Kashmir or merge it with Pakistan. In response, India deployed nearly a million Indian soldiers there and gave them extraordinary powers to control the region. The conflict has so far claimed tens of thousands of lives, most of them civilians.</p><p>India further tightened its grip over Kashmir in 2019 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s right-wing government <a href=\"/news/2023/12/11/whats-article-370-what-to-know-about-india-top-court-verdict-on-kashmir\">scrapped Article 370</a> of the Indian Constitution, legislation that granted a special status to the region by not allowing outsiders to get government jobs or buy properties there. The government also divided the semiautonomous region into two territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh – and brought them under New Delhi’s direct rule.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Kashmir residents say the VPN ban is another addition to an ever-expanding list of <a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/12/why-is-india-so-scared-of-my-book-on-kashmir-that-it-has-banned-it\">restrictions on civic freedoms</a> in the restive region.</p><p>A 32-year-old Kashmiri journalist told Al Jazeera he often relied on VPNs for work, but fears he will no longer be able to do so under the new restrictions.</p><p>“It is common for journalists in conflict zones to use VPNs for safety, especially when working on investigative stories,” said the journalist who requested anonymity over fears of reprisal from the authorities. “Now, that layer of protection is gone.”</p><p>Mir Umair, a 24-year-old businessman in Srinagar, said the VPN ban has cut his access to Bayyinah TV, an online platform of Quranic studies run by an Islamic preacher based in the United States.</p><p>“There’s nothing political in his speeches. Just religion. He has never talked about Kashmir except once when he narrated an episode of meeting a Kashmiri pilgrim during Hajj,” Umair said, adding that Khan’s channel was banned last year in May following the four-day India-Pakistan military clashes.</p><p>“I used to access his channel via VPNs,” he said.</p><p>Ahmad, a local lawyer who gave only his last name, fearing retribution from the authorities, told Al Jazeera the VPN ban could be unlawful.</p><p>“The legality of the order is doubtful as it is supposed to comply with India’s IT Rules that do not stipulate a blanket ban on VPNs,” he said. “One single executive order should not be able to sanction a ban as sweeping as this.”</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to police and government authorities in Kashmir for their statements on the VPN ban, but they did not respond.</p><h2 id=\"unconstitutional-policing-mechanisms\">‘Unconstitutional policing mechanisms’</h2><p>Last week, David Peterson, who heads the Geneva-based ProtonVPN company, invited a torrent of abuse from Indian users on X after he posted guidelines on tapping into his application’s “discreet icon” feature to evade the government ban.</p><p>“For additional context, Jammu and Kashmir [has] historically been subject to internet restrictions, bans and outages around this time of year to disrupt protests around the Republic Day [January 26] and the anniversaries of the Gawkadal and Handwara massacres,” he wrote, referring to the killings of civilians by Indian forces during the height of Kashmir’s armed rebellion in the early 1990s.</p><p>When an Indian X user accused him of facilitating “terrorism” in Kashmir, Peterson referred to the use of disguised apps by journalists working in dangerous environments. “[Like] in countries such as Iran, China, Russia, Myanmar, etc”, he replied.</p><p>In September last year, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) described Indian-administered Kashmir as an “information black hole” out of which reliable news rarely emerges.</p><p>Srinivas Kodali, a digital rights activist and researcher, told Al Jazeera merely having a VPN installed on phones does not amount to a criminal offence.</p><p>“People from diverse professions use VPNs for legitimate reasons. This blanket ban is uncalled for,” Kodali told Al Jazeera, adding that the act of stopping people and forcing them to unlock their phones was a “gross violation” of their fundamental rights.</p><p>“But in Kashmir’s case, we have continuously seen the state pushing all sorts of unconstitutional policing mechanisms. It is just one more step in that direction.”</p><p>Furqan*, another Kashmiri journalist, works remotely for an international media house based in the southern city of Bengaluru. He edits videos on major global events for his organisation and requires access to a bigger repository of online material than he can “legally” scour on the internet.</p><p>“India is one of the foremost countries to ban stuff on the internet. Just look at the rate at which the X handles are withheld in India, especially of critics and dissenters. To know who is writing what, a journalist will have to access VPNs,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Furqan insists that, as a journalist, he has the right to be discreet about his work, especially when he is dealing with sensitive information.</p><p>“Now this ban will hang like a sword on our thoughts,” he says. “Sometimes I am supposed to access the dashboard of the company. And because I am working remotely, it has to happen through a secure medium. So I use VPN. But in the damned region such as ours, even this mundane thing will now be deemed as a criminal activity.”</p><p>Furqan says the VPN ban adds to the “psychological pressure” on the Kashmiris. “It feels like we are on trial for our thoughts,” he told Al Jazeera. “A Kashmiri is risking so much even when he does something as basic as accessing a VPN.”</p><p><em>*Names changed to protect the identity of people over fears of retaliatory action by the government.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Many Australians have also expressed their concerns over a rise in right-wing activism in the country, where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas.</p><p>On Monday, Albanese announced that he would recall parliament next week to pass tougher hate speech laws and authorise a ‍gun buyback scheme.</p><p>He said Australians were entitled to express different views about the Middle East, but what they are not entitled to do “is to hold someone to account for the actions of others because they are a young boy wearing a school uniform going ‍to a Jewish ⁠school or a young woman wearing a hijab”.</p><p>Officials said the proposed laws would also ease visa denials on the grounds of racial bigotry and lower the threshold for banning hate organisations, including neo-Nazi groups.</p></div></div></body></html>"

His path seemed destined for the throne until the 1979 revolution upended the region.</p><p>At 17, he left Iran for fighter pilot training in the US at Reese Air Force Base in Texas. While he was away, the repressive monarchy collapsed, and the current political system was established, barring his return.</p><p>Pahlavi <a href=\"https://www.rezapahlavi.org/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">completed</a> his training and later earned a degree in political science from the University of Southern California. During the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, he famously volunteered to serve as a fighter pilot for his country but was rejected by the authorities in Tehran.</p><p>He has lived in exile ever since, residing in the US with his wife, Yasmine Pahlavi, and their three daughters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"preparing-to-return\">‘Preparing to return’</h2><p>For more than 40 years, Pahlavi advocated for a referendum and nonviolent change. However, his rhetoric has sharpened significantly in recent days.</p><p>On Saturday, he urged workers in key sectors — transport, oil, and gas — to launch nationwide strikes to “cut off the financial lifelines” of the state. He specifically called on the “youth of the Immortal Guard” — the erstwhile imperial forces — and security forces to defect.</p><p>“I, too, am preparing to return to the homeland so that at the time of our national revolution’s victory, I can be beside you,” he stated.</p><p>His call to action comes amid reports of the largest antigovernment protests in years. Pahlavi asked supporters to hoist the pre-1979 “Lion and Sun” flag, a symbol of his father’s rule, and to occupy public spaces starting from 6pm local time (14:30 GMT).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"terrorist-accusations\">‘Terrorist’ accusations</h2><p>The response from Tehran has been furious. On Sunday, state-affiliated media outlets labelled the protests as a “new phase of insecurity” and an “internal armed war”.</p><p>A report by the conservative Vatan-e Emrooz newspaper, cited by the Tasnim news agency, described Pahlavi’s call as cover for “terrorist nuclei” to attack police and Basij forces.</p><p>“Do not be mistaken; this is not merely a riot … these were armed terrorist attacks,” the report stated, claiming that dozens of security personnel had been killed.</p><p>Officials have linked Pahlavi’s escalation to foreign interference, specifically accusing the US and Israel. They claimed the unrest is a “Plan B” by US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the conclusion of the 12-day war between Israel and Iran in May last year.</p><h2 id=\"against-the-opposition\">‘Opposition against the opposition’?</h2><p>While Pahlavi has found renewed popularity on the streets, he faces sharp criticism from within the fractured Iranian opposition.</p><p>Alireza Nader, an Iran expert, argued in a recent <a href=\"https://www.meforum.org/mef-observer/has-reza-pahlavi-become-the-opposition-to-irans-opposition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a> that Pahlavi’s political activities have become divisive. Critics accuse his circle of attacking other prominent dissidents, such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, labelling them “leftists” or “terrorists”.</p><p>“Pahlavi has doubled down on his advisors despite others’ unease about them,” Nader wrote, questioning whether the prince has become “the opposition against the opposition”.</p><p>There are also concerns about manipulation. Nader noted that Pahlavi’s online support is partly driven by cyber-armies linked to the Iranian government, designed to sow discord, raising questions about “who is co-opting whom”.</p><p>Despite these internal rifts, Pahlavi remains the most visible figurehead for the current wave of unrest. With the Trump administration maintaining a hands-off approach — asserting it is “up to Iranians to choose their own leaders” — and the streets of Tehran burning, the exiled prince appears to be making his final gamble for the throne he lost 47 years ago.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>When Syria’s civil conflict ended in December 2024 with the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, hundreds of thousands of citizens were still bearing arms. Throughout the nearly 14 years of war, armed factions proliferated: from the broad spectrum of armed opposition factions in the northwest and the regime’s array of military and militia forces in central and western Syria, to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the northeast and a complex network of militias throughout the south, and not to forget the likes of ISIS and al-Qaeda.</p><p>In this context, the task of demilitarising society and reunifying the country has posed a truly formidable challenge for Syria’s transitional authority. Indeed, the process of disarming, demobilising, and reintegrating armed groups while simultaneously establishing new armed forces and a reformed security sector stands at the core of Syria’s transitional state building project. Days of heavy conflict between government forces and the SDF in Aleppo this past week highlighted the consequences of a failure to resolve the integration challenge.</p><p>As a first step in December 2024, the al-Assad regime’s armed forces were swiftly dissolved and a process of status settlement was initiated, whereby all previous soldiers – both officers and conscripts – could register using their national ID and apply for release to civilian life or to re-enlist in the new army.</p><p>Thousands of men chose to undertake this settlement process across the country, to clear their names and start life anew. But thousands of others abstained, especially in the coastal region, where the Alawite minority dominates. While many of those who avoided the process melted back into rural communities, hundreds ended up forming anti-government factions that conducted low-level attacks on government forces, culminating in a huge coordinated campaign on March 6 that killed more than 100 government personnel – triggering a chaotic and brutal week of violence that left more than 1,000 people dead.</p><p>In the months since, several thousand former regime personnel have undergone training and joined Syria’s new security forces across the country. Nevertheless, the fighting persists, due in part to financial support from prominent al-Assad regime figures now in exile in neighbouring Lebanon, as well as in Russia.</p><p>That continues to undermine Syria’s ability to heal ties with Lebanon and Russia, but also complicates the geopolitical standing of such countries among the wider region, which has stood squarely behind the new government in Damascus in the hope of transforming Syria into a base of stability and prosperity.</p><p>Meanwhile, Syria’s transitional government is also seeking to rebuild the Ministry of Defence (MOD) with an army, navy and air force and the Ministry of Interior (MOI) with provincial public security directorates, and dedicated “counterterrorism”, counternarcotics and cyber forces.</p><p>In this transitional phase, the MOD has emerged as the umbrella under which the broad spectrum of opposition armed factions have been folded. While all former opposition groups have technically dissolved, some remain largely in form, constituting the army’s nearly 20 divisions. Those factions with longstanding ties to Turkiye – particularly from the northern Aleppo-based Syrian National Army (SNA) – appear to have benefitted from greater levels of military support and arms supplies than others previously based in Idlib. Some have leaders with controversial pasts, including outstanding international sanctions designations for violent crimes and corruption.</p><p>In the earlier phases of Syria’s transition, the MOD was the force tasked with responding to security challenges and with securing territory through checkpoints and local deployments. This was not an effective “post-war” approach to security, and the ministry’s serious shortcomings in terms of discipline, cohesion and command and control gave way to grievous errors of judgement and restraint – most notoriously on the coast in March 2025, but also in Suwayda in July, when MOD forces intervened in bloody clashes between local Druze and Bedouin communities.</p><p>Through the second half of 2025, the MOD took a back seat when it came to domestic security and was replaced by the MOI, whose public security forces have assumed responsibility for local security across the country.</p><p>Unlike the MOD’s divisions, the MOI’s forces are dominated by newly recruited men from across the country. While the MOI’s specialist units remain dominated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) personnel, the relative lack of previous factional affiliations in the broader public security forces has led to significant improvements in some of the most challenging environments.</p><p>In fact, Syria’s coastal region has transformed from being the most consistently dangerous and deadly region of the country in the first half of 2025 to the most stable and least violent region at the end of the year – even with a low-level rebellion continuing. That is almost entirely due to the MOI’s assumption of security responsibility, and a months-long effort to engage and build trust with local communities.</p><p>The most strategically significant challenge Syria’s transition faces today is from its unresolved territorial issues in the northeast with the Kurdish-dominated SDF and in the southern Druze-majority governorate of Suwayda. In both regions, armed groups are presenting themselves as alternatives to Damascus’s rule – and both are resulting in persistent tensions and conflict.</p><p>While the United States government has worked intensively to facilitate and mediate talks to achieve the SDF’s integration into Syria, those negotiations have yet to bear fruit. With multiple deadlines for such a deal now passed, tensions have been sky-high for weeks.</p><p>An SDF <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2026/1/5/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%A5%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-3-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86\">drone attack</a> on a checkpoint manned by government forces in eastern rural Aleppo late on January 5 triggered a spiral of hostilities that ended in the expulsion of SDF-linked militia from northwestern districts of Aleppo city by January 10. This latest bout of fighting has dealt a blow to integration talks, but also highlighted the consequences of their failure. The very real prospect of hostilities now spreading to front lines in eastern Aleppo could kill the talks altogether.</p><p>In Suwayda, a tense standoff remains after the violence in July that killed more than 1,400 people. Druze militias have united under a “National Guard” that is receiving support from Israel. The dominant role played by former al-Assad regime officers within this formation’s leadership has driven a more than 400 percent rise in drug trafficking towards Jordan, according to data collected by the <a href=\"https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/data-update-december-9-30-2025\">Syria Weekly</a> media outlet – triggering Jordanian air strikes in late December.</p><p>Persistent reports of inter-factional violence within the National Guard and increasing numbers of extrajudicial attacks on Druze figures willing to criticise Suwayda’s new de facto authorities suggest the status quo does not offer stability.</p><p>It is in Suwayda where geopolitics have proven to be most acute – with Israel’s backing of Druze authorities presenting a direct challenge not just to Syria’s transition, but to Jordanian security, to regional support for Damascus, and to the desire of US President Donald Trump’s administration to see Syria’s new government assume nationwide control.</p><p>The de facto Druze leader in Suwayda, Hikmat al-Hijri, is also in regular contact with SDF leaders in northeast Syria, with both sides appearing at times to be coordinating their positions vis-a-vis Damascus. Alawite figures on the coast, meanwhile, including protest leader Ghazal Ghazal, have also been in communication with both the SDF and al-Hijri in an attempt to unite behind a political vision that stands in opposition to Damascus.</p><p>Ultimately, Syria’s process of resolving the challenges of armed factions is intrinsically political and tied both to the civil war and to the tensions and challenges that have emerged out of the transition itself. The fact that a vast majority of the international community has united in support of Syria’s transitional government has helped to provide the time and space for dissolving and integrating armed factions and fighters across the country. However, as long as geopolitical challenges to the transition remain, the process of integration will remain incomplete and continue to be a source of instability.</p><p data-start=\"7835\" data-end=\"8231\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

God has blessed me with far more than I could ever ask for. I look back at my journey with a lot of grace and gratitude, and I feel really proud of it.”</p><p>His 91-ball knock in the ODI opener helped India chase down a victory target of 301 with four wickets and six balls to spare to lead the three-match series 1-0.</p><p>But the in-form Kohli missed out on his 54th ODI century after he registered his fifth 50-plus score in as many ODI innings, including two hundreds.</p><p>“If I am being brutally honest, the way I’m playing right now, I’m not thinking about milestones at all,” the former captain said.</p><p>In his 17th year in international cricket, he continues to reinvent himself. Kohli said he now aims to make the most of the first 20 deliveries ‌after coming in at first drop.</p><p>He said he has tweaked his approach of late to counterattack early in his innings and ‍put bowlers under ‍pressure.</p><p>After opener Rohit Sharma fell for ‍26 in the ninth over, Kohli refused to retreat into a defensive shell and instead took the initiative to ‍force New Zealand’s ⁠attack onto the back foot.</p><p>“If the situation is a bit tricky, I back myself to counterattack now rather than just trying to play the situation in because some ball has your name on it,” he said.</p><p>“There’s no point waiting around for too long. But at the same time, you ‌don’t play outrageous shots. You still stick to ⁠your strengths, but you back yourself enough to put the opposition on the back foot,” he said.</p><p>The swashbuckling batter believed his approach would have been more aggressive had India not been chasing.</p><p>“If we were batting first, I probably would’ve gone harder. But in a chase, with a total on the board, I had to play the situation. I felt like hitting more boundaries, but experience kicks in. The only thing on my mind was getting the team into a position where we could win comfortably.”</p><p>“That actually ended up being the ‍difference in the game.”</p><p>Called King Kohli for his prolific run-scoring, the 37-year-old now only plays the ODI format after he and fellow stalwart Sharma, 38, retired from T20 and Test cricket.</p><p>The future of the two cricketers has been widely debated, with both likely targeting the ODI World Cup in 2027.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is about real people, real stories and a real group of human beings. The Rohingya of Myanmar. They have been targeted for destruction,” Jallow told ICJ judges.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The Gambia filed the case against Myanmar at the ICJ, also known as the World Court, in 2019, two years after the country’s military launched an offensive that forced some <a href=\"/news/2022/7/22/icj-to-rule-on-myanmar-objections-to-rohingya-genocide-case\">750,000 Rohingya</a> from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh. The refugees recounted mass killings, rape and arson attacks.</p><p>The trial is the first genocide case that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has taken up in full in more than a decade, and its outcome will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, likely affecting South Africa’s petition against Israel over its genocidal war on Gaza. The hearings will span three weeks.</p><p>A UN fact-finding mission at the time concluded that the 2017 offensive had included “genocidal acts”. But authorities in Myanmar rejected the report, saying its military offensive was a legitimate counterterrorism campaign in response to attacks by alleged Rohingya armed groups.</p><p>“The case is likely to ‍set critical precedents for how genocide is defined and how it can be proven, and how violations can be remedied,” Nicholas Koumjian, head of the UN’s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"renewed-hope\">‘Renewed hope’</h2><p>In Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, Rohingya refugees said they hoped the genocide case would help bring justice.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We sincerely believe that the ICJ hearing is a new hope to people that our decade-long suffering and denial may finally end and also lead to real justice, accountability and protection for the Rohingya refugees,” Tawfiq Al Moshin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We want justice and peace,” said 37-year-old Janifa Begum, a mother of two. “Our women lost their dignity when the military junta launched the eviction. They burned villages, killed men, and women became victims of widespread violence.”</p><p>Others said they hoped the case would bring them real change, even though the ICJ has no way to enforce any judgement it might make.</p><p>“I hope the ICJ will bring some solace to the deep wounds we are still carrying,” said Mohammad Sayed Ullah, 33, a former teacher and now a member of the United Council of Rohingya, a refugee organisation.</p><p>“The perpetrators must be held accountable and punished,” he said. “The sooner and fairer the trial is, the better the outcome will be… then the repatriation process may begin.”</p><p>Wai Wai Nu, the head of Myanmar’s Women’s Peace Network, said the start of the trial “delivers renewed hope to Rohingya that our decades-long suffering may finally end”.</p><p>“Amid ongoing violations against the Rohingya, the world must stand firm in the pursuit of justice and a path toward ending impunity in Myanmar and restoring our rights.”</p><p>The hearings at the ICJ will mark the first time that Rohingya victims of the alleged atrocities will be heard by an international court, although those sessions will be closed to the public and the media for sensitivity and privacy reasons.</p><p>“If the ICJ finds Myanmar responsible under the Genocide Convention, it would mark a historic step in holding a state legally accountable for genocide,” said Legal Action Worldwide (LAW), a group that advocates for Rohingya rights.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"separate-icc-case\">Separate ICC case</h2><p>During the preliminary hearings in the ICJ case in 2019, Myanmar’s then-leader, <a href=\"/news/2019/12/11/aung-san-suu-kyi-defends-myanmar-against-genocide-allegations\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, rejected The Gambia’s accusations of genocide as “incomplete and misleading”. She was later toppled by the military in a coup in 2021.</p><p>The power grab plunged Myanmar into chaos, with the military’s violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests sparking a nationwide armed rebellion.</p><p>While Myanmar’s military continues to deny the accusations of genocide, the opposition National Unity Government (NUG), established by elected lawmakers after the 2021 coup, said it has “accepted and welcomed” the jurisdiction of the ICJ, adding that it has “withdrawn all preliminary objections” previously submitted on the case.</p><p>In a statement ahead of the hearing, the NUG acknowledged the government’s failures, which it said “enabled grave atrocities” to take place against minority groups. It also acknowledged the name Rohingya, which the previous elected government, including Aung San Suu Kyi, had refused to do.</p><p>“We are committed to ensuring such crimes are never repeated,” the NUG said.</p><p>Myanmar’s military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, is facing a separate arrest warrant before the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his role in the persecution of the Rohingya.</p><p>The ICC prosecution said the general “bears criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh.”</p><p>Additionally, the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK) has accused the military government of <a href=\"/news/2024/6/26/rohingya-genocide-intensifying-as-war-rages-in-myanmars-rakhine-brouk\">“intensifying genocide”</a> against the Rohingya since taking power in 2021.</p><p>Myanmar is currently holding <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/myanmars-military-holds-second-phase-of-elections-amid-civil-war\">phased elections</a> that have been criticised by the UN, some Western countries and human rights groups as not free or fair.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ukrainian air defence units were trying to repel the attack, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>More than 1,000 apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, are still without heating three days after a devastating Russian attack, according to Ukrainian authorities.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in a statement on Telegram that not a single day passed this week without Russian attacks on energy facilities and critical infrastructure, which have totalled at least 44.</li>\n<li>A Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian city of Voronezh <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/ukrainian-drone-attack-kills-one-in-russias-voronezh-local-officials-say\">killed</a> a woman and wounded three other people on Sunday, the region’s governor, Alexander Gusev, said.</li>\n<li>The governor said that more than 10 apartment buildings, about 10 private houses, a secondary school and several administrative buildings were also damaged in the attack on Voronezh.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine’s military said it had made “direct hits” on three drilling platforms in the Caspian Sea belonging to Russia’s Lukoil oil firm. The military said it hit the V Filanovsky, Yuri Korchagin and Valery Grayfer platforms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Russia’s Ministry of Defence claimed control of the village of Bilohirya in Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhia region, according to the TASS state news agency.</li>\n<li>The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence’s main intelligence directorate said that Russia deployed the new jet-powered “Geran-5” strike drone against Ukraine this month, for the first time. The Geran is a Russian variant of the Iranian-designed Shahed. The drone can carry a 90kg (200-pound) warhead and has a range of nearly 1,000km (620 miles).</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Military aid</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The United Kingdom announced that it will develop a new deep-strike ballistic missile for Ukraine to support the country’s war efforts against invading Russian forces. Under the project, named Nightfall, the UK seeks to develop missiles that could carry a 200kg (440 lbs) warhead over a range of more than 500km (310 miles).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Sweden said it will spend 15 billion Swedish crowns ($1.6bn) on air defence, aimed at primarily protecting civilians and civilian infrastructure, as the country continues to ramp up its forces in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The European Union’s defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilus, said the bloc should consider setting up a combined military force that could eventually replace US troops in Europe. Kubilus, a former Lithuanian prime minister, said such a force, numbering up to 100,000, would be a possible option to better protect Europe.</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was now up to Russia to show it is interested in peace, after Kyiv and its allies agreed to implement <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/zelenskyy-says-us-security-guarantee-text-ready-to-be-finalised-with-trump\">a 20-point peace plan</a> and security guarantees, which would take effect following a ceasefire.</li>\n<li>Von der Leyen said that, under the plan, Ukraine would rely first on its own armed forces, which she said were well-trained and battle-experienced. It would be the task of the Europeans to make sure the Ukrainian army is also well equipped, she said.</li>\n<li>Von der Leyen added that the second line of defence would be the so-called Coalition of the Willing – 35 states, including most EU countries as well as Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Turkiye.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options. We’ll make a determination,” he told reporters on board Air Force One late on Sunday.</p><p>He said Iran’s leadership had called, seeking “to negotiate” after his threats of military action, and that a “meeting is being set up”.</p><p>But he added that “we may have to act before a meeting”.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Tehran.</p><p>Iranian leaders earlier on Sunday issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/irans-pezeshkian-pledges-economic-overhaul-amid-spiralling-protests\">stark warning</a> against military intervention, with Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf saying: “In the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories [Israel] as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target.”</p><p>The protests in Iran began on December 28, when merchants at Tehran’s Grand Bazaar closed their shops over the Iranian rial’s plummeting value.

The Wall Street Journal reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyberweapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.</p><p>Trump said on Sunday that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran.</p><p>“He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response ⁠to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite ​internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.</p><p>The US leader also spoke on his plans for Venezuela and Greenland.</p><p>Trump confirmed he would be meeting with Venezuelan opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado on Tuesday or Wednesday. He said global oil companies will also be “safe” if they invest in Venezuela, repeating a pledge made last week during a White House meeting with oil executives.</p><p>“There are guarantees they’re going to be safe,” he said. “They had problems in the past because they didn’t have Trump as president. They had stupid people.”</p><p>On Greenland, Trump called for the Danish Arctic territory to “make a deal”, and said “we are talking about acquiring it, not making a short term deal”.</p><p>Trump repeated his previous – and unproven – claims that China and Russia had deployed “destroyers and submarines all over the place” in the waters around Greenland. The territory’s defence force, he said, was made up of “two dogsleds”.</p><p>Trump, who has previously said that <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/8/why-trump-says-getting-greenland-is-about-defence\">US annexation of Greenland</a> is necessary for Washington’s self-defence, said Russia and China will take Greenland if the US does not.</p><p>“I’m not letting that happen,” he told reporters. “I would love to make a deal with them.

The US dollar fell about 0.2 percent against major currencies.</p><p>In an interview with NBC News, Trump denied any knowledge of the investigation.</p><p>“I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” he said.</p><p>Under US law, the president may only fire the Fed chair “for cause”, a provision widely interpreted to mean specific misconduct, not differences over policy.</p><p>“Much to the president’s frustration, the legislative architects of the modern Fed turn out to have been good at their craft,” David Wilcox, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the director of US economic research at Bloomberg Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They meant to allow the Fed to set monetary policy one step removed from political control, and, so far, their safeguards have stood up under pressure. In response, the president has resorted to increasingly outlandish tactics. This one is the most extreme example yet.”</p><p>Powell, who has served as Fed Chair since 2018, is due to step down from the top role in May, though his term on the seven-member board of governors does not expire until January 2028.</p><p>Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital, said the Trump administration’s latest move could encourage Powell to stay on the board longer than he would have otherwise.</p><p>“I was sure he was going to leave in May when his chairmanship ends. Now, I’m less sure,” Spindel told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He is an institutionalist, and will defend its independence as he sees it.

out several attacks on southern Lebanon, killing one person, according to Lebanese authorities, with the military saying it targeted a Hezbollah fighter and infrastructure.</p><p class=\"p1\">The attacks on Sunday came days after the Lebanese military said it had completed <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/lebanons-army-says-phase-one-of-hezbollah-disarmament-in-south-completed\">disarming Hezbollah</a> south of the Litani River, the first phase of a nationwide plan, though Israel has called those efforts insufficient.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

Ministry of Health said an “Israeli enemy strike on a car in Bint Jbeil city in south Lebanon resulted in the martyrdom of one citizen”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Israeli army said the strike was on a member of Hezbollah, which it accused of breaching a truce agreed in late 2024 to end more than a year of hostilities with the group.</p><p class=\"p1\">“A short while ago, in response to Hezbollah’s continuous violations of the ceasefire understandings, the [Israeli military] struck a Hezbollah terrorist” in the Bint Jbeil area, the army said in a statement.</p><p class=\"p1\">Elsewhere, Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reported that “enemy warplanes launched more than 10 raids” on the town of Kfar Hatta, which lies north of the Litani, noting “significant damage” to buildings there.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Israeli military had issued an evacuation warning for Kafr Hatta, subsequently saying it was “striking Hezbollah infrastructure in several areas”.</p><p class=\"p1\">It later announced an additional strike that targeted “an underground site used for weapons storage belonging to Hezbollah”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While a truce was signed between Israel and Lebanon in 2024, Israel has repeatedly targeted Lebanon and has kept troops in five south Lebanon areas it has classed as being necessary to its security.</p><p>Israeli attacks have killed more than 300 people in Lebanon since the agreement was signed.</p><p>The Israeli army has not only targeted Lebanon to attack alleged Hezbollah infrastructure, but also Hamas targets.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4232044\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4232044\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770

disarmed”.</p><p>“Efforts made toward this end by the Lebanese government and the Lebanese armed forces are an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah’s efforts to rearm and rebuild its terror infrastructure with Iranian support,” it added.</p><p>However, Hezbollah has repeatedly refused to disarm, saying Israel continues to violate the rules of the
