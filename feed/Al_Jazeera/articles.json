What have we done at any level? Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn’t play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?”</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-bcb-responded-to-the-players-demands\">How has the BCB responded to the players’ demands?</h2><p>The board initially distanced itself from Islam’s tirade, saying it regretted his remarks.</p><p>“Such comments do not reflect the values, principles, or official position of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, nor do they align with the standards of conduct expected from individuals entrusted with the responsibility of serving Bangladesh cricket,” the BCB said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>Following the players’ boycott of BPL games, the board gave in to the players’ demands and sacked Islam on Thursday.</p><p>“Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the BCB president has decided to release Nazmul Islam from his responsibilities as Chairman of the Finance Committee with immediate effect,” the board said.</p><h2 id=\"have-the-players-called-off-the-boycott-after\">Have the players called off the boycott after Islam’s sacking?</h2><p>Neither the CWAB nor the players have made a statement on the status of their boycott since Islam’s sacking.</p><h2 id=\"how-and-why-could-bangladesh-potentially-not-play-the-t20-world-cup\">How and why could Bangladesh potentially not play the T20 World Cup?</h2><p>The BCB has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) for Bangladesh’s fixtures at the T20 World Cup to be relocated from India, citing safety and security concerns for its players.</p><p>The ICC responded to BCB’s request by saying it deemed the venues – Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai and Eden Gardens in Kolkata – to be safe for the Bangladeshi team.</p><p>However, the BCB remained <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/13/bangladesh-wont-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-bcb-reaffirms\">firm</a> in its stance and asked the ICC to review its request once again.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-bcb-not-want-to-send-its-team-to-india\">Why does BCB not want to send its team to India?</h2><p>The row between the BCB and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) erupted after the latter instructed the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to remove Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from its squad for this year’s tournament.</p><p>The BCCI did not give any specific reason for the removal of the star left-arm paceman from the IPL, but it is believed it was done because of the recent political tensions between the two countries.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-if-bangladesh-doesn-t-play-the-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india\">What happens if Bangladesh doesn’t play the T20 World Cup matches in India?</h2><p>Should the ICC refuse to relocate Bangladesh’s games to Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament with India, and the Tigers refuse to travel, they will not only miss out on participating in the tournament, but the players would also be dealt a financial blow by not receiving their match fee for appearing in the games.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In particular, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) put the death toll at 2,615 on Wednesday.</p><p>However, the Iranian government said these numbers have been exaggerated, and Iranian state TV reports put the figure at about 300.</p><p>On Wednesday night, Trump’s tone softened when he said he had received assurances from Iran that the killings of protesters in Iran had stopped and that executions of detained demonstrators would not go ahead.</p><p>But his earlier threats to attack Iran prompted Tehran to warn of retaliation and, on Wednesday, Qatar ‌confirmed some personnel ‍had been removed from the Al Udeid air‌base, which hosts US armed forces, saying it was ‌in ⁠response ‌to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/diplomatic-contact-reportedly-suspended-between-us-and-iran\">“current ‍regional ‌tensions”</a>.</p><p>There have been some clashes between demonstrators and security forces in Iran, resulting in deaths. An ongoing internet blackout – which entered its eighth day on Thursday – has made it particularly difficult to track the actual number of deaths, according to watchdog NetBlocks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-death-toll-in-iran\">What do we know about the death toll in Iran?</h2><p>Iran has not released an official death toll, but authorities stated this week that more than 100 members of the security forces have been killed in clashes with protesters. Opposition activists said the toll is much higher and includes more than 1,000 protesters.</p><p>HRANA said the number of people killed had climbed to at least 2,615 on Wednesday.</p><p>Norway-based organisation Iran Human Rights (IHR) reported on Wednesday that at least 3,428 protesters had been killed in a crackdown on demonstrations.</p><p>But the same day, Iranian state TV said mass funerals were taking place in Tehran that would include 300 bodies of security force members and civilians.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Iranian ‍Foreign ‍Minister Abbas <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/trump-says-he-has-been-told-killing-of-protesters-in-iran-has-stopped\">Araghchi denied</a> that Tehran had plans to execute protesters. During this interview, Araghchi downplayed the death toll that is being reported.</p><p>“I certainly deny the numbers and figures they have said. It is an exaggeration, it is a misinformation campaign, only to find excuses, only to do another aggression against Iran,” Araghchi said, adding that the number was being exaggerated to involve Trump in the conflict.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot independently verify any of the figures that have been reported.</p><p>Among all of these figures, HRANA’s numbers are the ones that are most cited by news organisations worldwide.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-hrana\">What is HRANA?</h2><p>According to its website, US-based HRANA is the news agency affiliated with Human Rights Activists in Iran (also known as HRAI and HRA), which is described as “a non-political and non-governmental organisation comprised of advocates who defend human rights in Iran”.</p><p>The website states that HRAI was formed in 2005 but does not name or provide details about who formed the organisation.</p><p>It says that in February 2006, a small group of Iranian activists gathered to organise protests against human rights violations in the country.</p><p>“That effort lay the foundation of a larger vision that ultimately led to the establishment of an organization later known as Human Rights Activists in Iran,” the website states, adding that, initially, the effort was focused on political prisoners. It supported victims’ families, documented abuses and ran public education campaigns in Iran.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-group-now-based-in-the-us\">Why is the group now based in the US?</h2><p>By March 2010, the group was legally registered inside Iran, shifting from a “semi-secret organization into one which openly operated in Iran”, it states.</p><p>The organisation adds that during this time, the group decided to publicly disclose the names of its leaders. “By publicly disclosing the names of our leaders, we hoped to neutralize such suspicions that have historically led to brutal crackdowns in the past.”</p><p>However, the government did crack down on it, it says.</p><p>The website adds: “The military-style crackdown of our organization on March 2, 2010 left our members even more determined than before to re-group and ultimately rebuild the necessary infrastructure needed to continue our work despite the security risks that threatened each and every one of us.”</p><p>According to a document published by Amnesty International on March 12, 2010, HRAI reported that Iranian security forces raided the house and workplace of at least 29 of its members between March 2 and March 3, arresting 15 people.</p><p>The website adds that soon after the crackdown, HRAI registered in the US as a nonprofit organisation, and focused on recruiting skilled members, integrating technology into its operations and “obtaining appropriate sources of financial support”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-hrana-s-assessment-of-the-crisis-in-iran\">What is HRANA’s assessment of the crisis in Iran?</h2><p>This week, HRANA reported that of the 2,615 people killed, 2,435 were protesters, 153 were affiliated with the government or military, and 14 were civilians who were not protesting.</p><p>Besides the death toll, HRANA has reported that 18,470 people have been arrested over the course of 617 protests in 187 cities, beginning on December 28 in Tehran.</p><p>HRANA has also published news articles online with names, photos, ages and more information about some of the people who it says have been arrested or killed.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-hrana-s-backers-members-and-methodology\">What do we know about HRANA’s backers, members and methodology?</h2><p>Al Jazeera contacted HRANA for comment, but a spokesperson declined to disclose information about the group’s members or funding sources, citing security concerns.</p><p>The spokesperson told Al Jazeera that the organisation confirms all data with primary sources, but said it could not disclose the identities of individuals or organisations in Iran with whom HRANA corroborates information. Its methodology for collecting and analysing data is not provided on its website.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-hrana-s-previous-reporting-compared-with-official-government-figures\">How has HRANA’s previous reporting compared with official government figures?</h2><p>Iran fought a 12-day war with Israel from June 13 to 24 in 2025.</p><p>HRANA reported that over the course of the conflict, 1,190 people were killed and 4,475 were injured in Iran. These figures included civilian and military casualties. The organisation additionally reported that during the war, 1,596 people were arrested by Iranian security forces.</p><p>By contrast, according to Iran’s Ministry of Health and Medical Education, 610 people <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">were killed</a> and 4,746 people were injured over the course of the war.</p><p>In September 2022, a young woman named Mahsa Amini, aged 22, was arrested in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. She collapsed while in custody and died in hospital a few days later.</p><p>Her death caused national outrage and widespread protests in Iran that lasted for several weeks. The slogan “woman, life, freedom” was chanted in the streets.</p><p>HRANA reported in October 2022 that 200 people died and about 5,500 people were arrested during those protests.</p><p>That death toll matched figures of the state security council of the Iranian interior ministry, which said in December 2022 that <a href=\"/news/2022/12/3/iran-says-over-200-killed-in-countrys-ongoing-unrest\">more than 200</a> people had been killed since September. The security body said the deceased included security forces, those killed in “terrorist acts”, those killed by foreign-affiliated groups and described those killed by state forces as “rioters” and “armed anti-revolutionary elements who were members of secessionist groups”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>South America is at a crossroads. The attack on Caracas, the abduction of Nicolas Maduro and the threats towards the Colombian and Mexican presidents by the US president are an ominous sign of the years ahead. In addition to armed external meddling, elections have sharpened political tensions from La Paz to Santiago, Buenos Aires to Quito, and the region’s biggest democracies are heading to the polls again later in 2026. Unequal dividends from decades of growth, combined with the post-pandemic erosion of state capacity, have widened the appeal of hard-line, populist responses. The danger is not only domestic: the region’s drift towards militarised politics, and the open threats by the US, surface the risks of external influence, a modern rehash of the banana republic and gunboat diplomacy playbook.</p><p>Taken together, these dynamics point to a dangerous convergence. Rising insecurity, hollowed-out political representation and renewed external coercion are reinforcing one another, weakening institutions and making the region once again vulnerable to domination rather than self-determination.</p><p>Peru is a stark cautionary tale. For two decades, the country had above-average economic growth, attracted heavy foreign investment, and even sought OECD membership. By early 2026, the sol is widely regarded as South America’s most stable currency. Yet prosperity has not translated into institutional stability: seven presidents in nine years speak to a deeper political dysfunction. The sociologist Julio Cotler has argued that Peru’s elites, enriched by exports of raw materials, had scant incentives to share gains or build capable and inclusive institutions. The result is a brittle political economy, where colonial hierarchies linger, inequalities across gender, class and ethnicity persist, and state services are dysfunctional, weakening legitimacy and representation.</p><p>That brittleness is now colliding with insecurity. In Lima, transport strikes over rising violence and extortion have repeatedly paralysed the city; dozens of bus drivers were murdered in broad daylight throughout 2025. Protests turned deadly in October 2025, when a rapper and street artist was shot near the government palace during demonstrations against the new president, José Jerí. The president of Congress called the victim a “terruco” (once a label for terrorists), illustrating the toxicity of Peru’s political landscape, as this term is a slur aimed at dissenters, often Indigenous or peasant, to delegitimise their protests and demands. This is not an isolated phenomenon, but a symptom of how political systems treat social conflict as a policing problem, something to be repressed rather than addressed.</p><p>Peru’s response has been the militarisation of public space. Under Jerí, the government declared a state of emergency and sent soldiers to patrol the streets “until insecurity is eradicated”. Ecuador has tried something similar, going so far as to declare an “internal armed conflict”, leading to increasing human rights violations. When political demands are marginalised in favour of military or police force, political representation collapses into patronage or fear. Peru’s Congress illustrates this collapse of representation. It has become a plutocratic trading house where vested interests are waved through, rather than a forum for undertaking the reforms necessary for the state to respond to the demands of its citizens.</p><p>The 2026 presidential campaign in Peru is amplifying this logic. Frontrunners promise mega-prisons, drone surveillance, and even transferring inmates to Salvadoran prisons. Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former president Alberto Fujimori, openly invokes “mano dura” (a militarised response to the crisis of the state and representation). Across the Andes, “order” is back as a magical solution and political proposal, reinforced by US support for repression as a policy response, though it rarely fixes the causes of violence: social exclusion, impunity and hollowed-out states.</p><p>Chile offers a cautionary example. The celebratory chants for Pinochet heard after Jose Antonio Kast’s electoral victory illustrate a nostalgia for the certainty of authoritarianism and dictatorship, one that was sponsored by US intervention. Yet the appeal of “strong hand” governance is less about ideology than about disillusionment with parties and governments that feel distant and self-serving. When elites ignore citizens’ needs, toughness is performed, replacing political representation. The military is politicised and society is militarised. From this shift, it is a short step to a symbiosis in which politicians and uniforms defend predatory interests, local or foreign, under the banner of security, as authoritarian arrangements take hold and soldiers receive “warrior dividends”.</p><p>The return of hard-line populism in the region, as well as open US military intervention and bombing, resonates with a wider revival of militarised responses to social and political problems. The revival of the Monroe Doctrine in the Caribbean, the breach of international law and the use of sheer force, the so-called “Don Doctrine”, point to a governing logic that substitutes coercion for political legitimacy. Financial pressure, visible in Argentina’s most recent legislative elections, and the summary execution of alleged drug traffickers follow the same pattern. These are not isolated phenomena but variations of the same response: the gaslighting of social problems through force. Ultimately, this produces fragile states, fragmented societies and politicised militaries that undermine the very capacity needed to deliver safety, fairness and democracy, making external interference easier, not harder.</p><p>As leaders in the region pursue militarisation as a means of repressing dissent, they weaken states and position countries much as they were when banana republics first emerged. Weak institutions, corrupted legislatures and politicised security forces once again define political life. Today, the script is updated, more overt, raw and transactional, as the missiles and the aftermath of the abduction of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela illustrate.</p><p>A different path is possible, but it begins by describing the problem correctly. Violence is real, yet security without legitimacy is ephemeral, and force without institution-building is brittle. The Andes will not escape the current trend of insecurity and instability by doubling down on emergency powers, larger prisons and sweeping the streets with soldiers in full gear. The only way to bypass this path is to invest in justice and tackle the institutionalised inequalities that make violence feasible and profitable. This cannot happen without recasting political representation away from current predatory dynamics.</p><p>If the region continues the chant of right-wing populism in 2026, it will see more states of emergency, more “internal conflicts” and more militarised campaigns, and inevitably more room for foreign actors to set the terms and priorities in the region. A reboot of banana republics with a “security” add-on. It might even hand the US president the geopolitical equivalent of a “FIFA Peace Prize”, something that resembles a prize for the performance of success, but that ultimately fails in real life. The only way out of this trajectory is to ensure that politics takes place without the shadow of a uniform and populism, and that citizens’ voices are not eclipsed by the interests of cliques and short-sighted elites. This task will be more difficult given the pressures from the US for transactional deals that do not care for democracy, human rights or legitimacy.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It said one of the officers caught up with the immigrant on foot “when the subject began to resist and violently assault the officer”.</p><p>The department’s post said that while the immigrant and the officer were struggling on the ground, two people came out of a nearby apartment and began to strike the officer with a snow shovel and a broomstick. It further said, “The original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick.”</p><p>“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg,” the DHS wrote.</p><p>It added that the immigrant and the two people who had come out of the apartment ran back inside the apartment and barricaded themselves in.</p><p>The immigrant and officer who was attacked were taken to hospital, and the other two people who attacked the officer are in custody, DHS wrote.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"who-was-renee-nicole-good-and-what-happened-to-her-last-week\">Who was Renee Nicole Good and what happened to her last week?</h2><p>On the morning of January 7, Jonathan Ross, an ICE officer, fatally shot Good while she was in her car in Minneapolis.</p><p>Local officials said Good, 37, was acting as a legal observer during protests against US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.</p><p>Legal observers are usually volunteers who attend protests to watch police-demonstrator interactions and record any confrontations or possible legal violations.</p><p>Good’s killing sparked outrage and <a href=\"/gallery/2026/1/11/rallies-across-us-after-ice-agent-kills-renee-nicole-good-in-minneapolis\">protests</a> in Minnesota and nationwide.</p><p>In a joint statement released after she was shot dead, Minneapolis City Council President Elliot Payne and council members wrote: “Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government. Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p><p>After Good was shot, the Republican Trump administration clashed with local authorities, including Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.</p><p>Trump and administration officials claimed that Good had deliberately hit the ICE officer with her SUV and he had shot her in self-defence.</p><p>US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism”.</p><p>She said Good had refused to obey orders to get out of her car, “weaponise[d] her vehicle” and “attempted to run” over the officer. Minnesota officials disputed Noem’s account, citing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/new-video-on-minnesota-ice-shooting-emerges-as-public-anger-grows-across-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">videos</a> showing Good trying to drive away.</p><p>Footage from the incident shows Good’s car slowly reversing and then trying to move forwards. As the car moves forwards, an agent is seen walking around in front of it. He opens fire while standing in front of the driver’s side of the SUV.</p><p>Speaking about the shooting on Wednesday, Trump told the Reuters news agency: “I don’t get into right or wrong. I know that it was a tough situation to be in. There was very little respect shown to the police, in this case, the ICE officers.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-have-local-authorities-said-about-the-latest-shooting\">What have local authorities said about the latest shooting?</h2><p>Walz wrote in an X post on Wednesday that state investigators have been to the scene of the shooting.</p><p>“I know you’re angry. I’m angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets,” Walz wrote.</p><p>“But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don’t give him what he wants.”</p><p></p><p>In a series of posts on X on Wednesday, Frey wrote: “No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable.”</p><p>He added that there are 600 local police officers working in Minneapolis, and the Trump administration has sent in 3,000 federal officers.</p><p>“I have seen conduct from ICE that is intolerable. And for anyone taking the bait tonight, stop. It is not helpful. We cannot respond to Donald Trump’s chaos with our own chaos.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-ice-doing-in-minnesota\">What is ICE doing in Minnesota?</h2><p>The DHS launched Operation Metro Surge, which includes Minneapolis, in December. The Trump administration said the operation aims to root out and arrest criminals and undocumented immigrants.</p><p>The Trump administration escalated its immigration operation in Minneapolis on January 6. In an X post, ICE announced it planned to deploy 2,000 additional agents to the northern Midwestern city.</p><p>“A 100% chance of ICE in the Twin Cities – our largest operation to date,” the post said, referring to Minneapolis and the adjacent city of St Paul.</p><p>Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told local news media that ICE is “surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens”.</p><p>On Monday, the state of Minnesota filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the operation is an unconstitutional “federal invasion”.</p><p>The population of Minnesota is more than 5 million people, and according to numbers from the Migration Policy Institute from 2023, the number of undocumented immigrants in the state is 100,000.</p><p>Republicans have made disparaging remarks particularly targeting the state’s Somali population.</p><p>Noem said on Tuesday that Trump intends to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/us-to-end-deportation-protections-for-somalis\">end temporary deportation protections</a> and work permits for some Somali nationals in the US.</p><p>“Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status,” Noem said in a statement. “Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.”</p><p>In December, ICE launched a raid in Columbus, Ohio, which also has a large Somali population. In late November, ICE agents were deployed in New Orleans, Louisiana. Similar raids were launched in Charlotte, North Carolina, the same month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-many-venezuelan-immigrants-are-in-the-us\">How many Venezuelan immigrants are in the US?</h2><p>As of 2023, there were about 770,000 Venezuelan immigrants in the United States, making up just under 2 percent of the country’s 47.8 million foreign-born population, according to the Migration Policy Institute.</p><p>The institute estimated that in 2023, 486,000 Venezuelan immigrants were not authorised to be in the US, accounting for 4 percent of a total of 13.7 million unauthorised immigrants.</p><p>Since 2014, about 7.7 million Venezuelans, comprising 20 percent of the population, have left the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/venezuela-explained-in-10-maps-and-charts\">country</a>, mostly to seek better opportunities abroad as the economy has faltered and the government has cracked down on the political opposition. While the vast majority have moved to neighbouring countries, some have gone to the US.</p><p>On January 3, US forces <a href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/abduction_n?tl=true\">abducted</a> Venezuelan President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/what-is-the-us-charging-nicolas-maduro-with\">Nicolas Maduro</a>, whom the Trump administration describes as a “narcoterrorist”. He currently faces charges related to weapons and drug trafficking in New York.</p><p>During a national address on January 3, Trump stated: “Maduro sent savage and murderous gangs, including the bloodthirsty prison gang, <a href=\"/news/2025/3/20/fact-check-is-tren-de-aragua-invading-the-us-as-trump-says\">Tren de Aragua</a>, to terrorise American communities nationwide.”</p><p>However, several US intelligence agencies have rejected the claim that Trump has repeatedly made that Maduro controls Tren de Aragua. In an April memo, the agencies said Maduro’s government “probably does not” cooperate with the gang or direct it to carry out operations in the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His mandate is to oversee the transition from Hamas rule to a new technocratic administration led by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister.</p><p>For five years from 2015-2020, Mladenov served as the United Nations’ top envoy to the region, earning a reputation as a “firefighter” who could talk to everyone.</p><p>Now, he returns with a far more fraught and potentially explosive mission: Implementing a US-designed plan that explicitly calls for the “disarmament of all unauthorised personnel” – a euphemism for ending Hamas’s military power while Israel continues its occupation.</p><h2><strong>The mediator’s test</strong></h2><p>Mladenov’s immediate challenge is not just reconstruction, but high-stakes mediation. His itinerary, which includes meetings with leaders of Palestinian factions in Cairo, highlights why he was chosen: He is one of the few international figures who retains lines of communication with all sides while holding the trust of Washington and Israel.</p><p>While US special envoy Steve Witkoff has framed phase two as an effort to “create the alternative to Hamas”, Mladenov’s role is to make that alternative function on the ground.</p><p>He is tasked with supervising the new “technocratic committee” headed by Shaath, which will manage daily life for two million war-battered Palestinians who have lost family members, their homes, hospitals and schools in relentless Israeli bombardment.</p><p>However, this structure will face a crisis of legitimacy. Mladenov must navigate a landscape where Israel controls a “buffer zone” in the east, more than 50 percent of the whole territory, and refuses to withdraw fully – all while he attempts to sell a governance plan to the very factions he is tasked with disarming.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>A ‘technocrat’ in a war zone</strong></h2><p>Mladenov’s appointment signals Washington’s preference for a managerial solution to a military and political crisis.</p><p>In his recent post-UN career, Mladenov has championed a “new model” for the Middle East, defined by “cutting-edge innovation” and technological partnerships. He has spoken enthusiastically about the region shifting from “oil barrels to silicon chips”.</p><p>Critics, however, argue that this worldview presents a mismatch for Gaza’s current reality. As the Strip enters the second phase, the needs are existential, not technological. The displaced population is living in flimsy tents in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/eight-dead-in-gaza-as-storm-brings-extreme-cold-collapses-buildings\">extreme weather,</a> dependent on humanitarian aid that Israel largely blocks, and navigating a landscape of rubble.</p><p>There is a concern among humanitarian experts that Mladenov’s mandate – tied to high-level “Board of Peace” politics – may be divorced from the gritty requirements of a starving population. The risk is of an administrator focused on a “Davos-style” future while the present remains mired in catastrophe.</p><h2><strong>A shift in alignment</strong></h2><p>While Mladenov is often cited as a “fair broker” trusted by both Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the PA, his post-UN career suggests a subtle but significant realignment.</p><p>Since 2021, he has served as director-general of the Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy in Abu Dhabi. In this capacity, he has become a vocal proponent of the “Abraham Accords” – the normalisation agreements between Israel and several Arab states – framing them as a “supercharge” for regional stability.</p><p>This perspective places him firmly within the strategic orbit of some Gulf states and US President Donald Trump’s administration. While this connection may help secure funding for reconstruction, it complicates his standing on the Palestinian street, where the accords are often viewed as the diplomatic architecture that allowed Palestinians’ plight to be sidelined.</p><h2><strong>The mandate: Neutrality vs enforcement</strong></h2><p>The specific nature of phase two could make Mladenov’s job nigh impossible.</p><p>In his previous role, Mladenov reported to the UN secretary-general and was bound to uphold international law. In his new role, he answers to a US-led board that heavily leans into the Israeli narrative of its “security demands”, specifically the “disarmament of all unauthorised personnel”.</p><p>Mladenov must now persuade Palestinian factions to engage with a “technocratic” promise of governance, overseen by a diplomat who has spent the last few years advocating for Arab-Israeli normalisation.</p><p>As he engages in talks, Mladenov enters this role not merely as a mediator, but as the implementer of a complex international roadmap. It is a mandate shaped in Washington and supported by Gulf financing, yet one that will likely have to be realised under the entrenched constraints of an ongoing Israeli military presence in Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Tens of thousands of Lebanese are still displaced from their homes along Lebanon’s southern border.</p><p>And now the fear is that military action will ramp up. On Sunday alone, Israel launched around <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/12/israel-launches-air-strikes-against-lebanon\">25 attacks on south Lebanon</a>, leaving many in the country worried about further widespread attacks. The United Nations says Israel has violated the ceasefire more than 10,000 times since November 2024.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"continued-violations\">Continued violations</h2><p>Almost a year into the conflict that began in October 2023, Israel escalated its war on Lebanon, launching a devastating series of strikes between September and November 2024.</p><p>Every region in Lebanon was hit by some kind of Israeli attack, including air strikes or drone strikes. However, the areas primarily targeted, the south, eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, and Beirut’s southern suburbs (known as <a href=\"/features/longform/2024/10/26/once-upon-a-time-in-dahiyeh-israels-destruction-of-lebanons-communities\">Dahiyeh</a>), are predominantly inhabited by Shia Muslims, the sect from which Hezbollah derives the majority of its domestic support.</p><p>Among the dead in the attacks was the long-time leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.</p><p>Then in October, Israeli troops invaded south Lebanon and fought Hezbollah on Lebanese territory. When the ceasefire was agreed in November, Israel was supposed to withdraw all its troops from Lebanese territory within two months.</p><p>For its part, Hezbollah was to retreat to north of the Litani River and the Lebanese Army would deploy to south Lebanon.</p><p>Attacks from both sides would also cease.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the last year, however, Israel has continued to attack Lebanon almost daily. Hezbollah has largely avoided responding militarily, and the Lebanese Army has also dismantled Hezbollah’s infrastructure in south Lebanon, according to Lebanese <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/israel-lebanon-talks-everything-you-need-to-know\">government</a> and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/lebanons-army-says-phase-one-of-hezbollah-disarmament-in-south-completed\">military officials</a>.</p><p>Israel withdrew most of its troops, but kept hold of five areas inside Lebanon, under the guise of ensuring its security.</p><p>“You can’t only trust international guarantees or borders. You have to be wherever there is danger. This is the main lesson from October 7,” Amit Segal, an Israeli journalist who is familiar with Israel’s Netanyahu administration, told the New York Times in October, referring to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in 2023.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-threats\">Trump’s threats</h2><p>On January 8, the Lebanese Army announced it had completed its mission of disarming Hezbollah south of the Litani.</p><p>But Israel’s Foreign Ministry doesn’t agree, saying “extensive Hezbollah military infrastructure still exists south of the Litani River”.</p><p>“Hezbollah is rearming faster than it is being disarmed,” it said, accusing the Lebanese Army of collaborating with Hezbollah, without providing evidence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) Diodato Abagnara said there was no sign of Hezbollah regrouping in the south, and analysts <a href=\"/features/2025/11/27/beirut-attacks-leaves-lebanon-worried-and-waiting-for-another-israeli-war\">told</a> Al Jazeera late last year that the group was weakened to the point that it could not threaten Israel.</p><p>Regardless of the evidence put forward by Lebanese or UN officials, Israel doesn’t seem to be convinced. Analysts believe that Israel can only be stopped from attacking by one power: the United States.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"/video/the-listening-post/2025/7/12/netanyahu-trump-the-optics-and-the-outrage\">restrained</a> Israel from a follow-up attack on Iran last July. But the US president has largely emboldened Netanyahu to continue his militaristic agenda in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.</p><p>Following the Florida meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, Arab and Israeli media suggested that the Israeli prime minister had received a green light from the US president to go after Hezbollah and intensify attacks in Lebanon again.</p><p>“Hezbollah must be completely disarmed,” Trump is alleged to have said, according to the Jerusalem Post.</p><p>“If the Lebanese Army doesn’t succeed in disarming them, and Israel believes an action is the necessary thing to do [then the US backs Israel].”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"bombing-reconstruction\">Bombing reconstruction</h2><p>Residents in south Lebanon have gotten used to the attacks, but aren’t sure what to expect next.</p><p>“The situation is calm,” a local named Hussein Salman told Al Jazeera, adding without any sense of irony, “One day there’s an attack, another there isn’t. It’s calm”.</p><p>Kamel Jaber, a journalist from the southern town of Nabatieh, told Al Jazeera that the situation remained tense.</p><p>“Sometimes several days pass with nothing happening,” Jaber said. “Sometimes a single day passes, and the Israelis, through their warplanes, carry out a series of fire attacks or a series of successive raids on specific locations.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Sometimes they say they have eliminated Hezbollah’s missile capabilities, and then a little while later they escalate their attacks on the Lebanese state, claiming that Hezbollah’s weapons are still present and active,” Jaber said.</p><p>Many in Lebanon are now convinced that what happens next will depend on Israel’s agreements and calculations with the US, rather than anything the Lebanese government does.</p><p>And for many in the south – including Ali Attieh, the head of a farmers’ cooperative in the village of Kfar Hamam – the reason is simple.</p><p>“Israel wants to wage war,” Attieh said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/venezuelas-abducted-leader-maduro-wife-to-appear-in-nyc-court\">pleaded not guilty</a> to drug trafficking charges on January 5 in New York federal court.</p><p>The White House post isn’t the first time the Trump administration has blamed Maduro for trafficking fentanyl to the US. Trump has cited the potent synthetic opioid that is responsible for most <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/does-each-boat-strike-off-the-coast-of-venezuela-save-25000-us-lives\">US drug overdose deaths</a> to justify pressure on Venezuela in the months before Maduro’s capture.</p><p>But neither Venezuela nor Maduro plays a role in smuggling fentanyl to the US. The majority of US fentanyl comes from Mexico and is made with chemicals from China, according to US government reports and drug policy experts.</p><p>The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance addressed fentanyl in a January 4 X post, the day before the White House’s post, saying cocaine is “the main drug trafficked out of Venezuela,” and, “Yes, a lot of fentanyl is coming out of Mexico. That continues to be a focus of our policy in Mexico and is a reason why President Trump shut the border on day one.”</p><p></p><p>Drug experts previously told PolitiFact that Venezuela acts as a transit country for some cocaine trafficking in part because its neighbouring country, Colombia, is the world’s main cocaine producer. However, most of the cocaine that enters the US <a href=\"/news/2025/9/4/is-venezuela-the-big-cocaine-menace-trump-claims-it-to-be\">doesn’t go through Venezuela</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"government-reports-say-fentanyl-does-not-come-from-venezuela\">Government reports say fentanyl does not come from Venezuela</h2><p>The Drug Enforcement Agency’s annual National Drug Threat Assessment reports for years have pointed to Mexico and China as the countries responsible for illicit fentanyl in the US. None of the agency’s reports from 2017 to 2025 list Venezuela as a fentanyl producer or trafficker.</p><p>Most illicit fentanyl entered the US via the southern border at official ports of entry, and 83.5 percent of the smugglers in fiscal year 2024 were US citizens.</p><p>“There is no evidence of fentanyl or cocaine laced with fentanyl coming from Venezuela or anywhere else in South America,” David Smilde, a Tulane University sociologist who studies violence in Venezuela, told PolitiFact in September.</p><p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime World Drug Report also points to Mexico as the country of origin for the most fentanyl seized in the US.</p><p>US fentanyl overdose deaths recently have dropped. From May 2024 to April 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 43,000 synthetic opioid deaths, most of which were from fentanyl, down from nearly 70,000 in the previous year.</p><p>“The United States has been suffering an enormous overdose crisis driven by opioids and fentanyl in particular in recent years,” John Walsh, director for drug policy at the Washington Office on Latin America, a group advocating for human rights in the Americas, previously told PolitiFact. “I would say it has zero to do with anything in South America or the Caribbean.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Justice Department first indicted Maduro in 2020 for alleged drug-related actions dating to 1999. A newly unsealed and updated indictment filed in the Southern District of New York charges Maduro and two co-defendants with narcoterrorism conspiracy and him, Flores and the four other co-defendants with cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machineguns.</p><p>The indictment calls Maduro an illegitimate leader who transported cocaine under Venezuelan law enforcement protection, enriching his family and cementing power.</p><p>The 25-page document does not mention fentanyl or fentanyl trafficking.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2><p>The Trump White House described Maduro as “flooding America with deadly fentanyl”.</p><p>Drug experts and official government and international reports point to Mexico and China as the countries primarily involved in producing and trafficking the illicit fentanyl that reaches the US. The majority of fentanyl in the US comes from Mexico, is made with chemicals from China, and is smuggled by US citizens via official ports of entry at the southern border.</p><p>The US Justice Department indicted Maduro on charges related to cocaine. The indictment does not mention fentanyl.</p><p>We rate the statement <strong>False</strong>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A television channel in Israel that is aligned with the government claimed that “foreign agents” had armed Iranian protesters.</p><p>Several analysts <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/are-irans-protests-different-this-time-around\">have told Al Jazeera</a> in recent days that while the protesters have legitimate concerns, they believe Israel is playing a role in inflaming the tensions.</p><p>More than 100 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of unrest, Iran’s state media has reported, while opposition activists say the death toll is higher and includes thousands of protesters. Al Jazeera cannot independently verify the figures; the internet has been cut off in Iran for five days.</p><h2 id=\"russia-will-not-risk-another-reputation-failure-says-former-diplomat\">Russia will not risk ‘another reputation failure’, says former diplomat</h2><p>Centuries-old Russia-Iran ties have not always been cordial.</p><p>Russian tsars bit off huge chunks of Iranian territory that now constitute Russia’s Northern Caucasus and the ex-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia.</p><p>Communist Moscow strove to turn northern Iran into a “Soviet republic” in the early 1920s, briefly advocated for the independence of Iranian Kurds, and sought to control Tehran’s oil reserves after World War II.</p><p>But post-Soviet Moscow became Tehran’s main international backer, shielding it from United Nations’ resolutions and Western sanctions, building its Bushehr nuclear power station and supplying it with sophisticated weaponry.</p><p>The latter included the “advanced” S-400 air defence systems that failed, however, to repel Israeli and US drone and missile strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure last June.</p><p>In return, Tehran aided Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine by supplying drones, artillery shells, mortar mines, small gliding bombs and, reportedly, ballistic missiles.</p><p>But the 20-year “strategic partnership” agreement that Russia and Iran inked a year ago did not foresee military assistance. Moscow’s words on Trump’s threats did not even amount to “sabre-rattling”, a former Russian diplomat said.</p><p>“Why rattle sabres if it will only result in yet another reputation failure?” Boris Bondarev, who quit his Foreign Ministry job to protest the invasion of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The Kremlin is too afraid the White House could lose interest in its numerous concessions on the Ukraine war – while Trump does not need Moscow to agree to his possible actions in Iran, Bondarev said.</p><p>“What does Russia have to respond with? Withdraw troops from Ukraine and send them [to Iran]? Threaten Trump so that he completely loses interest towards Russia and the ‘deal’?” he asked rhetorically.</p><p>Western sanctions keep hobbling Russia’s economy, while average Russians are exhausted by the deaths on the Ukrainian front line, air raid sirens, airport shutdowns, galloping prices, pervasive propaganda and repression.</p><p>“Iran? What Iran? We’re busy surviving. My son is grieving the blocking of [popular online game] Roblox, my husband barely earns enough for our mortgage payments. Don’t pester me with questions about Iran,” Irina, a mother of two from the Urals Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She withheld her last name for security concerns.</p><p>But a renowned pro-Kremlin analyst, Sergey Markov, optimistically predicted Moscow’s help to “reform” Iran after the protests are over.</p><p>“The protests will be suppressed, but problems will remain. That’s why Iran awaits reforms. It would be right if Russia could help Iran with advice on reforms – advice both political and in political technologies,” Markov wrote on Telegram on Sunday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It does not apply to visitors or short-term visa holders. But the latest move comes five months before the US hosts the FIFA World Cup along with Canada and Mexico, at a time when a series of crackdowns on immigrants, refugees, foreign students and visa applicants have raised questions about its attitude towards visitors.</p><p data-start=\"370\" data-end=\"640\">Here is what we know about the latest crackdown:</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-us-administration-announced\" data-start=\"370\" data-end=\"640\">What has the US administration announced?</h2><p data-start=\"105\" data-end=\"430\">The State Department said it had told US consulates to stop processing immigrant visa applications from the affected countries. The move follows <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-pauses-immigration-from-third-world-countries-what-that-means\">a broader order issued</a> in November that tightened checks on potential immigrants who could become a financial burden on the US.</p><p>“The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” the department said in a statement.</p><p>“Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\" data-start=\"370\" data-end=\"640\">How does it work?</h2><p data-start=\"123\" data-end=\"311\">According to the State Department, nationals of the affected countries may still submit immigrant visa applications, but no immigrant visas will be approved or issued while the pause is in place. The US government has not indicated any deadline for when the suspension might be lifted.</p><p data-start=\"313\" data-end=\"433\">An exception applies to dual nationals who apply using a valid passport from a country not included in the suspension.</p><p data-start=\"435\" data-end=\"601\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The suspension will not apply to non-immigrant, temporary, tourist, or business visas.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-are-affected\" data-start=\"370\" data-end=\"640\">Which countries are affected?</h2><p>The list of 75 countries includes:</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"what-other-steps-has-trump-taken-to-restrict-immigration\">What other steps has Trump taken to restrict immigration?</h2><p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"413\">In recent months, the Trump administration has tightened immigration rules, particularly for people from countries whose vetting processes it has said are not robust enough, or that it believes are potential national security risks. The State Department has expanded limits on migration from these nations.</p><p data-start=\"415\" data-end=\"683\">In a statement released in January 2025, the White House said the US could not accept large numbers of migrants, especially refugees, without putting pressure on public resources, creating security concerns, or making it harder for newcomers to integrate.</p><p data-start=\"685\" data-end=\"895\">In June, the administration went further by imposing a full travel ban on citizens from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.</p><p data-start=\"897\" data-end=\"1145\">By October, the White House announced the lowest refugee admissions cap in US history, setting a limit of just 7,500 refugees for the 2026 fiscal year – mostly to be used for white Afrikaners from South Africa. Trump has amplified debunked conspiracy theories alleging a genocide against white South Africans, though data shows that violent crime is high in the country, with victims across races.</p><p data-start=\"897\" data-end=\"1145\">At the same time, the Trump administration has cut foreign aid programmes that support refugees living in other countries.</p><p data-start=\"1147\" data-end=\"1414\">The administration has also moved to limit skilled immigration, saying the aim is to protect jobs for US citizens. In September, it sharply increased the fee for H-1B visas – used by US companies to hire foreign workers – raising the cost to $100,000 per application.</p><p data-start=\"1416\" data-end=\"1806\">Following the arrest of an Afghan national linked to the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/national-guardsmen-shot-in-washington-dc-what-happened-whos-the-suspect\">November shooting</a> of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, the government introduced additional travel restrictions. <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/trump-expands-us-travel-ban-to-include-syria-palestine\">The ban list was expanded</a> to include six more countries, beyond the 12 countries whose citizens were previously banned. The six new additions were Palestine, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria.</p><p data-start=\"1808\" data-end=\"1975\">Immigration officials also paused asylum cases and stopped processing citizenship and green card applications for people from the countries first affected by the bans.</p><h2 id=\"has-the-trump-administration-also-been-deporting-people-at-record-rates\" data-start=\"1808\" data-end=\"1975\">Has the Trump administration also been deporting people at record rates?</h2><p data-start=\"1808\" data-end=\"1975\">It has.</p><p data-start=\"1808\" data-end=\"1975\">By early December, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security said it had deported more than 605,000 people, while another 1.9 million people had “self-deported”.</p><p data-start=\"1808\" data-end=\"1975\">As a result, the US had net negative immigration – more immigrants left the country than those who entered – in 2025, the first time in 50 years that this has happened, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution. The researchers at Brookings estimated that the net loss of immigrants last year was between 10,000 and 295,000 people.</p></div></div></body></html>"
