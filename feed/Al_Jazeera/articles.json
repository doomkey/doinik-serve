Instead, he went straight to work as a reporter on a local newspaper in Bristol, in western England.</p><p>While he found reporting daunting, he threw himself into working as a theatre and cinema critic, and his love of drama took hold.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4139442\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4139442\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4139442\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/reuters_692b3882-1764440194.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='FILE PHOTO: Tom Stoppard accepts the award for Best New Play for \"Leopoldstadt\" at the 76th Annual Tony Awards in New York City, U.S., June 11, 2023.

Tired of being asked, Stoppard is said to have replied to a woman outside a theatre on Broadway: “It’s about to make me very rich.”</p><p>He later questioned whether he had said “very”, Hermione Lee wrote in Stoppard’s authorised biography, but he had undoubtedly managed to transform his previously precarious finances.</p><p>Indeed, Stoppard would go on to win numerous awards on both sides of the Atlantic for his work.</p><p>He was knighted in 1997, and in 2014, he was crowned “the greatest living playwright” by the London Evening Standard Theatre Awards.</p><p>To non-theatre-goers, he is best remembered for his work in cinema, which included the Indiana Jones and Star Wars franchises.</p><p>In 1999, he won an Oscar for his screenplay for, Shakespeare in Love, which scooped a total of seven Academy Awards that year.</p><p>“He has no apparent animus towards anyone or anything,” said film and theatre director Mike Nichols, who directed the Broadway premiere of Stoppard’s tale of marriage and affairs, The Real Thing.</p><p>“He’s very funny at no one’s expense.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>It has been more than a month and a half since a ceasefire was concluded in Gaza. As part of the deal, 600 trucks were supposed to cross daily into the Strip carrying food, medicine, tents, fuel and other basic necessities.</p><p>We have grown used to official statements talking about hundreds of trucks crossing the border every day. Photos are released, crossings are documented carefully, and announcements are made with celebration.</p><p>“4,200 trucks carrying humanitarian goods are entering Gaza weekly, since the start of the ceasefire. 70% of trucks that entered carried food … Over 16,600 trucks of food entered Gaza since the start of the ceasefire. Over 370,000 tons of food,” claims a <a href=\"https://x.com/cogatonline/status/1993648112594772015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">November 26 update</a> from the Israeli occupation authorities.</p><p>One would think the Palestinians in Gaza are the most well-fed people in the world.</p><p>To many of us, it is not clear how Israel counts the “trucks of food”, as there are indeed many commercial trucks allowed in that carry food of low nutritional value, like chocolate bars and biscuits, or food that is too expensive, like frozen chicken for $25 a kilo or a tray of eggs for $30.</p><p>Humanitarian organisations also seem to doubt the official count. According to the World Food Programme, only half of required food aid is entering Gaza. According to Palestinian relief agencies, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">only a quarter</a> of necessary aid is actually allowed to go in.</p><p>And then only a fraction of that fraction actually reaches the displaced, the impoverished, the injured and the hungry. That is because much of the aid that does make it inside Gaza disappears into a “Bermuda triangle”.</p><p>The distance between the border and the displacement camps, where aid should be distributed, looks short on the map, but in reality, it is the longest distance politically and security-wise.</p><p>Yes, many trucks that go through never reach the families that need the supplies the most.</p><p>People hear about trucks, yet see no humanitarian packages. They hear about tonnes of flour, but they see no bread. They watch videos of trucks entering the Strip, but they never seen them come to their camps or neighbourhoods. It feels as if the aid enters Gaza only to vanish into thin air.</p><p>Recently, talk about the missing aid has grown louder in the streets, especially as basic food items have suddenly appeared in local markets while still carrying labels that say: “Humanitarian Aid Not for Sale”. I have seen cans of chicken meat with this label being sold for $15 apiece.</p><p>Even when aid parcels reach the needy, they are often lacking in promised items. For example, my family received a food parcel that was supposed to contain rice, lentils, and six bottles of cooking oil, but when we opened it, there was no rice or lentils, only three bottles of cooking oil.</p><p>This is not simply a matter of corruption. After two years of genocidal war, governance in Gaza has collapsed, its institutions systematically targeted by the Israeli army. There is no unified authority, and there is no force able to provide public order and security.</p><p>According to the UN mechanism for aid <a href=\"https://app.un2720.org/tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">monitoring</a>, from May 19 to November 29, 8035 aid trucks made it to their destinations inside Gaza; 7,127 were “intercepted” either “peacefully” or “forcefully”.</p><p>The Israeli army sets restrictions on the roads that trucks can take, often forcing them to take routes that are full of danger. Some roads cannot be used without coordination with powerful local families or neighbourhood committees, others are controlled by armed groups. All this makes a trip of a few dozen kilometres a very fragile process that is easy to disrupt. This is how aid disappears into Gaza’s “Bermuda triangle”.</p><p>International organisations are also unable to enforce security. They cannot accompany trucks because of the danger, cannot supervise unloading in real time, and do not have enough staff to track every shipment. Their dependence on local committees and volunteers means they rely on a system full of gaps that different parties quickly take advantage of.</p><p>Amid all this, one big question remains: Who truly benefits from the disappearance of aid?</p><p>There are the merchants looking for quick profit. There are the local armed groups seeking a source of cash. And there is, of course, the occupation and its allies who want to continue using hunger as a tool of political pressure. All of them are benefitting from the pain of ordinary Palestinians.</p><p>The problem here is that attention to what is happening in Gaza has diminished since the ceasefire. The global public feels reassured that the genocide is over, and it is no longer asking why aid is not reaching the Palestinian people.</p><p>Meanwhile, within policy and political circles, the disappearance of aid is being normalised, as if it were a natural outcome of conflict. But it is not; it is an engineered crisis meant as yet another kind of collective punishment for the Palestinian people.</p><p>As the world chooses yet again to turn a blind eye, it is not only trucks that are vanishing into Gaza’s “Bermuda triangle”, it is also the strength of Palestinians to keep going.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They also see the timing of Pope Leo’s visit as reflective of a period in which historic foundations feel more able to restore properties, organise religious life and engage directly with state bodies.</p><p>“This is, first of all, a great honour for Turkiye,” Manolis Kostidis, vice president of the Greek Foundations Association, told Al Jazeera of the pope’s visit.</p><p>“It’s also extremely important for the Ecumenical Patriarchate and for the Greek community. Istanbul has hosted empires for centuries, and welcoming such a guest shows the value of the patriarchate – especially with the support the Turkish government has given in recent years,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the early decades of the Turkish Republic, Turkiye’s Greek, Armenian and Syriac populations numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Their decline over the 20th century was shaped by a series of political ruptures – from the 1942 Wealth Tax, which disproportionately targeted non-Muslims, to the 1955 Istanbul pogrom that devastated Greek, Armenian and Jewish neighbourhoods, and the 1964 deportation of more than 12,000 Greek citizens amid tensions over Cyprus.</p><p>Other administrative restrictions and legal rulings followed in subsequent decades, gradually accelerating emigration. Today, the remaining communities are far smaller, yet their representatives stress resilience, continuity and a deep sense of belonging to the country they have lived in for centuries.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4138962\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4138962\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4138962\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251129__86JK9EN__v1__HighRes__TurkeyVaticanPopeDiplomacy-1764417581.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pope Leo XIV stands with patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem II (L) and patriarch Bortholomew I as he arrives for a private meeting with religious leaders at the Mor Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church, in Istanbul on November 29, 2025\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4138962\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pope Leo XIV, second from left, stands with Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem II, left, and Patriarch Bortholomew I, second from right, as he arrives for a private meeting with religious leaders at the Mor Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church in Istanbul [Andreas Solaro/AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>“If Turkiye’s population is 85 million, we are about 85,000 – one in a thousand,” Can Ustabası, head of the Minority Foundations Representative Office, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Communities that were once in the millions are now tiny. We’re citizens of this country, but history brought us to this point.”</p><p>While the pressures affecting minority groups through the 20th century are widely documented, community representatives agree that the atmosphere of the past two decades stands in sharp contrast.</p><p>From the 2000s onward, minority foundations benefitted from a number of legal changes.</p><p>The Foundations Law, first drafted in the Ottoman era and later adapted by the Republic, governs how non-Muslim charitable foundations own, manage and inherit property. A series of European Union-driven harmonisation packages between 2003 and 2008 expanded their ability to register assets, reclaim properties seized under earlier rulings, and receive donations and inheritances again.</p><p>This culminated in a 2011 government decree instructing the return – or compensation – of properties that had been taken from foundations under the 1974 Court of Cassation ruling and earlier administrative practices.</p><p>“Erdogan’s instruction to ‘return what rightfully belongs to them’ changed the attitude of every state body. Previously, getting permission to paint a church took years. Now, doors open easily,” Ustabasi said.</p><h2 id=\"one-of-most-comfortable-periods\">‘One of most comfortable periods’</h2><p>Lawyer Kezban Hatemi, who has advised minority foundations for decades, agreed that this has been “a major reform” but noted that more needed to be done. “Some cases are still ongoing – this kind of historical process never ends quickly,” Hatemi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>According to Hatemi, the earlier reluctance of state institutions was rooted in a decades-old mentality shaped by security fears and restrictive legal interpretations. She said minority foundations faced layers of bureaucratic obstacles for years, with even basic repairs or property registrations blocked. This only began to shift when EU harmonisation reforms created a new legal framework and political resolve emerged to act on it.</p><p>“The EU process gave real momentum – but it also took political will,” she said, noting that “a major blockage was removed” even as old fears loom for some.</p><p>“People abroad still say: ‘Don’t buy property in Istanbul, you never know what could happen.’ The memory from the 40s to the 70s is still very strong.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4138960\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4138960\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4138960\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251129__86JQ4WQ__v1__HighRes__TurkeyVaticanPopeDiplomacy-1764417553.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People react and take photos in front of the Mor Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church, where Pope Leo XIV meets with religious leaders, in Istanbul on November 29, 2025\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4138960\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People outside the Mor Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church, where Pope Leo XIV met religious leaders on Saturday [Yasin Akgul/AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>Ustabasi noted that while the process has not always been straightforward, some 1,250 properties “were returned through EU harmonisation reforms and changes to the Foundations Law” between 2003 and 2018.</p><p>Kostidis said the impact of the return of the properties has not only been material. “It makes us feel like full citizens,” he said, noting that “minorities have lived one of their most comfortable periods” since Erdogan came to power in 2003.</p><p>One of the clearest signs of renewed confidence is among Syriacs, particularly in Tur Abdin – the historic heartland of Syriac Christianity in southeastern Turkiye that stretches across Midyat and the wider Mardin region. In these villages, return migration has slowly begun to reverse.</p><p>“People who emigrated to Europe are building homes again in Midyat and its villages,” Ustabasi said. “The roads are better than Istanbul, security is solid, and some are even preparing to live there long term.”</p><p>He linked the shift directly to improved security conditions in the southeast, a region that for decades was affected by clashes between the Turkish state and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, making travel and daily life unpredictable. “A Turkiye without terrorism opens many doors. People feel safe travelling, restoring homes, returning to their villages,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Kostidis said returns to Turkiye’s largest city of Istanbul are also possible – but require practical fixes.</p><p>“Large-scale returns are unlikely. But yes, some will come back if residency issues are fixed,” he said, calling for “a special regulation” for Greeks from Istanbul with Greek citizenship.</p><p>“All communities – Muslim, Jewish, Armenian, Syriac, Greek – should live in this city. Istanbul’s strength has always been its plurality.”</p><h2 id=\"powerful-message\">‘Powerful message’</h2><p>Despite significant progress, several legal and administrative issues remain unresolved, with the representatives citing foundation board elections, legal ambiguity around autonomy and longstanding cases in some properties’ handover.</p><p>Ustabasi called for changes in the legal framework, while Hatemi noted the state “still intervenes in foundation governance in ways it never does with Muslim foundations. This mentality hasn’t fully changed – but I’m hopeful.”</p><p>Turkish-Armenian journalist and writer Etyen Mahcupyan said the pace of reform shifted after a failed coup attempt in 2016, when state bureaucracy regained influence over politics and decision-making.</p><p>He believes restitution slowed as a result, but said momentum could return if Turkiye “brings EU membership back to the forefront”. Turkiye started talks to join the bloc in 2005, but the accession bid <a href=\"/news/2023/9/20/analysis-is-turkeys-bid-for-eu-membership-over\">has effectively been frozen</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mahcupyan views Pope Leo’s visit as carrying political and symbolic resonance, given that the pope is seen not only as a religious figure but also as a political actor.</p><p>“Considering Turkiye’s foreign policy ambitions, this visit offers positive contributions. Ankara wants to shape a Turkiye that is accepted in global politics – and the world seems ready for it.”</p><p>Mahcupyan noted the pope’s “<a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/pope-leo-decries-shameful-disregard-for-international-law\">clear position</a>” on Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza “aligns closely with Turkiye’s own line. This kind of convergence is important. It prevents Turkiye from turning inward, helps the world look at Turkiye more gently – and softens attitudes towards non-Muslims.”</p><p>He also said the visit helps ensure minority communities “are not forgotten”.</p><p>Kostidis agreed.</p><p>“A Muslim-majority country hosting the leaders of the Christian world – you can’t give a more powerful message than this,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
