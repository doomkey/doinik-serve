They have no money. They have no anything right now, but they’re talking with us,” Trump told reporters.</p><p>“And maybe we’ll have a friendly takeover of Cuba. We could very well end up having a friendly takeover of Cuba.”</p><p>Trump has been pushing for regime change on the communist-led Caribbean island over the last two months, using economic and diplomatic pressure.</p><p>In Friday’s remarks, Trump reiterated his stance that Cuba is “a failing nation” teetering on collapse.</p><p>“Since I’m a little boy, I’ve been hearing about Cuba, and everybody wanted to change, and I can see that happening,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Cuban American known for his hawkish stance, is leading the initiative.</p><p>“Marco Rubio is dealing on it and at a very high level, and you know, they have no money. They have no oil, they have no food, and it’s really right now a nation in deep trouble. And they want our help.”</p><h2 id=\"increasing-pressure-on-cuba\">Increasing pressure on Cuba</h2><p>The US has long had strained relations with Cuba, an island just 145 kilometres, or 90 miles, from its shores. Since the 1960s, the US has imposed a full trade embargo on the island, weakening its economy.</p><p>But tensions have accelerated since January 3, when Trump authorised a military operation to abduct and imprison Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close ally of Cuba.</p><p>An estimated 32 Cuban soldiers were killed in the attack, alongside Venezuelan military personnel.</p><p>In the aftermath, Trump ratcheted up pressure against the island, publicly speculating that its government is “ready to fall”.</p><p>On January 11, he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115876460615555838\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that no more Venezuelan oil or money would flow to Cuba. Then, on January 29, he issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> threatening tariffs on any country that supplies oil directly or indirectly to the island.</p><p>Cuba’s energy grid largely relies on fossil fuels to generate electricity, and the United Nations has warned of the potential for an imminent humanitarian “collapse” on the island if supplies are not restored.</p><p>A panel of UN human rights experts also cast doubt this month on Trump’s stated rationale that Cuba constitutes an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security, due to its relations with China, Russia and other US rivals.</p><p>The fuel blockade, they explained, served primarily as “an extreme form of unilateral economic coercion” that violated international law.</p><p>“There is no right under international law to impose economic penalties on third States for engaging in lawful trade with another sovereign country,” they wrote in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-vision-for-a-growing-nation\">Trump’s vision for a ‘growing nation’</h2><p>The Trump administration, however, has made little secret of its desire to spread US influence, particularly in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>In his inaugural speech in 2025, Trump pledged that the US “will once again consider itself a growing nation”, including through the expansion of its territory.</p><p>Since delivering that address, Trump has proposed to <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/donald-trump-teases-us-aims-to-take-over-gaza-during-netanyahus-visit\">“own” Gaza</a> and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/trump-says-us-will-run-venezuela-after-nicolas-maduro-seized\">“run” Venezuela</a>, while pressuring countries like Greenland, Canada and Panama to cede sovereignty over their lands.</p><p>He has repeatedly referenced 19th-century expansionist policies like manifest destiny and the Monroe Doctrine to justify some of these efforts. He even married his personal brand to the latter, calling his plans for the Western Hemisphere the “Donroe Doctrine”.</p><p>During his State of the Union address this week, he touted his military action in Venezuela as a success and announced that more than 80 million barrels of Venezuelan oil had been transferred into the US government’s possession.</p><p>“We’re also restoring American security and dominance in the Western Hemisphere,” Trump told the crowd.</p><p>The Cuban government, however, has repeatedly denounced Trump’s campaign against the island as evidence of US imperialism.</p><p>On January 30, for instance, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel accused Trump of attempting “to strangle the Cuban economy” with the fuel blockade.</p><p>“This new measure reveals the fascist, criminal, and genocidal nature of a cabal that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal gain,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/DiazCanelB/status/2017219659955593370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Just this week, Diaz-Canel’s government announced there had been <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/cuban-border-agents-fire-upon-florida-tagged-speedboat-killing-four\">a deadly shootout</a> with a Florida-tagged speedboat close to its shores.</p><p>The US government has denied responsibility. But Cuba has described the boat as part of an “infiltration for terrorist purposes”.</p><h2 id=\"loosening-restrictions\">Loosening restrictions?</h2><p>Already, there have been signs that the US might seek to ease some of the pressure on Cuba, while maintaining its stiff opposition to the island’s communist government.</p><p>Earlier in February, the Trump administration announced $6m in humanitarian aid to the island, to be distributed through proxies like the Catholic Church, not the local government.</p><p>And on Wednesday, the US Department of the Treasury revealed it would “implement a favorable licensing policy” for the resale of Venezuelan oil to Cuba, barring any transaction with the Cuban government or its military and intelligence services.</p><p>Critics have argued that a humanitarian crisis in Cuba could trigger consequences for Trump, who has campaigned on cracking down on immigration and slashing government spending.</p><p>Cuba has seen multiple waves of migration to the US, the most recent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when nearly 2 million people fled the island due to economic instability and political repression.</p><p>Diaz-Canel, meanwhile, repeated on Friday that his government would defend itself from any outside threat.</p><p>“Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist or mercenary aggression that seeks to undermine its sovereignty and national stability,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/DiazCanelB/status/2027012778838348146\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

nuclear watchdog has said in a report that Iran has stored most of its highly enriched uranium at an underground tunnel complex at its Isfahan facility, urging Tehran to allow inspections as it faces <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/how-trumps-2026-iran-war-script-echoes-and-twists-the-2003-iraq-playbook\">growing pressure</a> from the United States over its nuclear programme.</p><p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, which was circulated to members Friday, confirmed earlier findings that the country was enriching uranium up to 60 percent, which is a short step away weapons-grade purity, raising concerns over the IAEA’s lack of access to the Isfahan site, one of three facilities that the US claimed to have “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">obliterated</a>” in last year’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/iaea-warns-israel-iran-conflict-threatens-nuclear-facilities-diplomacy\">12-day war</a>.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The IAEA report also stated that its inspectors do not know the precise location of a fourth uranium enrichment facility that Iran said it was setting up in Isfahan prior to the 12-day war, adding that they were not aware of its operational status or whether it currently contains nuclear material.</p><p>The IAEA said it had observed in satellite imagery “regular vehicular activity around the entrance to the tunnel complex at Isfahan in which (uranium) enriched up to 20% and 60% U-235 … was stored”, stressing the importance of being able to carry out inspections in Iran without further delay.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Iran.</p><p>The report comes a day after US and Iranian negotiators held a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/us-iran-talks-conclude-claims-progress-few-details\">third round</a> of indirect talks mediated by Oman in Geneva that yielded no breakthrough.</p><p>It will be discussed at a quarterly meeting of the IAEA’s 35-country board commencing on Monday next week in Vienna, coinciding with further Oman-mediated meetings between technical teams in the same city.</p><p>There is uncertainty over the fate of Iran’s stockpile of more than 400kg (882 pounds) of 60 percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors last June 10.</p><p>Israel launched strikes on Iran later that month, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>Tehran suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem said the technical points up for discussion in the Oman-mediated talks on Monday would, he said, be “related” to extracting the 440.9kg (972 pounds) of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent that the IAEA had reported prior to the 12-day war, in case there was “any tendency to go towards weaponisation of the programme”.</p><p>However, Hashem added, the IAEA is aware that “even the Iranians aren’t able to get into those facilities.” “So there’s been a lot of work around the facilities, at least this is what was shown in satellite imagery, but it doesn’t seem that the Iranians were able to get in,” he said.</p><p>Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi said the stockpile of enriched uranium and the inspections were the main “sticking point” in US-Iran discussions.</p><p>After yesterday’s talks, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the US should stop its “excessive demands”. He did not specify what those demands were, but the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He visited for the first time in February 2025, then in September and twice in October of last year.</p><p>No other details were provided about the latest diplomatic outing. But it comes at a delicate time for relations in the Middle East.</p><p>Just this week, the US and Iran held a third round of indirect talks, this time in Switzerland, as the two sides attempt to negotiate a deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>A new round of talks is slated to take place in Austria on Monday, the day Rubio arrives in Israel.</p><p>Still, Trump used a public appearance on Friday on the White House lawn to voice frustration at the slow pace of negotiations.</p><p>“I’m not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have. I’m not thrilled with that. We’ll see what happens,” Trump said.</p><p>“We’ll have some additional talks today. But no, I’m not happy with the way they’re going.”</p><p>Trump added that he was not averse to using the military to accomplish his aims. “I’d love not to use it, but sometimes you have to. We’ll see what happens.”</p><p>Upon his arrival in Texas, Trump added that he would not be satisfied with Iran merely reducing its enrichment of uranium, even for civilian energy projects.</p><p>“I say no enrichment,” Trump told reporters. “Not 20 percent, 30 percent.”</p><p>Trump’s latest comments are likely to feed ongoing fears of a military escalation with Iran, a conflict that could spill into the broader region.</p><p>His remarks coincided with an email from US Ambassador Mike Huckabee to embassy staff in Israel, giving them permission to leave the country, another signal that simmering tensions might boil over.</p><p>Huckabee emphasised that those who leave “should do so TODAY”, according to media reports. He added, however, that there is “no need to panic”.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://x.com/usembassyjlm/status/2027312031133499902\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">public notice</a> from the US Embassy in Jerusalem acknowledged the authorisation to leave and cited “safety risks” due to “terrorism and civil unrest”.</p><p>“Persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available,” the notice said.</p><p>The State Department also issued a <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/iran-designated-as-a-state-sponsor-of-wrongful-detention/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> from Rubio designating Iran a “state sponsor of wrongful detention”. He also urged US citizens to not “travel to Iran for any reason” or leave immediately, if they were already there.</p><h2 id=\"threat-of-iran-attack\">Threat of Iran attack</h2><p>Concerns have been mounting, though, that the US may seek to take military action against Iran, a longtime adversary of Israel and the US.</p><p>Since <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972658725010644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January</a>, the administration of US President Donald Trump has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">deployed a “massive armada”</a> to the waters near Iran, including two aircraft carriers, the USS Gerald Ford and the USS Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>Trump has also hinted on several occasions that he is prepared to launch an attack, either to force a deal to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities or intervene on behalf of Iranian protesters.</p><p>On January 1, for instance, Trump responded to a deadly crackdown on antigovernment demonstrations in Iran by <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posting</a> a message on Truth Social.</p><p>It said that the US military was “locked and loaded and ready to go” to “rescue” any protesters who might be killed.</p><p>More recently, during last Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Trump described his military threats as a successful tactic in stopping the execution of protesters.</p><p>“We stopped them from hanging a lot of them with the threat of serious violence,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that he would not be afraid to act. “I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must,” Trump said in the primetime speech, which accused Iran of having “spread nothing but terrorism and death and hate”.</p><p>On Friday, however, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk signalled that <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2026/02/our-choices-our-voices-our-votes-determine-our-future-says-turk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eight protesters</a> have nevertheless been sentenced to death, and 30 more are at risk of receiving the same penalty.</p><p>Turk also warned against the possibility of military action, highlighting the risk of civilian harm.</p><p>“I am extremely alarmed about the potential for regional military escalation and its impact on civilians, and I hope the voice of reason prevails,” he said.</p><p>Still, the Trump administration cited human rights</p><h2 id=\"pushing-for-a-deal\">Pushing for a deal</h2><p>But the protesters have not been the only motive Trump has cited for his sabre-rattling.</p><p>Trump has also indicated that military intervention may be necessary should Iran fail to agree to a nuclear deal.</p><p>On February 19, the president told reporters aboard his jet, Air Force One, that Iran had “10, 15 days, pretty much maximum” to strike a deal with US negotiators.</p><p>Should it fail to, Trump indicated he would take his “maximum pressure” campaign a “step further”, appearing to imply military action.</p><p>“We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen,” Trump had said earlier in the day at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace panel.</p><p>Iran, meanwhile, has said its position is “close” to that of the US on many issues, but it has called for the Trump administration to drop what it considers “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/27/iran-says-us-must-drop-excessive-demands-in-nuclear-negotiations\">excessive demands</a>“.</p><p>Recent reports have indicated that the US government not only wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear programme, but it also seeks to curtail its ballistic missile arsenal and sever its relations with regional allies and proxy groups, like Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p>Iran, however, has largely dismissed those demands as unrealistic, and it has argued that its nuclear enrichment programme is designed to produce civilian energy, not weaponry.</p><p>It has also warned of retaliation if the US proceeds with another military strike.</p><p>Last June, the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, including the Fordow facility, as part of a 12-day war initiated by an Israeli attack. The Trump administration dubbed the campaign “Operation Midnight Hammer”.</p><p>The latest negotiations seek to mint a new nuclear deal following the collapse of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a multilateral agreement that saw Iran scale down its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>But Trump’s decision, during his first term, to withdraw the US caused the deal to fall apart. As part of his withdrawal, Trump renewed US sanctions against Iran.</p><h2 id=\"there-s-always-a-risk\">‘There’s always a risk’</h2><p>But the pressure on Iran has increased in recent days, particularly as media reports emerged that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has been blocked from accessing the three sites targeted in Operation Midnight Hammer.</p><p>The agency has indicated that it cannot confirm whether Iran has suspended nuclear enrichment at the sites, nor can it estimate the size of Iran’s nuclear stockpile.</p><p>That news is likely to fuel the Trump administration’s efforts: It has long warned that Iran seeks a nuclear weapon, a claim Tehran denies.</p><p>Still, the government of Oman, which is mediating the talks, issued a statement striking a positive note, following a meeting between its top diplomat and US Vice President JD Vance.</p><p>“His excellency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, clarified that the negotiations have thus far achieved significant, important and unprecedented progress, which could form the cornerstone of the desired agreement,” the statement said.</p><p>It added that Oman would continue “its efforts in supporting dialogue and facilitating rapprochement between the concerned parties” and that diplomatic efforts could resolve the impasse.</p><p>Still, as Trump prepared to travel to Texas on Friday, he was asked about the prospect of a military strike sparking a wider, drawn-out regional war with Iran.</p><p>He largely shrugged off the possibility, citing successes with Operation Midnight Hammer as well as his decision to order the assassination of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020.</p><p>“I guess you could say there’s always a risk. When there’s war, there’s a risk in anything, both good and bad. We’ve had tremendous luck,” Trump replied. “Everything’s worked out, and we want to keep it that way.”</p><p>He called on Iran to negotiate in “good faith and conscience”. Still, he ended with a note of scepticism: “They are not getting there.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Palestinians.</p><p>Aid agencies – including Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE – were notified by Israeli authorities in December that their Israeli work registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them and provide lists containing personal details on their Palestinian staff.</p><p>The organisations say

Norwegian Refugee Council, said the decision was welcome, but pointed to the difficulties that aid agencies continue to face in Gaza.</p><p>“The injunction pauses immediate closure. It does not restore visas, reopen access or resolve the wider restrictions that continue to affect aid delivery.</p><p>“Despite a ceasefire agreement, conditions in Gaza remain catastrophic, and humanitarian needs in the West Bank continue to grow,” said Low.</p><p>Athena Rayburn, executive director for the Association of International Development Agencies, said they were “still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate,” adding that the situation inside Gaza remained “catastrophic”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-attacks-continue-in-gaza\">Israeli attacks continue in Gaza</h2><p>In Gaza, at least six Palestinians were killed in Israeli drone attacks targeting two police posts in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Strip and the al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis in the south on Friday.</p><p>Medical sources at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis reported the arrival of four bodies and several wounded individuals following an Israeli military strike on a police checkpoint at the al-Maslakh intersection in al-Mawasi.</p><p>The sources said that the strike occurred in an area outside the Israeli military’s control, and described the condition of some of the wounded as critical.</p><p>In the central Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed, and others were injured, in a similar Israeli drone strike that targeted a police post at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp.</p><p>The attacks overnight into Friday were condemned by Hamas as undermining mediator efforts during a “ceasefire” phase that <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">Israel has violated almost daily</a> since October 10.</p><p>Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said it was a “bloody night.

That came on the heels of Netflix’s decision on Thursday evening that it would not match Paramount’s latest $31 per share bid or raise its offer of $27.75 a share for Warner Bros’s studio and streaming assets, stating that the deal was “no longer financially attractive”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Warner had given Netflix four business days to come up with a counteroffer for Paramount’s latest bid — but Netflix, instead, responded less than two hours later, declining to raise its proposal. It said the new price it would have to pay made the deal “no longer financially attractive”.</p><p>“We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros′ iconic brands,” Netflix’s co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a joint statement. “But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p><p>The decision was welcomed by investors. Shares of the streaming giant had shed more than 18 percent since Netflix announced its deal with Warner Bros on December 5.</p><p>The latest move is a “tick in the box” for discipline, said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot.</p><p>“What you want from a management team is an ability to look at acquisitions, value them, pay what they think is a fair price, but to not overpay.”</p><p>Analysts and investors had questioned whether Netflix’s bid was a defensive attempt to block a future competitor or an offensive shift away from its historically disciplined build-versus-buy approach.</p><p>“A positive turn of events in our view, as we believe NFLX’s withdrawal from the race will leave it free to refocus on its business, while its closest competitors grapple with long and distracting regulatory approval and merger integration processes, and with PSKY saddled with sizable deal debts,” HSBC analysts said.</p><h2 id=\"hollywood-and-ego\">‘Hollywood and ego’</h2><p>Shares of the David Ellison-led Paramount, meanwhile, were up 17 percent.</p><p>Paramount’s deal, valued at $110bn, including debt, represents nearly 13 times Warner Bros’ EBITDA – earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or core profits – this year, according to estimates from LSEG. That is well above what Paramount is worth on the same basis, which is 7 times its estimated earnings.</p><p>A tie-up with Warner Bros would allow Paramount’s storied Hollywood studio to tap into Warner’s deep trove of intellectual property – including franchises such as Fantastic Beasts and The Matrix – across film, television and streaming.</p><p>“WBD’s largest asset is declining, and the company is still under debt from its last failed merger. But this deal is more about Ellison taking over Hollywood and ego than it is about good business sense,” said Ross Benes, senior analyst at Emarketer.</p><p>For Paramount’s streaming unit, a combination with HBO Max and Discovery+ would reshape its position in a streaming era long dominated by Netflix.</p><p>“Paramount was the streaming market laggard, and it needs Warner Bros’ content and capabilities to play catch-up. It will need more than Harry Potter for the deal to work its magic and enable Paramount to fight off Netflix, Disney and Amazon in the streaming wars,” said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the fight for Warner Bros, the Paramount consortium – backed by Larry Ellison, billionaire and ally of United States President Donald Trump, and led by his son, Paramount CEO David Ellison – also boosted its termination fee to $7bn and expanded its financing commitments, including $45.7bn in equity.</p><p>“There is a right price and wrong price for any acquisition, and the pressure is now on Paramount to prove the big financial outlay is worth it,” said Coatsworth.</p><h2 id=\"concerns-of-editorial-shifts\">Concerns of editorial shifts</h2><p>The proposed combination, which will still need the green light from both Warner shareholders and regulators, poses both antitrust concerns and questions of political influence.</p><p>A merger between the two companies would put CNN under the same roof as CBS, which has already seen significant editorial shifts under new Skydance ownership. Paramount took steps to appeal to more conservative viewers in its news operations, notably with the installation of Free Press founder Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News. And if the company’s takeover bid of Warner is successful, critics warn similar shifts could happen to CNN, a network that has long attracted ire from Trump.</p><p>“Politics are playing an outsized role in this deal, and they’ve been on Paramount’s side from the get‑go,” said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, a market research company.</p><p>Top Democratic lawmakers have also sounded the alarm about the Republican president’s ties to companies, such as Paramount, and potential consequences of growing corporate power.</p><p>“A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime antitrust hawk, said in a statement on Thursday night. She also called a potential Paramount-Warner combo an “antitrust disaster”.</p><p>How regulators will respond to a Warner-Paramount deal remains to be seen. The US Department of Justice has already initiated reviews, and other countries are expected to do so, too.</p><p>Warner shareholders will have to be convinced, too. But Paramount is taking on billions of dollars in debt to finance its offer — something critics have warned could only increase the likelihood of potential job losses and other restructuring down the road. Foreign sovereign wealth funds have also provided equity for the offer, drawing added scrutiny.</p></div></div></body></html>"

beaten Pakistan and Sri Lanka to secure qualification for the semifinals before claiming top spot with their win against New Zealand.</p><p>Pakistan must not only beat Sri Lanka, but overturn a net-run rate deficit, if they are to climb above the Kiwis to claim the final last-four spot.</p><p>To leapfrog New Zealand, and set up a semifinal against South Africa, Pakistan must either beat the Sri Lankans by roughly 65 runs or more, or chase their target down in fewer than 13 overs.</p><p>Both equations will be dependent on the outcome of the first innings of the game.</p><h2 id=\"pakistan-focused-on-sri-lanka-regardless-of-semifinal-hopes-at-t20-world-cup\">Pakistan focused on Sri Lanka regardless of semifinal hopes at T20 World Cup</h2><p>Fast bowler Salman Mirza said Pakistan’s focus has always been on beating Sri Lanka, regardless of whether their qualification hopes remained alive at the T20 World Cup.</p><p>Pakistan needed England to beat New Zealand handsomely in Colombo on Friday, but must now post a big victory of their own against Sri Lanka to sneak into the final four on net run rate.</p><p>A New Zealand win would have ended Pakistan’s hopes, rendering the Sri Lanka clash in Kandy meaningless in terms of the tournament.</p><p>“It’s a critical situation as reaching the semifinal [was] not in our control,” Mirza told reporters</p><p>“But if we reach the semifinal, we have the capability to do better.</p><p>“We needed to win the match against England, and that defeat has given us this position.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4288503\"

Ahmed’s wrist-spin partner Adil Rashid stepped in, however, to have Tim Seifert stumped for 35 off 25, before off-spinner Will Jacks removed Finn Allen for 29 off 19.</p><p>Over to Ahmed, who picked up the wicket of Rachin Ravindra with his first ball in World Cup cricket. Glenn Phillips topped up the total with 39 off 28 before he became Jacks’ second wicket, while Rashid and Ahmed also went on to claim two scalps.</p><p>“We have seen what Rehan can do in the nets, and he has gone out there and taken the game away from them,” England captain Brooks said.</p><p>“We said from the start of the competition that we will select players based on conditions, and we felt today was the day to bring Rehan in – he did an amazing job.”</p><p>South Africa has already qualified from Group 1. The second spot will be decided by the result of the match between India and the West Indies on Sunday. England will face the winner of that game in the semifinals.</p><p>“We’ve already played against West Indies … both teams are very strong and powerful,” Brooks added.</p><p>“We still haven’t played the perfect game, nor had the starts we would like with the bat and ball, but we have got over the line in some very tight games and in World Cups that can help you.”</p><p>For Pakistan to leapfrog New Zealand and set up a semifinal against South Africa, they must either beat Sri Lanka by roughly 65 runs or more, or chase their target down in fewer than 13 overs. Both equations will be dependent on the outcome of the first innings of the game.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, which arrived on Friday in the Israeli port city of Haifa, according to Israeli Channel 12.</p><p>Iran has said that it was not going to initiate a war, but that it was ready to respond if attacked, threatening to strike bases used by US forces in the region.</p><p>The military build-up has left the region bracing for a potential war that could spiral into a regional conflict. On Friday, China told its citizens to evacuate from Iran “as soon as possible” and the US authorised the departure of nonemergency embassy staff from Israel – the same order Washington issued for the US mission in Lebanon earlier this week. Canada, India, UK and Poland have also issued similar orders.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Wiles, a close adviser to Trump, has blamed the Republican defeats on Trump’s absence from the ballot.</p><p>\"Typically, in the midterms, it’s not about who’s sitting in the White House. You localise the election, and you keep federal officials out of it,\" Wiles explained to The Mom View.</p><p>\"We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot, because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.\"</p><p>Her strategy is designed to harness the strong sense of loyalty Trump has engendered in the Republican Party.</p><p>The YouGov poll found conservative voters overwhelmingly approved of his job, at a rate of 82 percent. A mid-January CBS News survey found an even higher approval rating — 90 percent — among US adults who identify as Republicans.</p><p>“Since 2016, our surveys have all been off because we underestimate the Trump vote consistently,\" said political scientist Lonna Rae Atkeson.</p><p>“Trump has definitely drawn more support from irregular voters, people who don't regularly go to the polls, during presidential elections.\"</p><p>But she questioned whether Trump's endorsement would translate into increased support for down-ballot races.</p><p>\"We haven't seen that carry over well to the midterms,” said Atkeson. “So it may not turn out well for him.”</p><p>But putting Trump \"on the ballot\", as Wiles suggests, also risks shifting the focus of the midterm races away from local issues.</p><p>Instead, experts like Gillespie believe that \"nationalising\" the midterm races could homogenise both down-ballot candidates and their policy platforms, as they seek to reflect national priorities, not local ones.</p><p>“One manifestation of polarisation in American politics is that national issues increasingly supplant local ones,” Gillespie said. “As national politics seep into state and local races, it becomes harder for federal candidates to distinguish themselves from Washington.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
