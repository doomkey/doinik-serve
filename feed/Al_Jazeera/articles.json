Al-Sharaa has used varying tactics against the group, recently announcing a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree</a> for Kurdish rights while also confronting the group militarily.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The SDF’s loss is al-Sharaa and his government’s gain. But the most significant sign of Syria’s improved standing may come from the fact that US officials, who have long backed the SDF as a partner in fighting ISIL (ISIS), have given their backing to al-Sharaa and Syrian forces after these latest developments.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"ceasefire-and-agreements\">Ceasefire and agreements</h2><p>These recent advancements by the Syrian government have stripped away much of the SDF’s leverage.</p><p>“This was about [the Syrian government forces] taking control of the most resource-rich parts of SDF territory that had the demographically highest number of Arabs, so they managed to play this very well by having a limited offensive but, at the same time, getting the tribal networks to rise up against SDF rule; and once they did that, it was basically game over for the SDF,” Rob Geist Pinfold, a lecturer at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>When the Assad regime fell in December 2024, the SDF was hesitant to throw its hat into the ring with the new forces in Damascus. Negotiations between Mazloum Abdi, the SDF’s leader, also known as Mazloum Kobani, and al-Sharaa culminated in an agreement on March 10, 2025 to integrate the Kurdish-led forces into the Syrian government forces.</p><p>However, details of the agreement were still to be ironed out. The SDF did not want to give up the hard-fought gains it had made during the last 14 years of conflict. It has previously called for autonomous control or decentralised rule in the northeast.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Tension had simmered between the two sides, manifesting in recent clashes in Aleppo and an SDF withdrawal from the city across the Euphrates River. Syrian government forces advanced towards the northeast and have now taken territory, including the cities of Raqqa and Deir Az Zor.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/syria-sdf-ceasefire-hangs-in-balance-after-renewed-clashes-faltering-talks\">ceasefire was agreed</a> on Monday, but clashes continued on Tuesday in the Hasakah region of northeast Syria, as Kurds there and in the diaspora feared incursions by government forces.</p><p>Recent discussions seemed to have settled on a formula where the SDF leadership would maintain control over three Kurdish-led divisions in Syrian forces, while the rest of the fighters would integrate as individuals. Analysts said it now looks as though individual integration is more likely to go ahead.</p><p>“They [the Syrian government] have achieved a very big milestone by forcing the SDF to integrate as individuals,” Labib Nahhas, a Syrian analyst, told Al Jazeera. “But vetting will be a huge challenge because we are talking about 50 to 70 or 80,000 soldiers, so this is a massive infiltration from a security point of view.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"kurdish-rights\">Kurdish rights</h2><p>Before this significant development, the SDF had been negotiating with Damascus over a few key points. In addition to discussions about integration, it wanted some form of autonomy or political decentralisation and the recognition of Kurdish rights.</p><p>On January 16, on the back of fierce fighting between government forces and the SDF in Aleppo, al-Sharaa issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree</a> formally recognising Kurdish as a “national language” and restoring citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians.</p><p>The decree, which declared Newroz, the spring and new year festival celebrated by Kurds, a national holiday and banned ethnic or linguistic discrimination, addressed one key SDF demand.</p><p>Under the Assad regime, Kurds were an oppressed minority in Syria. Their language and identity were not officially recognised and often suppressed by the state.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The move was described by Obayda Ghadban, a researcher with Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, as historic.</p><p>“It has recognised the cultural, linguistic rights of Kurdish Syrians, which is a grievance that has been accumulating for decades,” he told Al Jazeera. “This was seen as a gesture of goodwill by the SDF and regained the momentum of negotiations that have been going [on] for more than a year now.”</p><p>Al-Sharaa announced a four-day ceasefire with the SDF on Tuesday and said if a deal could be reached, government forces would leave Kurdish-majority cities like Hasakah and Qamishli to handle their security themselves.</p><p>Despite the carrot-and-stick approach, some analysts felt al-Sharaa’s recognition of Kurdish rights was likely a political tactic.</p><p>“Had a similar decree been issued six months ago in the context of relative peace between the two sides, I believe the situation would have been very different,” Thomas McGee, Max Weber fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The fact that no recognition of Kurdish rights came for the full first year after the fall of al-Assad is indeed significant. With this decree suddenly coming out within the context of large military developments shows that the Syrian government considers recognition of Kurdish rights as a tactical issue rather than such rights being considered innate and unconditional.”</p><p>Shortly after the announcement, al-Sharaa announced a military operation in Deir Hafir, a town in the north, 50km (31 miles) east of Aleppo, where SDF forces had retreated after evacuating the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh in Aleppo. Some Syrians and analysts told Al Jazeera that the SDF’s reputation had suffered amid the fighting in Aleppo, even among some Kurds, but it did not mean Kurds would throw their weight behind the government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“[Al-Sharaa] wanted to do this before the military operation,” Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an analyst of Kurdish politics based in Erbil, Iraq, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The Kurdish sentiment will not change much towards the government because it doesn’t recognise any form of local autonomy, and both <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/who-are-the-kurds-2\">the main Kurdish parties</a> want some form of autonomy or decentralisation.”</p><h2 id=\"us-and-turkiye\">US and Turkiye</h2><p>International actors will also have their eyes on the developments in northeast Syria.</p><p>Turkiye appears to be a big winner in the latest developments. The country <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/syrian-government-and-kurdish-led-sdf-fail-to-progress-on-military-merger\">warned the SDF</a> in early January that its “patience is running out” with the group.</p><p>“Ankara has welcomed the ceasefire and Full Integration Agreement, and it is certainly in Turkish interests,” McGee said. “Ultimately, on the SDF/self-administration integration, Turkiye and Damascus have long shared the same general red lines.”</p><p>There has also been a discussion about foreign fighters in SDF-controlled areas, which, under the ceasefire agreement, Nahhas said, the SDF was required to expel any “PKK-linked or affiliated individuals or operatives”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Then there is the United States, which helped broker the ceasefire due to its close relationship with the SDF and Damascus. The US currently has about 900 soldiers in the SDF-controlled parts of Syria for countering ISIL, and analysts said it was unlikely those troops would withdraw.</p><p>But under the Trump administration, relations between Washington and Damascus have warmed considerably.</p><p>Al-Sharaa, who had been considered a “terrorist” by the US when the Assad regime fell in 2024, visited the White House in November 2025, marking a remarkable turnaround in barely a year. Shortly after that visit, Syria <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/syria-signs-up-to-us-led-coalition-against-isil\">joined</a> the anti-ISIL coalition.</p><p>After a phone call with al-Sharaa, US President Donald Trump released a statement on Monday supporting Syria’s unity and “fight against terrorism”.</p><p>Not every US official was pleased with the recent events. US Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, posted on X on Tuesday his support for the SDF.</p><p>“You cannot unite Syria by the use of military force as Syrian government leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa is trying to do,” he wrote. “This move by Syrian government forces against SDF members is fraught with peril.”</p><p>Graham and others may be concerned about reports of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/isil-fighters-flee-jail-as-syrian-army-clashes-with-kurdish-led-sdf\">39 escaped ISIL detainees</a> from prisons previously held by the SDF, or, on the other side, SDF claims that government forces killed female Kurdish fighters.</p><p>But the sentiment in the US seems to be shifting heavily in favour of Damascus. On Tuesday afternoon, US Special Envoy for Syria Tom Barrack posted on X that the US was throwing its support behind al-Sharaa and choosing Damascus over the SDF.</p><p>“The greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria right now lies in the post-Assad transition under the new government led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa,” Barrack wrote. “This shifts the rationale for the US-SDF partnership: the original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps.”</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

It will manage Gaza’s day-to-day affairs in place of the Palestinian group Hamas as part of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire plan.</p><p>The US announced that the second phase had begun last week.</p><p>Khaled now wants to see tangible results from the NGAC and the second phase, starting with the opening of the Rafah crossing. But he is sceptical.</p><p>“I hope it’s a committee with real powers, not just words on paper,” Khaled told Al Jazeera. “Otherwise, it will be a failed committee.”</p><p>His pessimism is understandable. Israel has continued to attack Gaza, killing more than 400 Palestinians since the beginning of the ceasefire.</p><p>It has also made clear its opposition to the NGAC, and makes little effort to allow for life in Gaza to improve. One of Israel’s most recent moves has been to <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/11/israels-ban-on-ngos-operating-in-gaza-will-be-devastating\">order the shutdown</a> of international humanitarian organisations providing vital medical care and food aid in Gaza.</p><p>“On the ground, the shelling never stops,” Khaled said, as he followed news on the NGAC from inside a shelter set up in the former Legislative Council building in western Gaza City.</p><p>“In the media, they talk about withdrawals and reconstruction, but on the ground, the bombing continues from the north and the south, and things seem even more complicated.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4255993\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4255993\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4255993\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/873A1723-copy-1768952314.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Man stands in front of tent \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4255993\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Khaled Abu Jarrar hopes the new committee set up to administer Gaza will have real powers and authority [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"waiting-for-solutions\">Waiting for solutions</h2><p>Khaled’s living arrangements in a government building are not unusual. Thousands of displaced people have found shelter in the structures from which Gaza was once administered, or buildings that have at least partially survived Israel’s targeting.</p><p>This reality underlines the difficulty the NGAC and any administration will face when attempting to govern Gaza.</p><p>And it makes any talk of new committees and administrations hinge on a series of simple questions for the displaced: Will the technocrats be able to overcome the restrictions imposed on Gaza by Israel? Will they be able to deliver tangible changes to the lives of Palestinians exhausted by displacement and loss?</p><p>The committee is presented as a politically “neutral” framework, made up of non-factional figures with administrative and technical expertise. It will be led by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister.</p><p>But <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/gazas-phase-two-from-a-distance-why-hope-still-feels-out-of-reach\">many Palestinians</a> believe its success depends less on its composition and more on its ability to operate in an environment that Israel still dominates, and is unwilling to allow to rebuild.</p><p>Palestinian political analyst Ahed Farwana referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent comments, in which he described the second phase of the ceasefire as “symbolic”, as evidence that Israel has no intention of cooperating.</p><p>“So far, things are unclear for the committee, because it depends on serious implementation of the second phase’s obligations,” Farwana told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Many of the obligations on Israel in the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/us-declares-phase-two-of-gaza-ceasefire-but-what-did-phase-one-deliver\">first phase of the ceasefire</a>, such as halting attacks, a full Israeli withdrawal from a specified area of Gaza, and the opening of the Rafah crossing, have not happened.</p><p>Farwana believes that Netanyahu does not want to pay the political cost in Israel of allowing the ceasefire to progress and fully declaring an end to the war, particularly as he will face an election sometime this year.</p><p>If anything, Farwana expects Israel to continue violating the ceasefire and expanding its buffer zone, while it cites excuses such as that one remaining Israeli body has not been handed over from Gaza. Hamas has said that it is unable to reach the body because of the amount of rubble left behind by Israeli attacks.</p><p>“If there is real American pressure, there will be real change and implementation of the second phase,” Farwana said, arguing that the ceasefire’s partial success was largely tied to pushes made by the US administration. “[But] leaving the field to Netanyahu will not produce results.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256001\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256001\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256001\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/873A1878-copy-1768952519.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"View of Gaza legislative building arch\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256001\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians use what remains of the Gaza Legislative Council building in Gaza City for shelter [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"israeli-restrictions\">Israeli restrictions</h2><p>Israeli officials deny the existence of limits on the quantity of aid coming into Gaza. However, international organisations and local Palestinians point to delays in permit approvals, as well as prolonged inspection procedures that slow access and restrict the entry of goods Gaza desperately needs, including non-food items and heavy materials for infrastructure.</p><p>The United Nations and aid agencies have repeatedly called for crossings to be opened and the facilitation of aid entry, stressing that the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic and that a large share of agreed-upon aid has yet to enter since the implementation of the ceasefire.</p><p>The continued closure of the Rafah crossing, in particular, has left Gaza almost entirely dependent on other entry points, such as Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom), which is subject to complex inspection procedures and full Israeli security control.</p><p>Against these obstacles, discussions about Gaza’s new administration become more complex, as any committee’s authority to manage services and reconstruction is directly linked to its ability to operate within restrictions on the movement of materials.</p><p>Asmaa Manoun is waiting desperately for things to improve.</p><p>The 45-year-old, originally from northern Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, is a mother of five, but one of her children was killed during the war.</p><p>She now lives with her husband Mohammad – injured during the war – in the stairwell of a partially-destroyed building in Gaza City.

But constant Israeli shelling and gunfire, including a bullet that she said killed a woman in the tent next to her, ended the experiment and made it clear that safety was still a far-off prospect.</p><p>Mohammad, 49, stood beside Asmaa as she talked. His hope for the new committee was clear: organise aid entry and distribution, and manage Gaza after the chaos that it had been through.</p><p>“We hear a lot, but in reality, we are in the same place we’ve been for two years,” he said.</p><p>“The situation in Gaza is beyond difficult. We can barely manage. For many months, we haven’t received aid, food parcels, or tents. Things are chaotic, and Israel is interested in this chaos, and in using aid as punishment.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Rather than reduce US dependence on the two regions, both major manufacturing hubs, the tariffs have simply rearranged supply chains.</p><p>“If you squeeze a balloon in one direction and people still want the product, then they will get the product, whatever it is, from a different location,” said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore.</p><p>“Trade moves to where trade opportunities can be found,” she told Al Jazeera. “We have shuffled the way that we do trade, but we haven’t ended trade.”</p><h2 id=\"drop-in-chinese-exports-to-us\">Drop in Chinese exports to US</h2><p>One of Trump’s top targets was China, the world’s factory and a major source of exports to the US.</p><p>Months of tit-for-tariffs imposed by Washington and Beijing ended with an average US duty of 47.5 percent on Chinese goods as of November 2025, according to the US-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p>The final duties could change following a future meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, scheduled for April, but it has already led to a sharp drop in trade.</p><p>Amid the turmoil of 2025, the value of Chinese exports to the US fell 20 percent, according to Chinese customs data.</p><p><span>The US Census Bureau, which publishes US trade data, reported that the trade deficit for goods also fell dramatically. The value of imported goods from China fell from $438.7bn in 2024 to $266.3bn in 2025, according to US Census data.</span></p><p>The overall US trade deficit for goods fell from <span>$245.5bn in 2024 to $175.4bn in 2025, according to the same data. </span></p><p>US trade data tell a different story for Southeast Asia, however, whose manufacturers are a key part of the “Chinese Plus One” supply chain.</p><h2 id=\"southeast-asia-s-gain\">Southeast Asia’s gain</h2><p>The region was a major target of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, with preliminary duties set at 17 to 49 percent for Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Tariffs were later negotiated to 19 to 20 percent through bilateral trade deals that allowed some sector-specific exemptions.</p><p>While higher than before, they are still less than the US tariffs imposed on China.</p><p>The US trade in goods with Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines all rose in 2025, even as these countries faced “reciprocal tariff” rates of 19 percent, according to census data. The US trade deficit for goods rose 11 percent with Indonesia, 23 percent with Thailand, and an astonishing 38 percent with the Philippines – albeit from a relatively modest $4.9bn to $6.8bn.</p><p>Trade in goods with Cambodia and Malaysia remained unchanged between 2024 and 2025, despite tariffs of 19 percent, according to census data.</p><p>The most substantial change in terms of the dollar amount in Southeast Asia was seen in Vietnam, where the US trade deficit for goods rose more than $20bn – from $123.4bn in 2024 to $145.7bn in 2025 – despite a 20 percent tariff, according to the same data.</p><h2 id=\"is-china-just-rerouting-its-goods\">Is China just rerouting its goods?</h2><p>Some of this shift can be explained by Chinese goods being rerouted through Southeast Asia to the US – a practice known as transshipment – but Zichun Huang, a China economist at the United Kingdom’s Capital Economics, told Al Jazeera that supply chains continue to move around.</p><p>“Rerouting of exports to the US via neighbouring countries has played a role. But it has not been the main driver,” she said by email.</p><p>“Instead, there’s been a more fundamental reconfiguration of supply chains: ASEAN is importing more machinery and intermediate goods from China, which are being used in the production of exports sent to the US,” she continued, using the acronym for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</p><p>Chinese exporters are also expanding their customer base beyond the US, as reflected in China’s record $1.19 trillion global trade surplus in 2025, posted last week by Beijing’s General Administration of Customs.</p><p>The White House last year threatened to impose a 40 percent tariff on “transshipments”, but the term has become increasingly hard to define as supply chains spread across Southeast Asia, with goods crossing borders multiple times during the manufacturing process, according to Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p><p>“Probably one reason why we haven’t seen the US move on this is the difficulty in defining a transshipment,” he told Al Jazeera. At the same time, he said, the US is distracted with trade and foreign policy concerns in other parts of the world.</p><h2 id=\"taiwan-trade-booms-with-ai-as-key-driver\">Taiwan trade booms, with AI as key driver</h2><p>Trump has threatened new tariffs on European countries that oppose the US’s moves to take control of Greenland, as well as countries that continue to do business with Iran following Tehran’s crackdown on mass antigovernment protests.</p><p>Trump has meanwhile shown that he can have competing and even contradictory aims for the US economy, according to experts like Elms. While the US president may want the US trade deficit to shrink, he also wants to fuel the AI boom and US-based manufacturing.</p><p>Nowhere is this clearer than in Trump’s dealings with Taiwan, which the US president has previously accused of stealing the chip industry from the US.</p><p>Trade with Taiwan is booming, even as it has fallen elsewhere in East Asia, according to US government data. The US deficit with Taiwan ballooned more than 50 percent from $73.7bn in 2024 to $111.8bn in 2025, thanks to tariff carveouts for Taiwan’s semiconductors and derivative parts.</p><p>Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” on Taiwanese goods – agreed to last week as 15 percent – only affected about 30 percent of exports, according to Kristy Tsun-Tzu Hsu, director of the Taiwan ASEAN Studies Centre at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei.</p><p>Still, the surge in exports caught many observers off-guard, she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is very different from what everybody expected, because Taiwan and other countries expected weak exports last year, but because of this inventory [stockpiling] and the AI boom, there is very strong demand for semiconductors.”</p><p>Hsu said the same demand explained the surge in imports from Vietnam, which has risen through the ranks to become one of the US’s top chip suppliers. She expected the surge to continue into 2026 for both places.</p><p>Elms said Trump was unlikely to move against Taiwan on the issue of chips, despite the ballooning US trade deficit.</p><p>She acknowledged the US president’s “desire to have the trade deficits shrink”.</p><p>But she added, “Trump loves the stock market boom as a result of AI.”</p><p>“I think for Trump, if you said to him, would you rather have a lower trade deficit overall or a higher booming stock market? He would vote for the stock market every time,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>Whether the tariffs will remain in place is uncertain as Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” face a legal challenge at the US Supreme Court. Experts told Al Jazeera that even if the court strikes them down, the tariffs could still take months if not years to unwind.</p><p>Priyanka Kishore, director and principal economist at Asia Decoded in Singapore, told Al Jazeera that the midterm elections in the US in November could dent Trump’s enthusiasm for tariffs as the country’s prices rise.</p><p>“At this point in time, there’s a lot of uncertainty. There are two very strong schools of thought. One is that he has a lot of other avenues to go through,” said Priyanka Kishore, director and principal economist at Asia Decoded in Singapore. “And the other is that the general sentiment is turning against him. He does not have the popular support that he used to have.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

This has made the upcoming election a bipolar contest between the frontrunner, the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/why-bnp-leader-tarique-rahmans-return-to-bangladesh-matters-ahead-of-vote\">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> (BNP), and an electoral alliance forged by the Jamaat with the <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/bangladesh-students-who-deposed-pm-hasina-form-party-to-fight-elections\">National Citizen Party</a> (NCP), a group formed by student leaders of the 2024 uprising along with other Islamist parties.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Razzak’s confidence is fuelled by recent opinion polls that suggest the Jamaat is closing in on the BNP, its senior coalition partner for decades.</p><p class=\"pf0\">A December survey by the United States-based International Republican Institute put the BNP’s support at 33 percent, with Jamaat close behind at 29 percent. Another poll last week, conducted by leading Bangladeshi agencies – including NarratiV, Projection BD, the International Institute of Law and Diplomacy (IILD) and the Jagoron Foundation – found the BNP leading at 34.7 percent, and Jamaat at 33.6 percent.</p><p>If the Jamaat-led alliance is able to emerge victorious, it will be a dramatic turnaround for a party that was subjected to a brutal crackdown during Hasina’s 15-year government. Under Hasina, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/1/bangladesh-top-court-lifts-ban-on-jamaat-e-islami-countrys-largest-muslim-party\">Jamaat was banned</a>, its top leaders hanged or jailed, and thousands of its members <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/thousands-of-forced-disappearances-under-hasina-rule-in-bangladesh-inquiry\">forcibly disappeared</a> or killed in custody.</p><p>The crackdown followed convictions by the International Crimes Tribunal – a controversial court that Hasina founded in 2010 – to try suspects for their alleged role in crimes committed during Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.</p><p>Ironically, the same tribunal in November sentenced 78-year-old Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters, killing more than 1,400 of them. Hasina is in exile in India, her close ally, where she fled after the uprising. Despite several appeals by the Yunus administration, New Delhi has so far <a href=\"/features/2025/11/18/why-india-likely-wont-return-hasina-to-face-bangladesh-death-penalty\">refused to hand</a> Hasina over to face the gallows.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"resurgence-after-decades-of-repression\">Resurgence after decades of repression</h2><p>Jamaat supported Pakistan during the 1971 war, a move that continues to anger many in Bangladesh today. However, after Hasina’s escape to India during the uprising and the subsequent release of key Jamaat leaders from prison, the Islamist party has grown <a href=\"/news/2025/7/19/bangladeshs-largest-islamist-party-rallies-for-fair-elections\">increasingly assertive</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>“Our leaders and activists suffered throughout the Hasina years. Many of our leaders were executed. Jamaat and Shibir activists were killed, and our political rights were taken away,” Razzak told Al Jazeera, referring to Islami Chhatra Shibir, Jamaat’s student wing.</p><p>“Now, things have changed. People sympathise with what we went through, and they see us as honest. That is why they will vote for us,” he said.</p><p>Founded by Islamist thinker Syed Abul Ala Maududi in 1941, during the British rule on the Indian subcontinent, the Jamaat evolved from a trans-regional Islamist movement into a distinct political force in Bangladesh.</p><p class=\"pf0\">The party opposed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan, arguing that such a move could weaken Muslim political unity and alter the power balance in South Asia. During the 1971 war, senior Jamaat figures sided with the Pakistani state and even formed paramilitary groups that killed thousands of civilians demanding an independent Bangladesh.</p><p>Shortly after independence, the government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – Hasina’s father – banned Jamaat in 1972, until BNP founder Ziaur Rahman lifted the ban in 1979, when he was president. In the next two decades, Jamaat emerged as a significant political force. It supported the BNP-led coalition in 1991, when Rahman’s wife, <a href=\"/features/2025/12/30/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-woman-pm-a-life-of-power-and-resistance\">Khaleda Zia</a>, became the prime minister for the first time.</p><p>It was during Khaleda’s government that the citizenship of prominent Jamaat leader Ghulam Azam, revoked after independence, was reinstated, giving the party a major boost. In 2001, Jamaat formally joined the BNP-led coalition under Khaleda and held two cabinet positions.</p><p>Jamaat’s setbacks began afresh when Hasina returned to power in 2009 and ordered war-crimes trials against senior Jamaat leaders at the International Crimes Tribunal, which her government set up. Despite rights groups saying the tribunal’s proceedings violated due process, several Jamaat leaders, including former party chief Motiur Rahman Nizami and former Secretary-General Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, were hanged.</p><p>The crackdown decimated the Jamaat leadership and left the party politically marginalised for 15 years.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Since the 2024 uprising and the lifting of the ban on it, Jamaat – currently led by chief Shafiqur Rahman, deputy chief Syed Abdullah Mohammed Taher and Secretary-General Mia Golam Porwar – has reorganised itself into a strong contender in next month’s election.</p><p>Party leaders say the revival reflects not only public sympathy after years of repression, but a broader disillusionment with the country’s established political order.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Over the last 55 years, Bangladesh has mainly been ruled by two parties: the Awami League and the BNP,” Jamaat deputy chief Taher told Al Jazeera. “People have long experience with both, and many feel frustrated. They want a new political force to govern.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">In the political vacuum caused by the ban on Hasina’s Awami League, Jamaat moved swiftly to position itself as the BNP’s principal challenger. That momentum has been reinforced by the recent students’ union elections in which Islami Chhatra Shibir, Jamaat’s student wing, secured victories at key campuses.</p><p>Taher told Al Jazeera that Jamaat has an estimated 20 million supporters, roughly 250,000 of whom are registered members, known as “rukon”, including women. The numbers reveal the party’s organisational strength, which a nascent political party like the NCP aims to capitalise on in the coming election.</p><p>Taher said Jamaat’s appeal across Bangladesh also explains its resilience despite decades of political marginalisation. The “public interest in the Jamaat” is “growing”, he added.</p><p>“If this trend continues, we believe we can win a majority.”</p><h2 id=\"concerns-over-rise-of-islamist-party\">Concerns over rise of Islamist party</h2><p>Jamaat’s resurgence has also prompted debate over whether Bangladesh is prepared to be led by an Islamist force, which some fear could seek to enforce Sharia law or try to restrict women’s rights and freedoms.</p><p>But Jamaat leaders reject such fears and insist they would govern under the country’s secular constitution on a reform agenda.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“When we come to power, we will accept and implement agreed reforms. Where new laws are needed – for example, to ensure good governance and eliminate corruption – we will examine them at that time,” Taher said.</p><p>He also rejected the “conservative” label placed on Jamaat, describing his party as a “moderate Islamist force” that seeks to govern through constitutional reforms rather than ideological enforcement.</p><p>He said the party’s alliance with the NCP, founded by 2024 leaders of the uprising, and with the Liberal Democratic Party, led by 1971 war hero Oli Ahmad, are attempts to “unite the spirit of 1971” with that of the 2024 movement, and reflect a generational change rather than ideological hard lines.</p><p>Jamaat is also seeking to broaden its appeal beyond its Muslim base. For the first time in its history, the party has fielded a Hindu candidate, Krishna Nandi, from the city of Khulna, where it has highlighted minority rights as part of an effort to attract non-Muslim voters, who make up about 10 percent of Bangladesh’s majority-Hindu population.</p><p>Asif Bin Ali, geopolitical analyst and doctoral fellow at Georgia State University in the US, said that while several Bangladeshi voters might be more religious today than they previously were, they are also “politically pragmatic, despite personal piety”, and tend to prefer politicians over clerics.</p><p>“A sizeable part of the Bangladeshi society is moving in a more Islamist direction, but that is not the same as being ready to hand the state to a conservative Islamist leadership,” Ali told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The centrist and centre-left space is still large, and would resist any attempt to recast the state along strict Islamist lines.”</p><p>Thomas Kean, senior consultant on Bangladesh and Myanmar at the International Crisis Group, said that Jamaat’s best bet would lie in drawing voters less by using its Islamist identity and more by its reputation of being a cleaner, more disciplined political force, particularly for voters disillusioned with the BNP and the Awami League.</p><p class=\"pf0\">At the same time, Kean cautioned that Jamaat’s past and some of its policy positions – particularly those related to its Islamist ideology – continue to deter many voters.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Clearly, Jamaat is on track to record its best-ever results in the upcoming election,” he said. “However, I am sceptical of Jamaat’s chances of winning. We are talking about a party that has never won even 20 seats previously, or much more than 12 percent of the popular vote.”</p><h2 id=\"will-alliance-with-ncp-work\">Will alliance with NCP work?</h2><p>Jamaat’s resurgence has also prompted debate over whether Bangladesh is prepared to be led by an Islamist force, which some fear could seek to enforce Sharia law or try to restrict women’s rights and freedoms.</p><p>But Jamaat leaders reject such fears and insist they would govern under the country’s secular constitution on a reform agenda.</p><p>“When we come to power, we will accept and implement agreed reforms.

Domestic politics in both countries would make it very difficult for Jamaat and the BJP to work together,” Kean said, referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party.</p><p>Kean said several “perennial issues” will continue to cause <a href=\"/features/2026/1/6/new-phase-india-eyes-bangladesh-thaw-with-bnp-before-elections\">tensions with India</a>, regardless of which party is in power in Dhaka, including issues related to immigration, border security, and the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/2/17/what-is-holding-up-the-implementation-of-the-teesta-river-project\">sharing of water</a>.</p><p>Since Hasina’s fall in August 2024, Bangladesh has also taken steps to rebuild ties with Pakistan, including a renewed diplomatic engagement, discussions on expanding trade and transport links, and high-level official visits after years of limited contact.</p><p>Jamaat supporters say the February 12 vote is more than an electoral test. It is a referendum on whether a party, long defined by exclusion and controversies, can convert organisational resilience into national legitimacy as a governing force.</p><p>Khan, the professor at SOAS University, argues the contest will be decided less by ideology and more by promises of governance.</p><p>“This election will not be about Islam versus secularism, nor about left versus right,” he said. “It will be about reform versus the status quo. The coalition that provides a more convincing agenda for reform while keeping stability will have an advantage.”</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

Here are some of the key takeaways from his remarks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threatening-greenland\">Threatening Greenland</h2><p>Trump had started his day with a fusillade of social media posts on his platform Truth Social, including <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925888562624963\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one</a> that used images generated through artificial intelligence (AI) to show the US laying claim to Canada, Greenland and Venezuela.</p><p><a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925897257210763\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A second post</a>, also generated with AI, showed Trump planting a US flag on Greenland’s soil, alongside Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>The images were the latest indication that Trump planned to muscle ahead with his plans to take control of Greenland, as part of his expansionist goals for his second term.</p><p>In his news briefing, Trump expressed optimism that his pressure campaign would be successful, as he faced questions from reporters.</p><p>“ We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland,” Trump said of his upcoming trip to Davos on Wednesday. “And I think things are going to work out pretty well, actually.”</p><p>He also waved aside concerns that his ambitions of territorial expansion might strip Greenlanders of their right to self-determination. “When I speak to them, I’m sure they’ll be thrilled,” he said.</p><p>Still, when confronted with questions about how far he was willing to go to acquire the island, Trump struck an ominous note, stating simply, “You’ll find out.”</p><p>Trump has previously refused to take military options off the table, and he has threatened several European allies with a tariff hike should they fail to support his claim to the self-governing island.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"weighing-the-future-of-nato-and-the-un\">Weighing the future of NATO and the UN</h2><p>The sabre-rattling over Greenland led one reporter at the briefing to ask whether Trump was willing to risk the breakup of the NATO alliance to achieve his expansionist agenda.</p><p>Trump responded by largely sidestepping the question. He indicated that a mutually agreeable solution could be struck.</p><p>“I think something’s going to happen that’s going to be very good for everybody,” he said of Greenland.</p><p>“I think that we will work something out where NATO’s going to be very happy and where we’re going to be very happy, but we need it for security purposes. We need a financial security and even world security.”</p><p>He also touted his efforts to boost military spending among NATO members. At a NATO summit in June, most member countries agreed to increase their defence spending to 5 percent of their gross domestic products (GDPs), though Spain successfully petitioned for an exemption.</p><p>“Nobody’s done more for NATO than I have,” Trump said, revisiting a familiar boast.</p><p>Still, he questioned one of NATO’s basic principles. Article Five of the alliance’s treaty requires member states to come to one another’s defence, should any be attacked. But under Trump, allies in Europe and Canada have speculated whether the US would abide by that commitment.</p><p>At Tuesday’s briefing, Trump appeared to flip the accusation on its head, casting doubt on whether Europe and Canada would come to the US’s aid.</p><p>“The big fear I have with NATO is we spend tremendous amounts of money with NATO, and I know we’ll come to their rescue, but I just really do question whether or not they’ll come to ours,” Trump said. “I’m just asking. Just saying.”</p><p>Only once has Article Five ever been invoked, after the attacks in the US on September 11, 2001. The incident prompted NATO allies to deploy their first-ever “anti-terror operation”, providing aircraft to patrol US skies and ensure regional safety.</p><p>“Sometimes it’s overrated. Sometimes it’s not,” Trump said of the alliance.</p><p>The US president similarly equivocated on the subject of the UN, saying the international body “hasn’t been very helpful”.</p><p>“It has never lived up to its potential,” Trump told reporters.</p><p>When asked if his “board of peace” — designed to oversee the reconstruction of war-torn Gaza — might one day replace the UN, Trump replied in the affirmative, saying, “Well, it might.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-role-for-machado-in-venezuela\">A role for Machado in Venezuela?</h2><p>While Greenland was front of mind ahead of Trump’s arrival in Davos, the president was also forced to confront questions about another country where the US has made claims: Venezuela.</p><p>On January 3, Trump authorised a military action to abduct his longtime adversary, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who was subsequently transported to the US to face trial on drug-trafficking charges.</p><p>Legal experts have largely condemned the operation as a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty.</p><p>While Trump initially said the US would “run” Venezuela in the aftermath of the attack, he has since signalled his willingness to cooperate with interim President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former second-in-command.</p><p>Given that Maduro’s last two elections had faced widespread accusations of fraud, many political observers expected a new vote to be called in the wake of his removal. But the Trump administration has declined to set a timeline for new elections.</p><p>Previously, Trump also dismissed the prospect of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado taking power in Maduro’s absence.</p><p>“I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country,” Trump said within hours of the January 3 operation.</p><p>Still, on Tuesday, Trump appeared to shift his tone. He signalled that there could be a role for Machado in Venezuela’s leadership, following their meeting last week at the White House.</p><p>During her visit, Machado presented Trump with the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded in October. Trump has long lobbied for the prize himself.</p><p>“An unbelievably nice  woman also did a very incredible thing, as you know, a few days ago,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “We’re talking to her, and maybe we can get her involved in some way. I’d love to be able to do that.”</p><p>Trump added that the Rodriguez government had  been receptive to his administration’s demands and that he expected US oil companies to make “massive investments” in Venezuela.</p><p>“We’ve taken 50 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela in the first four days,” Trump said. “We’ve got millions of barrels of oil left. We’re selling it on the open market.”</p><p>The proceeds have gone into a US-controlled account, and on Tuesday, the Rodriguez administration said it received $300m as part of the arrangement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"addressing-tensions-in-minnesota\">Addressing tensions in Minnesota</h2><p>On the domestic front, Trump used his first-anniversary appearance to defend his controversial immigration operations in Minnesota, where nearly 2,000 federal agents have been deployed.</p><p>The large-scale immigration crackdown began in December, after Trump blamed Minnesota’s large Somali American community for a fraud scandal that rocked the midwestern state.</p><p>At the time, he deployed racist insults to disparage Somali Americans, including by calling them “garbage”.</p><p>Trump returned to that theme at Tuesday’s news conference, where he belittled the diaspora’s intelligence by saying they were “a lot of very low IQ people”.</p><p>He then framed the fraud scheme as a criminal enterprise masterminded outside the Somali American community.</p><p>“Other people work it out, and they get them money, and they go out and buy Mercedes Benzes,” Trump said.</p><p>“They have no money. They never had money. They never had a life. They never had a government. They never had a country, because there’s basically no country. Somalia’s not even a country. They don’t have anything that resembles a country, and if it is a country, it’s considered just about the worst in the world.”</p><p>Trump also used his podium to address the January 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US citizen and mother of three.</p><p>Good’s death was caught on video amid tensions in Minneapolis, Minnesota, over the presence of agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Footage appeared to show Good parked in her car when ICE agents approached her, and when she started to move her vehicle away, an officer fired three shots into her window.</p><p>Her death provoked nationwide outrage and protests, as critics questioned the use of force as excessive.</p><p>Trump, however, approached the controversy with a “both sides” argument, similar to how he framed the 2017 killing of Heather Heyer at a counterprotest denouncing white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p><p>“The woman was shot. And I felt terribly about that, and I understand both sides of it,” Trump said of Good’s shooting on Tuesday.</p><p>He then blamed “agitators” and “insurrectionists” among the anti-ICE protesters for creating a hostile environment.</p><p>“Sometimes ICE is going to be too rough with somebody,” Trump said. “They deal with rough people. They’re going to make a mistake. Sometimes it can happen.”</p><p>Still, he expressed sympathy for Good’s family, explaining that he had recently learned her father was one of his supporters.</p><p>“He was all for Trump, loved Trump, and it’s terrible. I was told that a lot of people, they said, ‘Oh, he loves you,'” Trump said.</p><p>“I hope he still feels that way.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
