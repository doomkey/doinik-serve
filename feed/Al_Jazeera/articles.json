The car is then seen hurtling out of control and crashing into other parked cars.</p><p>Multiple angles of the videos filmed by various onlookers went viral on the internet. The onlookers sound terrified, shouting, “Shame!” at the agent and asking him to stop.</p><p>In some images and videos, the woman’s bloodied body is seen slumped in the SUV in the aftermath.</p><p>According to Frey, the victim was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died of her injuries.</p><p>The incident took place during protests against the ICE immigration crackdown in south Minneapolis.</p><h2 id=\"who-was-renee-nicole-good-the-woman-named-as-the-victim\">Who was Renee Nicole Good, the woman named as the victim?</h2><p>The Minneapolis City Council, the city’s primary legislative body, identified the victim as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.</p><p>In a joint statement, Council President Elliot Payne and council members wrote: “Renee was a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbors this morning and her life was taken today at the hands of the federal government. Anyone who kills someone in our city deserves to be arrested, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p><p>The statement demanded that ICE leave Minneapolis.</p><p>Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper that Good died a few blocks away from her home. “She was probably terrified,” Ganger said.</p><p>Ganger denied that her daughter was part of the protests against ICE.</p><p>“She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”</p><p>The Star Tribune also quoted Good’s father-in-law, who said she had a six-year-old child with his son, Timmy Ray Macklin Jr. Macklin died in 2023 at the age of 36.</p><p>The newspaper reported that Good also had two other children.</p><p>She studied creative writing at Old Dominion University, a public university in Norfolk, Virginia. A brief English Department bio, which referred to her as Renee Macklin, described her as a Colorado Springs, Colorado, native who hosted a podcast with her husband, Tim Macklin, and said that when she wasn’t focused on writing, she enjoyed movie marathons and making “messy art”.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-about-the-shooting\">What has Trump said about the shooting?</h2><p>In a post on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump said: “The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.”</p><p>He added that the reason “these incidents” are happening is because “the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.”</p><p>It is unclear from the footage whether Good tried to run over the agent. The footage shows her car reverse and then move forward. When the car moves forward, an agent is seen jumping ahead. However, it is not clear whether this was because of her car or what he was trying to do.</p><h2 id=\"what-have-other-trump-administration-officials-said\">What have other Trump administration officials said?</h2><p>Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said during a news conference that “any loss of life is a tragedy” but Good “had been stalking and impeding [ICE’s] work all throughout the day”.</p><p>“She then proceeded to weaponise her vehicle,” Noem said.</p><p>The DHS runs ICE, and last summer, it launched a major recruitment drive to hire 10,000 more ICE agents on top of the existing force of about 6,000.</p><p>On X, the DHS wrote that the ICE agent fired “defensive shots” at Good after she had tried to run over the agent.</p><p>“An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots,” it posted, calling the incident “an act of domestic terrorism”.</p><p></p><p>“I want every ICE officer to know that their president, vice president, and the entire administration stands behind them,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.</p><p>“To the radicals assaulting them, doxxing them, and threatening them: congratulations, we’re going to work even harder to enforce the law.”</p><h2 id=\"how-have-local-authorities-responded\">How have local authorities responded?</h2><p>Authorities in Minnesota have disputed the Republican Trump administration’s accounts of the shooting.</p><p>Democratic Governor Tim Walz reposted the DHS X post on Wednesday, saying: “I’ve seen the video. Don’t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.”</p><p></p><p>Frey released a statement rebuking the actions of ICE.</p><p>“ICE – Get the f*** out of Minneapolis,” Frey said during a news conference on Wednesday. “We do not want you here. Your stated purpose for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, but you are doing exactly the opposite.”</p><p>“People are being hurt, families are being ripped apart, long-term Minneapolis residents who have contributed greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now, someone is dead. That’s on you. It’s also on you to leave. It’s on you to make sure that further damage, further loss of life and injury is not done.”</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-trump-administration-s-justification-for-ice-raids-in-minneapolis\">What’s the Trump administration’s justification for ICE raids in Minneapolis?</h2><p>On Tuesday, the Trump administration escalated its immigration operation in Minneapolis. In an X post, ICE announced it planned to deploy 2,000 additional agents to the northern Midwestern city.</p><p>“A 100% chance of ICE in the Twin Cities – our largest operation to date,” the post said.</p><p></p><p>The DHS launched Operation Metro Surge, which includes Minneapolis, in December. The Trump administration said the operation aims to root out criminals and undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told local news media that ICE is “surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens”.</p><p>The population of Minnesota is more than 5 million, and according to numbers from the Migration Policy Institute from 2023, the number of undocumented immigrants in the state is 100,000.</p><p>Republicans have made disparaging remarks particularly targeting the state’s Somali population.</p><p>Last month, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/trump-administration-freezes-minnesota-childcare-funds-over-fraud-claims\">froze</a> childcare payments to the state in response to allegations by conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley, who claimed daycare centres operated by Somali Americans in the city of Minneapolis had committed up to $100m in fraud.</p><h2 id=\"where-else-has-ice-led-anti-immigration-raids-under-trump\">Where else has ICE led anti-immigration raids under Trump?</h2><p>In September, ICE launched Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, Illinois, to arrest undocumented immigrants in the city. It is ongoing.</p><p>Last month, ICE launched a raid in Columbus, Ohio, which also has a large Somali population. In late November, ICE agents were deployed in New Orleans, Louisiana. Similar raids were launched in Charlotte, North Carolina that same month.</p><p>Since Trump came to office in January 2025, ICE raids have taken place in Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Miami, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, DC, among other cities.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And by 2030, they aim to reach almost 210,000.”</p><p>Russia also shifted tactics a few months ago, from large mechanised assaults that had resulted in huge losses of personnel and equipment, to infiltration tactics using several teams of two soldiers to establish bridgeheads and supply drops before reinforcements arrive.</p><p>These tactics enabled it to capture two-thirds of the hotly contested eastern town of Pokrovsk, in Donetsk, by the end of last year, and roughly half of neighbouring Myrnohrad.</p><p>Anticipating the further honing of these tactics, Ukraine has said it is improving the training of new troops.</p><p>“We clearly understand what we will have to face in the near future,” wrote Syrskii. “We have set the task of forming special units designed to effectively detect and destroy enemy high-tech drone units, control points, and the crews of the occupiers’ unmanned aerial systems.”</p><h2 id=\"the-long-range-war\">The long-range war</h2><p>On Monday, the war claimed the first two civilian deaths of the year in Ukraine.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In recent days, leaked recordings and documents have provided the rough outline of a conspiracy to launch an insurgency in the Alawite-dominated coastal region of Syria. Behind the plan are a number of high-level officials of the former regime of Bashar al-Assad living in exile. The leaks reveal the recruitment of fighters within the Alawite community, the movement and storage of weapons, and the transfer of payments to their families.</p><p>The revelations come months after an insurrection staged in the coastal region in March led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people, including civilians, government troops and Alawite fighters.</p><p>Similar violence erupted again in July in Suwayda, the Druze stronghold in southern Syria where several hundred Druze civilians were killed as government forces tried – unsuccessfully – to restore order after clashes between Sunni tribes and Druze militias.</p><p>There have also been sporadic clashes between the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and government forces despite a March 10 agreement to integrate the former into the national army.</p><p>Concerns are now growing that minority-dominated regions may be carved out, undermining the establishment of a strong Syrian state or even violating the territorial integrity of the country. Such a development, however, is not inevitable.</p><h2 id=\"the-alawite-challenge\">The Alawite challenge</h2><p>While the leaked recordings and documents show that al-Assad regime remnants have not accepted their fate and are planning a comeback in some form, they are far from being successful. Most Alawites, deeply shaken by what they view as abandonment and betrayal by the al-Assad family, seem to have resigned themselves to living under a new authority and are trying to adapt to this reality.</p><p>While a small number of die-hard figures may still harbour fantasies of a return to power, possibly through the creation of a coastal enclave, such ambitions remain politically detached from the broader Alawite community.</p><p>What shapes Alawite attitudes today are economic deprivation and physical insecurity, not aspirations for secession or restoration of the former regime.</p><p>Last month, the response to calls for protests by Ghazal Ghazal, head of the so-called Islamic Alawite Council in Syria and the Diaspora, reflected accumulated grievances rather than realistic political projects.</p><p>The dissolution of state institutions, particularly the army and security services, has plunged hundreds of thousands of families into poverty. Even pensioners have gone unpaid for more than a year.</p><p>Should violence re-emerge among Alawites, it would be driven by poverty and desperation rather than ideological or political ambition. This situation must be addressed before it erupts into a full hunger mutiny.</p><p>The absence of transitional justice further aggravates tensions. It encourages victims of the former regime to seek revenge outside legal frameworks while collective blame directed at Alawites has led to frequent revenge killings in Alawite-dominated areas.  Many Alawites now urge the government to publish a clear list of former regime officials responsible for major crimes, both to individualise accountability and to lift the burden of collective guilt imposed on their community.</p><h2 id=\"druze-and-kurdish-resistance\">Druze and Kurdish resistance</h2><p>The situation is more complicated in the southwest region of Suwayda, where the local Druze community has categorically refused to allow government forces to enter their territory. Hikmat al-Hijri, a prominent Druze spiritual leader with known ties to Israel, has been suspicious of the new government, and his position hardened after the March massacres in the coastal region of Syria. Over the summer, he was elevated to the position of the sole political authority of the Druze community.</p><p>Suwayda has become a de facto autonomous zone after the failure of government forces backed by Sunni tribal fighters to impose control in July. Al-Hijri openly appealed to Israel, whose intervention forced Damascus to retreat.</p><p>Since then, he has overseen the creation of a so-called National Guard, led by former regime officers and financed and armed by Israel, while openly advocating for independence.</p><p>In the northeast, Damascus also faces a formidable challenge. The SDF has refused to fully implement the March 10 agreement and relinquish the political and military gains it has consolidated over the past decade.</p><p>The collapse of the latest round of talks to implement the agreement, held in Damascus on Sunday, sparked tense fighting in and around Kurdish-dominated neighbourhoods of Aleppo, threatening to plunge the country into yet another civil war – this time along ethnic faultlines.</p><p>Backed by the United States and enjoying good relations with Israel, the SDF commands a force of roughly 60,000 fighters and runs an autonomous civil administration that governs roughly one-third of the country, including a significant amount of Syria’s natural resources. In effect, the SDF aspires to a status resembling that of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq.</p><h2 id=\"maintaining-unity\">Maintaining unity</h2><p>Dark predictions that Syria would slip back into a civil war have failed to materialise. However, the current situation still poses immense challenges.</p><p>Lacking decisive US backing while simultaneously fearing Israeli intervention and coordinated unrest both along the coast and in Suwayda, Damascus possesses little credible leverage to fully unify the country in the near term.</p><p>As minorities lack the capacity to challenge the new government and Damascus lacks the power to subjugate them, Syria risks sliding into a prolonged deadlock – one that may ultimately solidify into de facto partition.</p><p>Israel’s recent recognition of Somaliland as a breakaway entity has reinforced fears that it may employ similar tactics in Syria, aiming to weaken the state by promoting fragmentation along sectarian lines.</p><p>However, there are also other external powers that have vested interests in a stable and united Syria. Fearing a revival of ISIL (ISIS) and the return of Iranian influence, the US is pressuring both the SDF and the government in Damascus to implement the March 10 agreement. Turkiye is also applying pressure on the SDF to soften its position and agree to the terms of integration.

Initiating an inclusive political process, forming a unity government and convening a national dialogue conference to draft a new constitution with broad participation from Syria’s political, ethnic and sectarian components can help win more support in Syria’s troubled regions.</p><p>The initiation of a transnational justice track along with national reconciliation would also help heal the wounds of the past 14 years. Some <a href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/facing-alawite-backlash-syrias-new-leaders-take-controversial-steps-win-loyalty-2025-12-30/&amp;data=05%257C02%257Cmarwan.kabalan@dohainstitute.edu.qa%257Ca36d8273fad5489cbc0c08de4c6ca073%257Cdd2a2bdcb2b94005bbb65a5b635ada77%257C0%257C0%257C639032226649337014%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ==%257C0%257C%257C%257C&amp;sdata=vUlZcs2XwhfhMxwdGCaUIMKU0wlmJziZSxQ3DPmWOdE=&amp;reserved=0\">conciliatory gestures</a> towards minorities on the coast and in Suwayda and the northeast would also help. Yet all these measures will have little impact if they are not accompanied by the right economic policies especially designed to address dire poverty and staggering unemployment.</p><p>Taken together, these policies would certainly help Damascus abort Israel’s wicked plans for Syria and maintain unity.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It grossly violated the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, infringed on China’s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and undermined peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this, and has taken a series of necessary measures to safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p data-start=\"611\" data-end=\"965\">The Taiwan question is entirely China’s internal affair. There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. This has been clearly recognised by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 of 1971.</p><p data-start=\"967\" data-end=\"1271\">Taiwan’s restoration to China is a victorious outcome of World War II and an integral part of the post-war international order. A series of instruments with legal effect under international law, including the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, have all affirmed China’s sovereignty over Taiwan.</p><p data-start=\"1273\" data-end=\"1563\">Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, 183 countries have established diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle. The one-China principle is a universal consensus of the international community and a basic norm in international relations.</p><p data-start=\"1565\" data-end=\"2190\">The US’s massive arms sales to China’s Taiwan region grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs. The US side pledged in the August 17 communique, which China and the US jointly issued in 1982, that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution.</p><p data-start=\"2192\" data-end=\"2682\">However, the US has not been faithfully implementing the one-China principle and stipulations in the three China-US joint communiques, especially the August 17 communique, over the past 40 years. There have been more frequent open military interactions between the US and Taiwan, and the size and performance of arms sold by the US to Taiwan have kept increasing. It gravely undermines China’s sovereignty and security, while emboldening the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces.</p><p data-start=\"2684\" data-end=\"3212\">Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and must be decided by the Chinese ourselves. History and practice have repeatedly proved that the one-China principle is what underpins peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. When the one-China principle is fully recognised and earnestly followed, the Taiwan Strait would remain calm and tranquil. However, when the one-China principle is wilfully challenged or even sabotaged, there would be dark clouds or even violent storms across the Taiwan Strait.</p><p data-start=\"3214\" data-end=\"3797\">The root cause of the tensions across the Taiwan Strait is that the Taiwan authorities have kept soliciting US support for “Taiwan independence”, and some people in the US intend to use Taiwan to contain China. It is the US and Taiwan separatist forces, not China, that seek to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The US arms sales to Taiwan made provocations first. China’s response is legitimate, lawful and justified. It is a severe punishment against the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and a stern warning to external interference forces.</p><p data-start=\"3799\" data-end=\"4084\">Although the two sides across the Taiwan Strait have yet to be reunified, the fact that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China has never and will not be changed. This is the true status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</p><p data-start=\"4086\" data-end=\"4525\">To solicit US support to advance their separatist agenda, the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) authorities are turning Taiwan into a powder keg. Their massive and desperate arms purchase further reveals their true nature as provocateurs, saboteurs of peace and warmongers. External forces who try to arm Taiwan to contain China will only embolden the separatists and push the Taiwan Strait closer to the peril of armed conflict.</p><p data-start=\"4527\" data-end=\"5034\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The Taiwan question is at the core of China’s core interests, and is a red line that must not be crossed. China will take all measures necessary to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. No matter how many advanced weapons are sold to Taiwan, this will not reverse the inevitability of China’s reunification. Anyone who crosses the line or makes provocations on the question will be met with China’s firm response. All attempts to hold back China’s reunification will invariably fail.</p><p data-start=\"4527\" data-end=\"5034\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The federal government in Mogadishu, which considers Somaliland part of its territory, condemned the move as a violation of sovereignty. The Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) also issued statements rejecting the “separatist reality”.</p><p>Hassan, however, brushed off the criticism.</p><p>“We have been an independent state for 34 years,” he said. “The rejection of the Arab League does not matter to us at all. They did not accept us as a member … and we did not receive any attention from Arab countries.”</p><p>When pressed on why Somaliland would ally with Israel while it is isolated in the region, Hassan pointed to other Arab nations.</p><p>“Normalisation with Israel is not limited to Somaliland,” he argued. “Many Arab and Islamic countries have broad political and economic relations with Israel, such as Egypt, Turkiye, Jordan, and the UAE.”</p><h2><strong>The military base question</strong></h2><p>Regional powers are concerned that the new alliance could lead to an Israeli military foothold at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.</p><p>When asked repeatedly if Somaliland would allow Israel to establish a military base on its soil, Hassan refused to rule it out explicitly.</p><p>“We have started diplomatic relations… This topic [a military base] has not been touched upon now,” Hassan said.</p><p>Pressed further on whether Hargeisa would accept such a request in the future, he replied: “Ask the question when the time comes… The question is untimely.”</p><p>He insisted that the relationship is currently diplomatic and economic, aimed at securing international legitimacy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>‘Political, not religious’</strong></h2><p>The interview grew tense when the discussion turned to the war on Gaza. The anchor Ahmed Taha challenged Hassan on the morality of forging ties with a state accused of genocide, asking how he could ignore the suffering of “two million besieged Palestinians”.</p><p>Hassan sought to separate the political deal from religious solidarity, claiming that the war in Gaza had “stopped” following a US-brokered initiative in October 2025 – a reference to a recent ceasefire deal championed by United States President Donald Trump. Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect.</p><p>“We deal with Israel politically,” Hassan said. “Political dealing is not something religion forbids… Our stance on the Palestinian people is similar to the stance of Arab and Islamic countries.</p><p>“We are far from these problems,” he added. “We are looking for international recognition… That is the key.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On Christmas Day last year, Tarique Rahman – the heir apparent of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the man many believe could be the country’s next prime minister – returned home and stepped directly into a power vacuum that has been steadily widening since the collapse of the Awami League government in August 2024.</p><p>After 17 years in exile, Rahman’s act of touching the soil was carefully staged for the cameras, but its consequences are structural rather than symbolic. Bangladesh today is a state without a steady pulse, and his return has brought the country’s brief post-revolutionary interlude to an end.</p><p>Five days later, on December 30, the political moment hardened into historical finality. Khaleda Zia – the former prime minister and wife of BNP founder and former Bangladesh President Ziaur Rahman – died after a prolonged illness, severing the last living link to the party’s original leadership generation.</p><p>Rahman is no longer Khaleda Zia’s successor. He is now the leader of the BNP as it heads towards elections on February 12.</p><p>The nation Rahman left in 2008 was fractured; the one he inhabits now is structurally compromised. The hurried flight of Sheikh Hasina to India after the uprising against her ended a decade and a half of autocratic rule but left behind a hollowed-out bureaucracy and a social contract in shreds.</p><p>While Muhammad Yunus’s interim administration attempts to manage the transition, street power has already begun to bypass formal authority. In this volatility, Rahman’s presence acts as a high-voltage conductor for the BNP, providing a focal point for an opposition that was, until recently, systematically suppressed.</p><p>For millions who viewed the last decade of elections under Hasina’s authoritarian grip as foregone conclusions, Rahman represents the return of choice.</p><p>Yet Rahman is no insurgent outsider; he is the ultimate product of the system he seeks to lead. As the son of two former leaders of the country, he carries the weight of a dynastic legacy closely associated with the patronage networks that have long hobbled Bangladeshi governance. His earlier proximity to power was marked by allegations of informal authority and corruption – charges that continue to serve as political ammunition for his detractors. To supporters, he is a victim of judicial overreach; to critics, he is evidence of why Bangladesh’s democratic experiments so often collapse under the weight of elite impunity.</p><p>This duality defines the tension of his return. Rahman is now attempting a pivot, trading the rhetoric of street agitation for the measured cadence of a statesman. His recent speeches – emphasizing minority protection, national unity, and the rule of law – suggest a leader acutely aware that the youth who helped dislodge Hasina will not accept a simple change in the identity of the ruling elite.</p><p>The BNP he now leads faces a Bangladesh that is more globally integrated and less patient with opaque politics. If Rahman takes power, pressure to reform the judiciary and the Election Commission will be immediate. Without institutional credibility, any mandate he secures will have a dangerously short shelf life.</p><p>Economically, Rahman is likely to pursue pragmatic continuity. Bangladesh’s dependence on garment exports and foreign investment leaves little room for ideological experimentation. The real test will be internal discipline. The temptation to settle old scores and reward loyalists through the same rent-seeking channels used by previous regimes will be immense. History suggests this is where Bangladeshi leaders fail – and the country’s current economic fragility leaves no margin for such indulgence.</p><p>The most delicate arena, however, will be foreign policy – specifically, relations with India. For years, New Delhi found a predictable, if transactional, partner in Sheikh Hasina. The BNP, by contrast, has long been viewed by Indian security circles with suspicion and strategic unease.</p><p>Rahman now appears to be signalling a reset, moving away from nationalist antagonism towards what he describes as “balanced sovereignty”. He understands that while Bangladesh must recalibrate its relationship with India to satisfy domestic sentiment, it cannot afford hostility with its most consequential neighbour. For India, the challenge is accepting that a stable, pluralistic Bangladesh – even under a familiar rival – is preferable to a perpetually unstable one.</p><p>Ultimately, Rahman’s return is a stress test not just for Bangladesh, but for the idea of democratic choice in South Asia itself. This is not a simple dynastic succession; it is a reckoning. After years of enforced stability and managed outcomes, the reintroduction of political uncertainty is, paradoxically, a sign of democratic life.</p><p>Whether Tarique Rahman uses this opening to rebuild institutions he once bypassed – or reverts to the habits of the past – will determine more than his personal legacy. It will decide whether Bangladesh can finally break its cycle of exile and revenge, or whether it is merely preparing for the next collapse.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

At the same time, the US has handed China a new opportunity to assert its dominance in its own back yard, including on its claim to self-governing Taiwan, say analysts.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Under the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, recently revived by US President Donald Trump, the Western Hemisphere falls under the US sphere of influence – and the US only.</p><p>Trump invoked the doctrine in his latest national security strategy published late last year. Originally intended to keep Europe out of the Western Hemisphere, Trump’s version emphasises the need to counter China’s presence there.</p><p>The “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine states the US wants a Western Hemisphere that “remains free of hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets, and that supports critical supply chains” in an oblique reference to China.</p><p>ABC News and CNN on Tuesday reported that the Trump administration was demanding that Venezuela cut ties with China, Iran, Russia and Cuba before it would be allowed to resume oil production.</p><p>The White House declined to confirm or deny the reports, which cited unnamed sources.</p><p>Trump has previously taken issue with Chinese investment in the region and claimed, incorrectly, during his inauguration speech last year that China was in control of the Panama Canal.</p><p>Since US forces captured Maduro last week, Trump has also revived claims that the US should “acquire” Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, to protect US national security.</p><p>He claimed this week that the Arctic island was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/do-russia-and-china-pose-a-national-security-threat-to-the-us-in-greenland\">inundated with “Russian and Chinese ships</a>,” although there is no evidence to support his claim.</p><p>“China is likely to read this as confirmation that the US is explicitly comfortable with hemispheric spheres of influence,” said Simona Grano, head of research on China-Taiwan relations at the University of Zurich’s Institute for Asian and Oriental Studies.</p><p>China immediately condemned Maduro’s abduction by US special forces as a “clear violation of international law” and urged Washington to “stop toppling the government of Venezuela”.</p><p>But the return of these spheres “cuts both ways for Beijing,” said Grano.</p><p>“On the one hand, it underscores the vulnerability of China’s investments and partnerships in Latin America; on the other, it may reinforce Chinese perceptions that Washington would find it harder to credibly oppose similar logic in East Asia, even if the Taiwan case is far more sensitive and escalatory,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>China has pledged to annex Taiwan by peace or by force if necessary and regards Taipei’s Democratic Progressive Party, which heads the democratically elected government, as separatists.</p><p>Diplomatically isolated Taiwan is only recognised by 11 countries and the Holy See, but it has unofficial backing from the US, which has pledged to help Taipei defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances.</p><p>While Beijing regards Taiwan as an “internal” matter, Trump’s policy regarding “spheres of influence” could offer it another way to discuss Taiwan on the world stage, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and an assistant professor at National Taiwan University.</p><p>“I do think that America has created more global precedent for large powers to take action against other states beyond their jurisdiction,” Nachman told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Though China is unlikely to act militarily against Taiwan in the near future, “it will now have an easier time justifying military action if and when the day comes,” Nachman said.</p><p>Taiwan is not the only place Beijing may consider to fall under its “sphere of influence”. China claims much of the South China Sea and has ongoing territorial disputes there with Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taipei, while it also claims the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.</p><p>Disputes between China and India on its eastern border have ended in deadly clashes, including a 1962 border war and more recent skirmishes since 2020.</p><p>On Chinese social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin and Weibo, Venezuela has been a major talking point over the past week, with some netizens drawing parallels to Taiwan.</p><p>“Since the US can illegally invade Venezuela and arrest its president, the [Chinese military] can legitimately and legally exercise its national sovereignty over unification,” one Weibo user wrote in a post that received more than 1,000 comments.</p><p>The White House has characterised Maduro’s abduction as a law enforcement operation, and its air strikes on the waters around Venezuela as a defensive move to stem the flow of drugs into the US. None of Venezuela’s neighbours has interceded, although they have condemned Trump’s actions.</p><p>While critics have rejected the Trump administration’s framing of the kidnapping as a law and order move, that approach, too, appears to have prompted suggestions from some on Chinese social media on how Beijing could try to take Taiwan.</p><p>“First, issue arrest warrants for pro-independence elements, then send people to search for them,” a Weibo user said.</p><p>“During this process, there will inevitably be people who obstruct us, so we will use the military to overcome the obstruction,” another Weibo user said. “This term is good: law enforcement action, which is more applicable to our internal province of Taiwan.”</p><p>Experts agreed that the Maduro abduction in Venezuela would not immediately change China’s plans for Taiwan, which Grano described as “categorically different from Latin America in terms of escalation and alliance dynamics”.</p><p>A conflict with Taiwan could quickly draw in the US and potentially its treaty ally Japan, whose Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any attack or blockade of Taiwan would be a “survival-threatening situation for Japan,” potentially justifying the use of force. It could also dramatically affect global shipping routes through the strategically important Taiwan Strait.</p><p>Beijing has also not ruled out peaceful means of taking control of the democracy of 23 million people.</p><p>At the same time, “many [Chinese] netizens expressed shock at the United States’ unilateral handling of Maduro, with some commenting that the incident underscored a belief that only a strong country can avoid being bullied,” Jiang Jiang, chief editor of the China-focused newsletter Ginger River Review and a researcher at the Xinhua Institute think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Maduro’s arrest has shown Beijing that Trump is ready and willing to act on perceived threats, said William Yang, senior analyst for Northeast Asia at the Crisis Group.</p><p>Trump’s strike on Maduro was preceded by months of threats against the Venezuelan leader over his alleged ties to drug cartels, accompanied by US air strikes on alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The Trump administration has not released any evidence showing that the more than 100 people killed in these boat strikes were drug traffickers, or that the vessels were headed to the US.</p><p>“It’s a warning towards Beijing that the US will be willing to resort to the military option when trying to accomplish the goal of removing certain political forces in Latin America,” Yang told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Qinduo Xu, a Chinese political analyst who hosts a current affairs programme on the state-run CGTN television channel, agreed.</p><p>“It’s a reminder for China that the US is a different power – naked raw power – and they just throw out any kind of rules, international rules, or as long as they see the rules as in their way,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Maduro’s ousting will likely reinforce Beijing’s preference for a model of engagement in Latin America where it does not assume any responsibility for the survival of its partnering governments and leaders, according to experts like Grano.</p><p>For the past 20 years, Venezuela has been one of Beijing’s closest partners in the region. China was the top destination for Venezuelan oil after the US imposed sanctions in 2019, and China has invested $4.8bn in Venezuela over that period, according to the Rhodium Group.</p><p>Beijing has also loaned the country tens of millions of dollars, of which JP Morgan estimates Venezuela still owes between $13bn and $15bn, according to a recent Reuters report.</p><p>The two sides signed an “all-weather strategic partnership” in 2023 – a diplomatic designation only granted by Beijing to five other countries. The partnership, however, does not include security guarantees, which means China will suffer little reputational damage in the long term as a trusted diplomatic partner for failing to come to Venezuela’s defence militarily, experts said.</p><p>Gabriel Wildau, the managing director of risk analysis company Teneo, told Al Jazeera he expected Chinese officials to remain pragmatic even as the US tries to assert its political sway over its “sphere of influence”.</p><p>“Ultimately … Beijing is likely to keep the bigger picture in mind. China’s leadership does not view relations with Venezuela as a core interest, and maintaining the current US-China detente is likely a higher priority,” he said. Trump is due to visit China in April amid negotiations aimed at resolving an ongoing trade war between the two superpowers that last year threatened to disrupt global commerce with spiralling tit-for-tat tariffs.</p><p>“Trump’s raid on Venezuela suggests that Chinese investments in Latin America now face greater political risks from US meddling in the region,” Gildau said. “Still, Beijing will likely respond by seeking ways to mitigate those risks rather than turning away from the region.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But he blamed Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/israel-bombs-southern-lebanon-saying-it-targeted-hezbollah-and-hamas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">continued military actions</a> and occupation of Lebanese territory along the border as complicating and undermining these efforts.</p><p>On January 8, Haykal will brief Lebanon’s government on the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/first-phase-of-hezbollahs-disarmament-close-to-complete-lebanons-salam\">progress</a> of the disarming mission. He’s expected to announce the completion of the plan’s first phase, which involves clearing the area between the Litani River, about 30km (19 miles) at its deepest point in Lebanon, and the country’s southern border with Israel.</p><p>But Israel already has a verdict on the army’s performance.</p><p>It says Hezbollah still has a presence close to the border and is rebuilding its military capabilities “faster than the army is dismantling [them]”. The United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon has a different take. It says there is “no evidence” that Hezbollah’s infrastructure has been rebuilt.</p><p>Israel also sent another message through its military actions days before the cabinet meeting.</p><p>It carried out intense air strikes on what it said were positions north of the Litani River some kilometres (miles) from the border in what a western diplomat said showed “Israel has no intention to wait for the army to move to the next phase to dismantle Hezbollah’s weapons.”</p><h2 id=\"litani-river\">Litani River</h2><p>“Israel has already shifted focus to phase two,” Joe Macaron, a political analyst, told Al Jazeera. “And this phase is going to be different, difficult and challenging for the army.”</p><p>The second phase involves operations expanding north of the Litani River up to the Awali River north of the city of Sidon. “Hezbollah has made it clear there will be no disarmament north of the Litani, which means there is the possibility of political tension,” Macaron added.</p><p>Hezbollah, which has dismissed efforts to disarm it as a United States-Israeli plan, believes it has complied with a ceasefire agreement agreed with Israel because it understands the truce to apply “exclusively south of the Litani River”.</p><p>The November 2024 truce ended more than a year of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The group’s critics in Lebanon say the ceasefire calls for the implementation of UN Resolution 1701, which mentions the disarmament of all non-state actors across Lebanon.</p><p>“With the Israeli enemy not implementing any of the steps of the agreement … Lebanon is no longer required to take any action on any level before the Israelis commit to what they are obligated to do,” Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Naim Qassem said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"political-consensus\">Political consensus</h2><p>Hezbollah was long considered the strongest military force in Lebanon, although it has been weakened by the war with Israel, when much of its leadership was killed.</p><p>The group retains the support of Lebanon’s Shia community, which it emerged from.</p><p>“Assuming the Lebanese state and the army commander would try to disarm Hezbollah north of the Litani, Hezbollah and also the majority of the Shia community is going to rise and try to prevent this. They will act and there will be a violent reaction if that scenario will happen,” Ali Rizk, a political and security analyst, told Al Jazeera. “The community feels they are facing a twin threat … one from Israel and the other from the <a href=\"/features/2025/3/24/lebanon-syria-border-clashes-reflect-new-realities-on-the-ground\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new regime in Syria</a>, so that is why they are more supportive of Hezbollah’s weapons.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Lebanese Army commander Hakyal reportedly told a recent military meeting that the army is carefully planning for the next phases of disarmament. Officials know that without political consensus, there is a risk of internal conflict.</p><p>But Lebanon’s leadership, which pledged to reassert full state sovereignty, is under pressure. Israel has publicly said it will act “as necessary” if Lebanon fails to take steps against Hezbollah.</p><p>“The state is ready to move on to the second phase – namely [confiscating weapons] north of the Litani River – based on the plan prepared by the Lebanese army pursuant to a mandate from the government,” Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said.</p><p>And then there is Iran.</p><p>Coinciding with Lebanon’s government meeting, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will arrive in Beirut.</p><p>“There is no doubt there is a link between his visit and the army submitting its report before moving to phase 2,” Rizk explained. “Hezbollah is by far Iran’s number one ideological and strategic ally, and it will stop at nothing to prevent Hezbollah’s complete elimination by getting rid of its weapons.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
