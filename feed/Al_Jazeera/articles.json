Though now safe from immediate danger, many refugees struggle to survive as humanitarian funding continues to decrease.</p><p>Chad currently shelters almost 1.3 million forcibly displaced persons, including at least 760,000 Sudanese refugees who have arrived since April 2023. This massive influx, mostly women and children, strains a country already battling economic weakness, conflict and extreme weather events.</p><p>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) collaborates with Chad’s government to coordinate humanitarian operations, transfer refugees from border areas to established facilities, and provide essential protection services and aid, including water, shelter, food and medical provisions. Work continues to move more than 237,000 refugees from temporary settlements near Adre to locations with better healthcare and educational access.</p><p>The malnutrition ward at the Farchana Hospital is currently treating at least 80 infants and children who need urgent care. These young patients receive continuous monitoring and specialised nutritional therapy throughout their recovery. However, funding for this vital programme will expire by late 2025, putting countless vulnerable children at risk.</p><p>“We need a lot of support to provide enough medicine for both refugees and the host community. The number of people here is overwhelming, and seasonal diseases and outbreaks make the situation even more difficult,” said Mohamed Ibrahim, a pharmacist from Al Jazeera state in central Sudan, who fled the war with his wife and children and now works at the Farchana Hospital. With resources severely limited, he becomes increasingly concerned about his fellow refugees’ health.</p><p>Water demand in the Farchana refugee settlement has risen dramatically. The dry conditions and ongoing arrival of new refugees from Sudan have worsened these shortages, with at least 41,000 new refugees arriving in 2025 alone.</p><p><em><strong>This photo essay was provided by <a href=\"https://media.unhcr.org/?\">UNHCR</a></strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

I don’t see any good reasons why our generation should have to go to war,” she told the AFP news agency.</p><p>Protest organiser Ronja Ruh said an “unbelievable amount of money is being spent on the military and armament” in Germany, while funds are lacking in basic public services.</p><p>“When we look at schools in particular, there is outdated technology, far too few teachers, dilapidated school buildings,” she said.</p><p>The military service bill sets ambitious expansion goals for the Bundeswehr, as Germany’s armed forces are known, with a target of up to 260,000 active soldiers – up from 183,000 currently – and 200,000 reservists by 2035.</p><p>It introduces a dual-track system to boost recruits: a more lucrative voluntary service intended to attract young recruits, but if enlistment falls short, lawmakers can now activate needs-based conscription.</p><p>To do so, the politicians would be required to hold a Bundestag vote. If more people are eligible for conscription than needed, recruits may be randomly selected.</p><p>All men born after January 1, 2008, will undergo medical evaluation, in a move not seen since Germany suspended conscription in 2011.

Only one captive’s body remains in Gaza, and retrieval has been hampered by the widespread destruction of the enclave under Israeli bombardment.</p><p>The ministers said they appreciated <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\">Trump’s peace efforts</a>, which foresee the formation of a technocratic Palestinian government supported by a multinational stabilisation force under the supervision of an international “board of peace”, insisting that his plan move forward “without delay or obstruction”.</p><p>They urged that conditions be established allowing the Palestinian Authority to “resume its responsibilities in Gaza”, calling for “sustainable peace” that would enable the two-state solution to be rolled out, with “an independent Palestinian state on the June 4, 1967 borders, including Gaza and the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital”.</p><p>Gaza featured prominently at the <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/6/doha-forum-2025-live-gaza-ukraine-wars-in-focus-as-policy-leaders-gather\">Doha Forum</a> on Saturday, an annual diplomatic conference in Qatar, with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani saying that the two-month ceasefire was at a “critical moment”.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We cannot consider it yet a ceasefire. A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of the Israeli forces, (and) there is stability back in Gaza,” he said.</p><p>Also speaking at the conference, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said that negotiations over the Gaza international stabilisation force (ISF) remained ongoing, including its mandate and rules of engagement, and that its main objective should be to separate Israelis and Palestinians along the border.</p><p>Arab and other Muslim countries, which had expressed interest in providing troops for an ISF, had insisted the US include more defined language about Palestinian self-determination in the plan before a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/unsc-approves-us-resolution-mandating-intl-stabilisation-force-in-gaza\">United Nations Security Council vote</a> last month. Israeli attempts to stymie the move failed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Attacks continue despite ceasefire</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, Israel kept up intense attacks on Gaza overnight into Saturday morning, killing three people in a drone strike in the northern town of Beit Lahiya, where it was carrying out a demolition operation.</p><p>Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the victims were part of a group of family members who had been travelling to inspect their farm in the northern part of the Strip.</p><p>Mahmoud said that Israeli sources had claimed the family had breached the so-called yellow line designating the area to which Israeli troops have withdrawn under the truce, but that members had not been aware they were in a “dangerous and restricted” zone.</p><p>In other attacks, Israel pummelled Gaza with at least 20 air strikes across the enclave, including eastern Gaza city, the centrally located Maghazi refugee camp and the southern city of Rafah.</p><p class=\"p1\">There were also reports of artillery shelling and heavy fire from tanks and aircraft in areas where the Israeli military is currently stationed east of Khan Younis and Rafah.</p><p class=\"p1\">Israeli gunboats attacked Palestinian fishing boats off the coast of Khan Younis, amid heavy gunfire and shelling.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Israeli army continues to control the southern and eastern belts of the Strip, along with large parts of northern Gaza, spanning more than 50 percent of the enclave’s total area.</p><p>Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 70,125 Palestinians and wounded 171,015 since October 2023.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, he and his allies filed a <a href=\"/news/2022/11/22/brazils-bolsonaro-seeks-to-challenge-election-loss\">legal challenge</a> against the vote, arguing there was evidence of “serious failures” and “malfunctions” in the voting machines.</p><p>It was a theory Jair Bolsonaro had publicly advanced even before the first vote was cast, while he was on the campaign trail. Critics have pointed out that there is no evidence to support his claims.</p><p>The legal challenge <a href=\"/news/2022/11/24/brazilian-judge-rejects-attempt-to-overturn-lula-election-victory\">was ultimately tossed</a> for being “in total bad faith”.</p><p>But Jair Bolsonaro’s supporters continued to rally against his defeat. In the months that followed, they attacked <a href=\"/news/2022/12/13/bolsonaro-supporters-attack-police-headquarters-in-brazil\">federal police headquarters</a> in the capital, Brasilia, and after Lula’s inauguration on January 8, 2023, they stormed government buildings in the city’s Three Powers Plaza.</p><p>Some of the protesters sought to provoke a military response that would overthrow Lula’s nascent government.</p><p>The riot at the Three Powers Plaza ultimately spurred federal investigations, raids and arrests.</p><p>Following his electoral defeat, Jair Bolsonaro also found himself mired in probes and legal complaints, which ranged from fraud allegations related to his COVID-19 records to accusations of embezzlement.</p><p>In June 2023, Brazil’s Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE) <a href=\"/news/2023/6/30/brazil-court-votes-to-bar-bolsonaro-from-office-until-2030\">voted to bar</a> Jair Bolsonaro from public office for eight years, calling his use of public resources to spread election falsehoods an “abuse of power”.</p><p>And just last month, Jair Bolsonaro <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/brazils-supreme-court-orders-jair-bolsonaro-to-begin-prison-sentence\">was taken into custody</a> to serve a 27-year prison sentence, after he was convicted in September of plotting to stage a coup.</p><p>Jair Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing and described his prosecution as a politically motivated hit job, designed to dent his popularity.</p><h2 id=\"politics-a-family-affair\">Politics, a family affair</h2><p>His sons, meanwhile, have transformed into public advocates for their father, petitioning for his release.</p><p>Earlier this year, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a member of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies, travelled to the United States to lobby President Donald Trump for help with his father’s case. Trump has since spoken out against Jair Bolsonaro’s prosecution and imposed tariffs on Brazil’s economy.</p><p>In mid-November, a panel on Brazil’s Supreme Court voted to put Eduardo Bolsonaro on trial to weigh whether his actions amounted to obstruction of justice, as an attempt to sway the outcome of his father’s trial.</p><p>Jair Bolsonaro’s family and allies have also pushed Congress to pass <a href=\"/news/2025/9/21/brazilians-protest-bill-that-could-grant-ex-president-bolsonaro-amnesty\">an amnesty bill</a> that would allow the ex-president to walk free.</p><p>In the lead-up to Friday’s endorsement, there was speculation that former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro might be an option to represent the PL in next year’s election. Sao Paulo’s governor, Tarcisio Gomes de Freitas, was also floated as a possibility.</p><p>But the selection of Flavio Bolsonaro, 44, is seen as an appeal to the ex-president’s far-right base.</p><p>That choice could end up alienating centrists in Brazil’s conservative arenas. Flavio has served in the Senate since 2019 and previously was a state deputy for Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Currently, the biggest contender in the upcoming race is Lula himself.</p><p>In late October, the left-wing president announced he would seek <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/brazils-president-lula-announces-he-will-seek-a-fourth-term-in-2026\">a fourth term</a>. Now 80 years old, he has reassured his supporters that he feels as energetic as ever.</p><p>Brazilian law allows for only two consecutive terms at a time, but more are possible if they are not back-to-back. Lula first served as president from 2003 to 2011, before mounting his latest successful bid in 2022.</p><p>Polls currently show Lula in the lead for next year’s race, though much could change. After all, the vote is more than nine months away.</p><p>A survey conducted in late November by the National Confederation of Transport and the research firm MDA Institute attempted to measure the odds of various match-ups Lula could face in October.</p><p>Lula came out on top each time. When pitted against the imprisoned Jair Bolsonaro, he earned nearly 39 percent support to the right-wing leader’s 27 percent. When compared to Michelle Bolsonaro, Lula had even higher support: 42 percent to her 23 percent. Flavio Bolsonaro was not among the options surveyed.</p><p>Lula would be 85 years old if he were to win and complete a fourth term.</p></div></div></body></html>"

US citizens.</p><p>Lower courts have ruled the order to be a violation of the 14th Amendment, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction

case.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration has also argued that the 14th Amendment, passed in the wake of the Civil War, addresses the rights of former slaves and not the

Some denounced the Disney Hall as looking like a collection of cardboard boxes that had been left out in the rain.</p><p>Still other critics included Dwight D Eisenhower’s family, who objected to Gehry’s bold proposal for a memorial to honour the nation’s 34th president.</p><p>Although the family said it wanted a simple memorial and not the one Gehry had proposed, with its multiple statues and billowing metal tapestries depicting Eisenhower’s life, the architect declined to change his design significantly.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4153764\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4153764\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4153764\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP22260629577634-1764970107.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C478&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Dancing House in Prague\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4153764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Architect Frank Gehry designed what’s known as the Dancing House — or the Fred and Ginger Building — in Prague, Czech Republic [File: Petr David Josek/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>If the words of his critics annoyed Gehry, he rarely let on. Indeed, he even sometimes played along. He appeared as himself in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons cartoon show, in which he agreed to design a concert hall that was later converted into a prison.</p><p>In that episode, he came up with the idea for the design, which looked a lot like the Disney Hall, after crumpling Marge Simpson’s letter to him and throwing it on the ground. After taking a look at it, he declared, “Frank Gehry, you’re a genius!”</p><p>“Some people think I actually do that,” he would later tell The Associated Press news agency.</p><p>Ephraim Owen Goldberg was born in Toronto on February 28, 1929, and moved to Los Angeles with his family in 1947, eventually becoming a US citizen. As an adult, he changed his name at the suggestion of his first wife, who told him anti-Semitism might be holding back his career.</p><p>Although he had enjoyed drawing and building model cities as a child, Gehry said it wasn’t until he was 20 that he pondered the possibility of pursuing a career in architecture, after a college ceramics teacher recognised his talent.</p><p>“It was like the first thing in my life that I’d done well in,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4153761\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4153761\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4153761\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25339738174095-1764970092.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Guggenheim museum in Spain\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4153761\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, has come to exemplify Gehry’s style [File: Alvaro Barrientos/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>He went on to earn a degree in architecture from the University of Southern California in 1954.
