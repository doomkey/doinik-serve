            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The administration of President Donald Trump has proposed a suite of new rules that seek to bar hospitals across the United States from performing gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth below 18 years of age.</p><p>On Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that one of the proposed rules would block hospitals and clinics from accessing its programmes if they chose to continue providing gender-affirming care.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>A second rule would prohibit federal Medicaid funds from going to gender-affirming procedures.</p><p>Both Medicare and Medicaid are forms of government-provided health insurance, offered to vulnerable groups. Medicaid primarily serves low-income households, while Medicare offers coverage to older Americans and people with disabilities.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hhs-acts-bar-hospitals-performing-sex-rejecting-procedures-children\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, the Trump administration noted that the vast majority of healthcare providers work with Medicare and Medicaid to provide health coverage for their patients. The proposed rule would therefore amount to a de facto ban on gender-affirming care.</p><p>“Nearly all US hospitals participate in Medicare and Medicaid,” the CMS statement reads.</p><p>“This action is designed to ensure that the US government will not be in business with organizations that intentionally or unintentionally inflict permanent harm on children.”</p><p>In addition to the two proposed rules, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr signed a declaration on Thursday rejecting gender-affirming care as detrimental to youth.</p><p>Under his orders, the Food and Drug Administration also issued notices to 12 manufacturers of chest binders — which flatten the upper torso, where breasts are — warning that marketing to transgender youth would be considered illegal under the current administration.</p><h2 id=\"diverging-from-medical-consensus\">Diverging from medical consensus</h2><p>The string of pronouncements marked the Trump administration’s latest broadside against transgender healthcare, despite repeated warnings from top medical associations that prohibiting such treatment could have devastating, lifelong consequences.</p><p>But in a news conference on Thursday, Kennedy, who has no formal medical training, lashed out against some of the country’s leading medical groups, accusing them of violating their professional duties.</p><p>“The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics peddled the lie that chemical and surgical sex-rejecting procedures could be good for children who suffer from gender dysphoria,” Kennedy said.</p><p>“They betrayed their Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. So-called gender-affirming care has inflicted lasting physical and psychological damage on vulnerable young people. This is not medicine. It is malpractice.”</p><p>CMS Director Mehmet Oz likewise accused healthcare practitioners of abusing patients’ trust by prescribing gender-affirming treatments. He suggested the motivation was not the patients’ health but rather profit.</p><p>“ The doctor can’t look them in the eyes and treat them like a child that’s confused and lost and needs help. They become an opportunity. They become eventually a victim,” Oz said.</p><p>“ Reasonable evidence-based objections that a child’s confusion might resolve over time have been ignored, even though it makes common sense.”</p><p>The Trump administration has taken a hardline against the transgender community, denying such an identity even exists.</p><p>Instead, upon taking office on January 20, Trump issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> announcing that the federal government would recognise only the concept of biological sex, not gender identity, and that people would be categorised as either male or female, according to their birth certificates.</p><p>The executive order also rejected transgender identity as a “false” concept.</p><h2 id=\"problem-that-does-not-actually-exist\">‘Problem that does not actually exist’</h2><p>Eight days later, on January 28, Trump followed that executive order with a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second one</a> that called on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to end practices it described as “the chemical and surgical mutilation of children”.</p><p>That order was cited as the basis for Thursday’s proposed rule and declarations to limit gender-affirming care.</p><p>But there is a wide consensus in the healthcare community that gender-affirming care can improve the health of transgender youth, including by lowering incidents of suicide, anxiety, self-harm and depression.</p><p>Gender-affirming care can take a range of forms, from surgery to puberty blockers, a treatment considered safe and reversible for children seeking to delay the onset of puberty.</p><p>Such treatments are recommended only after in-depth consultation with a trusted healthcare professional, and surgery is incredibly rare among transgender youth.</p><p>One 2024 study from Harvard University found that, for every 100,000 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 17, an average of 2.1 teenagers sought gender-affirming surgery, according to medical insurance claims from 2019.</p><p>That average dropped to 0.1 for teens between 13 and 14 years of age, and no cases were reported under the age of 12.</p><p>One of the study’s authors, Dannie Dai, said in a news release that the results suggested that “legislation blocking gender-affirming care among TGD [transgender and gender-diverse] youth is not about protecting children, but is rooted in bias and stigma”.</p><p>Dai added that such government actions seek “to address a perceived problem that does not actually exist”.</p><p>Shortly after Thursday’s announcements, groups like the Human Rights Campaign called on the public to voice their concern about the Trump administration’s proposed new rules.</p><p>“These rules now face a 60-day ‘comment period,’ where YOU can weigh in,” the Human Rights Campaign wrote on its social media.</p><p>“A large number of comments can slow it down, force changes, or lay the groundwork for future litigation. YOUR comments are where that starts.”</p><h2 id=\"congressional-actions-under-way\">Congressional actions under way</h2><p>Already, 27 states prohibit gender-affirming care for minors, including major population centres like Texas, Ohio and Florida.</p><p>As a result, the Human Rights Campaign estimates that, out of the 300,000 transgender youth in the US, nearly 40 percent live in a state where they cannot access the healthcare they may need.</p><p>Those state actions have been supported by actions on the federal level. In June, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority voted in a six-to-three decision to uphold Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors.</p><p>Just this week, on Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/2001325085848719846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bill</a> that would criminalise providing gender-affirming care for patients aged below 18. A total of 216 representatives, including several Democrats, voted in favour of sending the bill to the Senate, where it faces uncertain odds.</p><p>Another House bill, designed to cut off Medicaid benefits for transgender youth seeking gender-affirming care, is slated to be voted upon on Thursday.</p><p>While proponents fear youths may make healthcare decisions they come to regret later in life, advocates emphasise that some gender-affirming treatments, including puberty blockers, are reversible and that they can protect teenagers from physical and emotional harm.</p><p>Standing on the steps of Congress, Representative Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of the House, said she believes there is a gap in the public’s understanding of gender-affirming treatments.</p><p>“I get that it’s hard to understand this care and understand the need for it,” McBride told reporters. “But one of the things that gets so lost in this conversation is that the transgender adults of today were kids once. I was a kid once.”</p><p>“My biggest regret in life,” she continued, “is that I never had a childhood without that pain.”</p><p>McBride voted against the legislation and denounced the “hate” she felt motivated it. “Politicians should never insert themselves into the personal health care decisions of patients, parents, and their providers — and that includes trans Americans,” she later <a href=\"https://x.com/Rep_McBride/status/2001427693070430595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Kennedy, meanwhile, told reporters that he anticipates lawsuits will challenge the Trump administration’s proposed changes.</p><p>“I think that’s going to happen. The number of lawsuits with my name on it right now is almost beyond counting,” he said.</p><p>He added that the Trump administration was confident it would win any lawsuits. “It’s a disgrace to the medical establishment that they let this go on for so long.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

A ceasefire was agreed on November 27, 2024, but since then, Israel has killed more than 300 people, including at least 127 civilians, according to the United Nations. The talks come as Israel continues to attack Lebanon on a <a href=\"/tag/israel-lebanon/\">near-daily basis</a> and threatens to <a href=\"/features/2025/11/27/beirut-attacks-leaves-lebanon-worried-and-waiting-for-another-israeli-war\">expand</a> its war on the country.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about the talks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-is-meeting\">Who is meeting?</h2><p>A special committee of representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon, and the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, which is based in Naqoura.</p><p>The committee is chaired by a US general and was originally composed of military officials. But due to Israeli pressure, Lebanon’s President Joseph Aoun appointed Simon Karam, a Lebanese diplomat, to participate earlier this month.</p><p>Israel reportedly wants the inclusion of civilians to discuss nonmilitary issues, such as plans for potential economic cooperation.</p><p>Israel also appointed a civilian representative from its National Security Council, Uri Resnick, and the meeting was also attended by US Special Representative for Lebanon Morgan Ortagus.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-goal\">What is the goal?</h2><p>The committee’s plan of action is to monitor the ceasefire agreed last year.</p><p>The terms of the ceasefire were left relatively undefined, but it was widely assumed that attacks from both sides would cease, the Lebanese army would disarm Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and that Israel would withdraw its troops from its northern neighbour.</p><p>Officials say Lebanon has largely met its side of the bargain. Speaking at a conference in Beirut on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Mitri said the army’s task of disarming Hezbollah below the Litani River, which runs across southern Lebanon, was nearly completed, apart from the places where Israel still occupies Lebanese land.</p><p>However, Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/2/9/heres-how-israel-is-repeatedly-violating-the-lebanon-ceasefire\">violated</a> the ceasefire repeatedly and continues to occupy five locations in southern Lebanon.</p><p>“The main task of the mechanism is to oversee and verify and do everything possible to respect the agreement,” Mitri said.</p><p>Lebanon has been “strictly observing” the ceasefire agreement since day one, but that is not the case for Israel, he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-outcome-of-the-last-meeting\">What was the outcome of the last meeting?</h2><p>The members of the so-called mechanism met in Naqoura, south Lebanon, on December 3. The meeting was reportedly positive.</p><p>The inclusion of civilians “reflects the Mechanism’s commitment to facilitating political and military discussions with the aim of achieving security, stability, and a durable peace for all communities affected by the conflict”, the US embassy said in a statement about the meeting</p><p>The office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement that emphasised potential future economic agreement between his country and Lebanon. However, analysts believe that is a far-fetched proposition considering Israel is still occupying territory in southern Lebanon, and more than 88,000 Lebanese are still displaced from their homes in the region.</p><p>Despite the alleged positivity of the meeting, Israel <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/4/another-devastating-israeli-strike-on-lebanon-captured-on-video\">attacked</a> Lebanon the very next day.</p><h2 id=\"is-normalisation-on-the-agenda\">Is normalisation on the agenda?</h2><p>From the Lebanese side, no. Normalising relations with Israel after a war that killed thousands, including many civilians, would anger a large segment of the population.</p><p>But there has been US and Israeli pressure to find a peace agreement and to move towards normalisation.</p><p>The mechanism meeting is also a place for other bilateral discussions between Israel and Lebanon, which do not have direct relations.</p><p>On the Lebanese side, border delineation is a priority. On the Israeli side, a <a href=\"/features/2025/9/1/will-us-backed-economic-zone-incentivise-lebanon-to-disarm-hezbollah\">US-backed economic zone</a> is high on the agenda.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-if-israel-is-unhappy-with-the-talks-will-it-launch-a-war\">So if Israel is unhappy with the talks, will it launch a war?</h2><p>That is still unclear.</p><p>Israel has claimed Hezbollah is rearming, though analysts say the group is not an <a href=\"/features/2025/9/28/after-war-with-israel-how-is-lebanons-hezbollah-regrouping\">existential threat</a> to Israel. The group, long the political and military hegemon in Lebanon, was badly weakened during last year’s war with Israel. Much of its senior military leadership was assassinated, including its longtime leader <a href=\"/news/2024/9/28/hassan-nasrallah-hezbollah-leader-killed-in-beirut-in-israeli-strike\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>With Hezbollah weakened, some analysts believe Israel’s decision will be based on internal Israeli politics and dependent on international pressure on Israel.</p><p>Officials from the US, Saudi Arabia, and France met the head of the Lebanese army in Paris on Thursday in an effort to coordinate positions and possibly avoid an Israeli intensification in Lebanon. They also agreed to document the Lebanese military’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah, according to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-hezbollah-in-all-of-this\">Where is Hezbollah in all of this?</h2><p>Publicly, it has refused the Lebanese government’s plans for full disarmament.</p><p>The group says Israel’s behaviour – continuing to attack and occupy Lebanese territory – justifies its position.</p><p>But how it will respond should the ceasefire move forward is yet to be seen. In the proposed second phase, the Lebanese army would start to dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure between the Litani and Awali Rivers – the area between Sidon in the south, and Beirut, roughly in the middle of Lebanon.</p><p>Hezbollah has been militarily and politically weakened since last year’s war. But while analysts and diplomats have told Al Jazeera that they do not believe the group is strong enough to pose a threat to Israel, it could still cause problems domestically if it feels that it is being cornered.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Even during World War II, German state assets were not seized, analysts note.</p><p>Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever told parliament on Thursday that he remained deeply concerned about the legal and financial risks, having previously opposed the measures over fears Belgium could be forced to compensate Russia if courts later rule the use of the frozen assets is unlawful.</p><p>Belgium is demanding binding commitments from other EU states to cover all potential liabilities, and wants assurances that Russian assets held outside Belgium would also be used.</p><p>The majority of frozen Russian assets in Europe – about $185bn – are held by Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial services company.</p><p>Some countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have said they are prepared to back up the loan, while others, such as Italy and Bulgaria, remain hesitant.</p><p>Although the plan requires only a qualified majority rather than unanimity, EU officials are keen to secure Belgium’s support. A Belgian vote against the proposal would be politically damaging, given Brussels’s role as the EU’s institutional centre.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"risk-of-antagonising-russia\">Risk of antagonising Russia</h2><p>Russia’s central bank said on Thursday it would sue European banks in Russian courts over any attempt to use frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine.</p><p>Chris Weafer, chief executive of the consultancy Macro-Advisory, told Al Jazeera that Moscow would likely see such a move as the start of a financial war with the EU.</p><p>“Moscow is now drawing a line on this issue,” Weafer said, adding that Russia would likely “retaliate based on what Europe does”.</p><p>Russia’s central bank has already launched legal proceedings against Euroclear, which holds most of the frozen assets, as well as against institutions in France, Austria and the United Kingdom, Weafer said.</p><p>He added that the EU was unlikely to proceed without Belgium’s backing and that many EU states were increasingly reluctant or financially unable to continue funding Ukraine directly.</p><p>“So the EU is desperately looking for an alternative source of money,” Weafer said.</p><h2 id=\"attacks-continue-along-the-front-line\">Attacks continue along the front line</h2><p>Inside Ukraine, Russian forces carried out attacks across multiple regions, injuring dozens of people, including in Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhia, Cherkasy and Odesa regions.</p><p>In Russia, three people – including two crew members of a cargo vessel – were killed in Ukrainian drone attacks on the port of Rostov-on-Don and the nearby town of Bataysk, according to the regional governor.</p><p>Russia shelled Ukraine’s Donetsk region 18 times, killing three residents, Governor Vadym Filashkin said.</p><p>Ukraine’s acting Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said Russian attacks overnight cut electricity supplies in five regions, affecting about 180,000 people.</p><p>Ukrainian shelling in Russian-occupied Kherson killed a 72-year-old woman and injured six others, according to regional Governor Volodymyr Saldo.</p><p>Heavy ground and air fighting continues across eastern Ukraine, including around Kupiansk, Lyman and Sloviansk.</p><p>Ukraine said it shot down 330 drones during what it described as major Russian air attacks, while Russia said its air defences intercepted 47 Ukrainian drones overnight.</p></div></div></body></html>"
