While announcing their government … RSF forces and their allies were besieging entire state capitals and starving innocent civilians,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Why Tasis wants to be a state authority</h3><p>Tasis announced its government just three days before a new round of Sudan peace talks is set to begin on July 29 in the United States.</p><p>The talks will bring together representatives from the Sudan Quartet – Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the US. Neither SAF nor the RSF will be included in this round, according to Africa Intelligence.</p><p>Regardless, the RSF has long been wary of being dismissed as a mere “armed group” in ceasefire negotiations and left out of the circles of power and influence in a post-war Sudan due to a lack of international legitimacy.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>By forming its own government, the Tasis Alliance aims to garner recognition from some friendly states and boost its bargaining position in future negotiations, said Kholood Khair, an expert on Sudan and the founder of the Confluence Advisory think-tank.</p><p>“What’s interesting is that there has been so little disclosed about these new talks, yet it has started a fury across Sudan and catalysed the formation of these two governments,” Khair told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She added that the army adopted a similar ploy in May when it appointed Kamel Idris as prime minister in Port Sudan, a strategic city on the Red Sea Coast.</p><p>Idris recently appointed five new ministers to round out his new government, just a day after Tasis announced its parallel administration.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3859711\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3859711\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3859711\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ap_6885f62a5da99-1753609770.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sudanese army officers inspect a recently discovered weapons storage site belonging to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Khartoum, Sudan, Saturday, May 3, 2025.

The two were supposed to step down from power in 2021, yet they orchestrated a coup to dismiss the then-civilian cabinet and dash hopes for democracy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3><strong>Cementing the rift </strong></h3><p>Since SAF recaptured the capital Khartoum from the RSF in March, the former has been in control of the east and centre of the country, while the RSF has attempted to consolidate its control over the western and southern regions.</p><p>The Tasis government may have ended up cementing that division more than helping it gain an advantage at the negotiating table, said Alan Boswell, an expert on Sudan with International Crisis Group.</p><p>“The RSF aims to be legitimate as a national actor,” he said. “Yet [this government] makes de facto partition all the more likely, even if that is not the strategic intent.”</p><p>Khair added that the creation of a second government further incentivises armed groups to accumulate power in hopes of scoring a post in one of the two administrations.</p><p>“This [new government] really catalyses the proliferation of different armed groups,” she said. “More armed groups will mobilise … to win a position [in one of the two governments] during wartime.”</p><p>“This is a reality that really entrenches war dynamics.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In Kenya, as in many countries across the world, street protests are often framed as the unfortunate result of political failure. As the logic goes, the inability of state institutions to translate popular sentiment into political, legislative and regulatory action to address grievances undermines trust and leaves the streets vulnerable to eruptions of popular discontent.</p><p>In this telling, protests are viewed as a political problem with grievances expected to be legitimately addressed using the mechanisms – coercive or consensual – of the formal political system.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the increasingly paranoid regime of Kenyan President William Ruto has also adopted this view. While generally acknowledging the constitutional right of protest, it has sought to paint the largely peaceful and sustained Generation Z demonstrations and agitation of the past 16 months, which have questioned its rule and policies, as a threat to public order and safety and to delegitimise the street as an avenue for addressing public issues.</p><p>“What is going on in these streets, people think is fashionable,” <a href=\"https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-responds-to-ruto-must-go-calls-urges-critics-to-offer-solutions-instead/\">Ruto declared a month ago</a>. “They take selfies and post on social media. But I want to tell you, if we continue this way, … we will not have a country.”</p><p>The killing and abductions of protesters as well as the move to charge them with “terrorism” offences, borrowing a leaf from Western governments that have similarly criminalised pro-Palestinian and antigenocide sentiments, are clear examples of the state’s preferred response. At the same time, there have been repeated calls for the protesters to enter into talks with the regime and, more recently, for an “<a href=\"https://www.citizen.digital/news/saba-saba-raila-wants-national-conclave-formed-to-address-grievances-n365889\">intergenerational national conclave</a>” to address their concerns.</p><p>But framing protests as a dangerous response to political dissatisfaction is flawed. Demonstrations are an expression of democracy, not the result of its failures. The Generation Z movement has shown that transparency, mutual aid and political consciousness can thrive outside formal institutions. Activists have made the streets and online forums sites of grievance, rigorous debate, civic education, and policy engagement.</p><p>They have raised funds, provided medical and legal aid, and supported bereaved families, all without help from the state or international donors. In doing so, they have reminded the country that citizenship is not just about casting ballots every five years. It is about showing up – together, creatively and courageously – to shape the future.</p><p>The Generation Z movement is in many respects a reincarnation of the reform movement of the 1990s when Kenyans waged a decadelong street-based struggle against the brutal dictatorship of President Daniel arap Moi. Today’s defiant chants of “Ruto must go” and “Wantam” – the demand that Ruto be denied a second term in the 2027 election – echo the rallying cries from 30 years ago: “Moi must go” and “Yote yawezekana bila Moi (All is possible without Moi).”</p><p>Centring the struggle on Moi was a potent political strategy. It united a broad coalition, drew international attention and forced critical concessions – from the reintroduction of multiparty politics and term limits to the expansion of civil liberties and, crucially, the rights of assembly and expression.</p><p>By the time Moi left office at the end of 2002, Kenya was arguably at its freest, its spirit immortalised in the Gidi Gidi Maji Maji hit I Am Unbwogable! (I Am Unshakable and Indomitable!)” But that moment of triumph also masked a deeper danger: the illusion that removing a leader was the same as transforming the system.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Moi’s successor, Mwai Kibaki, hailed then as a reformist and gentleman of Kenyan politics, quickly set about reversing hard-won gains. His government blocked (then tried to subvert) constitutional reform, raided newsrooms and eventually presided over a stolen election that brought Kenya to the brink of civil war.</p><p>One of his closest ministers, the late John Michuki, had in 2003 revealed the true mindset of the political class: Constitutional change to devolve the power of the presidency, <a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/the-standard/article/2001457975/intrigues-that-shattered-the-kibaki-raila-dream?started=true\">he claimed</a>, was necessary only so “one of our own could share power with Moi”. Once Moi was gone, he averred, there was no longer need for it.</p><p>Due to the obstruction from the political class, it took Kenyans close to a decade after Moi’s departure to finally promulgate a new constitution.</p><p>Generation Z must avoid the trap of the transition of the 2000s. Power, in the Kenyan political imagination, has often been the prize, not the problem. But real change requires more than a reshuffling of names atop the state. It demands a refusal to treat state power as the destination and a commitment to reshaping the terrain on which that power operates. And this is where the youth should beware the machinations of a political class that is more interested in power than in change.</p><p>Today’s calls for national talks and intergenerational conclaves emanating from this class should be treated with suspicion. Kenyans have seen this play out before. From the 1997 Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group talks and the negotiations brokered by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan after the 2007-2008 postelection violence to the infamous “handshake” between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his rival Raila Odinga and the failed Building Bridges Initiative, each of these elite pacts was presented as a way to translate popular anger into meaningful reform. Yet time and again, they only served to defuse movements, sideline dissenters and protect entrenched power.</p><p>Worse still, Kenya has a long history of elevating reformers – from opposition leaders and journalists to civil society activists – into positions of state power, only for them to abandon their principles once at the top. Radical rhetoric gives way to political compromise. The goal becomes to rule and extract, not transform. Many end up defending the very systems they once opposed.</p><p>“Ruto must go” is a powerful tactic for mobilisation and pressure. But it should not be seen as the end goal. That was my generation’s mistake. We forgot that we did not achieve the freedoms we enjoy – and that Ruto seeks to roll back – through engaging in the formal system’s rituals of elections and elite agreements but by imposing change on it from the outside. We allowed the politicians to hijack the street movements and reframe power and elite consensus as the solution, not the problem.</p><p>Generation Z must learn from that failure. Its focus must relentlessly be on undoing the system that enables and sustains oppression, not feeding reformers into it. And the streets must remain a legitimate space of powerful political participation, not one to be pacified or criminalised. For its challenge to formal state power is not a threat to democracy. It is democracy.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

They said their children have been starving for days, and they do not have any other option than jumping on these trucks,” Khoudary said.</p><p>“This shows how desperate Palestinians are and how they were deprived of their basic necessities. Now we are expecting more trucks to enter today.”</p><p>Israel’s decision to allow more aid into Gaza has been welcomed by the UN, but officials warned that severe restrictions continued to block lifesaving deliveries.</p><p>“This is a welcome step in the right direction,” Tom Fletcher, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But clearly, we need to get in vast amounts of aid at a much, much greater scale than we’ve been able to do so far.”</p><p>Fletcher said deliveries overall have been just “a drop in the ocean” of what is needed.</p><p>“We can’t just simply turn up and drive through. That’s what we should be allowed to do, that’s what international law demands, but we’re not yet at that point,” he said, citing ongoing security risks, closed crossings, visa rejections and customs delays.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>As the hunger crisis deepens, Israeli forces have continued to launch attacks across Gaza, killing at least 65 people on Monday, including 23 who were seeking aid, medical sources told Al Jazeera.</p><p>More than 1,000 Palestinians seeking aid have been killed by Israeli forces near distribution sites run by the US- and Israeli-backed GHF, which launched operations in late May.</p><p>The GHF has been heavily criticised by the UN and other humanitarian organisations for failing to provide enough aid and for the dire security situation at and around its aid distribution sites.</p><p>Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said: “What Israel describes as ‘humanitarian pauses’ are, in fact, limited and seen as unilateral suspensions of military activities that usually last for a few hours and are confined to select areas,” Abu Azzoum said.</p><p>“These pauses, as we have seen, lack international oversight or any sort of coordination with humanitarian agencies,” he said.</p><p>Rejecting international calls for a ceasefire, the Israeli army has conducted its offensive on Gaza since October 7, 2023, the day Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel killed 1,139 people and resulted in more than 200 people being taken captive.</p><p>The war has since killed nearly 60,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children.</p><p>Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for its war on the enclave.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In a couple of weeks, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the biggest hydroelectric dam on the African continent, will be inaugurated. The construction of this dam has taken more than a decade and has cost nearly $5bn. The government and people of Ethiopia mobilised the funds for this national project from their meagre internal resources. No international financing was made available for this project.</p><p>While the construction of the dam has received some international media attention, the media coverage has not made clear the Ethiopian perspective. This is a modest attempt to rectify that problem.</p><p>The GERD is constructed on the Blue Nile, which Ethiopians call Abay. Abay means “big” or “major” in several Ethiopian languages. Abay is one of the main tributaries of the Nile River. Although many associate the Nile almost exclusively with Egypt, the river traverses 10 other African countries. Among these countries, Ethiopia holds a unique position because 86 percent of the Nile water that reaches Egypt originates from the Ethiopian highlands.</p><p>Abay is the biggest river in Ethiopia with a huge potential to boost overall socioeconomic transformation and development. It has been a long-held aspiration of Ethiopians to utilise this resource. The GERD is a national development project that fulfils this dream.</p><p>Despite its huge labour force and economic potential, Ethiopia has yet to make headway in its endeavour to industrialise. One critical factor that has held back this effort has been Ethiopia’s lack of energy. According to the latest figures, barely 55 percent of Ethiopians have access to electricity.</p><p>There is a huge demand and need for electricity in Ethiopia. Hence, the GERD is seen as our national ticket out of darkness and poverty. Necessity dictates that Ethiopia use this major resource as an instrument to spur growth and prosperity for the benefit of its 130-million-strong population, which is expected to reach 200 million by 2050.</p><p>The GERD is expected to generate about 5,150 megawatts of electricity and produce an annual energy output of 15,760 gigawatt hours. This will double Ethiopia’s energy output, which will not only light our homes but also power industries and cities and transform our economy. The GERD would also make it possible to increase our energy exports to neighbouring countries, thereby strengthening regional integration and interconnectedness.</p><p>The lower riparian states of the Nile would also derive immense benefit from the GERD because it would prevent flooding, sedimentation and water loss through evaporation. The very purpose of the GERD, which is generating electricity, requires that the water flows to lower riparian countries after hitting the enormous turbines that generate the electricity. The dam does not block or stop the river from flowing. Doing so would make electricity generation impossible and defeat the very purpose for which the dam was built.</p><p>So, you might ask, why are some lower riparian countries complaining about the construction of the dam? The reason for their objections emanates not from rational fear or legitimate concern. The objections are the result of an attitude shaped by a colonial-era water-sharing agreement concluded between Britain and Egypt in 1929 and its derivative agreement sealed in 1959 between Egypt and Sudan.</p><p>Ethiopia was not a party to any of these treaties. However, some Egyptians contend that the water-sharing formula enshrined in the colonial-era agreement, which excludes the remaining nine African nations from having any share of the Nile, is still valid and should be adhered to by all Nile riparian countries.</p><p>From an Ethiopian point of view, this anachronistic argument, often presented as “historic rights over the Nile” is unacceptable. While Britain is entitled to enter into any agreements regarding the River Thames, it does not have the right to dispose of the waters of the Nile or the Abay River. As we all recall, the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser rejected Britain’s claims over the Suez Canal. For much stronger reasons, Ethiopian leaders have consistently rejected arguments based on colonial arrangements in which Ethiopia did not have a say.</p><p>The Ethiopian view is that the Nile is a shared natural resource. It should be used in a cooperative framework that would be beneficial for all riparian countries. The developmental aspirations and dreams of all nations are equally legitimate. The needs of some should not be prioritised over the needs of others.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>A fair, just and inclusive arrangement that takes into account the realities of the 21st century is needed. Such an arrangement is already in place in the form of the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement, which is a contemporary, African-initiated treaty designed to promote sustainable management and equitable use of the Nile. This treaty has already been signed and ratified by Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan.</p><p>Egypt should stop yearning for a bygone colonial era and join these Nile riparian countries in their joint effort to promote fair and equitable use of the Nile in a sustainable manner.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s going to bring us closer together,” he added.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the agreement would “bring stability” and “bring predictability that’s very important for our businesses on both sides of the Atlantic”.</p><p>Von der Leyen defended the deal, saying the aim was to rebalance a trade surplus with the US. Trump has made no secret of using tariffs to try to trim US trade deficits.</p><p>Sunday’s agreement capped off <a href=\"/news/2025/5/27/why-are-the-us-and-eu-struggling-to-reach-a-trade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">months of often tense shuttle diplomacy</a> between Brussels and Washington although neither side disclosed the full details of the pact or released any written materials.</p><p>It follows preliminary trade pacts the US signed with <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/23/trump-announces-massive-trade-deal-with-japan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Japan</a>, the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/8/us-uk-trade-deal-how-are-trumps-global-tariff-talks-shaping-up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/15/trump-announces-19-percent-tariff-on-indonesia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Indonesia</a>, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-secures-trade-deal-with-vietnam-as-negotiations-continue-with-s-korea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vietnam</a> and the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/trump-sets-19-tariff-on-philippines-in-new-trade-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Philippines</a> and a 90-day trade truce with <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-us-china-trade-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">China</a>.</p><p>So how will the deal impact the two sides, which account for almost a third of global trade, and will it end the threats of a tariff war?</p><h2 id=\"what-was-agreed\">What was agreed?</h2><p>At a news event at Trump’s golf resort, von der Leyen said a 15 percent tariff would apply to European cars, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors – all important products for Europe’s economy.</p><p>For his part, Trump said US levies on steel and aluminium, which he has set at 50 percent on many countries, would not be cut for EU products, dashing the hopes of industry in the bloc. Elsewhere, aerospace tariffs will remain at zero for now.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In exchange for the 15 percent tariff rate on EU goods, Trump said the bloc would be “opening up their countries at zero tariff” for American exports.</p><p>In addition, he said the EU would spend an extra $750bn on US energy products, invest $600bn in the US and buy military equipment worth “hundreds of billions of dollars”.</p><p>Von der Leyen confirmed that the EU would seek to buy an extra $250bn of US energy products each year from now until 2027.</p><p>“With this deal, we are securing access to our largest export market,” she said.</p><p>At the same time, she acknowledged that the 15 percent tariffs would be “a challenge for some” European industries.</p><p>The EU is the US’s largest trading partner with two-way trade in goods and services last year reaching nearly $2 trillion.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-european-leaders-responded\">How have European leaders responded?</h2><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the agreement, saying it avoids “an unnecessary escalation in transatlantic trade relations”.</p><p>He said a trade war “would have hit Germany’s export-oriented economy hard”, pointing out that the German car industry would see US tariffs lowered from 27.5 percent to 15 percent.</p><p>But French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called the deal a “dark day” for Europe, saying the bloc had caved in to the US president with an unbalanced deal that spares US imports from any immediate European retaliation.</p><p>“It is a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, brought together to affirm their common values and to defend their common interests, resigns itself to submission,” Bayrou wrote on X of what he called the “von der Leyen-Trump deal”.</p><p>Wolfgang Niedermark, a board member of the Federation of German Industries trade body, called the deal “an inadequate compromise” with the EU “accepting painful tariffs”.</p><p>A 15 percent tariff rate “will have a huge negative impact on Germany’s export-oriented industry”, he said.</p><p>Earlier, Benjamin Haddad, France’s European affairs minister, said: “The trade agreement … will bring temporary stability to economic actors threatened by the escalation of American tariffs, but it is unbalanced.”</p><p>Echoing that sentiment, Dutch Foreign Trade Minister Hanneke Boerma said the deal was “not ideal” and called on the commission to continue negotiations with Washington.</p><p>The European Commission is responsible for negotiating trade deals for the entire bloc.</p><p>EU ambassadors will be discussing the agreement with the commission this week.</p><h2 id=\"how-was-trade-conducted-before-the-deal\">How was trade conducted before the deal?</h2><p>On July 12, Trump threatened to impose <a href=\"/news/2025/7/12/trump-says-30-percent-tariffs-against-eu-and-mexico-to-begin-on-august-1\">30 percent</a> tariffs on EU goods if the two sides couldn’t reach a deal before this Friday, the day a suspension expires on the implementation of what Trump calls his “reciprocal tariffs”, which he placed on nearly all countries in the world.</p><p>Those “reciprocal tariffs” are due to come into effect in addition to the <a href=\"/economy/2025/3/27/trump-announces-25-percent-tariffs-on-cars-ramping-up-trade-war\">25 percent</a> tariffs on cars and car parts and the <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/4/donald-trumps-50-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs-take-effect\">50 percent</a> levy on steel and aluminium products Trump already put in place.</p><p>On the European side, it is understood that Brussels would have pushed ahead with a retaliatory tariffs package on <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/16/what-retaliatory-action-is-the-eu-planning-over-trumps-tariffs\">90 billion euros</a> ($109bn) of US goods, including car parts and bourbon, if talks had broken down.</p><p>The EU had been a frequent target of escalating trade rhetoric by Trump, who accused the bloc of “ripping off” the US.</p><p>In 2024, the US ran a $235.6bn goods deficit with the EU. Pharmaceuticals, car parts and industrial chemicals were among Europe’s largest exports to the US, according to EU data.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-the-deal-impact-the-us-and-eu\">How will the deal impact the US and EU?</h2><p>Bloomberg Economics estimated that a no-deal outcome would have raised the effective US tariff rate on European goods to nearly 18 percent on Friday.</p><p>The new deal brings that number down to 16 percent, offering a small reprieve to European exporting firms. Still, current trade barriers are much higher than before Trump took office in 2025.</p><p>According to Bruegel, a research group, the average US tariff rate on EU exports was just 1.5 percent at the end of 2024.</p><p>William Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute, told Al Jazeera: “I think the [Trump] strategy has been clear from the very beginning. … It’s brinkmanship. … Either partner with the US or face high tariffs.”</p><p>Meanwhile, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said: “President Trump just unlocked one of the biggest economies in the world. The European Union is going to open its $20 trillion market and completely accept our auto and industrial standards for the first time ever.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
