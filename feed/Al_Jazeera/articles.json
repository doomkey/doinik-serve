While their attacking threat has been evident, greater defensive solidity will be the focus when they face Uganda in Tuesday’s clash in Fez.</p><p data-start=\"838\" data-end=\"1035\">Though the fixture carries little consequence for Nigeria, it is a do-or-die encounter for Uganda, who must spring a major upset against the West African giants to keep their tournament hopes alive.</p><p data-start=\"406\" data-end=\"645\">Here’s everything you need to know about Uganda vs Nigeria:</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-nigeria-s-first-two-matches\">What happened in Nigeria’s first two matches?</h2><p>Nigeria kicked off their AFCON campaign with a <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/23/nigeria-beat-tanzania-to-make-winning-start-to-afcon-2025\">narrow 2-1 win</a> over Tanzania, a game in which the Super Eagles were left to rue their inability to convert chances.</p><p>But they bounced back with an impressive display of attacking prowess and <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/27/nigeria-reach-afcon-knockouts-despite-late-tunisia-scare\">survived</a> a late rally by Tunisia to win 3-2, sealing their spot in the last 16.</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-in-uganda-s-first-two-matches\">What happened in Uganda’s first two matches?</h2><p>Uganda suffered a 3-1 defeat to Tunisia in the opening match and had to settle for a 1-1 draw with Tanzania in the second game.</p><p>While Uganda were inferior to Tunisia in the opener, they had the chance to seal victory in the second game against East African rivals Tanzania, but Allan Okello missed a penalty in stoppage time.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4199298\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4199298\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4199298\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251227__894Y9MP__v1__MidRes__FblAfr2025Match17NgaTun-1766874190.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria's forward #09 Victor Osimhen celebrates\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4199298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thumbs up for victory: Nigeria’s forward Victor Osimhen was among the scorers as they beat Tunisia 3-2 in a five-goal thriller on Saturday [Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-are-the-afcon-group-c-standings-and-who-can-qualify\">What are the AFCON Group C standings, and who can qualify?</h2><p>Nigeria lead Group C with six points, having registered two wins in two matches. They are already through to the last 16.</p><p>Tunisia sit second with three points, while Tanzania and Uganda are third and fourth respectively, both with one point each. All three teams are in the mix to qualify, though Tunisia have the best chance out of the trio, with a draw against Tanzania on Tuesday enough to progress.</p><p>The top two teams from each group, along with the best four third-place teams, will advance to the round of 16.</p><p data-start=\"69\" data-end=\"327\">Nigeria are guaranteed to finish top of Group C, regardless of results in the final round.

Currently, it means it could be one of Zambia, Angola or Mozambique.</p><p>Like all of Nigeria’s group games, the last-16 contest will also be held in Fez.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-nigeria-s-best-players\">Who are Nigeria’s best players?</h2><p>With two goals and two assists, Ademola Lookman is arguably Nigeria’s best player and the tournament’s standout attacker so far. The 28-year-old was the architect of Nigeria’s victories in both games, playing an equal role as a playmaker and finisher.</p><p>Apart from him, striker Victor Osimhen has been one of the most feared attackers, while Alex Iwobi has been pulling the strings in midfield.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"who-are-uganda-s-best-players\">Who are Uganda’s best players?</h2><p data-start=\"387\" data-end=\"650\">Attacking midfielder Okello, known as “Star Boy” in his homeland, is one of Uganda’s key players. His late penalty miss against Tanzania proved costly, but it does little to diminish his talent and importance to the side.</p><p data-start=\"387\" data-end=\"650\">Midfielder Denis Omedi and striker Uche Ikpeazu, who both scored off the bench, have proven to be impactful and could be handed starts.</p><h2 id=\"form-guide\">Form guide</h2><p>All competitions, most recent result last:</p><p>Nigeria: W-W-L-L-W</p><p>Uganda: D-L-L-L-W</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>Uganda and Nigeria have played each other a total of eight times, including in competitive and friendly games.</p><p>Although ranked 47 spots below Nigeria, Uganda have historically had a strong record against the mighty West Africans. Uganda have won four times, Nigeria have won only twice, while two games ended in a draw.</p><p>The last meeting between the teams took place in 2018 in an international friendly, which ended in a goalless draw. Their last AFCON face-off was in June 2007, when Uganda won 2-1 in a group fixture.</p><h2 id=\"afcon-records\">AFCON records</h2><p>Uganda have played seven times at AFCON, with their best result a runners-up finish in 1978. They also finished fourth in 1962.</p><p>Nigeria have played at the tournament 20 times, finishing winners on three occasions and runners-up five times.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4198689\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4198689\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4198689\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251227__894Q2CC__v1__MidRes__FblAfr2025Match17NgaTun-1766857193.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fez Stadium is pictured prior the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) Group C football match between Nigeria and Tunisia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4198689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The 45,000-capacity Fez Stadium will host Tuesday’s clash between Nigeria and Uganda [Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"nigeria-team-news\">Nigeria team news</h2><p>With the last-16 qualification secured, Nigeria’s head coach, Eric Chelle, is expected to rest the usual starters and hand game time to other players.</p><p>Goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali, defender Semi Ajayi, striker Osimhen and attacking midfielder Lookman are all one yellow card away from suspension and could be rested.</p><h2 id=\"nigeria-s-predicted-lineup\">Nigeria’s predicted lineup</h2><p>Francis Uzoho (goalkeeper); Bright Osayi-Samuel, Chidozie Awaziem, Calvin Bassey, Bruno Onyemaechi; Frank Onyeka; Raphael Onyedika, Wilfried Ndidi, Fisayo Dele-Bashiru; Chidera Ejuke, Paul Onauchu</p><h2 id=\"uganda-team-news\">Uganda team news</h2><p>Uganda head coach Paul Put will name a full-strength side for this must-win encounter.

These Palestinians have been displaced after more than two years of Israel’s genocidal war, which has destroyed much of the besieged enclave.</p><p>In Khan Younis, soaked blankets and swamped clay cooking ovens added to the misery. Children in flip-flops navigated through puddles while adults desperately used shovels and tin cans to remove water from tents or extracted collapsed shelters from mud.</p><p>“Puddles formed, and there was a bad smell,” said Majdoleen Tarabein, displaced from Rafah in southern Gaza. “The tent flew away. We don’t know what to do or where to go.”</p><p>She and her family attempted to wring sodden blankets dry by hand.</p><p>“When we woke up in the morning, we found that the water had entered the tent,” said Eman Abu Riziq, also displaced in Khan Younis. “These are the mattresses. They are all completely soaked.”</p><p>She added that her family is still grieving her husband’s death less than two weeks ago.</p><p>“Where are the mediators? We don’t want food. We don’t want anything. We are exhausted. We just want mattresses and covers,” pleaded Fatima Abu Omar while trying to stabilise a collapsing shelter.</p><p>At least 15 people, including three babies, have died this month from hypothermia following the rains and plunging temperatures, according to the authorities in Gaza.</p><p>Emergency workers have warned against staying in damaged buildings due to collapse risks, yet with most of the territory in rubble after relentless and ongoing Israeli bombardment, shelter options are scarce. United Nations estimates from July indicate nearly 80 percent of Gaza’s buildings have been destroyed or damaged.</p><p>Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began, 414 people have been killed and 1,142 wounded, with the overall Palestinian death toll reaching at least 71,266, according to the Health Ministry.</p><p>Aid deliveries to Gaza fall significantly short of ceasefire-mandated amounts, humanitarian organisations report. The Israeli military authority overseeing humanitarian aid stated that 4,200 aid trucks entered Gaza in the past week, along with sanitation equipment and winter supplies, but refused to specify the quantity of tents provided. Aid groups emphasise that current supplies cannot meet overwhelming needs.</p><p>Since the ceasefire, approximately 72,000 tents and 403,000 tarps have entered Gaza, according to Shelter Cluster, an international aid coalition led by the Norwegian Refugee Council.</p><p>“People in Gaza are surviving in flimsy, waterlogged tents and among ruins,” Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the UN refugee aid organisation in Gaza, said on social media. “There is nothing inevitable about this. Aid supplies are not being allowed in at the scale required.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

During that time, there is a constant stream of patients, from heart attacks to hypothermia to chronic diseases that have suddenly worsened due to the lack of treatment for traumatic injuries from Israeli attacks.</p><p>On a regular shift, there are four to six of us nurses, and up to three doctors – about a third of the staff that the emergency room had before the war. Like many of the other medical staff, I do not get paid for this work. The hospital cannot afford to compensate us; some colleagues occasionally receive symbolic remuneration from supporting organisations. No one has a fixed salary.</p><p>Out of 29 departments, just three are partially operational at al-Shifa. Most of the buildings in the once-sprawling medical complex are destroyed or burned. We work in three of them that have been partially restored.</p><p>Once I am done with my shift, I go back to my bombed-out home, which now has tarpaulins instead of walls. We have no heating, no electricity, and no running water, and we struggle to get adequate food because I bring no income back.</p><p>This is the reality that medical workers face across Gaza. It has been more than two months since the ceasefire came into effect, but Gaza’s hospitals still feel like battlefronts. The health sector is on the brink of collapse; it is barely functioning only because of the volunteer work of countless medical professionals and their sense of moral duty.</p><p>All across Gaza, doctors are working under immense pressure, nurses are performing tasks beyond their capacity, and patients stand in long queues waiting for unavailable medication or surgeries postponed due to equipment shortages.</p><p>Hospital occupancy rates have reached record levels, and in some departments, capacity has been exceeded many times over.</p><p>Medical teams are working in an environment lacking almost everything: essential medicines, ventilators, functioning operating rooms, and even beds. This is compounded by a severe shortage of spare parts for broken medical equipment, meaning that even a minor malfunction can halt the treatment of dozens of patients.</p><p>There are 350,000 people with chronic illnesses, the majority of whom are unable to receive their regular treatments. There are 42,000 people with life-changing injuries who require multiple surgeries and/or long-term rehabilitation, which is inaccessible in Gaza. There are more than 16,000 patients who require urgent medical evacuation; nearly 1,100 have died while waiting to be allowed to leave for treatment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel continues to bomb civilians and block the delivery of essential and life-saving medications, including cancer drugs, supplies for dialysis, heart medications, antibiotics, insulin, and emergency care IV solutions.</p><p>At least 411 people <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/israel-kills-two-palestinians-in-gaza-city-as-ceasefire-violations-mount\">have been killed</a> and 1,112 injured by Israeli attacks since the truce took effect on October 10. We can only guess the number who have died as a result of Israel’s decision to block medicines.</p><p>All of these pressures – the high number of patients, the destroyed medical infrastructure, and the lack of medicines – fall on the shoulders of medical workers who have already been through hell.</p><p>At least 1,722 of our colleagues were killed during the genocide, according to Medical Aid for Palestinians. Some fled Gaza when they got a chance. At least 80 of our colleagues are still held captive in Israeli jails, including <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/a-year-on-israel-still-holds-gaza-doctor-hussam-abu-safia-without-charge\">Dr Hussam Abu Safia</a>, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital.</p><p>Those of us who are still on the ground, working, are exhausted. Images of the horrors of the genocide continue to haunt us: Babies and children who have lost multiple limbs; elderly people with severe internal injuries who cannot be operated on; young people with spinal or head injuries whose lives are now fully dependent on a caregiver and unavailable equipment or medications.</p><p>“I carry my grief with me in my pocket, among the instruments and bandages. Sometimes I treat a child who looks like my own son, and I have to hide my tears,” one colleague at al-Shifa Hospital who lost a child told me recently.</p><p>Another colleague said, “We don’t work in a hospital; we’re on a battlefield, fighting against time and death.”</p><p>We, medical workers in Gaza, are not merely caregivers or employees. We are witnesses to tragedy, heroes without armour, soldiers in a different kind of war. Some of us have lost loved ones, others have lost homes, and yet we return to work, putting our personal pain aside. Not because we are fearless, but because we cannot afford to let our patients down. Despite the exhaustion, the fear, and the sorrow, there is an unwavering will, there are hearts that beat with a sense of duty and humanity.</p><p>We will keep going, but we cannot do it alone. We need urgent help to restore Gaza’s healthcare sector, to re-equip operating rooms, and replenish medical supplies.</p><p>Gaza doesn’t need more statements; it needs medicine, equipment, personnel, and a guarantee of the basic right to treatment.</p><p>Let this article be a cry for help, a call to urgent action. Gaza healthcare must be saved so it can save lives again. Palestinian lives matter.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

She said some algorithms used by social media platforms could “become as powerful as states”.</p><p data-start=\"1143\" data-end=\"1349\">Metreweli warned that the “defining challenge of the 21st century” was “not simply who wields the most powerful technologies, but who guides them with the greatest wisdom”.</p><p data-start=\"1143\" data-end=\"1349\">Just a handful of tech giants now control how information reaches the public, raising concerns that their owners could manipulate information and communications for their preferred political outcomes.</p><p data-start=\"2004\" data-end=\"2116\">While Metreweli did not cite specific examples, two or three US firms dominate social media and Elon Musk, the owner of X (as well as SpaceX and Tesla), also controls Starlink – the satellite communications network that is considered crucial for the Ukrainian military in its ongoing war with Russia.</p><p data-start=\"1143\" data-end=\"1349\">This is a type of monopoly, but while Metreweli was talking mainly about political power and influence, monopolies can wield immense economic power as well.</p><p data-start=\"1143\" data-end=\"1349\">Monopolies in other industries are also causing havoc. India’s airline market was rocked by rising prices and a pilot shortage recently, while Netflix’s proposed merger with Warner Bros has led to concern that a streaming monopoly could harm creative and artistic industries and restrict consumer choice.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"which-other-monopolies-are-causing-controversy\">Which other monopolies are causing controversy?</h2><p>Monopolies are not just an issue for the technology sector; they are disrupting other industries as well.</p><h3 id=\"netflix-and-warner-bros\">Netflix and Warner Bros</h3><p>On December 5, <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\">Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros Discovery</a> in an $82.7bn deal, close on the heels of the merger of Paramount with Skydance Media earlier this year and, in 2019, Disney’s purchase of fellow studio 21st Century Fox.</p><p>Experts and government officials have raised antitrust concerns about the planned acquisition, noting that the enlarged market share controlled by one group following such a merger could throw up problems.</p><p>Consumers seem to agree. Netflix was hit with a lawsuit on December 9 seeking to block the merger.</p><p>The lawsuit asserts that the Warner Bros deal would eliminate one of Netflix’s closest rivals – HBO Max – and give Netflix control over several major Warner Bros franchises, including Harry Potter, DC Comics and Game of Thrones.</p><p>The proposed class action, filed by a subscriber in a federal court in California, says this will reduce competition, push up prices, and limit content choice for US viewers.</p><p>Netflix has suggested that social media video platforms such as YouTube and TikTok should be included in any survey of the market, which would shrink its perceived market dominance, and has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-combo-seen-lowering-costs-consumers-sources-say-2025-12-03/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">argued</a> that the costs for consumers would be lowered because Discovery Warner Bros services could be bundled with a Netflix subscription.</p><h3 id=\"indigo\">IndiGo</h3><p>On December 2, air travel across India was thrown into chaos when the country’s largest airline, IndiGo, cancelled thousands of flights, stranding hundreds of thousands of passengers at airports across the country.</p><p>Passengers faced <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/indigo-chaos-why-is-indias-largest-airline-canceling-hundreds-of-flights\">mass cancellations</a> due to pilot shortages, because IndiGo – which operates roughly 2,200 flights a day – had failed to adopt new pilot rest-and-duty rules introduced by the government in 2024.</p><p>Though the airline had been granted temporary exemptions from the new rules to keep it operational, it still failed to comply with the revised deadline of November 1. Former AirAsia CFO Vijay Gopalan blamed IndiGo’s “very, very lackadaisical, nonchalant attitude” in adapting to rule changes.</p><p>On December 6, India’s aviation watchdog, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), sent a letter to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers, warning him of regulatory action. “You have failed in your duty to ensure timely arrangements for conduct of reliable operations,” the Reuters news agency reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>For now, IndiGo has been exempted from capping the weekly number of landings between midnight and early morning until February 10. Meanwhile, the government has ordered a high-level inquiry to determine the cause of flight disruptions.</p><p>Together, IndiGo and Air India control 92 percent of the market in India, raising questions about the lack of competition.</p><p>The recent crisis, in particular, has highlighted the risk of overreliance on a single carrier, with IndiGo controlling 65 percent of the market share.</p><p>This month, <a href=\"/features/2025/12/2/indias-sky-high-fares-crash-dreams-to-make-flying-accessible-to-all\">it was revealed</a> that Indians are facing steep rises in airfares as a direct result of the lack of competition, effectively shutting a large part of the population out of air travel.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.aci-asiapac.aero/media-centre/news/international-airfares-remain-high-notable-increase-in-key-domestic-markets-aci-asia-pacific-and-middle-east\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> published in November last year by Airports Council International (ACI), a global trade association representing more than 2,000 airports in more than 180 countries, India saw a 43 percent rise in domestic airfares in the first half of 2024, compared with 2019, the second highest in the Asia Pacific and West Asia regions after Vietnam.</p><h2 id=\"why-should-monopolies-be-restricted\">Why should monopolies be restricted?</h2><p>Monopolies form when one firm outcompetes others through innovation or control of scarce resources, creating barriers for rivals. While often criticised for limiting choice and raising prices, they can sometimes deliver goods and services that fragmented competition could not sustain.</p><p>Still, there are a number of reasons that many economists warn against allowing monopolies to emerge.</p><p>Monopolies can undermine a country’s economic activity by weakening competition and stifling innovation. Monopolies can also distort prices. Dominant firms may limit supplies in order to keep prices artificially high, squeezing consumers.</p><p>“In a world that’s been suffering from a cost-of-living crisis, anything that drives up the price of goods should get people worried,” said Max Lawson, head of policy and advocacy for Oxfam.</p><p>Finally, monopolies stifle entrepreneurship. One group having control over infrastructure, data, or supply chains allows that group to favour itself or other preferred firms by raising the barrier to entry for new firms or potential competitors.</p><p>Economically, this can mean fewer jobs, less innovation and greater wealth inequality. It can also, in the case of social media, be used to smother reporting, opinions, or even political alternatives.</p><p>Guy Standing, an economist and research associate at SOAS University, said, “They [monopolies] can gain economies of scale, where the unit price of production [goes] down and then raise the price for consumers … as there’s no competition left.”</p><p>He noted that, across an array of different industries, private monopolies “reap vast wealth and benefits for their shareholders at the expense of consumers, which exacerbates income inequality”.</p><h2 id=\"have-monopolies-been-a-big-issue-in-the-past\">Have monopolies been a big issue in the past?</h2><p>US economic history is awash with examples of monopoly power. In the late 1800s, John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil crushed rivals through “predatory pricing”, deliberately undercutting competitors’ prices to drive them out of business before later raising prices.</p><p>By the 1890s, Standard Oil controlled approximately 90 percent of US oil refining.</p><p>At roughly the same time, railroad monopolies distorted regional economies by using discriminatory freight rates, favouring certain regions and industries while undercutting firms that challenged their dominance.</p><p>Modern technology monopolies echo these. Google, for instance, dominates digital advertising and effectively shapes online markets, using mass data collection to determine what people see and how businesses <a href=\"/video/counting-the-cost/2024/11/14/what-does-a-second-trump-presidency-mean-for-big-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and politicians</a> reach audiences.</p><p>Elsewhere, Amazon leverages its e-commerce and logistics power to undercut rivals. It uses its vast logistics network, warehousing, and data-driven pricing to offer lower prices and faster delivery than competitors, which consolidates its market power.</p><p><span>“In the past 30 years, we’ve seen an extreme concentration of market power [in the tech sector] … which made economies more </span>inefficient and [has] driven up <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/6/tesla-shareholders-approve-878bn-pay-plan-for-elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">income inequality</a>,” Lawson told Al Jazeera.</p><p>SOAS University’s Standing echoed that sentiment: “Modern economies have evolved so that monopolies are increasingly present across all sectors of activity.”</p><p>“This is particularly in information services. Plutocrats like Elon Musk are increasingly able to determine the <a href=\"/economy/2024/9/6/xs-grok2ai-chatbot-escalates-problem-of-deepfakes-ahead-of-us-elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">political direction</a> of the services [such as social media platform X] they provide, in addition to using their wealth to <a href=\"/news/2024/10/16/musk-gave-seventy-five-million-to-pro-trump-group-underscoring-influence-on-race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buy off politicians</a>,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-can-governments-combat-monopolies\">How can governments combat monopolies?</h2><p>Governments can curb monopolies through antitrust laws, which refer to legal measures that stop anticompetitive practices. Antitrust laws give regulators the power to break up domineering firms into smaller units, as seen in the 2011 breakup of AT&amp;T, a US telecom giant.</p><p>At its height, in the 1980s, AT&amp;T oversaw many regional service providers, covering almost all telephone networks in the US, limiting choice and inflating prices. Regulators broke them into smaller companies, boosting competition and eventually lowering costs.</p><p>In the US, the Department of Justice has two significant, ongoing antitrust lawsuits against Google. In 2021, Google said it would overhaul its global advertising business and agreed to pay a $268m fine as part of an antitrust settlement with French watchdogs.</p><p>Regulators may also impose fines for unfair pricing and work to promote transparency and open standards, to reduce barriers to markets for new entrants. In March 2025, for instance, the European Commission ordered Apple to open device connectivity to other companies and fined the technology giant for practices that hid cheaper options from consumers.</p><p>Regulators have gone beyond fines to mandate interoperability and fair practices under laws like the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA requires dominant platforms to share data, allow rivals to connect with their systems, and disclose transparent advertising and ranking practices, giving smaller firms a fairer chance to compete.</p><p>Through a combination of legal action, economic oversight and structural reform, authorities can prevent monopolies from stifling innovation and concentrating excessive market power, which can give them political power, as the UK’s intelligence chief recently warned.</p><p>Lawson said he believes that “to regulate super-powerful corporate titans, you can cut them down to size; either break them up into smaller private firms or nationalise them”.</p><p>“We’ve been here before,” he added. “Standard Oil was broken up in the 1910s. That was over a century ago. There’s no reason it can’t happen again.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Someone told me it was in the basement, but I got lost in the corridors, trying to buy an adapter and some toast.</p><p>Everything felt unfamiliar – especially the silence.</p><p>Nothing hummed, nothing hovered, nothing threatened. The stillness almost frightened me.</p><p>My first real conversations were at the English prep course at the university. It was a small classroom that felt like a tiny world: Classmates from Cyprus, Turkiye, Lebanon, Morocco, Libya.</p><p>We traded words and accents, and my teacher loved how quickly I learned new vocabulary.</p><p>When I told people I am from Palestine, some heard “Pakistan”, or pointed vaguely at their maps; I showed them pictures, then places.</p><p>In classes, some asked whether we “actually had a life” there. One person asked, sincerely, if Gaza existed. The confusion wasn’t malicious; it was a vacuum in the world’s imagination where my home is.</p><p>Once, in a market, I helped an elderly man find a carton of milk.

That lasted for years – until October 7, 2023, when the dream ended, and the distance collapsed.</p><p>During the war, I worked remotely with my father, a journalist in Gaza – translating, monitoring, waiting for his messages to know he was still alive.</p><p>Fear found me; I shut myself in a room for months, terrified to sleep.</p><p>When I finally slept after weeks, I woke to the news that my cousin Ahmed had been killed.</p><p>Ahmed was in his 30s, and everyone used to call him Saddam because he was born on the day Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles on Israel.</p><p>He used to call me “ya koshieh”, a teasing nickname that meant “dark-skinned one” – a silly, small joke that somehow felt like protection.</p><p>The guilt over his death was immediate and irrational, as if my wakefulness could have kept him alive.</p><p>We lost more family: my uncle Iyad and his only daughter, and my uncle Nael and his wife, Salwa.

Gaza gave me awareness; exile gave me the language to understand it.</p><p>Egypt, and later Oman, added new layers to the same unanswered question: How do you carry a home that keeps breaking?</p><p>Maybe this is why, over the past two years, I’ve worked and planned to rebuild my life, to pursue a master’s degree in diplomacy.</p><p>I want to try to understand the world whose decisions shaped my childhood, the power structures that determined so much of my story.</p><p>When people hear “Gaza,” they often think “destruction”.</p><p>The people of Gaza are like anyone else – except their struggle is multiplied by forces beyond their control.</p><p>My story is one of millions.

That’s a very tough issue,” Trump said.</li>\n<li>The two leaders did not offer further details or a deadline for completing the deal, but Zelenskyy said any peace agreement would have to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament or by a referendum.</li>\n<li>Shortly after the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, wrote on X that the “whole world appreciates” Trump and his team’s peace efforts.</li>\n<li>Ahead of the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump and Putin spoke for more than two hours on the telephone. The US president described the call as “excellent” and “productive”.</li>\n<li>Trump said he would call Putin again after the meeting with Zelenskyy.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov said the initial call was “friendly” and that Putin had told Trump that a 60-day ceasefire, proposed by the European Union and Ukraine, would simply prolong the war.</li>\n<li>Ushakov said that a “bold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv” on the Donbas region and other disputed matters for there to be a “complete cessation” of hostilities.</li>\n<li>European leaders, including those from Finland, France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom, joined at least part of the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting by phone.</li>\n<li>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that Europe was ready to keep working with Ukraine and the US, and that having ironclad security guarantees would be of “paramount” importance.</li>\n<li>French President Emmanuel Macron said that progress had been made on security guarantees at the meeting. Macron said that countries in the so-called “Coalition of the Willing” would meet in Paris in early January to finalise their “concrete contributions”.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said that Trump had agreed to host European leaders again, possibly at the White House, sometime in January. Trump said the meeting could be in Washington, DC, or “someplace”.</li>\n<li>Earlier on Sunday, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov warned that any European troop contingents deployed to Ukraine would become legitimate targets for Russia’s forces. Lavrov also accused European politicians of being driven by “ambitions” in their relations with Kyiv, and disregarding the people of Ukraine and of their own nations.</li>\n</ul><h3>Fighting</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russian forces attacked a heating plant in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, wounding one person and causing “significant damage” to the facility, state oil and gas firm Naftogaz said.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s leading private energy provider, DTEK, said it had restored power to more than a million households in and around Kyiv a day after a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/russia-hammers-ukraines-capital-ahead-of-trump-zelenskyy-meeting\">massive Russian air attack</a> had forced emergency outages.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s military said it had struck the Syzran oil refinery in Russia’s Samara region in a drone attack. The strike caused a fire, and damages were still being assessed, the army said in a statement.</li>\n<li>The military also said that only part of the southeastern town of Huliaipole was under Russian control, contradicting an earlier claim by Moscow that it had been captured. It added that fighting was also still under way for Stepnohirsk, another town in the southeastern Zaporizhia region that Russia claimed it had captured.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement that its troops had taken control of four other settlements in the Donetsk region. It identified them as Myrnohrad, Artemivka, Rodynske and Vilne.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Certainly, that’s one of the big issues, and… it’s unresolved,” Trump said.</p><p>Zelenskyy reiterated his position that the issue of territory should be decided by the people of Ukraine and said that different aspects of the peace plan could be put to the public in referendums.</p><p>“Of course, our society has to choose… because it’s their land… not of one person. It’s the land of our nation, for a lot of generations,” he said.</p><p>After their talks, Trump and Zelenskyy held a joint phone call with key European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><p>Trump has been trying to end Russia’s nearly <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/will-the-russia-ukraine-war-end-in-2026\">four-year war in Ukraine</a> since returning to the White House in January.</p><p>He has variously shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin, while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of resolving the conflict.</p><p>Before his meeting with Zelenskyy on Sunday, Trump said that Moscow and Kyiv were in the “final stages of talking” and had the “makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, good for everybody”.</p><p>Russia <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/russia-hammers-ukraines-capital-ahead-of-trump-zelenskyy-meeting\">intensified its attacks</a> on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, in the days before the Florida meeting.</p><p>During talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators in Berlin earlier this month, the Trump administration agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO.</p><p>The proposal came after Zelenskyy said he could agree to no longer seek membership of the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like guarantees to protect the country from Russian attacks.</p><p>Oleksandr Kraiev, an analyst with the think tank Ukrainian Prism, said that the people of Ukraine were “quite cynical” about the US-brokered talks.</p><p>“We tried this in 2015, 2016, 2017, and unfortunately, each time, the Russians broke even the ceasefire regime, not even talking about the peace process,” Kraiev told Al Jazeera, referring to previous accords such as the 2015 Minsk II Agreement, which aimed to end the war in Donbas between Ukraine’s army and pro-Russian separatists.</p><p>“So, we have little faith that a proper peace process will take place. As of now, we’re striving for a ceasefire as a precondition for any kind of talks… We cannot trust the Russians with a peace deal, but a ceasefire is something we’re working on.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"blindsided-yet-again\">‘Blindsided yet again’</h2><p>Trump’s optimistic tone comes despite widespread scepticism in Europe about Putin’s intentions after Russia carried out heavy bombardment of Kyiv just as Zelenskyy headed to Florida.</p><p>Before Zelenskyy arrived, Trump spoke with Putin by phone for more than an hour and said he planned to speak with him again after the Zelenskyy meeting, catching Ukrainian leaders off guard, according to Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi.</p><p>“From what we’re hearing, the Zelenskyy delegation here have been blindsided yet again by Donald Trump. And according to the Russians, it was at the Americans’ insistence [that] there should be a call with Vladimir Putin the hour before Zelenskyy arrived,” said Rattansi, speaking from Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the call with Putin as “very good” and “productive”.</p><p>The Kremlin offered a more pointed account in its readout of the call, saying that Trump agreed that a ceasefire “would only prolong the conflict” as it demanded Ukraine make concessions on territory.</p><p>Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland if Russia also pulled back and the area became a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/ukraine-accepts-demilitarised-zone-to-end-russia-war-but-do-dmzs-work\">demilitarised zone</a> monitored by international forces.</p><p>Putin has stated that all areas in four key regions captured by his forces – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson – as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, should be recognised as Russian territory. The Russian leader has also demanded that Ukraine withdraw from parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces have not occupied.</p><p>Kyiv has publicly rejected those demands.</p><p>Trump has appeared sympathetic to some of Putin’s demands, arguing that the Russian president could be persuaded to end the fighting if Kyiv gives up Ukrainian land in the Donbas region, and if Western countries welcome Russia back into the global economy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>I am a Palestinian. And increasingly, that fact alone is treated as a provocation.</p><p>In recent months, I have watched anti-Semitism — a real, lethal form of hatred with a long and horrific history — be stripped of its meaning and weaponised to silence Palestinians, criminalise solidarity with us, and shield Israel from accountability as it carries out a genocide in Gaza. This is not about protecting Jewish people. It is about protecting power.</p><p>The pattern is now impossible to ignore.</p><p>A children’s educator, Ms Rachel, whose entire public work is built around care, learning, and empathy, is branded “Anti-Semite of the Year” — not for her engaging in any form of hate speech, but for expressing concern for Palestinian children. For acknowledging that children in Gaza are being bombed, starved, and traumatised. For expressing compassion.</p><p>As a Palestinian, I hear the message clearly: even empathy for our children is dangerous.</p><p>Then there is Palestine Action, a protest movement that targets weapons manufacturers supplying Israel’s military. Instead of being debated, challenged, or even criticised within a democratic framework, it is proscribed as a “terrorist” organisation, casually equated with ISIL (ISIS) – a group responsible for mass executions, sexual slavery, and genocidal violence.</p><p>This comparison is not just obscene. It is deliberate. It collapses the meaning of “terrorism” so completely that political dissent becomes extremism by definition. Resistance becomes pathology. Protest becomes “terror”. And Palestinians, once again, are framed not as a people under occupation, but as a permanent threat.</p><p>Language itself is now being criminalised. Phrases like “globalise the Intifada” are banned without any serious engagement with history or meaning. Intifada — a word that literally means “shaking off” — is torn from its political context as an uprising against military occupation and reduced to a slur. Palestinians are denied even the right to name their resistance.</p><p>At the same time, international law is being actively dismantled.</p><p>Staff and judges at the International Criminal Court are <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/us-sanctions-more-icc-judges-citing-ruling-on-israeli-war-crime-probe\">sanctioned</a> and intimidated for daring to investigate Israeli war crimes. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on Palestine, has not only been sanctioned, but also relentlessly smeared — because she uses the language of international law to describe occupation, apartheid, and genocide.</p><p>When international law is applied to African leaders, it is celebrated.<br>\nWhen it is applied to Israel, it is treated as an act of hostility.</p><p>This brings us to Australia — and to one of the most revealing moments of all.</p><p>After the horrific Bondi Beach attack, which shocked and horrified people across Australia, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Australian government of encouraging anti-Semitism. Not because of any incitement, not because of inflammatory rhetoric — but because Australia had moved towards recognising Palestine as a state.</p><p>Read that again.</p><p>The diplomatic recognition of Palestinian statehood — long framed as essential to peace and grounded in international law — is presented as a moral failing, even as a contributor to anti-Semitic violence. Palestinian existence itself is treated as the problem.</p><p>What makes this moment so disturbing is not only that Netanyahu made this claim, but that so many centres of power ran with it rather than challenged it.</p><p>Instead of forcefully rejecting the idea that recognising Palestinian rights could “encourage anti-Semitism”, governments, institutions, and commentators allowed the premise to stand. Some echoed it outright. Others stayed silent. Almost none confronted the dangerous logic at its core: that Palestinian political recognition is inherently destabilising, provocative, or threatening.</p><p>This is how moral collapse happens — not with thunder, but with acquiescence.</p><p>The result is not safety for the Jewish people, but erasure of the Palestinian people.</p><p>As a Palestinian, I find it devastating.</p><p>It means my identity is not merely contested — it is criminalised. My grief is not simply ignored — it is politicised. My demand for justice is not debated — it is pathologised as hatred.</p><p>Anti-Semitism is real. It must be confronted seriously and without hesitation. The Jewish people deserve safety, dignity, and protection — everywhere. But when anti-Semitism is stretched to include children’s educators, UN experts, international judges, protest movements, chants, words, and even the diplomatic recognition of Palestine, then the term no longer serves to protect Jewish people.</p><p>It protects a state from accountability.</p><p>Worse still, this weaponisation endangers Jews by collapsing Jewish identity into the actions of a government committing mass atrocities. It tells the world that Israel speaks for all Jews — and that anyone who objects must therefore be hostile to Jews themselves. That is not protection. It is recklessness masquerading as morality.</p><p>For Palestinians like me, the psychological toll is immense.</p><p>I am tired of having to preface every sentence with disclaimers.</p><p>I am deeply pained by watching my people starve while being lectured about tone.</p><p>I am angry that international law seems to apply only in certain politically convenient cases.</p><p>And I am grieving — not just for Gaza, but for the moral collapse unfolding around it.</p><p>Opposing genocide is not anti-Semitism.</p><p>Solidarity is not “terrorism”.</p><p>Recognising Palestine is not incitement.</p><p>Naming your suffering is not violence.</p><p>If the world insists on calling me an anti-Semite for refusing to accept the annihilation of my people, then it is not anti-Semitism that is being countered.</p><p>It is genocide that is being justified.</p><p>And history will remember who helped make that possible.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
