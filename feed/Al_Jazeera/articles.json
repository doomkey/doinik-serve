But its breakout star, Chase Infiniti, who played the hard-nosed daughter to Leonardo DiCaprio’s stoner dad, was snubbed in the Best Actress category.</p><p>But hers was not the only name absent from the tight race for the top female acting trophy. The category’s 2013 winner, Jennifer Lawrence, was passed over for her much-lauded work in the drama Die My Love, as was Amanda Seyfried, who was a contender for the historical musical The Testament of Ann Lee.</p><p>One surprise, however, came in the form of a Best Actress nod for Kate Hudson, whose last nomination was for 2001’s musical drama Almost Famous. This time, she was recognised for her work in Song Sung Blue, another musically charged film where she plays one half of a Neil Diamond cover band.</p><p>The competition was no less fierce in the male acting categories, with notable snubs including Paul Mescal, who played William Shakespeare in the historical heartwrencher Hamnet.</p><p>The musical Wicked: For Good, the sequel to last year’s 10-time Oscar nominee, was also completely shut out this year, amid middling reviews.</p><p>But where some performances were overlooked, others were embraced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which holds the Oscars each year. And nowhere was that more apparent than with the accolades showered on Sinners.</p><p>Actors Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo, both passed over at the Golden Globes, scored acting nods alongside their Sinners costar Michael B Jordan.

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_69723dec2de8-1769094636.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"262\" data-end=\"625\">On January 20, a court in Brussels, Belgium, convened a procedural hearing in the long-running case concerning the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The hearing did not revisit the full history of the killing, but was limited to determining whether the case should proceed under Belgian law.</p><p data-start=\"627\" data-end=\"1135\">At the centre of the proceedings stands Etienne Davignon, a 93-year-old former Belgian diplomat and senior state official. Federal prosecutors are seeking to prosecute Davignon on charges linked to Lumumba’s unlawful detention and degrading treatment in the months preceding his execution, allegations he denies. The case follows Belgium’s acknowledgement of moral responsibility for Lumumba’s death, and represents an incomplete, belated attempt to reckon with colonial violence through legal means.</p><p data-start=\"1137\" data-end=\"1568\">That such a reckoning is taking place at all, however limited, raises a more uncomfortable question. While a former colonial power is revisiting aspects of its role in Lumumba’s killing, much of postcolonial Africa is still failing to confront the political vision for which he was eliminated. Lumumba’s assassination is mourned, but his analysis is rarely taken seriously. His name is invoked, but his demands are quietly set aside.</p><p data-start=\"1570\" data-end=\"1898\">Lumumba is often remembered as an anti-colonial martyr and periodically rediscovered across Africa, but the substance of his political thought is rarely engaged. The questions he raised at the moment of independence, about sovereignty, land and the limits of political freedom in postcolonial Africa, remain largely unresolved.</p><p data-start=\"1900\" data-end=\"1931\">That neglect is not accidental.</p><p data-start=\"1933\" data-end=\"2407\">Many post-colonial African leaders have not honoured Lumumba’s legacy precisely because of the radical clarity of his critique, and what it would demand of those in power today, including governing coalitions that have learned to profit from the systems he sought to dismantle. To understand why his ideas still unsettle so many in Africa and abroad, it is necessary to return to the speech that announced his politics publicly, and to the reactions it provoked at the time.</p><p data-start=\"2409\" data-end=\"2799\">On June 30, 1960, at the Palais de la Nation in Leopoldville, now Kinshasa, Lumumba addressed the official independence ceremony in the presence of Belgium’s King Baudouin. The speech has since been recognised as one of the most consequential political interventions of Africa’s decolonisation era. At the time, however, it was treated by much of the Western press as an act of provocation.</p><p data-start=\"2801\" data-end=\"3502\">Writing the next day in The New York Times, foreign correspondent Harry Gilroy described Lumumba’s address as “militant” and claimed it had “marred” an occasion meant to celebrate independence in a spirit of colonial goodwill. Gilroy contrasted Lumumba unfavourably with a conciliatory address by President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, observed that “the Soviet diplomats present seemed to be enjoying the occasion”, and framed the moment through a Cold War lens that cast Lumumba as erratic and ideologically suspect. This framing was not incidental, but part of a broader Western media reflex that treated uncompromising anti-colonial speech as a threat to order rather than an assertion of political agency.</p><p data-start=\"3504\" data-end=\"3893\">A special report by The Guardian on July 1, 1960, was equally revealing, if more detailed. The British paper described Lumumba’s speech as “pugnacious” and disruptive to royal dignity. Much attention was paid to etiquette, to the king’s discomfort, to the delay in the official programme and to the supposed embarrassment caused to Belgium on what was meant to be a ceremonial handover.</p><p data-start=\"3895\" data-end=\"4151\">According to contemporaneous reporting, Baudouin nearly abandoned the independence ceremony altogether as officials scrambled to contain the fallout. What went largely unexamined in the West was the accuracy of Lumumba’s account and how it came into being.</p><p data-start=\"4153\" data-end=\"4380\">Lumumba revised and expanded his remarks while seated inside the Palais de la Nation, after listening to Baudouin’s address, and without having been scheduled to speak at all. His address was not part of the official programme.</p><p data-start=\"4382\" data-end=\"4400\">It was a response.</p><p data-start=\"4402\" data-end=\"4906\">The gulf between the king’s self-congratulatory narrative and Lumumba’s prophetic speech could not have been clearer. Baudouin praised the “genius” of King Leopold II, under whose personal rule an estimated 10 million or so Congolese died through forced labour, violence and famine in the pursuit of rubber and ivory. He spoke of Belgium’s so-called civilising mission and presented independence as benevolent stewardship, without acknowledging the racial terror, dispossession or mass death it caused.</p><p data-start=\"4908\" data-end=\"4947\">Lumumba rejected that framing outright.</p><p data-start=\"4949\" data-end=\"5421\">“We have known ironies, insults and blows,” he said, speaking of a system that reduced Africans to subjects rather than citizens. He described land seized through racially discriminatory laws, political prisoners exiled within their own country and forced labour paid at wages that could not sustain human life. Independence, he insisted, was not a gift but the outcome of struggle, and it would be meaningless without dignity, equality and control over national wealth.</p><p data-start=\"5423\" data-end=\"5891\">What unsettled Western observers was not that Lumumba was inaccurate. It was that he spoke plainly, in public, and in the presence of European power. Colonial self-vindication was acceptable. Anti-colonial truth-telling was not. Lumumba paid with his life for naming realities that others would later learn to manage, soften and profit from. The fixation on his tone, timing and supposed militancy functioned as an early delegitimisation of African political agency.</p><p data-start=\"5893\" data-end=\"5941\">History would prove Lumumba’s diagnosis correct.</p><p data-start=\"5943\" data-end=\"6054\">One of the central demands of his speech was that “the lands of our native country truly benefit its children”.</p><p data-start=\"6056\" data-end=\"6112\">More than six decades later, the contradiction persists.</p><p data-start=\"6114\" data-end=\"6668\">The DRC holds some of the world’s most strategic mineral reserves, including those essential to global energy transitions. Yet around three-quarters of the population lives in poverty, while mining revenues are dominated by foreign corporations. In the DRC, World Bank-backed reforms and liberalisation programmes, particularly from the 1980s onwards and formalised in the early 2000s, dismantled state control over mining, driving privatisation that returned cobalt and copper to foreign companies and weakened national control over strategic resources.</p><p data-start=\"6670\" data-end=\"6794\">Resource extraction has continued alongside displacement, conflict, and environmental degradation, particularly in the east.</p><p data-start=\"6796\" data-end=\"6834\">The same pattern is visible elsewhere.</p><p data-start=\"6836\" data-end=\"7216\">In Nigeria, crude oil exports have generated hundreds of billions of dollars since the 1970s, yet more than 133 million Nigerians live in multidimensional poverty. Different national contexts, similar outcomes: political independence without economic sovereignty. Communities in the Niger Delta endure chronic pollution, underdevelopment and violence, while wealth flows outward.</p><p data-start=\"7218\" data-end=\"7267\">Lumumba also spoke directly to political freedom.</p><p data-start=\"7269\" data-end=\"7461\">He pledged to “stop the persecution of free thought” and to ensure that “all citizens enjoy to the fullest extent the basic freedoms provided for by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights”.</p><p data-start=\"7463\" data-end=\"7501\">This, too, was not lofty speechmaking.</p><p data-start=\"7503\" data-end=\"7520\">It was a warning.</p><p data-start=\"7522\" data-end=\"7723\">Across the continent, elementary democratic commitments have been repeatedly broken through violence, repression and deeply compromised electoral processes, including in Uganda, Tanzania and Eritrea.</p><p data-start=\"7725\" data-end=\"7951\">Militarisation has become a default mode of politics, with wars, coups and power struggles now recurrent features across the continent, from protracted conflicts in the Horn of Africa to repeated military takeovers elsewhere.</p><p data-start=\"7953\" data-end=\"8117\">Lumumba cautioned explicitly against rule by force in Africa. “We shall institute in the country a peace resting not on guns and bayonets,” he said, “but on concord and goodwill.”</p><p data-start=\"8119\" data-end=\"8159\">That vision has been steadily abandoned.</p><p data-start=\"8161\" data-end=\"8206\">Africa is independent in form, not substance.</p><p data-start=\"8208\" data-end=\"8283\">Corruption, repression and neocolonial systems continue to hollow it out.</p><p data-start=\"8285\" data-end=\"8686\">The African Union estimates that Africa loses around $89bn annually through illicit financial flows, while CFA franc controls and debt conditionalities continue to impede socioeconomic progress. Courts can examine individual acts, but history judges systems, and the systems Lumumba warned against remain firmly in place. That is why the case unfolding in Belgium matters beyond its legal scope.</p><p data-start=\"8688\" data-end=\"8850\">The Belgian courtroom process revisits the mechanics of Lumumba’s death, but it cannot resolve the deeper historical and political injury his killing represented.</p><p data-start=\"8852\" data-end=\"9014\">Lumumba’s family, the DRC, and the continent are owed full accountability for his assassination, just as Africans deserve reparations for slavery and colonialism.</p><p data-start=\"9016\" data-end=\"9096\">However, justice for the past is inseparable from responsibility in the present.</p><p data-start=\"9098\" data-end=\"9150\">His legacy requires more than statues and memorials.</p><p data-start=\"9152\" data-end=\"9311\">Continued failure to meet the standard Lumumba articulated has produced not stability or dignity, but extraction, inequality and recurring cycles of violence.</p><p data-start=\"9313\" data-end=\"9386\">That remains the unfinished business of Patrice Lumumba’s life and death.</p><p data-start=\"9313\" data-end=\"9386\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Netanyahu faces an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) over alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territory.</p><p>But many analysts believe there’s a thought-out strategy behind what on the surface appear to have been shifting Israeli positions.</p><p>Just days before he <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">accepted a seat</a> on the multi-national board, Netanyahu raised opposition to the Gaza “executive board”, saying its composition “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy”.</p><p>Members of the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/who-is-part-of-trumps-board-of-peace-for-gaza\">US-led board</a>, including representatives of nations friendly to Israel, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, “will oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza’s stabilization and long-term success”, the White House has said, including “governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilization”.</p><p>But at the same time that Netanyahu prepares to sit alongside them on the board, the Israeli army is simultaneously blocking entry to the enclave by the very people tasked with rebuilding it.</p><p>According to analysts, the Israeli government’s decision to join may, therefore, be a calculated strategy to sabotage future efforts for governance of Gaza.</p><p>While all members of the board will be able vote on decisions, Trump, as chairman, will be able to veto them – and could well be drawn into “negotiations” on these decisions by Israel.</p><p>“Israel does not have a veto,” Rami Khouri, a fellow at the American University of Beirut, told Al Jazeera, but added: “Trump has clearly shown that he will make deals … Israel will object, and then ultimately come around to making the deal, as just happened with the Board of Peace.”</p><p>“While Trump is transactional and eager to close the file to focus on Iran, Netanyahu is a ‘long-term Zionist planner’ intent on buying time,” Khouri said.</p><p>Israel has already objected to Trump’s inclusion of Turkiye and Qatar on the board, calling this a “red line”, according to Israeli media reports.</p><p>Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid reportedly told Netanyahu in the Knesset that Trump had announced the board “without your knowledge”. He accused the prime minister of weakness, saying: “The hosts of Hamas in Istanbul and Doha … have been invited to manage Gaza.”</p><p>Netanyahu responded that “there will be no Turkish or Qatari soldiers in Gaza”, acknowledging a “disagreement” with Washington regarding the advisory council.</p><h2 id=\"a-strategy-of-disruption\">A strategy of ‘disruption’</h2><p>While the diplomatic row has so far focused on members of the board, the real deadlock is operational, analysts say.</p><p>Haaretz <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2026-01-20/ty-article/.premium/0000019b-d802-dd98-a7df-fc72a3390000\">reported</a> on Tuesday that Israel is refusing to allow the Palestinian National Committee for the Administration of Gaza – a 15-person committee of politically independent Palestinian experts tasked with rebuilding and overseen by the Board of Peace – to enter the Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing. These “technocrats” had been scheduled to take over civil administration of the Strip this week.</p><p>On the surface, therefore, there are differences of opinion between the US and Israel over Gaza and phase two of the ceasefire agreement, which this committee is part of. But analysts say that despite the rhetoric, there is no real rupture between the allies.</p><p>“I do not call it a clash, but a divergence,” Mohannad Mustafa, an expert on Israeli affairs, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Netanyahu cannot say ‘no’ to Trump directly, so Israel will use tools to disrupt the work of the committee … restricting their movement and keeping the Rafah crossing closed.”</p><p>Ultimately, Israel’s goal is to decouple the second “humanitarian phase” of the ceasefire agreement from the first “withdrawal phase”.</p><p>“Israel will tell everyone: continue with your committees, but we will not withdraw,” Mustafa predicted. “They are currently expanding control over 55 to 60 percent of the Gaza Strip.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4021265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4021265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4021265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/INTERACTIVE-Gaza-map-Israels-withdrawal-in-Trumps-20-point-plan-yellow-line-map-1760017243.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Gaza map Israel’s withdrawal in Trump’s 20-point plan yellow line map-1760017243\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4021265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"reconstruction-vs-security-the-high-rise-threat\">Reconstruction vs security: The ‘high-rise’ threat</h2><p>While the rebuilding of Gaza is high on the agenda for the peace plan in Gaza, the Israeli military is already raising the alarm over it.</p><p>Haaretz <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2026-01-18/ty-article/.premium/0000019b-d1b5-d54e-a3db-f7b7babc0000\">reported</a> that Israeli military officials are worried about the physical reconstruction plans, specifically the proposed “high-rise towers” in a new Gaza. They argue these buildings would overlook southern Israeli settlements and military bases, and say this is “unacceptable”.</p><p>By citing such security threats, Israel effectively freezes reconstruction before it can begin, by demanding a separate demilitarisation process that no international body is willing or able to enforce.</p><p>This demonstrates the “absurdity of the US vision clashing with Israeli reality”, Mustafa said.</p><p>“Imagine building residential clusters in an area that Israel still controls militarily. The committee might start managing the areas … but with Israeli security clearance.”</p><h2 id=\"a-pattern-of-compliance-for-compensation\">A pattern of compliance for compensation</h2><p>Khouri argues that this game of “brinkmanship” which Israel appears to be playing is a historical pattern dating back 75 years, whereby it concedes to US demands only after extracting a great deal of compensation.</p><p>“It will try to extract, in return, guarantees,” Khouri said, citing the withdrawals from Sinai in 1979 and Lebanon in 2000 as precedents. “It did what the US wanted … but it got guarantees of unprecedented levels of aid, support at the UN, and strategic defence collaborations.”</p><p>By creating a crisis over the inclusion of Turkiye and Qatar – or over the building of high-rise apartment blocks – Netanyahu is likely positioning himself to demand new security guarantees – or perhaps access to advanced weaponry – in exchange for allowing the Board of Peace to function.</p><h2 id=\"a-domestic-pressure-cooker\">A domestic pressure cooker</h2><p>Netanyahu is not just negotiating with Trump, however; he is also fighting for political survival at home.</p><p>A recent Channel 13 poll revealed that 53 percent of Israelis view the Turkish-Qatari involvement in the Board of Peace as an “Israeli failure”. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich rebuked the US plan and <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/19/smotrich-says-trumps-plan-for-gaza-is-bad-for?traffic_source=rss\">called</a> it ”a bad plan for Israel”.</p><p>According to the Israeli newspaper Ma’ariv, Smotrich also claimed countries like the UK and Egypt are hostile to Israel’s security. Smotrich has continued to demand military rule over Gaza and the “voluntary migration” of its population instead of Israel’s withdrawal.</p><p>“Netanyahu is in a political whirlwind,” Mustafa said. “He is being squeezed by the opposition, the settlers who want to return to Gaza, and the Americans.”</p><h2 id=\"the-election-clock-is-ticking\">The election clock is ticking</h2><p>The final variable is the Israeli electoral calendar, with elections likely in October 2026.</p><p>“If Israel withdraws from Gaza without Hamas being disarmed, this will be considered a failure,” Mustafa said. “Netanyahu will prefer his personal electoral interest over pleasing Trump.”</p><p>While the disarmament of Hamas is part of the ceasefire agreement with Israel, no formal agreement on when this will happen has been reached yet, despite Trump’s increasing displeasure. Last week, he said he would push for the “comprehensive” demilitarisation of Hamas, and, in a social media post, wrote: “As I have said before, they can do this the easy way, or the hard way.”</p><p>However, the bottom line, according to Khouri, is that while US public opinion is shifting further to horror at the genocide in Gaza, forcing Washington to take heed, Israel is terrified of losing “sole security control” of the Strip.</p><p>“They are afraid of the same thing happening in Gaza that happened in Lebanon,” Khouri concluded. “Because then the same thing might happen in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. So they will use all the different methods they’ve used for 100 years to stall.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Houston Texans team did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While most professional sport leagues in the world attempt to present themselves as <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/6/infantinos-peace-prize-to-trump-raises-questions-about-fifas-neutrality\">politically neutral</a>, critics say athletes who speak out for Palestinian rights in the US and the West are especially scorned and punished.</p><p>In 2023, the NFL teams held pre-game moments of silence in honour of Israelis killed during Hamas’s October 7 attack – a gesture that ignored the suffering in Gaza as the <a href=\"/video/between-us/2023/10/13/gaza-under-attack-2\">Palestinian death toll</a> from the horrific Israeli response was mounting.</p><p>Some teams also released individual statements in support of Israel at that time.</p><p>Several NFL team owners are outspoken supporters of Israel – most notably the New England Patriots’ Robert Kraft, a major donor for <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/centrist-us-democrat-says-he-returned-aipac-donations-cites-netanyahu-ties\">pro-Israel groups</a>, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).</p><p>The NFL emerged as a flashpoint in 2016 after San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the US national anthem to protest racism and police brutality in the US.</p><p>Critics of the move accused Kaepernick of disrespecting national symbols and called on the league to intervene. But the player’s supporters praised him for his willingness to stand up to injustice despite potential repercussions for his career.</p><p>Kaepernick was not signed by any team after he became a free agent at the end of that season.</p><p>With Kaepernick out, other players continued his kneeling protest.</p><p>In 2018, the NFL issued a policy requiring players to stand during the anthem or stay in the locker room after mounting criticism and calls for a boycott by President <a href=\"/video/2018/8/11/nfl-anthem-protests-trump-wants-players-suspended\">Donald Trump</a> and his allies.</p><h2 id=\"unspoken-expectation\">‘Unspoken expectation’</h2><p>The NFL does allow limited advocacy through the “My Cause My Cleats” campaign – an initiative that lets players display messages on their boots.</p><p>Al-Shaair has used the programme to raise donations for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF) with shoes featuring the word “free” and data about the atrocities in Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But his recent nose tape message has elevated his activism at a time when Palestinians in Gaza continue to suffer from near-daily <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/new-storm-to-hit-gaza-piling-on-suffering-for-thousands-of-displaced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Israeli attacks</a> in the bitter cold amid a lack of shelters despite the Trump-brokered “ceasefire”.</p><p>Riaz said Muslim athletes face “heightened consequences” for speaking out <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/three-journalists-among-11-palestinians-killed-in-israels-attacks-on-gaza\">for Palestine</a>, so there is an “unspoken expectation” for them to remain silent on the issue.</p><p>She added that Muslim Americans in Texas and beyond are responding positively to Al-Shaair’s message and trying to reach out to him for speaking engagements. “The community is loving it,” Riaz told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Houston chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) said the NFL should not fine a player for rejecting genocide.</p><p>“Azeez Al-Shaair’s message was rooted in basic human decency and concern for innocent lives.

Both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the island is not for sale.</p><p>In a bid to defuse rising transatlantic tensions, Rutte met with Trump in Davos, Switzerland, during the annual summit of the World Economic Forum. During his speech at Davos on Wednesday, Trump reiterated that he wants to acquire Greenland, but <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trump-rules-out-using-force-to-take-over-greenland-calls-for-negotiations\">ruled out</a> taking the Arctic island <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/i-wont-use-force-for-greenland-key-takeaways-from-trumps-davos-speech\">by force</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, Rutte told reporters that NATO countries would <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/trumps-greenland-pact-will-demand-allies-boost-arctic-security-nato-chief\">ramp up security</a> in the Arctic as part of the agreement.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-about-the-framework-for-a-future-deal\">What has Trump said about the ‘framework’ for a future deal?</h2><p>In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said that following a “very productive” meeting with Rutte, he had formed the “framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region”.</p><p>Trump added that, under this deal, he would <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trump-nixes-european-tariff-threats-over-greenland-after-nato-chief-talks\">not impose tariffs</a> on the eight European countries that have opposed his attempt to acquire Greenland.</p><p>He added that additional discussions are being held about “The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland”.</p><p>The Golden Dome is Washington’s proposed multilayered missile defence programme, which is designed to counter aerial threats. Trump announced the project in May 2025. Under it, the US will deploy missile interceptors in space to shield against ballistic and hypersonic threats. The project is set to be completed by the end of Trump’s term in 2029.</p><p>In his post, Trump said more information about the framework would be made public as negotiations progress. These talks, he said, would be led by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff on the US side.</p><p>“We have a concept of a deal,” Trump told CNBC later on Wednesday.</p><p>But he offered no further details about what these negotiations, such as dates or venues for upcoming talks – would involve, nor specifics on who from Europe would join.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-us-at-odds-with-europe-over-greenland\">Why is the US at odds with Europe over Greenland?</h2><p>On January 17, Trump announced that from February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would be charged a 10 percent tariff on their exports to the US.</p><p>On June 1, the tariff was to be increased to 25 percent, he said. “This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>One day after he made this threat, the 27 members of the European Union convened for an emergency meeting to discuss their options. While many wanted to try to resolve the dispute via diplomatic efforts, some called for the implementation of a never-before-used <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/trumps-greenland-tariffs-whats-europes-bazooka-option-to-hit-back\">“bazooka” package</a> of retaliatory tariffs and trade restrictions. However, this could take up to a year to fully implement.</p><p>But following his meeting with Rutte on Wednesday, Trump withdrew his threat of tariffs and said a “framework for a future deal” had been reached.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-trump-want-greenland\">Why does Trump want Greenland?</h2><p>Trump, and US presidents before him, have coveted Greenland for its <a href=\"/news/2025/1/9/behind-trumps-threat-why-is-greenland-so-strategically-important\">strategic position</a>.</p><p>The sparsely populated Arctic island of 56,000 people – mostly Indigenous Inuit – is geographically in North America but politically part of Denmark, making it part of Europe.</p><p>Greenland’s geographical position between the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans provides the shortest air and sea routes between North America and Europe, making it crucial for US military operations and early-warning systems, especially around the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap, according to the Trump administration.</p><p>Greenland also has plentiful deposits of minerals, including large amounts of untapped rare earth metals, which are required for the production of technology ranging from smartphones to fighter jets. With global warming, more shipping routes around Greenland are opening up as the ice melts, making it of greater interest to many nations.</p><h2 id=\"did-the-us-ever-own-greenland\">Did the US ever own Greenland?</h2><p>During his speech in Davos on Wednesday, Trump said: “After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it. But we gave it back.”</p><p>The US occupied Greenland in 1941 following Nazi Germany’s invasion of Denmark during World War II. It established a military and radio presence on the island, withdrawing following the end of the war. However, US forces have maintained a permanent presence at Pituffik Space Base, previously known as the Thule Air Base, in Greenland’s northwest ever since.</p><p>Denmark and the US reached an agreement in 1951, which allows the US to maintain military facilities in Greenland as part of mutual defence within the NATO framework.</p><p>Despite its presence on the island during World War II, the US never actually possessed the territory and its 1951 agreement with Denmark did not pass sovereignty of Greenland to the US.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-framework-of-trump-s-future-deal\">What do we know about the framework of Trump’s future deal?</h2><p>Specific details of the “framework” are unknown.</p><p>But Trump has described it as a pathway towards a “long-term deal”.</p><p>And he has specified some elements of what he expects from that deal. “It puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals,” Trump told reporters.</p><p>“It’s a deal that’s forever.”</p><p>On Thursday, Rutte told Reuters that will demand NATO countries ramp up Arctic security swiftly, as part of the security element of the agreement.</p><p>“We will come together in NATO with our senior commanders to work out what is necessary,” Rutte said.</p><p>“I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly, I would hope for 2026; I hope even early in 2026.”</p><p>But experts say not much else about the framework is known.</p><p>“We still don’t know what ‘framework’ actually means: is it political signalling, or does it contain concrete commitments, timelines and legal hooks? We also don’t know who the real parties are [US-Denmark only, or US-Denmark-Greenland] and what Greenland has formally endorsed,” Christine Nissen, the chief analyst at the Copenhagen-based Think Tank Europa, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>It is unclear whether Greenland has agreed to the framework of any deal or whether Greenlandic or Danish authorities were even consulted.</p><p>“There can’t be a deal without having Greenland as part of the negotiations,” Sascha Faxe, a member of the Danish parliament, told Sky News on Wednesday.</p><p>“We have a Greenlandic MP in Denmark and she’s very clear that this is not a prerogative of Rutte and NATO,” Faxe said, referring to Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, who represents one of the two parliamentary seats for Greenland in the Danish parliament.</p><p>She added: “They are very clear – Greenland is not for sale, they are not for negotiations – so it’s not real negotiations, it’s two men who have had a conversation.”</p><p>On Wednesday night, Larsen wrote in Danish in a Facebook post: “NATO in no way has the right to negotiate anything on its own about us from Greenland while bypassing us. Nothing about us, without us.”</p><p>In an X post on Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen wrote: “The day is ending on a better note than it began,” welcoming Trump’s ruling out the European tariffs and taking Greenland by force. “Now, let’s sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the [Kingdom of Denmark].”</p><p>It is also not clear which other European leaders are on board with the deal. EU leaders are convening in Brussels on Thursday for emergency talks over the matter.</p><p>In an X post on Wednesday, Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni welcomed Trump’s decision to not charge tariffs on European countries. “As Italy has always maintained, it is essential to continue fostering dialogue between allied nations,” she wrote, without specifying details about Greenland or the deal.</p><p>If Washington ends up owning parts of Greenland as American overseas territory, it is not clear whether Denmark will hand over the land or whether the land will be purchased at a price. It is also not known what this hypothetical price would look like.</p><h2 id=\"what-natural-resources-does-greenland-have\">What natural resources does Greenland have?</h2><p>Greenland is incredibly rich in minerals, including rare earth minerals used in the manufacture of batteries and high-tech industries crucial for defence. According to a 2023 survey, 25 of 34 minerals deemed “critical raw materials” by the European Commission were found in Greenland.</p><p>Greenland does not carry out the extraction of oil and gas, and its mining sector is opposed by its Indigenous population. The island’s economy is largely reliant on its fishing industry.</p><p>However, during his speech at Davos, Trump said that it was national security, and not minerals, that made it imperative for him to own Greenland.</p><p>“To get to this rare earth, you got to go through hundreds of feet of ice. That’s not the reason we need it. We need it for strategic national security and international security,” Trump said.</p><p>Referring to Trump during an interview with Fox News’s Special Report with Bret Baier on Wednesday, Rutte said: “He is very much focused on what do we need to do to make sure that that huge Arctic region – where change is taking place at the moment, where the Chinese and the Russians are more and more active – how we can protect it.”</p><p>Amid global warming, the vast untapped resources of the Arctic are becoming more accessible. Countries like the US, Canada, China and Russia are now eyeing these resources.</p><p>Russia and China have been <a href=\"/news/2024/7/23/us-wary-of-china-russia-cooperation-in-increasingly-strategic-arctic\">working together</a> to develop Arctic shipping routes as Moscow seeks to deliver more oil and gas to China amid Western sanctions, while <a href=\"/program/101-east/2022/3/3/behind-chinas-rise-in-the-arctic\">Beijing seeks an alternative shipping route</a> to reduce its dependence on the Strait of Malacca.</p><p>“Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold – economically or militarily – in Greenland,” Reuters news agency reported, citing an unnamed NATO source.</p><p>On Wednesday, Russian news agencies quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin as saying: “What happens in Greenland is of absolutely no consequence to us.”</p><h2 id=\"what-about-the-ownership-of-greenland\">What about the ownership of Greenland?</h2><p>On Wednesday, Rutte said during the interview that the issue of whether Greenland will remain Danish territory did not come up during his discussion with Trump.</p><p>When Rutte was asked whether Greenland would remain under the Kingdom of Denmark, he responded: “That issue did not come up any more in my conversations tonight with the president.”</p><p>Trump has previously said that Washington needs to own Greenland, rather than lease it.</p><p>“You defend ownership. You don’t defend leases. And we’ll have to defend Greenland. If we don’t do it, China or Russia will,” Trump told reporters at the White House on January 9.</p><p>During his speech at Davos, Trump reiterated that he wants Washington to own Greenland, despite the US military presence there under the 1951 agreement.</p><p>Nissen, of Think Tank Europa, explained that this agreement already grants the US very extensive operational rights in Greenland pertaining to construction, movement and logistics. But, she added, the arrangement is not territorial, and sovereignty sits with Denmark and Greenland’s self-government.</p><p>“The US cannot exercise civil authority, change laws, control borders as a state, or transfer the territory. So Denmark and Greenland’s hard red line is straightforward: no ‘ownership’ and no territorial transfer through a deal.”</p><p>On Wednesday, The New York Times, however, cited three unnamed senior officials involved in the latest Greenland talks, reporting on the possibility that the framework could involve conversations over giving Washington sovereign control over small pockets of Greenland for military bases.</p><p>In theory, these pockets would be similar to the concept of the <a href=\"/news/2024/1/15/uk-bases-in-cyprus-protests\">UK’s bases in Cyprus</a>, which are regarded as British territory, one of the officials told The Times, while another confirmed this.</p><p>The UK has two Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) inside <a href=\"/news/2017/2/20/cyprus-an-island-divided\">Cyprus</a>, namely Akrotiri and Dhekelia. These are legally British-owned territories within Cyprus.</p><p>SBAs are purely for military use and governed almost entirely as military installations, where authority is essentially military and centralised.</p><p>“There are rumours that Trump may still imagine some form of US ownership of a very small piece of land, but Rutte has indicated that this was not substantively on the table,” Nissen said.</p><p>“If any element of the deal were to involve even a symbolic transfer of territory, that would cross a red line for Denmark, Greenland and Europe, and would set a dangerous precedent for sovereignty and the Western order.”</p><p>Nissen explained that even if there is a framework, Denmark and Greenland have legal options to constrain US ambitions for the island.</p><p>They could insist that US influence is limited to “rights of use” to territory rather than anything resembling sovereign control or exclusive jurisdiction. Essentially, she argued, they could use bureaucracy to bolster their positions.</p><p>“They can use governance tools that matter in practice: consultation clauses, joint oversight bodies, transparency requirements, clear review points and meaningful termination options – plus domestic law and permitting [land use, environment, infrastructure approvals] that can shape or slow what ambitions become on the ground.”</p><p>She explained that a likely outcome could involve strengthened US access to Greenland and an update to the 1951 defence deal — with more NATO branding, extra infrastructure and investment, and limited, targeted cooperation on minerals.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4259293\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-yRGTS-united-kingdom-14-territories-1769067236.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - yRGTS-united-kingdom-14-territories-1769067236\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"what-are-some-overseas-territories\">What are some overseas territories?</h2><p>Greenland is actually one of two Danish self-governing overseas territories, the other one being the Faroe Islands.</p><p>The Arctic island was a Danish colony in the early 18th century, after an expedition led by Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede arrived in 1721. In 1979, it became a self-governing territory. Since 2009, Greenland has the right to declare independence through a referendum.</p><p>The UK has 14 overseas territories across the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific and polar regions.</p><p>The inhabited ones, including Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar and Montserrat, are mostly self‑governing, with the UK responsible for defence and foreign affairs.</p><p>The US has five permanently inhabited territories — Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands — all with local governments but limited federal representation, and Puerto Rico is the largest as a self‑governing commonwealth.</p><p>Washington also controls nine mostly uninhabited islands used mainly for military or strategic purposes.</p><p>France has 13 overseas territories spread across the Atlantic, Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Pacific and South America. China has two Special Administrative Regions (SARs), Hong Kong and Macau, which are generally autonomous in terms of political, economic and legal systems.</p><p>Australia, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand and Portugal also have overseas territories in different parts of the world with different arrangements for self-government.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But essentially it’s total access,” Trump told the US network, claiming the access was permanent. “There’s no end, there’s no time limit.”</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Denmark on Trump’s remarks, which came hours after Rutte told the Reuters news agency that the framework agreement would require NATO countries to swiftly ramp up security efforts in the Arctic to ward off threats from Russia and China.</p><p>“We will come together in NATO with our senior commanders to work out what is necessary,” Rutte told Reuters.</p><p>“I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly, I would hope for 2026; I hope even early in 2026.”</p><p>In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up his threats to seize the island, citing the threat it could be acquired by China or Russia, plunging US-European relations to their lowest point in decades, and prompting fears for the survival of NATO.</p><p>But on Wednesday, the US leader unexpectedly dropped his threat to impose 10 percent tariffs on European countries opposed to his bid to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trump-rules-out-using-force-to-take-over-greenland-calls-for-negotiations\">take control of the territory</a> and ruled out the use of force to seize the island.</p><p>Trump also said there could be a deal that satisfies his desire for a “Golden Dome” missile defence programme, a $175bn system that will put US weapons in space for the first time, and access to critical minerals while blocking what he says are Russia and China’s ambitions in the Arctic. But he offered few details on the talks.</p><p>Rutte told Reuters that he was confident that non-Arctic NATO allies ‍would contribute to the effort, and that an enhanced security focus on the Arctic would not come at the expense of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.</p><p>Mineral exploitation on the resource-rich island had not been discussed in the meeting with Trump, Rutte said, adding that negotiations on the issue would ​continue between the US, Denmark and Greenland itself.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"denmark-cannot-negotiate-on-sovereignty\">Denmark ‘cannot negotiate on sovereignty’</h2><p>Prior to Trump’s comments, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement on Thursday that while issues such as security, investment and economic matters could be discussed, “we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty”.</p><p>“It is still a difficult and serious situation, but progress has also been made in the sense that we have now got things where they need to be. Namely that we can discuss how we promote common security in the Arctic region,” Frederiksen said.</p><p>Frederiksen said Arctic security was a matter for all of NATO, and that it was “good and natural” that it be discussed between Trump and Rutte.</p><p>She said that she had spoken with Rutte “on an ongoing basis”, including before and after he met Trump in Davos, and said she had “been informed” that the NATO chief’s talks with Trump had not touched on issues of sovereignty, adding that only Denmark and Greenland could make decisions on issues concerning themselves.</p><p>Frederiksen said that Denmark wanted to continue engaging in constructive dialogue with allies on strengthening security in the Arctic, including the US Golden Dome programme, “provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity”.</p><p>Asked in an interview with Fox News whether Greenland would remain part of Denmark under the framework deal Trump announced, Rutte said the issue “did not come up anymore in my conversations tonight with the president”.</p><p>“He’s very much focused on what do we need to do to make sure that huge Arctic region, where change is taking place at the moment, where the Chinese and Russians are more and more active, how we can protect it,” said Rutte.</p><p>“That was really the focus of our discussions.”</p><p>NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said on Thursday that Rutte “did not propose any compromise to sovereignty during his meeting with President Trump”.</p><p>She added that negotiations between Denmark, Greenland and the US would continue, aimed at “ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold – economically or militarily – in Greenland”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"germany-supports-talks\">Germany supports talks</h2><p>Meanwhile, German Chancellor ⁠Friedrich Merz, welcoming Trump’s U-turn on Greenland, urged Europeans not to be too quick to write off the transatlantic partnership.</p><p>“We support talks between Denmark, Greenland [and] the United States on the basis of these principles” aiming for closer cooperation, Merz said in Davos.</p><p>“It is good news that we are making steps into that right direction. I welcome President Trump’s remarks from last night – this is the right way to go.”</p><p>Merz stressed the need for European NATO countries to do more to secure the Arctic region, describing it as “a common transatlantic interest”.</p><p>“We will protect Denmark, Greenland, [and] the north from the threat posed by Russia,” he said.</p><p>“We will uphold the principles on which the transatlantic partnership is founded, namely sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><p>His comments came as EU leaders were reportedly set to discuss reviewing their ties with Washington at an emergency summit on Thursday.</p><p>Despite Trump’s sudden about-face on his tariff threats, European governments remained wary of another change of ​mind by a US president who was increasingly seen as a bully that Europe needed to stand up to, observers say.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the reactor remains “stable”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The No 6 reactor at the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/japan-to-restart-worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant-after-15-year-shutdown\">Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant</a> in north-central Japan – closed since the 2011 Fukushima disaster – reactivated on Wednesday as plant workers started removing neutron-absorbing control rods from the core to start stable nuclear fission.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">But the process had to be suspended hours later due to a malfunction related to control rods, which are essential to safely starting up and shutting down reactors, the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) said. The duration of the shutdown was still unknown.</p><p class=\"p1\">TEPCO said there was no safety issue from the glitch and it was checking the situation while suspending the restart operation. The utility later said it was putting the reactor back into shutdown for a fuller examination.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We were investigating the malfunctioning electrical equipment,” spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi told the AFP news agency.</p><p class=\"p1\">The reactor “is stable and there is no radioactive impact outside”, he said.</p><p class=\"p1\">Control rods are a device used to control the nuclear chain reaction in the reactor core, which can be accelerated by slightly withdrawing them, or slowed down or stopped completely by inserting them deeper.</p><p class=\"p1\">The restart, initially scheduled for Tuesday, had been pushed back after another technical issue related to the rods’ removal was detected last weekend – a problem that was resolved on Sunday, according to TEPCO.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.</p><p class=\"p1\">The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.</p><p class=\"p1\">Fourteen other nuclear reactors have restarted across Japan since 2011, but the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, about 220 kilometres (135 miles) northwest of Tokyo, is the first TEPCO-run unit to resume production.</p><p>The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.</p><p class=\"p1\">A restart of the No 6 reactor could generate an additional 1.35 million kilowatts of electricity, enough to power more than 1 million households in the capital region.</p><p class=\"p1\">Public opinion in Niigata is deeply divided: about 60 percent of residents oppose the restart, while 37 percent support it, according to a survey conducted in September.</p><p class=\"p1\">“It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, told AFP this week during a protest in front of the plant.</p><p class=\"p1\">Earlier this month, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority, saying that the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noting it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.</p></div></div></body></html>"
