I do not know where to go, but I hope there is some safe shelter where I can take my family,” she told the AFP news agency.</p><p>As floodwaters receded in Manampitiya, 250km (155 miles) northeast of Colombo, the scale of destruction became visible.</p><p>“Manampitiya is a flood-prone town, but I have never seen such a volume of water,” said 72-year-old resident S Sivanandan, who described extensive damage to businesses and property.</p><p>The disaster has created urgent medical needs, with blood supplies critically low. Lakshman Edirisinghe, the blood bank chief, reported receiving only 236 units on Saturday against a daily requirement of 1,500. “Because of floods and heavy rains, we were unable to conduct our mobile campaigns to collect blood,” he said, urging donors to visit blood banks.</p><p>Officials warn of continuing landslide risks as mountain slopes remain saturated with rainwater.</p><p>President Anura Kumara Dissanayake declared a state of emergency on Saturday and appealed for international assistance. India responded immediately with relief supplies and rescue helicopters, while Pakistan and Japan have also pledged support.</p><p>The cyclone has destroyed more than 25,000 homes, forcing 147,000 people into temporary shelters, with another 968,000 requiring assistance after being displaced. Military personnel are working alongside civilian responders in the huge relief effort.</p><p>This marks Sri Lanka’s deadliest natural disaster since 2017, when floods and landslides killed more than 200 people. The country’s worst flooding this century occurred in June 2003, killing 254 people.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the RSF and some of its allied militias have been mobilising troops and equipment to take more areas in central Kordofan.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">The RSF has set its sights on <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/battles-in-west-kordofan-as-sudan-army-resists-rsfs-eastward-push\">Babnusa and el-Obeid</a>, strategic cities that offer a vital military advantage as they provide a route to Khartoum and an economic edge as they are rich in agricultural, livestock and petroleum resources.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">Army soldiers celebrated their <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/sudans-army-captures-two-areas-in-north-kordofan-as-rsf-burns-more-bodies\">takeovers of Kazqil and Um Dam Haj Ahmed</a> in North Kordofan in mid-November, and have been holding on to territory in central Sudan as international stakeholders push for a ceasefire that could potentially freeze battle lines.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"humanitarian-crisis\" class=\"s3\">Humanitarian crisis</h2><ul>\n<li class=\"s5\">Witnesses and international aid agencies working on the ground in Darfur recounted widespread horrific instances of atrocities committed by the RSF in the aftermath of its bloody takeover of el-Fasher. Evidence shows RSF militias engaged in mass killings, rape of women and girls, and taking hostages for ransom.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">Thousands of people remain missing after fleeing el-Fasher for surrounding areas like Tawila. Thousands more Sudanese civilians were forced to run to neighbouring Chad, where the humanitarian situation is faring no better, and agencies are working to assist people <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/un-cuts-global-aid-plan-as-funding-plummets\">amid depleting UN finances</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">Satellite images showed that the RSF systematically burned and buried a large number of bodies in mass graves across multiple areas of el-Fasher to hide what a Sudanese nongovernmental medical organisation called a “genocide”.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, in early November confirmed that famine had been detected not only in el-Fasher, but also in Kadugli, located in South Kordofan. The United Nations-backed global hunger monitor said 20 other areas in Darfur and Kordofan were also at serious risk of sliding into famine conditions as most aid remains blocked.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">Amy Pope, director general of the UN’s International Organization for Migration, said Sudan has the world’s largest displacement crisis and that it does not get the attention it deserves despite mostly affecting children and women. Nearly 14 million people are displaced internally or forced to flee to impoverished neighbouring countries.</li>\n</ul><figure id=\"attachment_4140706\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4140706\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4140706\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/reuters_692c0563-1764492643.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C559&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mabroka Adam, 7 a Sudanese refugee girl from al-Fashir, poses inside her family tent at the Tine transit refugee camp in eastern Chad, November 22, 2025.

The fighting continues on the ground, even as the RSF has claimed to accept the proposal and the SAF has refused it.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">The RSF announced on November 6 that it had accepted the proposal from the mediators, and its commanding general, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti, released a video message on November 26 to claim his paramilitary force is committed to an apparently unilateral <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/rsf-announces-unilateral-three-month-humanitarian-truce-in-sudan\">three-month “humanitarian truce”</a>. But the RSF attacks did not cease in November.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">The RSF commander’s announcement came a day after army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan told senior commanders in an address released by his office that he categorically rejects the Quad proposal. Al-Burhan said the proposal heavily undermines the armed forces, dissolves security agencies, and maintains the RSF in its positions.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">The army commander also <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/sudan-army-chief-rejects-truce-proposal-citing-uae-role\">singled out the UAE</a> and said the Quad lacks credibility as “the entire world has witnessed the UAE’s support for rebels against the Sudanese state”. Abu Dhabi, the largest importer of gold from Sudan, continues to deny arming and funding the RSF.</li>\n<li class=\"s5\">US President Donald Trump pledged “cooperation and coordination” to end Sudan’s war after an appeal by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a White House visit. Trump’s senior adviser on Arab and African affairs, Massad Boulos, held a joint news conference in Abu Dhabi with Anwar Gargash, the diplomatic adviser to the UAE’s president, to push the truce proposal.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

We are still so far from justice or accountability,” one protester told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We, the people, know that this [Israel’s war] is wrong. But why do the people in power not feel that this is wrong?” asked another protester.</p><p>Anne Tuaillon, head of the France Palestine Solidarity Association (AFPS), one of about 80 non-government organisations, unions and parties behind the call to protest, said that “nothing has been resolved” seven weeks after a ceasefire took effect on October 10.</p><p>“The ceasefire is a smokescreen. Israel violates it every day, blocks humanitarian aid and continues to destroy homes and infrastructure in Gaza. We are calling for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the genocide,” she told the AFP news agency.</p><p>Protests were also held in London, Geneva, Rome and Lisbon.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Sonia Gallego, reporting from Paris, said that for the organisers, the march represents a “sustained pressure” on Israel at a time when negotiations for a more lasting peace in the Palestinian territory remain stalled.</p><p>“This worldwide mobilisation is not just maintaining focus on Gaza, but also [on] the broader unresolved issue of Palestinian rights.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the British capital, London, organisers said that up to 100,000 joined the march demanding accountability for Israeli “crimes” against Palestinians and pleading for “protection” of those still suffering under siege despite a ceasefire.</p><p>In Italy, where mass demonstrations and union-led strikes have repeatedly mobilised against Israel’s war, the UN’s special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese, and climate activist Greta Thunberg, attended the main demonstration in the capital, Rome.</p><p>The Wanted In Rome news website, in a report ahead of the rally, said some 100,000 were expected to take part.</p><p>In a statement posted on X, Albanese said that Israel is “committing genocide against the Palestinians” not just in Gaza, but in the occupied West Bank, too.</p><p>“Look at the totality of conduct/crimes against the totality of the Palestinians in the totality of the land slated for ethnic cleansing. Israel must be stopped, and we will,” she wrote.</p><p>Under the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/24/no-there-is-no-ceasefire-in-gaza\" target=\"_self\">US-brokered ceasefire</a>, Israel has pulled back to a so-called “yellow line” inside the Gaza Strip. But it remains in control of more than half of the besieged territory, and has launched several deadly attacks in breach of the agreement.</p><p>Since the ceasefire deal, at least 500 Israeli violations have been recorded, resulting in at least 347 Palestinians being killed and 889 being injured.</p><p>Fadi and Jumaa Tamer Abu Assi were aged eight and 10, respectively.</p><p>Alaa Abu Assi, an uncle of the two boys, said they were “innocent children who have no rockets and no bombs”.</p><p>“They were gathering firewood to help their disabled father, who has platinum plates in his legs. We went and found them in pieces, and we brought them back,” he told the AFP news agency.</p><p>In a statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that “the killing of so many civilians, the repeated displacement of an entire population and the obstruction of humanitarian aid should never be acceptable”.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Gaza City, said that even as Palestinians welcome the international support, most “are simply trying to survive”.</p><p>“It’s a daily struggle,” she said. “Palestinians are suffering to get their basic necessities; they’re suffering to find shelter.”</p><p>“There are lots of Palestinians still living in tents. They’re saying that they do not have any source of shelter. There’s no medication. Their children are without any education. The Palestinians are still dying slowly, despite the fact that it is ceasefire,” she added.</p><p>On Thursday, rights group Amnesty International warned that “Israeli authorities are still <a href=\"/features/2025/11/26/stuck-in-gazas-limbo-palestinians-struggle-to-live-amid-israels-attacks\">committing genocide</a>” in Gaza, waging new attacks and curbing critical aid access, despite the declared ceasefire.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The men were stopped at the boarding gate in Johannesburg, police said, weeks after reports that 17 South African men were stuck in Ukraine after being lured into joining mercenary forces with the promise of lucrative contracts.</li>\n<li>Prosecutors in Poland have charged two Ukrainians and three Belarusians with working for a foreign intelligence service, amid heightened tensions with Russia. The prosecutor’s office did not say which country was involved, but since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Warsaw has regularly accused Moscow of attempts at sabotage and conducting “hybrid warfare”.</li>\n<li>Poland also announced that it will boost railway security in the country after the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/poland-blames-two-ukrainians-allegedly-working-for-russia-for-railway-blast\">recent sabotage it blamed on Russia</a>. Poland, a NATO and EU member, has become the main hub for transporting Western military and humanitarian support to Ukraine as it fights off an invasion launched by Russia in 2022.</li>\n</ul><h3>Censorship</h3><ul>\n<li>Russia said on Friday that it was considering banning the popular messaging service WhatsApp, accusing it of failing to prevent crime, and urged its tens of millions of users to switch to domestic alternatives. US technology giant Meta, which owns WhatsApp, said Russia was trying to ban the application because it “defies government attempts to violate people’s right to secure communication”.</li>\n</ul><h3>Human rights</h3><ul>\n<li>The group <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/russia-outlaws-human-rights-watch-crackdown-critics-ukraine-war\">Human Rights Watch (HRW)</a> promised not to stop investigating Russia or the actions of its military in Ukraine, despite Moscow declaring it an “undesirable” organisation. Tanya Lokshina, senior associate director of the group’s Europe and Central Asia division, told the AFP news agency that HRW was “not surprised” by the designation, which effectively criminalises it in Russia.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

Liverpool.</p><p>A few hours later, a spokesperson for Sultana said that she would not enter the conference hall on Saturday in protest at one of her supporters being denied entry to the event and

conference, how members were treated with contempt.”</p><p>Corbyn, 76, and Sultana, 32, both former Labour MPs, have been in frequent dispute since they announced the party in July.</p><p>A

system and Labour moves rightward on some issues.</p><p>Two of the four independent MPs who initially signed up later quit over the divisions, which have included a row over a botched membership launch and threats of legal action.</p><p>Over the course of the conference, members are set to choose the party’s official name and decide whether it should have a single leader or be led by its members.</p></div></div></body></html>"
