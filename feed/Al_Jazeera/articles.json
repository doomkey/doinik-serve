            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The catastrophic violence in Gaza has unfolded within an international system that was never designed to restrain the geopolitical ambitions of powerful states. Understanding why the United Nations has proved so limited in responding to what many regard as a genocidal assault requires returning to the foundations of the post–World War II order and examining how its structure has long enabled impunity rather than accountability.</p><p data-start=\"245\" data-end=\"1054\">After World War II, the architecture for a new international order based on respect for the UN Charter and international law was agreed upon as the normative foundation of a peaceful future. Above all, it was intended to prevent a third world war. These commitments emerged from the carnage of global conflict, the debasement of human dignity through the Nazi Holocaust, and public anxieties about nuclear weaponry.</p><p data-start=\"245\" data-end=\"1054\">Yet, the political imperative to accommodate the victorious states compromised these arrangements from the outset. Tensions over priorities for world order were papered over by granting the Security Council exclusive decisional authority and further limiting UN autonomy. Five states were made permanent members, each with veto power: the United States, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and China.</p><p data-start=\"1056\" data-end=\"1951\">In practice, this left global security largely in the hands of these states, preserving their dominance. It meant removing the strategic interests of geopolitical actors from any obligatory respect for legal constraints, with a corresponding weakening of UN capability. The Soviet Union had some justification for defending itself against a West-dominated voting majority, yet it too used the veto pragmatically and displayed a dismissive approach to international law and human rights, as did the three liberal democracies.</p><p data-start=\"1056\" data-end=\"1951\">In 1945, these governments were understood as simply retaining the traditional freedoms of manoeuvre exercised by the so-called Great Powers. The UK and France, leading NATO members in a Euro-American alliance, interpreted the future through the lens of an emerging rivalry with the Soviet Union. China, meanwhile, was preoccupied with a civil war that continued until 1949.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"3085\">Three aspects of this post-war arrangement shape our present understanding.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"3085\">First, the historical aspect: Learning from the failures of the League of Nations, where the absence of influential states undermined the organisation’s relevance to questions of war and peace. In 1945, it was deemed better to acknowledge power differentials within the UN than to construct a global body based on democratic equality among sovereign states or population size.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"3085\">Second, the ideological aspect: Political leaders of the more affluent and powerful states placed far greater trust in hard-power militarism than in soft-power legalism. Even nuclear weaponry was absorbed into the logic of deterrence rather than compliance with Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which required good-faith pursuit of disarmament. International law was set aside whenever it conflicted with geopolitical interests.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"3085\">Third, the economistic aspect: The profitability of arms races and wars reinforced a pre–World War II pattern of lawless global politics, sustained by an alliance of geopolitical realism, corporate media, and private-sector militarism.</p><h2 id=\"why-the-un-could-not-protect-gaza\">Why the UN could not protect Gaza</h2><p data-start=\"3137\" data-end=\"4011\">Against this background, it is unsurprising that the UN performed in a disappointing manner during the two-plus years of genocidal assault on Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"3137\" data-end=\"4011\">In many respects, the UN did what it was designed to do in the turmoil after October 7, and only fundamental reforms driven by the Global South and transnational civil society can alter this structural limitation. What makes these events so disturbing is the extremes of Israeli disregard for international law, the Charter, and even basic morality.</p><p data-start=\"3137\" data-end=\"4011\">At the same time, the UN did act more constructively than is often acknowledged in exposing Israel’s flagrant violations of international law and human rights. Yet, it fell short of what was legally possible, particularly when the General Assembly failed to explore its potential self-empowerment through <a href=\"https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/uniting-for-peace-and-the-role-of-the-general-assembly-in-armed-conflict/\">the Uniting for Peace resolution</a> or the <a href=\"/opinions/2023/10/31/where-is-the-responsibility-to-protect-in-gaza\">Responsibility to Protect norm</a>.</p><p data-start=\"4013\" data-end=\"4911\">Among the UN’s strongest contributions were the near-unanimous judicial outcomes at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on genocide and occupation. On genocide, the ICJ granted South Africa’s request for provisional measures concerning genocidal violence and the obstruction of humanitarian aid in Gaza. A final decision is expected after further arguments in 2026.</p><p data-start=\"4013\" data-end=\"4911\">On occupation, responding to a General Assembly request for clarification, the Court issued a historic advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, finding Israel in severe violation of its duties under international humanitarian law in administering Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. It ordered Israel’s withdrawal within a year. The General Assembly affirmed the opinion by a large majority.</p><p data-start=\"4013\" data-end=\"4911\">Israel responded by repudiating or ignoring the Court’s authority, backed by the US government’s extraordinary claim that recourse to the ICJ lacked legal merit.</p><p data-start=\"4913\" data-end=\"5489\">The UN also provided far more reliable coverage of the Gaza genocide than was available in corporate media, which tended to amplify Israeli rationalisations and suppress Palestinian perspectives. For those seeking a credible analysis of genocide allegations, the Human Rights Council offered the most convincing counter to pro-Israeli distortions. A Moon Will Arise from this Darkness: Reports on Genocide in Palestine, containing the publicly submitted reports of the special rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, documents and strongly supports the genocide findings.</p><p data-start=\"5491\" data-end=\"6286\">A further unheralded contribution came from UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, whose services were essential to a civilian population facing acute insecurity, devastation, starvation, disease, and cruel combat tactics. Some 281 staff members were killed while providing shelter, education, healthcare, and psychological support to beleaguered Palestinians during the course of Israel’s actions over the past two years.</p><p data-start=\"5491\" data-end=\"6286\">UNRWA, instead of receiving deserved praise, was irresponsibly condemned by Israel and accused, without credible evidence, of allowing staff participation in the October 7 attack. Liberal democracies compounded this by cutting funding, while Israel barred international staff from entering Gaza. Nevertheless, UNRWA has sought to continue its relief work to the best of its ability and with great courage.</p><p data-start=\"6288\" data-end=\"6495\">In light of these institutional shortcomings and partial successes, the implications for global governance become even more stark, setting the stage for a broader assessment of legitimacy and accountability.</p><h2 id=\"the-moral-and-political-costs-of-un-paralysis\">The moral and political costs of UN paralysis</h2><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">The foregoing needs to be read in light of the continuing Palestinian ordeal, which persists despite numerous Israeli violations, resulting in more than 350 Palestinian deaths since the ceasefire was agreed upon on October 10, 2025.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">International law seems to have no direct impact on the behaviour of the main governmental actors, but it does influence perceptions of legitimacy. In this sense, the ICJ outcomes and the reports of the special rapporteur that take the international law dimensions seriously have the indirect effect of legitimising various forms of civil society activism in support of true and just peace, which presupposes the realisation of Palestinian basic rights – above all, the inalienable right of self-determination.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">The exclusion of Palestinian participation in the US-imposed Trump Plan for shaping Gaza’s political future is a sign that liberal democracies stubbornly adhere to their unsupportable positions of complicity with Israel.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">Finally, the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 2803 in unacceptably endorsing the Trump Plan aligns the UN fully with the US and Israel, a demoralising evasion and repudiation of its own truth-telling procedures. It also establishes a most unfortunate precedent for the enforcement of international law and the accountability of perpetrators of international crimes.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\">In doing so, it deepens the crisis of confidence in global governance and underscores the urgent need for meaningful UN reform if genuine peace and justice are ever to be realised.</p><p data-start=\"6560\" data-end=\"8072\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Thousands of plantation workers have been rendered homeless.</p><p>“Nothing we ever faced could have prepared us for what we endured last week.

There will not be any work for several months. We will have to snap out of plantation lives and work somewhere else,” he told Al Jazeera from a government shelter where he has taken refuge along with his 30-year-old wife Mariappan Sharmila, also a tea plucker, and their two children.</p><p>Prabath Chandrakeerthi, Sri Lanka’s commissioner general of essential services, last week estimated the total economic losses caused by the cyclone to be approximately $6bn, which is almost 3.5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>In the tea industry, preliminary estimates predict an output decline of up to 35 percent, according to a member of a presidential committee on cyclone recovery, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.

On Friday, the global lender said it was considering a request by the Sri Lankan government for a $200m fund on top of the $347m tranche due later this month for post-cyclone relief works.</p><p>Moreover, Sri Lanka’s current public debt stands at nearly $100bn, 99.5 percent of its GDP, leaving barely any room for further financial shocks. But the cyclone has exacerbated the country’s economic vulnerabilities, which threaten its exports and domestic food availability, say the experts.</p><p>Dhananath Fernando, chief executive at Advocata Institute, an independent think tank in Sri Lanka, believes the economic devastation caused by Ditwah is at par with what happened during the catastrophic <a href=\"/gallery/2024/12/26/memorials-held-across-asia-to-mark-20-years-of-devastating-tsunami\">2004 tsunami</a>, which killed more than 35,000 people.</p><p>However, Fernando says, the impact of the cyclone is likely to be harsher as he predicts a sharp increase in consumer prices due to the disruption of supply chains.</p><p>“The cyclone has dealt a heavy blow, and this shock will significantly reduce overall growth, not just our export capacity, but also local consumption. The export basket will reflect the shock, reducing foreign earnings, vital to keep the economy afloat,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4144758\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4144758\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4144758\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-Severe-floods-across-Asia-kill-Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand-Sri-Lanka-December-2-1764667162.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Severe floods across Asia kill Indonesia Malaysia Thailand Sri Lanka December 2-1764667162\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4144758\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Fernando warned that tea plantation workers would be forced to shift to other professions – “inevitable, considering the level of shock”, as he put it – adding that the shift would not be good for the economy.</p><p>“Sri Lanka’s approach to debt sustainability is founded on economic development. Our focus is to repay debt by growing the economy. For this to happen, we cannot afford people to shift from the plantations in search of other options,” he said.</p><p>In October, the Tea Exporters Association of Sri Lanka (TEASL) had set a target of $1.5bn in export earnings for 2025, a slight increase from $1.43bn in 2024. The projection was supported by a global rise in demand for more value-added products such as tea packs and bags.</p><p>But a source at TEASL told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity that the target may not be feasible now due to the cyclone’s impact on tea-growing highlands. “Destruction to the sector is so vast, and it has dealt a huge blow to an industry that was picking up. Rebuilding will require both time and resources,” he said.</p><p>Omar Rajarathnam, executive director of Factum, another think tank based in Colombo, said the government should consider external shocks, given the island’s high vulnerability to extreme weather and climate crisis, before setting up revenue targets in sectors like tea.</p><p>“Even if we did not face a disaster of this magnitude, extreme weather should be factored in as part of industry preparedness, and projections should include multiple scenarios and mitigation methods,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>As the South Asian country recovers from the deadly cyclone, many tea plantation workers say they are lucky to be alive.</p><p>“The tea plantations are now like wastelands. The crops are devastated, homes destroyed, and we have lost so many people. I don’t know whether we would ever recover,” Palansamy’s wife, Sharmila, told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I know that all the questions will still be about Mo on Friday, ahead of the next game.”</p><p>Liverpool skipper van Dijk said it was an important victory for the players amid intense scrutiny and criticism.</p><p>“Winning is a good feeling, especially in the period we are in – trying to find consistency, something to build in,” the Liverpool defender told Amazon Prime.</p><p>“It was always going to be tough here. It nearly ended 0-0, but it ended positively for us.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Elsewhere in the Champions League on Tuesday, Bayern Munich’s 17-year-old midfielder Lennart Karl produced an audacious bit of skill to continue his high-scoring start to life in the Champions League in a 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chelsea were beaten in the Champions League for the first time in nearly three months as Belgium forward Charles De Ketelaere set up the equaliser and scored an 83rd-minute winner, and Atalanta came from behind to win 2-1 in Bergamo.</p><p class=\"p1\">Atletico Madrid came from behind to beat PSV Eindhoven 3-2 away on Tuesday and move up to the seventh spot in the Champions League standings, all but ensuring their progress to the knockout stages.</p><p class=\"p1\">Two headers by Jules Kounde, three minutes apart, gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory over Eintracht Frankfurt at Camp Nou.</p><p class=\"p1\">Tottenham Hotspur moved up to ninth after beating Slavia Prague 3-0 on an own goal and two penalties, and Marseille held on for a 3-2 win over Union Saint-Gilloise – whose players and fans twice celebrated what they thought were goals to level the score late on, only for both to be ruled out for narrow offsides on video review.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olympiakos broke through a determined Kairat Almaty defence to take a 1-0 win in Kazakhstan and boost their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Such designations can only be made at the federal level.</p><p>Moreover, CAIR is a domestic group with dozens of chapters across the country and hundreds of employees and contributors who are US citizens. It therefore cannot be labelled a foreign group.</p><p>“Material support to terrorism” is a serious criminal charge that would require legal proceedings, and the civil rights group has not yet faced any formal accusations.</p><p>But DeSantis’s announcement echoes a similar move taken by Texas Governor <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/cair-sues-texas-governor-over-unconstitutional-terror-designation\">Greg Abbott</a>, another Republican, last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desantis-welcomes-lawsuit\">DeSantis ‘welcomes’ lawsuit</h2><p>Founded in 1994, CAIR describes itself as the largest Muslim American civil liberties organisation.

The Israeli government itself has asked its Ministry of Defence to consider designating the US nonprofit as a terrorist group.</p><p>In Tuesday’s interview, Rahim criticised DeSantis for pursuing “Israel First” policies, instead of protecting US citizens who might be affiliated with CAIR.</p><p>She underscored that, in 2019, DeSantis held his first official cabinet meeting as Florida governor in Israel, a sign of his close relationship with the country.</p><p>Rahim also slammed the governor for failing to speak out about the plight of his Palestinian American constituents.</p><p>In July, Israeli settlers in the West Bank <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/the-love-he-gave-family-vows-to-keep-sayfollah-musallets-memory-alive\">beat to death</a> Florida ice cream shop worker Sayfollah Musallet, and 16-year-old Florida teen Mohammed Ibrahim was jailed by Israel for more than eight months this year without any public protest from the governor.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“What type of priorities is he showing the people of Florida when he elevates an ‘Israel First’ policy and ignores the needs of the Floridian people?” Rahim told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, Rahim told reporters that CAIR is proud to be “America First”, highlighting the patriotism of the Muslim group while questioning DeSantis’s loyalties. She said CAIR’s mission was to defend the rights enshrined in the US Constitution.</p><p>The Florida governor has said he would welcome a lawsuit against CAIR’s “terrorist” designation, arguing that a legal challenge would give the state “discovery rights to be able to subpoena” the group’s bank records.</p><p>However, if CAIR were indeed suspected of any criminal activity, state officials should be able to seek a search warrant to investigate its activities, without waiting for a lawsuit.</p><p>Rahim appeared unfazed by the prospect of having the group’s records made public. “We welcome it as well, and we will see him in the courtroom,” she told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"islamophobia-on-the-rise\">Islamophobia on the rise</h2><p>The targeting of CAIR comes amid a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/30/mamdanis-new-york-victory-sparks-islamophobic-backlash-in-us\">spike in Islamophobia</a> across the country, with politicians, including allies of President Donald Trump, sharpening their anti-Muslim rhetoric.</p><p>Earlier this year, several right-wing Congress members, including Chip Roy and Tommy Tuberville, introduced bills against the establishment of Islamic law — measures that critics consider a red herring.</p><p>Rather than addressing a real issue, rights advocates say the legislation is instead aimed at demonising the Muslim community and portraying Islam as a threat to the Constitution.</p><p>Last month, anti-Muslim activists also marched on the city of Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to a large Muslim community.

However, he did not rule out endorsing candidates and parties in European elections, akin to his support for right-wing politicians in Latin America.</p><p>Trump also confirmed that his Hungarian ally, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, is seeking a US bailout, similar to the $40bn aid package that Washington handed to the government of Argentinian President <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/27/argentine-assets-cheer-milei-partys-election-victory-with-massive-rally\">Javier Milei</a>.</p><p>But the US president denied Orban’s claim that an assistance deal <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/9/hungarian-leader-orban-says-he-secured-financial-shield-from-trump\">has been secured</a>.</p><p>It may be difficult for the US to empower allies beyond Hungary. Many European far-right parties that echo Trump’s rhetoric have been shunned in their own countries.</p><p>In Germany, for example, groups across the political spectrum have vowed not to include the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/2/german-security-service-designates-far-right-afd-as-extremist\">hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party</a> in any governing coalition.</p><p>In 2017, during his first term, Trump sparked a diplomatic crisis with the United Kingdom when he shared fake videos from a British far-right leader that purported to paint Muslim immigrants as violent.</p><p>Then-UK Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2017/11/30/trump-attacks-may-defends-britain-first-tweets\">Theresa May</a> called the posts “wrong”, and several politicians condemned the US president.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump renewed his attacks on one of his most frequent political targets – London’s Mayor <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/9/23/un-general-assembly-2025-live-day-one\">Sadiq Khan</a>.</p><p>The US president questioned Khan’s ideology and suggested that the mayor, a Muslim, was elected by immigrants, echoing the “great replacement” <a href=\"/news/2022/5/18/great-replacement-the-conspiracy-theory-stoking-racist-violence\">conspiracy theory</a> that alleges an unfounded plot to replace white voters with newcomers.</p><p>“If you take a look at London, you have a mayor named Khan. He’s a horrible mayor. He’s an incompetent mayor, but he’s a horrible, vicious, disgusting mayor,” Trump said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Although the UK has been adopting restrictive immigration laws, Trump claimed that it is “allowing people just to come in, unchecked, unvetted”.</p><p>“Look at the mayor of London. He’s a disaster. He’s a disaster,” Trump said. “He’s got a totally different ideology of what he’s supposed to have. And he gets elected because so many people have come in, and they vote for him.”</p><p>Trump also attacked Khan during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in September, suggesting that the London mayor adopted Islamic law in the city.</p><p>The US president’s rhetoric against Khan and Europe has been met with a muted response over the past weeks.</p><p>UK Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/is-keir-starmer-facing-a-plot-to-depose-him-as-uk-prime-minister\">Keir Starmer</a> has only defended and voiced support for Khan – his Labour Party ally – without condemning or directly criticising Trump.</p><p>In his Politico interview, Trump also decried the state of Paris – a major destination for US tourists – as well as Sweden, saying that the Nordic country is now “very unsafe”.</p><p>Sweden, home to around 10.6 million people, had 92 homicides last year – far less than half of the 250 murders recorded in the US city of Memphis, which has a population of less than 630,000 people.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its brutality has deepened the conflict and destabilized the region, creating the conditions for terrorist groups to grow,” Treasury official John K Hurley said in a statement.</p><p>The conflict, the Treasury added, “has provoked the world’s worst ongoing humanitarian crisis”.</p><p>Fighting has raged in Sudan since the outbreak of war in April 2023, and more than 12.4 million people have been forced from their homes, contributing to displacement both within the country’s borders and in surrounding areas. More than 3.3 million people have fled Sudan as refugees.</p><p>Just this week, a United Nations committee called for an end to the hostilities, citing a long list of human rights abuses committed by the RSF and its allies.</p><p>They include ethnically motivated killings, torture, the targeting of humanitarian workers and the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.</p><p>On January 7, the US Department of State <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/genocide-determination-in-sudan-and-imposing-accountability-measures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> it had determined the RSF had committed genocide against ethnic groups in Sudan as part of its armed campaign, though it also highlighted abuses on both sides of the conflict.</p><p>Tuesday’s Treasury statement references that genocide determination and adds that the fighting threatens US interests in Africa.</p><p>“The civil war in Sudan risks destabilizing the region and making the country a safe haven for those who threaten the United States,” the statement reads.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"more-than-300-colombian-recruits\">More than 300 Colombian recruits</h2><p>While the Treasury has sanctioned RSF leaders and organisations in the past, Tuesday’s economic penalties shine a spotlight on the role Colombian nationals have played in the fighting.</p><p>According to the US government, hundreds of Colombian military veterans have flown to Sudan since September 2024, in order to intervene on the RSF’s behalf.</p><p>Many start by training RSF fighters, including child soldiers. They also provide RSF forces with information about operating drones, artillery and military-style vehicles.</p><p>In addition, the US Treasury has accused Colombian nationals of engaging in the fighting firsthand, including during the 18-month siege on <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/10/29/satellite-images-reveal-mass-killing-sites-in-sudans-el-fasher-city\">el-Fasher</a>, the capital of the North Sudan state and a city the RSF seized in October.</p><p>“Colombian fighters have participated in numerous battles across Sudan, including in its capital, Khartoum, as well as Omdurman, Kordofan, and El Fasher,” the Treasury’s statement reads.</p><p>“The presence of Colombian fighters in Sudan would not be possible without the assistance of numerous individuals and companies, mostly from Colombia.”</p><p>In a September letter to the UN Security Council, a representative of Sudan’s government estimated that between 350 to 380 Colombian mercenaries have arrived in the African country to participate in the fighting. Most of them, he said, were “retired soldiers and officers of the Colombian Army”.</p><p>Colombia has gained a reputation as an international marketplace for mercenaries.</p><p>Experts often point to the role of Colombia’s own internal conflict in producing out-of-work fighters. Since 1964, Colombia has been mired in fighting between multiple armed forces, including right-wing paramilitary groups, left-wing rebels, criminal networks and the country’s own military.</p><p>Accusations of human rights abuses have been rampant in that conflict as well, and at least 450,000 people have been killed, according to a government truth commission.</p><p>According to Tuesday’s statement from the US Treasury, two of the sanctioned individuals, Quijano Becerra and his wife, Oliveros Forero, run a Bogota-based employment firm called International Services Agency.</p><p>That firm, the Treasury says, holds “group chats” and “town halls” to recruit Colombian fighters for Sudan, “including drone operators, snipers, and translators”.</p><p>The organisation allegedly obscures its actions through a Panama-based company called Global Staffing, also known as Talent Bridge.</p><p>The Treasury also sanctioned Duque Botero and Muñoz Ucros for running another Bogota-based employment company with similar aims.</p><p>That company, called Maine Global Corp, allegedly hires Colombians and works with Global Staffing to convert currency in order to ensure the fighters’ payments. A fourth company, Comercializadora San Bendito, was accused of facilitating the wire transfers.</p><p>From 2024 to 2025, the Treasury estimated the payments processed amounted to “millions of US dollars”. All four companies mentioned in the Treasury’s statement faced sanctions, alongside their leaders.</p><p>Sanctions freeze any assets individuals or groups may have in the US. They also make it illegal for US-based entities to do business with the designated individuals.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The court’s conservative members have argued that political spending is a constitutionally protected form of free speech.</p><p>In 2010, the court reshaped the country’s campaign finance landscape with the landmark ruling Citizens United v Federal Election Commission that struck down previous limits on individual expenditures. Corporations and donors rushed to take advantage, leading to a considerable increase in campaign spending.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the transparency watchdog Open Secrets, spending by super PACS, or a kind of political action committee that can raise unlimited funds from donors, corporations, and other groups, rose from $62.6m in 2010, the year of the ruling, to $622.7m two years later. By 2024, the figure had exploded to $4.1bn.</p><p>The court has continued to chip away at limits in a series of additional rulings since Citizens United.</p><p>“The coordinated party spending limits are at war with this court’s recent First Amendment cases,” Noel Francisco, a lawyer for the Republican challengers, told the justices.</p><p>Some of the court’s liberal justices noted the surge in <a href=\"/news/2024/10/9/harris-campaign-hits-1bn-in-fundraising-reports\">political spending</a> that has accompanied previous decisions on campaign finance.</p><p>“Once we take off coordinated expenditure limits, then what’s left?” asked Justice Sonya Sotomayor. “What’s left is nothing. No control whatsoever.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The case before the court was brought by two Republican committees for House and Senate candidates, and was first filed in Ohio in 2022 when a pair of Ohio Republicans, Steve Chabot and current Vice President <a href=\"/news/2024/7/15/who-is-jd-vance-trumps-pick-for-us-vice-president\">JD Vance</a>, were running for Senate.</p><p>The Trump administration has joined the request to strike down a prior federal election law intended to prevent arrangements in which wealthy donors circumvent limits on individual spending by directing those sums to a party, with the understanding that it will be spent in support of a particular candidate.</p><p>“More speech,” Francisco told Sotomayor in response to her concerns, “is always better than less.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
