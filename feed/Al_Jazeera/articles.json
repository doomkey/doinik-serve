out several attacks on southern Lebanon, killing one person, according to Lebanese authorities, with the military saying it targeted a Hezbollah fighter and infrastructure.</p><p class=\"p1\">The attacks on Sunday came days after the Lebanese military said it had completed <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/lebanons-army-says-phase-one-of-hezbollah-disarmament-in-south-completed\">disarming Hezbollah</a> south of the Litani River, the first phase of a nationwide plan, though Israel has called those efforts insufficient.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

Ministry of Health said an “Israeli enemy strike on a car in Bint Jbeil city in south Lebanon resulted in the martyrdom of one citizen”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Israeli army said the strike was on a member of Hezbollah, which it accused of breaching a truce agreed in late 2024 to end more than a year of hostilities with the group.</p><p class=\"p1\">“A short while ago, in response to Hezbollah’s continuous violations of the ceasefire understandings, the [Israeli military] struck a Hezbollah terrorist” in the Bint Jbeil area, the army said in a statement.</p><p class=\"p1\">Elsewhere, Lebanon’s official National News Agency (NNA) reported that “enemy warplanes launched more than 10 raids” on the town of Kfar Hatta, which lies north of the Litani, noting “significant damage” to buildings there.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Israeli military had issued an evacuation warning for Kafr Hatta, subsequently saying it was “striking Hezbollah infrastructure in several areas”.</p><p class=\"p1\">It later announced an additional strike that targeted “an underground site used for weapons storage belonging to Hezbollah”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While a truce was signed between Israel and Lebanon in 2024, Israel has repeatedly targeted Lebanon and has kept troops in five south Lebanon areas it has classed as being necessary to its security.</p><p>Israeli attacks have killed more than 300 people in Lebanon since the agreement was signed.</p><p>The Israeli army has not only targeted Lebanon to attack alleged Hezbollah infrastructure, but also Hamas

disarmed”.</p><p>“Efforts made toward this end by the Lebanese government and the Lebanese armed forces are an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah’s

However, analysts debate the extent to which such moves can have an impact on the ground in Iran.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-behind-the-protests\">What’s behind the protests?</h2><p>Protests in Iran began on December 28 amid soaring inflation in the country. They’ve since spread to more than 100 cities and towns, and are now reportedly taking place in every province in the country.</p><p>“The focus of the protests is on the core of the state and governance of the country because political, economic, social, cultural, or even environmental policies have not worked for [protesters],” Negar Mortazavi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, told Al Jazeera. “Economics, though, was the start of it.”</p><p>Many of the protesters are calling for an end to the rule of the country’s ayatollahs who, along with their Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), took over after the 1979 revolution.</p><p>Khamenei, the current supreme leader, has led the country since 1989. And while his rule has survived a number of waves of unrest, including the mass “Women, Life, Freedom” protests of 2022, some analysts believe that the latest demonstrations are among the biggest challenges his regime has faced.</p><p>“The Trump administration’s decision to quit the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimpose sanctions – and its failure to reach a new deal with Iran last year – have crippled the economy and increased corruption, benefitting a small sanctions-busting elite,” said Barbara Slavin, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington and a lecturer in international affairs at George Washington University.</p><p>“Add to that the severe blows inflicted on Iran’s regional allies since October 7, 2023, the Israeli and US strikes last summer, and it is hard to see a way out [for the regime].”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>The Iranian regime has enforced an internet blackout in the country since Thursday, though some videos have still managed to circulate online of masked protesters clashing with security forces in Iranian cities.</p><p>The semiofficial news agency Tasnim reported on Sunday that the number of security personnel killed has reached 109. Opposition activists say the death toll is higher and includes dozens of protesters.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot independently verify the figures coming out of Iran.</p><p>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene if the authorities kill more protesters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"enter-elon\">Enter Elon</h2><p>Musk, a longtime tech mogul heading US government-supported companies including Tesla and SpaceX, <a href=\"/news/2025/5/29/why-has-elon-musk-quit-donald-trumps-administration\">left a role</a> with the Trump administration, where he led the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in late May.</p><p>Musk’s work with DOGE was widely criticised, though his purchase of social media platform X and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/24/this-guy-is-dangerous-british-pakistanis-fear-musk-is-stoking\">vocal support for racist policies</a> have also attracted widespread condemnation in recent years.</p><p>Today, Musk is more focused on his private businesses, though he still wades into politics from time to time, particularly to push right-wing conspiracy theories about “<a href=\"/news/2025/3/26/kill-the-boer-the-anti-apartheid-song-musk-ties-to-white-genocide\">white genocide”</a> and immigration.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>As for Iran, during the 2022 “Women, Life, Freedom” protests and again in 2025’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-Day War</a> – which killed more than 610 people in Iran and 28 in Israel – Musk provided internet access to people inside the country through his satellite service Starlink.</p><p>Iran has reportedly jammed Starlink signals during the latest protests.</p><p>“The state uses internet disruption and shutdown to prevent more mobilisation of protesters and communication between protest groups and also to prevent news of it spreading,” Mortazavi said.</p><p>“It still happens with a delay when the internet comes back on, but what it does is hamper mobilisation and slows down the process of the protests. That’s the first goal of a comms shutdown.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This is where Starlink can be particularly useful. But analysts say Musk responding to Khamenei’s post and changing the flag on X are not likely driven by ideology.</p><p>“I doubt he cares about Iran per se,” said Slavin. “But he wants to gin up more traffic for X, and this is one way to do it.”</p><h2 id=\"how-useful-are-musk-s-latest-interventions\">How useful are Musk’s latest interventions?</h2><p>The change of Iran’s flag on X came amid the internet blackout, so many protesters on the ground were likely unable to see it. Some Iranian officials, however, were briefly viewed by those outside the country with the pre-Islamic Republic flags in their account profiles.</p><p>“It’s a digital version of conquering a building and pulling down the old flag, and trying to put a new flag, that was essentially the symbolising they were going for,” historian Reza H Akbari, who is also an analyst on Iran at the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The power of these types of moves are quite readily contested in mid- and long-term effects,” said Akbari. “But it could provide momentary excitement [for protesters on the ground if they can see it] though it’s very hard to gauge the amount of popular support.”</p><p>Slavin told Al Jazeera that “what is happening outside Iran is not that relevant” to what is taking place inside the country.</p><p>“The real struggle for freedom is among Iranians is still in Iran, not the diaspora or others interested in the topic,” she said.</p><p>“They can amplify developments within Iran and express support for human rights, but we cannot determine the outcome of the struggle.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-contentious-flag\">A ‘contentious’ flag</h2><p>Meanwhile, Akbari says the pre-1979 flag “has always been contentious, essentially as a symbol for opposition both inside the country and abroad”.</p><p>He added that while the flag may mean different things to different critics of the current Iranian government, it is often associated with “the opposition that identifies as monarchist or wants the return of the shah”, who was deposed in 1979.</p><p>During recent protests, the ousted shah’s son, Reza Pahlavi, called on demonstrators to take to the streets and occupy Iranian cities.</p><p>Some protesters, including those outside Iran, have called for a return to rule by the shah, <a href=\"/features/2025/7/3/son-of-former-shah-loses-credibility-after-justifying-israels-war-on-iran\">despite his questionable popularity</a>. Akbari said that Pahlavi himself has offered to act as a transitional leader but is not looking to move permanently to Iran to rule the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Analysts agree that Pahlavi would not be the man to lead the country forward, should Iran’s Islamic Republic fall after 47 years in power.</p><p>“Today, there are many decent and capable people in Iran who could replace those in power. Unfortunately, most of them are in prison,” Slavin said.</p><p>“The son of the shah, meanwhile, lives comfortably in a mansion in Potomac [in the US state of Maryland]. It’s hard to see what he offers in the way of practical change.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.</p><p>“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,” Trump added.</p><p>Trump did not elaborate on his suggested deal, but US officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks.</p><p>Earlier on Sunday, Trump also reposted a message on Truth Social suggesting US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could become the president of communist-ruled Cuba.</p><p>Trump shared that post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel rejected Trump’s threats in a post on X.</p><p>“Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation.

He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other “material” compensation in return for security services provided to any country.</p><p>Reporting from Cucuta, Colombia, Al Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti said that, despite its defiant rhetoric, Cuba may struggle to find alternative sources of fuel.</p><p>“Cuba is going through a very, very difficult situation with rolling blackouts, fuel shortages on a daily basis,” he said.</p><p>He added that an oil embargo from the US could worsen and could pressurise Havana to reach a deal with Washington.</p><p>Under a US trade embargo, Havana since 2000 has increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez.</p><p>As its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela’s supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with about 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship-tracking data and internal documents of Venezuela’s state-run oil company, PDVSA. Venezuela’s shipments covered roughly 50 percent of Cuba’s oil deficit.</p><p>Cuba also relies on imported crude and fuel provided by Mexico in smaller volumes.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes but, given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an “important supplier” of crude to Cuba.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, amid Trump’s threats to Cuba, Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane said Americans generally want Trump to focus on the domestic economy.</p><p>“There is an affordability crisis in this country, groceries are expensive, housing is expensive, health insurance has gone up,” she said, reporting from Washington, DC.</p><p>“This is a president who has said he will focus on America First. We have now seen him bomb seven countries, … so within [Trump’s] base, they are starting to see cracks because this is not what he promised on his campaign trail,” she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The second iteration, Exercise Mosi II, was held in February 2023, coinciding with the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>South Africa had faced heat from the West for hosting the joint drills then.</p><p>A third edition was scheduled for late 2025, but it overlapped with a Group of 20 summit that was held in South Africa in November. Washington did not send any delegates. The ongoing Will for Peace 2026, now rebranded, is the third edition of the drills.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-at-stake-for-south-africa\">What’s at stake for South Africa?</h2><p>The exercises in South African waters will likely further raise tensions with Washington.</p><p>Since Trump took office again, South Africa-US ties have deteriorated over a range of issues, and Trump has imposed 30 percent tariffs on South African goods.</p><p>A part of the fallout is also rooted in the South African government’s decision to bring a genocide case against Israel, a top US ally, before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It accuses the Israeli government of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. In a preliminary ruling, the world court found it plausible that Israeli actions amounted to genocide.</p><p>When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House in May, hoping to mend ties, Trump falsely claimed that white South African farmers were facing systematic killings.</p><p>Ramaphosa rejected the claims. None of South Africa’s political parties says there is a “white genocide” happening in the country as the Trump administration claims.</p><p>Hosting the wargames at a time of global geopolitical upheaval has its own risks, given that the US sees some of the participants as a military threat.</p><p>Ramaphosa’s government also faces criticism from one of its largest coalition partners, the liberal Democratic Alliance (DA). A DA spokesperson, Chris Hattingh, said in a statement that the bloc has no defensive role or shared military plans to warrant such exercises.</p><p>The party said BRICS had “rendered South Africa a pawn in the power games being waged by rogue states on the international stage”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>To the government of the United Kingdom:</p><p> </p><p>We, the undersigned, write to you today as survivors of state violence.</p><p>We are a collective of former hunger strikers from Palestine, Ireland and Guantánamo Bay. Hunger strikes end only when power intervenes, or when people die. We learned, through pain, permanent damage, and watching our comrades fall, how states behave when prisoners have no choice but to refuse the only right afforded to them: food.</p><p>As such, we write in uncompromising solidarity with the hunger strikers held today in British prisons: Qesser Zuhrah, Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Kamran Ahmed, Teuta Hoxha, Jon Cink, Lewie Chiaramello, and Muhammad Umer Khalid. They are imprisoned on remand, without trial and without conviction. For some, their remand has lasted over a year, and for most, they will not see trial for two.</p><p>The UK government has chosen prolonged remand, isolation and their censorship. It has chosen to restrict their contact with loved ones, allow medical neglect, and deployed the language of terror in an insidious attempt to deliberately strip these prisoners of public sympathy and basic rights before any trial takes place.</p><p>We cannot forget what the hunger strikers today stand for. They stand for Palestine. They stand for dismantling the infrastructure of weapons that kills Palestinians. They stand for the end of the apartheid regime implemented by the Israeli government. They stand in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners. They stand for the complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.</p><p>For years, Palestinian prisoners have been subjected to systematic abuse inside Israeli prisons, including well-documented torture, extreme sexual violence, medical neglect, and death in custody. Yet, the UK government, through its unwavering support for the Israeli state continues to choose to be complicit in its actions. It chooses to continue to arm Israel and shield Israeli officials from accountability while Palestinian bodies – men, women and children – are violated and destroyed in their streets, in their homes, and behind bars.</p><p>The Palestine Action political prisoners began their hunger strike when they had no other choice. The state’s decision to rely on the use of the classification of “terror” to enforce the systematic repression of those who refuse to conform has left them with no other alternative as they seek the rights they are entitled to by law.</p><p>This is not a new phenomenon: the use of the word “terror” has long been used to manufacture fear, to poison public perception, to justify the repeated violation of even the most basic human rights. Once this label is attached, rights become conditional, liberty becomes transactional, and the presumption of innocence evaporates. The rule of law that is so proudly claimed to be upheld is swiftly desecrated in the face of a singular word, deployed by unscrupulous politicians determined to protect their own interests: “terrorist”.</p><p>The proscription of Palestine Action was not about safety. It was about control. The repeated and flagrant breaches of sub judice were not about convincing the public that this was a dangerous organisation; it was about condemning the prisoners before they stood trial. It was about isolating them, criminalising solidarity, and sending a warning to anyone who might speak or organise against the Israeli war machine.</p><p>No trial held under an atmosphere of state-manufactured fear can be deemed as fair, and no jury exposed to decades of terrorism rhetoric can operate free of bias. These prisoners were smeared the moment the announcement of their arrest made mention of a “terrorism connection”, despite those proceedings not having taken place.</p><p>We therefore demand the following:</p><p>1. An urgent ministerial meeting with families and legal representatives to agree on actions that will preserve the lives of the hunger strikers. Immediate bail for the Palestine Action prisoners (known as the Filton 24) and all hunger strikers.</p><p>2. Dropping of terror charges designed to criminalise dissent.</p><p>3. Fair trial conditions free from fear-driven narrative and political interference.</p><p>4. Immediate access to independent medical care chosen by the prisoners.</p><p>5. An end to censorship and restrictions on family visits.</p><p>In 1981, Britain chose to let the Irish hunger strikers die in the Long Kesh prison. In the 2000s, Britain chose silence over the plight of the detainees at Guantánamo Bay. For decades, Britain – along with other governments – continued to choose inaction in Palestine. Each time, British officials claimed responsibility rested elsewhere. Each time, history recorded the truth.</p><p>The Suffragettes, despite being force-fed and labelled as terrorists, are today celebrated as heroes and freedom fighters. The Long Kesh prisoners, despite the smears they faced, are now seen as a vital part of the peace achieved under the Good Friday Agreement. The Guantánamo Bay prisoners, despite their inhumane treatment and public consent for torture, remained untried and were largely released without conviction.</p><p>Just as they were all vindicated, history will too vindicate the Palestine Action prisoners who sought to stop the slaughter of innocent people, against the wishes and interests of the British government.</p><p>We are not merely observers, but witnesses to the injustice currently being dispensed by the hands of the state against people who history will no doubt vindicate, as it has done those hunger strikers who have gone before.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Signatories:</strong></p><p>Shadi Zayed Saleh Odeh, Palestine</p><p>Mahmoud Radwan, Palestine</p><p>Othman Bilal, Palestine</p><p>Mahmoud Sidqi Suleiman Radwan, Palestine</p><p>Loay Odeh, Palestine</p><p>Tommy McKearney, Ireland</p><p>Laurence McKeown, Ireland</p><p>Tom McFeely, Ireland</p><p>John Nixon, Ireland</p><p>Mansoor Adayfi (GTMO441), Guantanamo</p><p>Lakhdar Boumediene, Guantanamo</p><p>Samir Naji Moqbel, Guantanamo</p><p>Moath Al-Alwi, Guantanamo</p><p>Khalid Qassim, Guantanamo</p><p>Ahmed Rabbani, Guantanamo</p><p>Sharqawi Al-Hajj, Guantanamo</p><p>Saeed Sarim, Guantanamo</p><p>Mahmoud Al Mujahid, Guantanamo</p><p>Hussein Al-Marfadi, Guantanamo</p><p>Osama Abu Kabir, Guantanamo</p><p>Abdul Halim Siddiqui, Guantanamo</p><p>Ahmed Adnan Ahjam, Guantanamo</p><p>Abdel Malik Al Rahabi, Guantanamo</p><p>Ahmed Elrashidi, Guantanamo</p><p data-start=\"7835\" data-end=\"8231\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Courts have repeatedly declined to rule on its constitutionality.</p><p>Within days of the Venezuela operation, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/us-senate-passes-measure-to-restrict-trumps-military-actions-in-venezuela\">US Senate</a> advanced a resolution to limit further military operations in the Latin American country without <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/congresss-role-questioned-as-democrats-vow-to-rein-in-trump-on-venezuela\">congressional</a> backing, with five Republicans joining Democrats in supporting it. But this measure has little chance of being enacted, since it would need Trump’s signature if the Republican-controlled House passes it, which is uncertain.</p><p>For decades, presidents and Congress have battled over who has the institutional power to declare war.</p><p>The US Constitution assigns Congress the right to declare war. The last time Congress did that was at the beginning of World War II.</p><p>Since then, presidents have generally initiated military action using their constitutionally granted powers as commander-in-chief without an official declaration of <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/12/the-us-is-already-at-war-with-venezuela\">war</a>.</p><p>In August 1964, President Lyndon B Johnson asked Congress to back his effort to widen the US role in Vietnam. He received approval with the enactment of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which easily passed both chambers of Congress.</p><p>As public sentiment turned against the Vietnam War, lawmakers became increasingly frustrated about their secondary role in sending US troops abroad. So, in 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which was enacted over President Richard Nixon’s veto.</p><p>The resolution required the president to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and to terminate the use of US armed forces within 60 days unless Congress approves. If approval is not granted and the president deems it an emergency, an additional 30 days are allowed to end operations.</p><p>Presidents have often, but not always, followed the act’s requirements, usually framing any entreaties to Congress as a voluntary bid to secure “support” for military action rather than “permission”. This has sometimes taken the form of an “authorisation for the use of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/analysis-why-venezuelas-military-holds-the-key-to-countrys-future\">military</a> force” – legislation that amounts to a modern version of a declaration of war.</p><p>Trump has a point that presidents from both political parties have sought to assert power and limit lawmakers’ interference, including in court. But these arguments were never backed by court rulings.</p><p>Between 1973 and 2012, Congress’s nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found eight judicial decisions involving the War Powers Resolution, and “in each and every case” the ruling declined to offer a binding opinion, always finding a reason, such as a lack of standing to sue, to avoid taking a side.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Minnesota officials disputed Noem’s account, citing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/new-video-on-minnesota-ice-shooting-emerges-as-public-anger-grows-across-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">videos</a> showing Good trying to drive away.</p><p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said on Thursday on the CNN news channel that Noem’s statement is “an abuse of the term” “domestic terrorism”.</p><p>President Donald Trump’s administration has turned to the phrase in recent months, including in an October immigration enforcement-related shooting.</p><p>In September, the administration issued a memo calling on law enforcement to prioritise threats including “violent efforts to shut down immigration enforcement”, saying “domestic terrorists” were using violence to advance “extreme views in favour of mass migration and open borders”. Experts said it violates free speech laws.</p><p>Good, a mother of three and a poet, lived in the Minneapolis neighbourhood where she was fatally shot. She was a US citizen and had no criminal background, The Associated Press news agency reported. Good’s ex-husband told AP that she wasn’t an activist and he hadn’t known her to participate in protests. Good had dropped off her 6-year-old son at school and was driving home when she encountered <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/we-have-to-stand-up-ice-killing-in-minneapolis-sparks-protests-across-us\">ICE</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration has ramped up Minneapolis immigration enforcement in recent weeks after news reports about allegations of daycare funding fraud involving the local <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/from-mogadishu-to-minneapolis-somalis-reject-trumps-bigoted-remarks\">Somali community</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>What is ‘domestic terrorism’?</strong></h2><p>Federal agencies have their own definitions of “domestic terrorism”.</p><p>According to a 2020 memo, the FBI, citing a specific section of the US Code, defines “domestic terrorism” as acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state criminal laws and appear intended to intimidate or coerce civilians; influence government policy by intimidation or coercion; or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses a similar definition, citing a different statute that defines “domestic terrorism” as dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources.</p><p>The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in 2023: “Unlike foreign terrorism, the federal government does not have a mechanism to formally charge an individual with domestic terrorism which sometimes makes it difficult (and occasionally controversial) to formally characterise someone as a domestic terrorist.”</p><p>In 2022, former FBI agent Michael German, then a fellow with New York University Law School’s Brennan Center for Justice, told PolitiFact that 51 federal statutes apply to “domestic terrorism”.</p><p>“I think there is and always has been confusion between rhetoric and the law in regard to terrorism,” German told PolitiFact after the Minneapolis shooting. “There is no law that authorises the US government to designate any group or individual in the US as a ‘domestic terrorist’.”</p><p>The federal government periodically revises how it describes threats. For example, in 2025, federal officials sometimes used the term “nihilistic violent extremists” to describe perpetrators who don’t subscribe to one ideology but appear to be motivated by a desire to, as one expert put it, “gamify” real-life violence. Experts told PolitiFact that the term is valid but cautioned against its overuse or citing it to obscure other ideological motivations, such as white supremacy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>The Trump administration has broadened the ‘domestic terrorism’ label</strong></h2><p>The DHS rhetoric around Good’s fatal shooting is similar to another immigration enforcement-related shooting in October. During DHS’s months-long immigration crackdown in Chicago called <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/lawsuit-alleges-horrific-conditions-at-us-immigration-facility-in-chicago\">“Operation Midway Blitz”</a>, a Border Patrol agent shot US citizen Marimar Martinez five times.</p><p>A DHS news release described Martinez as a “domestic terrorist” and accused her of ramming her vehicle into the Border Patrol agent’s car, carrying a semiautomatic weapon and having a “history of doxxing federal agents”.</p><p>A federal judge granted a motion from prosecutors to dismiss federal charges against Martinez in November.</p><p>“Ultimately, there was a determination when everything was evaluated that there were serious questions about the officers’ narratives,” legal analyst Joey Jackson told CNN.</p><p>The government’s use of the term goes beyond immigration and the DHS.</p><p>After conservative activist <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/who-was-charlie-kirk-what-we-know-about-the-shooting-and-the-suspect\">Charlie Kirk</a>’s murder, Trump issued a September 25 memo ordering the attorney general to expand “domestic terrorism” priorities to include “politically motivated terrorist acts such as organised doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder”.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order a few days before designating <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/what-is-antifa-what-does-trumps-major-terrorist-label-mean\">antifa</a>, a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists, as a “domestic terrorist” organisation.</p><p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi told federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to compile a list of groups “engaged in acts that may constitute domestic terrorism”.</p><p>Legal experts have raised alarms about the memo’s potential infringements on the First Amendment.</p><p>“Both the order and the memo are ungrounded in fact and law,” Faiza Patel, the director of liberty and national security at the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote. “Acting on them would violate free speech rights, potentially threatening any person or group holding any one of a broad array of disfavored views with investigation and prosecution.”</p><p>Experts have also pointed to the memo’s focus on left-wing violence. It does not mention the politically motivated assassination of Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, months before.</p><p>“When a policy directive targets one ideological family and leaves others to the footnotes, it sheds any pretense of neutrality,” Thomas E Brzozowski, former Department of Justice counsel for domestic terrorism, wrote on December 12.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>Experts raise questions about Noem’s ‘domestic terrorism’ label</strong></h2><p>Information is still <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/minneapolis-leaders-urge-transparency-independent-probe-after-ice-killing\">surfacing</a> about what transpired before Good was fatally shot. However, frame-by-frame analyses of video footage by The New York Times and The Washington Post found Good’s vehicle moved towards an ICE agent, but the agent was able to move out of the way and fire at least two of the three shots from his gun from the side of the car as Good veered away.</p><p>Brzozowski told PolitiFact that because Good was trying to drive away, to “characterise that as domestic terrorism, I think, is a stretch.”</p><p>However, he said the larger concern is that Noem is using the “domestic terrorism” term absent any actual findings before an<a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/fbi-takes-over-investigation-into-ice-agent-killing-of-woman-in-minneapolis\"> investigation</a>.</p><p>“Essentially within hours of the incident occurring, labelling this activity as domestic terrorism, what that does is effectively strip domestic terrorism of its significance,” he said, calling it a “blatantly partisan effort to label it as domestic terrorism”.</p><p>“Now what is domestic terrorism? Whatever the DHS secretary says it is? She can characterise anything she wants as domestic terrorism. She is doing so without any facts to go on.”</p><p>Shirin Sinnar, a Stanford University Law School professor, told PolitiFact: “While intentionally ramming a vehicle for a political purpose could amount to terrorism in a different context, the videos of the Minneapolis incident appear to show a woman attempting to drive away from ICE officers, not hit them. Here, the administration’s calling her a domestic terrorist is simply an attempt to malign a protester and justify her killing by an ICE officer.”</p><p>German told PolitiFact there isn’t any public evidence to suggest that Good was “engaging in conduct that could have been prosecuted under the terrorism chapter of the US Code”.</p><p>“So a government official calling her a domestic terrorist isn’t supported in the law and is entirely pejorative and prejudicial.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
