Who didn’t come to the streets with unreasonable demands from him? This country will never be good. People gave their lives in July for nothing.”</p><p>His weary assessment came as Yunus prepares to leave office after presiding over arguably the country’s first free and fair elections in more than a decade, closing one of the most unusual political transitions in the country’s history.</p><p>As Bangladesh heads towards the February 12 polls, spirited debates over Yunus’s legacy are already dividing people who once placed their hopes on him.</p><p>The key question at the heart of those debates: was Yunus the steady hand who kept a fragile state from breaking, or a leader who fell short on delivering the structural change demanded by the movement that powered the 2024 uprising?</p><figure id=\"attachment_3105659\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3105659\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3105659\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AFP__20240808__36CC4BX__v1__Preview__BangladeshPoliticsUnrest-1723131629.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus (C) is sworn in as the chief adviser of the new interim government of Bangladesh in Dhaka on August 8, 2024, as President Mohammed Shahabuddin (2L) administers the oath taking ceremony. - Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was sworn into office on August 8 to lead Bangladesh's interim government as its chief adviser, days after a student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.

The NCP is now in alliance with Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, in next week’s election.</p><p>“When we discussed alternatives, we didn’t find anyone other than Yunus,” he added.</p><p>Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuiyan, another student leader who contacted Yunus days before Hasina’s fall, said their calculation was similar: addressing institutional collapse and global uncertainty required someone with moral authority.</p><p>Bhuiyan said Yunus’s appointment was not unanimously welcomed within state institutions, and cited reservations within the military that he claimed were voiced during discussions among student leaders and officials at the time. Al Jazeera cannot independently verify this claim. The military has not publicly detailed its internal deliberations around Yunus’s appointment, and General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the army chief appointed by Hasina, remained in his post under the interim government.</p><p>Yunus is also reported to have initially hesitated, insisting he was “not a political person”. But as protests escalated and deaths mounted, he stepped in, in “a moment of obligation”, as political scientist Ali Riaz puts it.</p><p>“He felt a commitment to step forward,” said Riaz, who was handpicked by Yunus to head a committee on constitutional reforms – a key demand of the 2024 uprising.</p><p>But 18 months later, a sense of disappointment – and missed opportunity – hangs over even those who backed Yunus.</p><p>“We wanted a national unity government,” Bhuiyan added. “That wasn’t possible. Still, we expected a rigorous overhaul of the state.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4288424\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4288424\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4288424\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2024-08-08T092308Z_993351806_RC2KB9AXEZ2X_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-PROTESTS-1770218297.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Yunus meets student leaders\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4288424\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Muhammad Yunus, who was recommended by Bangladeshi student leaders to be the head of the interim government in Bangladesh, meets student leaders as he arrives at the Hazarat Shahjalal International Airport, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on August 8, 2024 [File: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"push-for-justice\">Push for justice</h2><p>To be sure, Yunus presided over one of the most ambitious and contested reform drives attempted by any interim government in Bangladesh’s history. In the absence of an elected parliament, his administration relied on experts to diagnose the failures of governance, document the abuses of power and propose structural fixes before holding a general election.</p><p>Supporters saw it as long overdue truth-telling. Critics saw an unelected government trying to do too much, too quickly.</p><p>Yunus’s administration set up multiple reform and inquiry commissions covering elections, constitution, judiciary, police, as well as the various rights abuses carried out under Hasina’s administration, including arrests of critics, extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.</p><p>The judiciary, which during Hasina’s rule was also accused of systemic repression, assumed a more independent role and ordered the trial of several politicians, army generals, police officers and other security officials who were implicated in past abuses. Late last year, Hasina was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity and convicted in other cases, while several other Hasina-linked officials also faced the wrath of the law.</p><p>Among Yunus’s most sensitive initiatives was confronting the issue of enforced disappearances and secret detentions under Hasina’s watch between 2009 and 2024.</p><p>The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, which he formed, documented 1,913 complaints, verified 1,569 cases, and identified 287 victims as either missing or dead, with most of those cases to security agencies, including the police, the Rapid Action Battalion, a notorious paramilitary sanctioned by the United States and the military intelligence.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, an adjunct fellow at Western Sydney University, who was himself abducted in Dhaka in November 2017 and returned home 44 days later after being left blindfolded on a highway, called the commission Yunus’s “most consequential intervention”.</p><p>“It showed that crimes under Sheikh Hasina were systematic,” Hasan said.</p><p>He credited Yunus with acknowledging Aynaghor or “house of mirrors” – as Hasina-era clandestine detention sites were called – and visiting suspected locations, despite resistance within the security establishment.</p><p>But Hasan also felt the commission could have a broader mandate, comparing it with a truth and reconciliation commission in post-dictatorship Argentina. “It [Bangladesh commission] was a success,” he said, “but it could have been a bigger one.”</p><p>The interim government under Yunus also engaged with the United Nations Human Rights Office, which confirmed that Bangladeshi security forces used excessive force during the July 2024 uprising, lending international weight to claims of serious violations.</p><p>Political analyst Dilara Choudhury thinks bureaucratic reforms were another area where expectations did not match the outcome during Yunus’s rule.</p><p>“There was an expectation that Yunus would confront an entrenched bureaucracy that routinely exercises power over citizens,” she told Al Jazeera. “But he failed to do so, constrained by structural resistance and the limits of an unelected mandate.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"referendum-on-reforms\">Referendum on reforms</h2><p>Yunus is using the February 12 vote to attempt something unprecedented in Bangladesh’s history: forging political consensus around key recommendations and putting them directly to voters through a nationwide referendum alongside the general election.</p><p>Yunus’s supporters argue that if the next government is to dismantle systems that enabled repression during Hasina’s abuse of power – from politicised courtrooms to unaccountable security forces – then the reforms require public consent.</p><p>If voters approve the charter, the next parliament will decide whether those reforms are to be implemented. If not, the reform initiatives may be shelved.</p><p>For analysts, that uncertainty defines Yunus’s legacy.</p><p>“He provided leadership at a moment when Bangladesh could have fallen apart,” said Hasan, the Sydney-based political analyst. “History will judge what survives after he leaves.”</p><p>Choudhury offered a different perspective. “Whether the initiatives he took ultimately succeed or fail is not the only measure,” she said. “He will remain a permanent figure in the nation’s history.”</p><p>Bangladesh’s political parties, however, remain divided on Yunus’s legacy as they seek to form an elected government later this month.</p><p>The frontrunner Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which had been demanding swift elections since Hasina’s fall, did not approve of an unelected government in command. On the other hand, the NCP and its ally, the Jamaat-e-Islami, favoured deeper reforms before an election was held.</p><p>BNP leader Salahuddin Ahmed acknowledged Yunus’s role in stabilising the country, but questioned how far an unelected government should have gone.</p><p>“There was a tendency to try to do everything within this short time,” Salahuddin told Al Jazeera. “Some of these issues could have been addressed later through parliament once an elected government was in place.”</p><p>He said law and order had been “largely under control, though not to expectations”, while economic stability remained fragile, with foreign investments largely stalled during the interim period.</p><p>Economists say that while macro indicators stabilised somewhat under Yunus, household-level distress persisted – with <a href=\"/features/2026/2/3/jobs-cash-loans-can-bangladeshs-parties-deliver-on-election-promises\">unemployment, stagnant wages and sluggish investment</a> keeping private sector confidence low and limiting the government’s capacity to generate growth and jobs.</p><p>Still, the BNP leader described Yunus’s decision to hold elections on February 12 as a “major achievement”, adding: “How much of what [reform agenda] he has initiated will be accepted or implemented by the next parliament remains an open question.”</p><p>The Jamaat-e-Islami, which supported Yunus’s appointment after Hasina’s fall, struck a similar note.</p><p>“He started the reform process and made significant progress,” Jamaat leader Abdul Halim said. “But reforms need time. This government’s achievements should be seen as a collective effort by all political forces.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4288431\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4288431\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4288431\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-01-28T083635Z_559596609_RC28AJANQU0D_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-1770218573.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh election\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4288431\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Women supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chant slogans as they join in an election campaign in Dhaka on January 28, 2026 [Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-country-of-the-blind\">‘A country of the blind’</h2><p>Among the student leaders who propped up Yunus, assessments blend respect with a degree of disappointment.</p><p>Islam, who also served as the acting head of the information ministry in the Yunus cabinet before forming the NCP a year ago, said Yunus’s intent was clear but political realities were unforgiving.</p><p>“He tried to create unity,” Islam said. “But his government was weak in political negotiations.”</p><p>Bhuiya agreed, saying Yunus succeeded internationally but struggled at home. “We needed stronger positions,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>For Sanjida Khan Deepti, however, Yunus will be remembered more for his government’s push for justice for the victims of the 2024 uprising. Deepti’s 17-year-old son Anas was killed by the police at the peak of the uprising in early August 2024.</p><p>Last month, a court sentenced former Dhaka police chief Habibur Rahman and others to death, while several officers received prison terms for their crackdown on the protesters.</p><p>“We gave our children’s lives in exchange for justice,” Deepti told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She insisted that Yunus should be remembered positively. “In a country of the blind, a mirror has no value,” she said. “How could one person finish so many tasks in such a short time?”</p><p>Back in the crawling traffic of Dhaka, Chaklader slowed his autorickshaw near the Bashundhara neighbourhood and turned around to share a family secret: his wife and daughter remain staunch supporters of Hasina’s banned Awami League party and he has failed in persuading them otherwise.</p><p>And that, he explains, is why he has little hope for the February 12 election.</p><p>“I will still vote,” he told Al Jazeera. “Not because I expect change, but because there is nothing else left to do. I don’t believe the election would alter my life – or the country – in any meaningful way.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Throughout 2025, a total of 14,891 cases were confirmed.</p><p>Some of the biggest outbreaks the PAHO highlighted were unfolding in North America, with countries like the United States, Mexico and Canada facing high numbers of cases.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-measles\">What is measles?</h2><p>Measles is a highly contagious airborne virus capable of infecting nine out of every 10 people exposed to it, if they are unvaccinated.</p><p>In most cases, symptoms of the disease clear up within several weeks. However, measles can be deadly or cause life-altering health complications, particularly among young children.</p><p>Some sufferers find themselves with ear infections and lung inflammation. Others experience pneumonia or encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that can cause lasting damage, including seizures and memory loss.</p><p>The only way to prevent measles and halt its spread is by taking a vaccine. That care is often administered through a combination vaccine known by the acronym MMR, for measles, mumps and rubella.</p><p>Doctors typically advise patients to get vaccinated early. For healthy children, the general guidance is to receive the first MMR dose before 15 months of age. The second and final dose is recommended before age six.</p><p>The MMR vaccine is widely considered safe. But in countries like the US, vaccination rates have fallen in recent years, in part due to conspiracy theories and misleading statements.</p><p>The country’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, for instance, has previously asserted that the vaccine “wanes very quickly”, despite the fact that it offers lifelong protection.</p><p>Kennedy has also claimed there were health risks associated with the vaccine. But experts, including at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have repeatedly maintained that most people encounter no serious problems – and that the vaccine is far safer than exposure to measles itself.</p><p>“There have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people,” the Infectious Diseases Society of America says on its website.</p><h2 id=\"high-numbers-in-north-america\">High numbers in North America</h2><p>According to PAHO’s report on Wednesday, the US has seen 171 new cases of measles in the first three weeks of 2026. The country experienced a total of 2,242 cases in 2025.</p><p>One of the ongoing outbreaks has been in South Carolina, where <a href=\"https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-29-new-measles-cases-bringing-outbreak-total-876-new-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">876 incidents</a> of measles have been reported in recent months. Of that total, 800 sufferers were unvaccinated, 16 had only received a partial vaccination, and 38 had an unknown vaccination status.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Texas, an outbreak resulted in <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">762 cases</a> of measles between January and August. Two unvaccinated children died in that outbreak, and there were 99 hospitalisations.</p><p>In 2000, measles had been declared eliminated from the US, a sign that cases were no longer spreading domestically, though some cases did occur after exposure to the virus abroad.</p><p>Mexico, too, had achieved its measles elimination status in 1996, after an extensive vaccination campaign. The entire Americas region <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/news/27-9-2016-region-americas-declared-free-measles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was declared</a> measles-free in 2016.</p><p>But both the US and Mexico risk seeing their measles elimination status revoked, as outbreaks continue.</p><p>In Mexico, for instance, there were 6,428 cases of measles in 2025, the highest of any country in the Americas. For the first three weeks of 2026, there have been 740 more cases.</p><p>PAHO typically determines which countries have elimination status, and the organisation has indicated that it will review the situation in the US and Mexico during a virtual <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/news/16-1-2026-measles-elimination-status-united-states-and-mexico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meeting</a> on April 13.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/why-has-canada-lost-its-measles-free-status-and-could-the-us-be-next\">Canada</a>, meanwhile, already saw its measles elimination status <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rescinded</a> in November. It has seen several measles outbreaks since October 2024.</p><p>PAHO found that there were 5,436 cases of measles last year, and 67 in the first three weeks of 2026.</p><p>The country can win back its elimination status only if it stops measles transmissions resulting from its outbreaks for more than one year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Out of 435 seats, 218 are held by Republicans, and 214 by Democrats.</p><p>Texas, a Republican stronghold, proceeded to approve a newly revamped congressional map in August, overcoming a walkout by Democratic legislators.</p><p>That, in turn, prompted Newsom to launch a ballot initiative in California to counteract the Texas effort.</p><p>Just as the new Texas congressional map was designed to increase Republican seats by five, the California ballot initiative, known as Proposition 50, was also positioned to increase Democratic representation by five.</p><p>Voters in California passed the initiative overwhelmingly in a November special election, temporarily suspending the work of an independent redistricting commission that had previously drawn the state’s congressional maps.</p><p>Newsom, a possible 2028 presidential contender, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/5/california-proposition-50-on-redistricting-set-to-pass-in-blow-to-trump\">framed Proposition 50</a> as a means of fighting “fire with fire”.</p><p>The new map approved under Proposition 50, however, will only be in place through the 2030 election, and Newsom has pledged to repeal it, should Republicans in Texas do the same with their new map.</p><h2 id=\"debate-over-gerrymandering\">Debate over gerrymandering</h2><p>The push to redistrict for partisan gain — a process known as gerrymandering — has long faced bipartisan pushback as an attack on democratic values.</p><p>Normally, redistricting happens every 10 years, after a new census is taken, to reflect population changes.</p><p>But this mid-decade redistricting battle comes before the pivotal 2026 midterm elections, which are slated to be a referendum on Trump’s second term as president. Trump has already expressed fear that he might be impeached, should Congress switch to Democratic control.</p><p>Partisan gerrymandering is not necessarily illegal, unless it purposefully disenfranchises voters on the basis of their race. That, in turn, is seen as a violation of the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, an important piece of civil rights legislation from 1965.</p><p>In response to the passage of Proposition 50, Republicans in California sued Newsom and other state officials in an effort to overturn the new congressional map.</p><p>They argued the new map was created “specifically to favor Hispanic voters” and would dilute the representation of Republican voters in the state.</p><p>The Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/trump-administration-joins-lawsuit-against-californias-redistricting-maps\">joined the lawsuit</a> on November 13, backing the state Republicans.</p><p>But Bonta, the California attorney general, argued the redistricting process was legal. In court filings, he also maintained that Trump’s backing of the lawsuit was driven by self-interest.</p><p>“The obvious reason that the Republican Party is a plaintiff here, and the reason that the current federal administration intervened to challenge California’s new map while supporting Texas’s defense of its new map, is that Republicans want to retain their House majority for the remainder of President Trump’s term,” his court filing said.</p><p>Bonto also called on the Supreme Court not to “step into the political fray, granting one political party a sizeable advantage” by overturning Proposition 50.</p><p>The victory for California Democrats on Wednesday comes as redistricting fights continue across the country.</p><p>Already, states like North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri have adopted new congressional maps to favour Republicans. There has been pushback, though.</p><p>In December, Indiana’s Republican-led legislature <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/indianas-state-senate-votes-down-redistricting-bill-despite-trump-pressure\">voted down</a> a partisan redistricting measure, despite pressure from Trump to pass it.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The special election is scheduled for April 16.</p><p>However, UDP’s strategy appears focused on Malinowski; neither AIPAC nor its super PAC has explicitly endorsed candidate Tahesha Way, the former lieutenant governor of New Jersey, although she has won the endorsement of another pro-Israel lobby group, the Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI).</p><p>“It may be [AIPAC’s] sense is that this is a way to scare those in the middle of the road, who have started to express some concerns about what’s going on and the funding that’s being sent to Israel,” Jaffer said.</p><p>“It seems very excessive … but it may be an investment in trying to intimidate others who are watching,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"a-familiar-strategy\">A familiar strategy</h2><p>Parts of the strategy have become familiar. In the US elections in 2024, the UDP poured about $35m into party primaries, with the biggest buys aimed at scuttling Democratic candidates who called for cutting off aid to Israel.</p><p>That included a combined $24m against progressive congressmembers <a href=\"/video/upfront/2022/11/11/jamaal-bowman-on-us-midterms-and-the-democratic-partys-future\">Jamaal Bowman</a> and <a href=\"/news/2024/8/7/cori-bush-loses-democratic-primary-after-huge-campaign-by-pro-israel-groups\">Cori Bush</a>, who both lost their races to opponents running to their right.</p><p>Like the messaging targeting those candidates, the advertisement campaign against Malinowski has not specifically referenced Israel; instead, it focuses on more domestic issues, including Malinowski’s past stock trades and his 2019 vote in support of an annual Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill.</p><p>The line of criticism comes as support for US immigration, and the DHS sub-agency ICE, has tanked among Democratic voters amid the administration of US President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/us-border-security-chief-withdrawing-700-immigration-agents-from-minnesota\">mass deportation drive</a>.</p><p>Usamah Andrabi, the communications director of Justice Democrats, an organisation that supports progressive candidates regularly targeted by AIPAC, called the approach particularly disingenuous, noting that AIPAC had previously endorsed Malinowski despite the DHS funding vote.</p><p>During his previous three runs for Congress, Malinowski received more than $378,000 from pro-Israel groups, including those affiliated with AIPAC.</p><p>“It’s interesting, as always, to see that again you’re not going to see a single television ad actually talking about their, quote ‘single issue’: Israel,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Tom Malinowski is no champion for progressive values or for the Palestinian people, but he is not going to ask ‘how high?’ when they say, ‘jump’,” Andrabi told Al Jazeera. “And that’s not enough for AIPAC. They truly demand unconditional support for their policies.”</p><p>Malinowski had previously served as Washington director of Human Rights Watch, which, during his tenure, lobbied for US aid not to be used in Israeli abuses of Palestinian rights.</p><p>But as a congressman from 2019 to 2023, Malinowski took a distinctly divergent path in Congress, including petitioning against conditioning US aid to Israel.</p><p>Malinowski, who also served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labour under former President Barack Obama, has further enraged pro-Palestine advocates by suggesting that using the terms “genocide” and “apartheid” to describe Israel’s approach towards Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank fuels anti-Jewish sentiment in the US.</p><p>Nevertheless, the candidate has become a vocal critic of AIPAC’s approach in advance of Thursday’s vote, condemning the “dark-money” influence on the race.</p><p>“I committed one sin in their minds,” Malinowski told a small group of supporters in mid-January, as reported by the New Jersey Globe news site.</p><p>“I was not willing to tell them that I would unconditionally, unquestionably, blindly support any request for assistance that Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu of Israel might make. That position puts me in the mainstream, not just of all Americans, but of the Jewish and pro-Israel community in this country,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"a-sour-taste\">‘A sour taste’</h2><p>The UDP’s spending has also been condemned by other pro-Israel lobbying groups, including J Street, which supports Israel, but has staunchly criticised providing a “blank cheque” to the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p><p>“It weakens bipartisan support, alienates the next generation – Jewish and non-Jewish alike – and ties Israel’s fate to the most corrosive elements of American politics,” Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the group, which has endorsed Malinowski, said in a January post on Substack.</p><p>AIPAC and UDP did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment on the spending initiative’s objectives.</p><p>But Beth Miller, the political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, which advocates for Palestinian justice through US policy, saw the attack on Malinowski as in line with AIPAC’s increasing embrace of the Republican Party, which remains staunchly pro-Israel. She pointed to UDP’s history of relying on donations from wealthy conservatives to influence Democratic primaries.</p><p>Former assembly member Jaffer noted that the super PAC had not targeted Analilia Mejia, a progressive in the race who has won endorsements from US Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Some analysts have suggested AIPAC may see a win-win approach in targeting Malinowski, either leading to the success of a candidate like Way, who led the New Jersey-Israel Commission and has been embraced by many right-wing Israeli news outlets, or a candidate like Mejia, who could be seen as more vulnerable against a Republican in the general election.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Miller said the spending “should show every other candidate that there is no middle or centrist lane that will protect them from AIPAC spending attacks”.</p><p>“Democratic candidates watching the [New Jersey] special election should learn that the politically and morally correct move is to fully embrace Palestinian rights and demand an end to US complicity in Israel’s apartheid and genocide,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Both Justice Democrats’ Andrabi and Jaffer, meanwhile, saw potential for the approach to backfire, particularly as AIPAC has become an increasingly toxic brand in some segments of the Democratic Party.</p><p>“It’s definitely the most I’ve heard people who are not particularly interested in Israel-Palestine talking about AIPAC,” Jaffer told Al Jazeera, adding that outside spending in the race has left a “sour taste” for some New Jersey residents.</p><p>Andrabi added that it was “interesting to see the moderates of the world and the corporate Dems becoming willing to comment on [AIPAC] now that one of their own is getting eaten alive by this spending”.</p><p>That comes as AIPAC and UDP have amassed a $100m war chest heading into 2026.</p><p>“What [AIPAC] is really doing is expanding the base of people who don’t like AIPAC and who will vote against candidates for being supported by AIPAC,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I spoke with them every day despite how hard calls and internet access were.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>From Egypt to Rafah </strong></p><p>Rotana and Huda found out that they would be allowed to return to Gaza the day before the crossing partially opened on Monday.</p><p>They were contacted by the Palestinian embassy in Cairo, which gave them the news that they were among the names on the first list of those crossing.</p><p>The reopening of the crossing is part of the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, which the United States said <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/us-declares-phase-two-of-gaza-ceasefire-but-what-did-phase-one-deliver\">had begun in mid-January</a>, despite the continuation of Israeli attacks on Gaza.</p><p>Rafah is the only border crossing from Gaza that does not cross Israeli territory. But it has been largely closed since Israeli forces took control of it in May 2024.</p><p>Multiple returnee testimonies indicate that the crossing is functioning only partially, allowing very small numbers of people to use it on each side.</p><p>Reports from the opening days show that some travellers were sent back at the Palestinian side of the crossing, despite having already cleared Egyptian procedures, often for unspecified “security screening” reasons, or over the size of their luggage, without a detailed official explanation from Israeli authorities.</p><p>According to Egyptian officials, roughly 50 people reached the Palestinian side of the crossing on Tuesday, but Israeli authorities forcibly returned 38 of them, permitting only 12 to enter Gaza after extensive searches, detentions, and interrogations.</p><p>Rotana describes approximately 50 travellers being present on the Egyptian side of the crossing on Monday.</p><p>After completing procedures there, the group waited for hours for the Palestinian side of the gates, under the control of Israel, to open, a delay that lasted until evening hours.</p><p>But even then, not everyone was allowed to pass.</p><p>“At first, they let nine people through and told [others] to wait. A little later, they let [some of us] pass, but the rest were sent back,” she said, adding that she believed Israel was behind the decision.</p><p>Egyptian media – citing Egyptian officials – also reported that roughly 50 people reached the Palestinian side of the crossing on Tuesday, but that Israeli authorities forcibly returned 38 of them, permitting only 12 to enter Gaza after extensive searches, detentions, and interrogations.</p><p>Since its partial reopening on Monday, the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza has allowed only very limited movement.</p><p>In the first days of operation, just more than 120 people have crossed according to the Gaza Ministry of Interior – the majority of them returning to Gaza – while dozens more, including patients in need of urgent medical care, were prevented from crossing.</p><p>Palestinian health authorities report that tens of thousands remain on waiting lists, including more than 18,500 patients requiring specialised treatment unavailable inside Gaza, as a result of Israel’s devastation of the enclave.</p><p>Israel has framed the restrictions as being necessary for security reasons.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"body-searches-and-interrogation\">Body searches and interrogation</h2><p>Finally, by Monday evening, Rotana and Huda were able to cross to the Palestinian side, where the European Union Border Assistance Mission for the Rafah Crossing Point (EUBAM Rafah) are operating.</p><p>Rotana thought that their ordeal was finally over – and that she would finally be able to reunite with her children and husband. Instead, she met a new phase of hardship.</p><p>“They put us into a vehicle flanked by Israeli army cars, one in front and one behind and then stopped us in an open area,” she said.</p><p>There, Rotana and the others were subjected to full-body searches carried out by a woman accompanied by two men who identified themselves as part of “counterterrorism forces” – an apparent reference to <a href=\"/features/2025/12/4/who-was-yasser-abu-shabab-israel-backed-militia-leader-killed-in-gaza\">Palestinian militias</a> working with the Israeli military in Gaza.</p><p>“One of them told us they were fighting terrorism and lived in a ‘humanitarian city’, welcoming anyone who wanted to join them,” she added.</p><p>“I didn’t engage with his remarks, and then they began scolding us because we wanted to return to Gaza.”</p><p>Following this, Rotana was taken for interrogation by an Israeli military officer, which she said lasted for three hours. “It was interrogation, pressure, and degrading language,” she recounted.</p><p>Rotana said she and the others were insulted by the officer, who attempted to provoke them, and called them “humiliated”.</p><p>She remembered being asked, “Why did you come back to Gaza? Do you want to live in a tent without water or electricity? Or on a roof that doesn’t exist?”</p><p>“I tried to hold myself together and not let his words affect me,” she said.</p><p>Huda described having her hands bound and eyes covered before she, too, was interrogated.</p><p>“[An Israeli soldier] even told me to tell my family to prepare immediately for forced relocation from Gaza,” she said, referencing the threat by the Israeli right-wing to force Palestinians to leave Gaza in what would be ethnic cleansing.</p><p>During her own two hours of detention, Huda was separated from her daughter and said the experience was frightening.</p><p>“I was terrified. The place around me was dark and empty like a desert, and I didn’t know where they had taken Rotana and the other women, until they released me and I saw them again in the bus,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"return\">Return</h2><p>In a press <a href=\"https://en.icspr.ps/opening-of-the-rafah-crossing-a-partial-humanitarian-step-under-israeli-restrictions-and-systematic-humiliation-measures/6835/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, the International Commission to Support Palestinian People’s Rights (ICSPR) strongly condemned the strict Israeli restrictions on the operation of the crossing, saying that they had turned “travel and return [to Gaza] into a symbolic procedure that falls short of a genuine and comprehensive opening”.</p><p>The ICSPR added that Israeli restrictions – including requiring pre-approved security clearances, imposing strict passenger quotas, and enforcing complex procedures for travel – had turned the Rafah crossing “into a tool of control and domination rather than a humanitarian passage”.</p><p>The organisation also condemned the treatment of Palestinians at the crossing, including beatings, humiliating body searches, prolonged handcuffing, confiscation of personal belongings, and threats of arrest.</p><p>When Rotana and Huda were finally allowed to continue their journey, they found that Israeli forces had confiscated nearly all of what they had packed for the children.</p><p>“I brought toys and headphones for my daughters … things to make them happy,” Rotana said.</p><p>“They took everything. Even food was forbidden,” she explained. “I had promised my children sweets, something to celebrate with after months of hardship, but they took all of it.”</p><p>Despite it all, reuniting with Rotana’s children – Huda’s grandchildren – was at the forefront of their minds.</p><p>“I returned with my daughter even before I completed my treatment because her children couldn’t bear to be apart from her any longer,” Huda told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“In the end, we are returning to our country no matter what, so why were we treated this way?”</p><p>After a long and exhausting day, Rotana and her mum arrived in Gaza late at night on Monday, at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.</p><p>“The journey was deadly … but thank God, we finally arrived and reunited with our loved ones,” Rotana said calmly.</p><p>“What happened to us was an attempt to discourage us from returning to our land. But where would we go? This is our home, no matter what.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

A reward for his capture was set at 5 billion Colombian pesos, equivalent to $1.37m.</p><p>The other two “kingpins” included top rebel commanders identified only by their aliases: Ivan Mordisco and Pablito.</p><p>The public announcement echoes a private one cemented during a closed-door meeting on Tuesday at the White House, when Petro met United States President Donald Trump in person for the first time.</p><p>For months, Trump has pressured the Petro administration to take more “aggressive action” to combat narcotics trafficking out of Colombia.</p><p>In response, Petro and his team presented the Trump administration on Tuesday with a dossier on their counter-narcotics operations titled, “Colombia: America’s #1 Ally Against Narcoterrorists”.</p><p>The presentation featured statistics on cocaine seizures, programmes to eradicate coca crops, and the high-level arrests and killings of drug lords.</p><p>But the commitment to collaborate with the US in the pursuit of Chiquito Malo’s arrest has thrown negotiations with the EGC into peril.</p><p>It has also raised questions about the future of Petro’s signature policy, “Total Peace”, which was designed to open talks with rebel groups and criminal networks in an effort to halt Colombia’s six-decade-long internal conflict.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>The EGC is a major criminal group with almost 10,000 members, according to a recent report by the Ideas for Peace Foundation.</p><p>In December, the US also <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/us-officially-labels-colombias-egc-group-a-terrorist-organization\">designated</a> the group as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, as part of its ongoing efforts to crack down on drug trafficking.</p><p>The EGC has been engaged in high-level discussions with the Colombian government in Doha since September 2025. The two parties signed a “commitment to peace” on December 5, which outlined a roadmap to the EGC putting down arms.</p><p>The first step towards demobilisation was for the group to gather its forces in temporary zones, beginning in March. The government had suspended arrest warrants in December for EGC commanders, including Chiquito Malo, who were due to move to these areas.</p><p>But the government’s plans to detain the drug lord, declared yesterday at the White House, destabilised this process, according to analysts.</p><p>“[The EGC] interpret this as a direct threat where, if any commander who has arrest warrants … goes to the temporary zones, he runs a high risk,” said Gerson Arias, a conflict and security investigator at the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a Bogota-based think tank.</p><p>The Colombian Supreme Court in January approved Chiquito Malo’s extradition to the US in the eventuality of his capture, but the final decision to extradite him resides with the president.</p><p>By declaring the drug lord a “target” at the White House, Petro signalled support for capturing and extraditing the EGC commander.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Potential US involvement in the operation also appears to have unsettled the criminal organisation, according to experts.</p><p>“It is very different for Chiquito Malo to be pursued solely by the Colombian government than for him to become a target of joint strategic value involving US intelligence,” said Laura Bonilla, a deputy director at the Peace and Reconciliation Foundation, a Colombian think tank.</p><p>Although the EGC suspended its peace talks on Wednesday, it stressed that it remained open to resuming negotiations.</p><p>“It should be clarified that the suspension is temporary, not permanent, which indicates that they [the talks] will resume shortly,” a lawyer for the group, Ricardo Giraldo, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Giraldo added that, for talks to continue, the EGC requires that “legal and personal security guarantees” and “the commitments agreed upon in Doha, Qatar, are fulfilled”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We’ll do a better agreement.”</p><p>Trump has also called for China to be involved in any future nuclear talks.</p><p>Russia and the US’s nuclear arsenal accounts for more than 90 percent of all nuclear weapons in the world.</p><p>As of January 2025, Russia had 4,309 nuclear warheads, and the US had 3,700. France and the United Kingdom, who are treaty-bound US allies, have 290 and 225 warheads each, while China has about 600.</p><h2 id=\"fears-of-new-arms-race\">Fears of new arms race</h2><p>Security experts say the end of New START risks fuelling a global arms race that has been unfolding gradually for some time now, including in China.</p><p>Miles Pomper, a senior fellow at the James Martin Center for Non-proliferation Studies, said China has tripled its nuclear arsenal over the past decade, while Russia has expanded its short-range weapons following the collapse of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty during Trump’s first term.</p><p>“The US has actually not been building up its arsenal,” he told Al Jazeera. “So in a sense, this arms race… has been underway for some time. I don’t think that it will necessarily accelerate rapidly now. But I think the US in particular would like to have the same to be able to match some of the Chinese increases over time,” he said.</p><p>As the clock ticked towards the treaty’s expiry on Thursday, Pope Leo urged both sides to not abandon the limits set in the treaty.</p><p>“I issue an urgent appeal not to let this instrument lapse,” the first US-born pope said at his weekly audience. “It is more urgent than ever to replace the logic of fear and distrust with a shared ethic, capable of guiding choices toward the common good.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>United Nations ‌Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called the expiration of the ‍New START treaty ‍a grave moment for international peace and security and urged Moscow and Washington to negotiate a new nuclear arms control framework without delay.</p><p>“For the first time in more than half ‍a century, we ⁠face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the Russian Federation and the United States of America – the two States that possess the overwhelming majority of the global stockpile of nuclear weapons,” Guterres said in a statement.</p><p>He said the dissolution of decades of ​achievement in arms control “could not come at a ‌worse time – the risk of a nuclear weapon being used is the highest in decades”.</p><p>At the same time, Guterres said there was now an opportunity “to ‌reset and create an arms control regime fit for a rapidly evolving context” and welcomed ‌the appreciation by the leaders of both Russia ⁠and the US of the need to prevent a return to a world of unchecked nuclear proliferation.</p><p>“The world now looks to the Russian Federation ‌and the United States to translate words into action,” Guterres said.</p><p>“I urge both states to return to the negotiating table without delay ‍and to agree upon a successor framework that restores verifiable limits, reduces risks, and strengthens our common security.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

All that’s left to [Israel] is the freedom to kill Palestinians, and with Qatar, Turkiye and Egypt now being involved in Gaza, over Israel’s objection, it won’t be allowed to do that for much longer.”</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>While senior Israeli figures including Netanyahu are liaising directly with the Trump administration over a possible attack on Iran, analysts say it is increasingly clear that Israel’s ability to shape regional developments is diminished.</p><p>After two years of genocide in Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 71,800 Palestinians, the US now appears to have taken the lead and has overruled Israel when it objected to the admission of Turkiye and Qatar to the board that will oversee the administration of Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In Syria, Israeli ambitions to hobble the new government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa also appear to have fallen foul of Trump’s White House, which is actively <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/israel-syria-agree-to-dedicated-communication-line-in-us-brokered-talks\">pushing </a>the Netanyahu government to reach an accommodation with Damascus. In Lebanon, too, the US continues to play a defining role in determining Israeli actions, with any possible confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel said to be dependent upon Washington’s green light.</p><p>What influence Israel could wield over US action in Iran, according to many, is uncertain, even to the point that Washington could enter negotiations with no regard for Israeli concerns.</p><p>“There’s a worry that Donald Trump will not strike in Iran, which will continue to endanger Israel, and instead negotiate a conclusion that’s good for him as a peacemaker and leave the regime in place,” Netanyahu’s former aide from the early 90s and political pollster, Mitchell Barak, told Al Jazeera from West Jerusalem. “He’s transactional. That’s what he does. It’ll be like Gaza. Israel will secure their ultimate victory, then lose control to the US, whose interests – under Trump – don’t always align with ours.”</p><h2 id=\"big-bad-wolf\">‘Big Bad Wolf’</h2><p>While analysts’ expectations that Netanyahu could influence Trump’s actions in Iran may be limited, their sense that a fresh war would buy the Israeli prime minister relief from his current difficulties seems universal.</p><p>“Iran is Israel’s ‘Big Bad Wolf’,” Chatham House’s Yossi Mekelberg said of the geopolitical opponent that many in Israel believe exists only to ensure Israel’s destruction.</p><p>Mekelberg added that a war with Iran would serve as a useful distraction from Netanyahu’s domestic troubles, such as an inquiry into government failures related to the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, his attempt to weaken the oversight powers of the judiciary, and his ongoing corruption trials.</p><p>“There’s a saying in Hebrew: ‘the righteous have their work done by others.’ I’m not for a moment saying that Netanyahu is righteous, but I’m sure he’s keen on having his work done by others,” Mekelberg said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"war-fears\">War fears</h2><p>How much public appetite there may be for a confrontation with Iran is unclear.</p><p>Israel was able to heavily damage Iran during the conflict it started in June last year. But Iran was also able to repeatedly pierce Israel’s defences, making it clear that the Israeli public is not safe from the wars its state pursues in the region.</p><p>The threat – rather than the reality – of a confrontation with Iran also serves the prime minister’s ends, Goldberg noted. “Netanyahu has no need for a war. He doesn’t really need to do anything other than survive, which he’s proven adept at,” the analyst said, referring to the absence of any credible political rival, as well as the risk that an actual war may highlight Israel’s diplomatic weakness in its dealings with the US.</p><p>“There’s this joke phrase that became popular with those resisting Netanyahu’s judicial reform: ‘This time he’s done’,” Goldberg said. “Netanyahu’s never done. He committed a genocide, and all people in Israel can object to is the management of it. He’s currently losing military and diplomatic influence across the region, and few are noticing. I can’t imagine that this will be ‘it’ either.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
