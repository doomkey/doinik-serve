            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Two weeks ago, incumbent Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani announced his withdrawal from the premiership race. Amid political negotiations following the November elections, this move effectively paved the way for former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to return to power.</p><p>This development is not just an act of political recycling; it reflects the failure of Iraqi state-building after the United States invasion of 2003. Under al-Maliki, Iraq may well go back to the disastrous policies that in 2014 led to the rise of ISIL (ISIS).</p><h2 id=\"sectarian-politics\">Sectarian politics</h2><p>In reflecting on what al-Maliki’s return could possibly mean for Iraq, it is important to examine his track record. In 2006, when he was first nominated for the prime minister’s post, the administration of US President George W Bush supported him. Washington did so in the name of stability and trust, despite the early red flags. By November 2006, just six months after al-Maliki came to power, US National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley was already raising concerns about his ability to rein in violence against the Sunni population.</p><p>The decision by the Bush administration to continue its support for the prime minister reflects its own record of misguided policies, driven by ignorance of the region and its history. By backing al-Maliki, Washington paved the way for the chaos and instability it sought to avert.</p><p>During his first two terms, al-Maliki established a governance template that deliberately dismantled the post-2003 settlement’s vision of inclusive politics. He pursued policies of deliberate exclusion of the Sunni population on the political and social levels under the guise of de-Baathification. While originally intended to remove Saddam Hussein’s loyalists, the process was weaponised by al-Maliki as a sectarian tool. In 2010, for example, the prime minister used a de-Baathification law to ban nine parties and more than 450 candidates — predominantly Sunnis — from the parliamentary elections.</p><p>The security apparatus under his leadership also carried out arrests of moderate Sunni politicians on trumped-up charges of “terrorism” and suppressed peaceful demonstrations.</p><p>The 2013 massacre in the town of al-Hawija, in Kirkuk province, is a case in point. In January of that year, scores of Sunnis gathered for a peaceful protest of the discriminatory policies of al-Maliki’s government that lasted weeks. Three months later, security forces attacked the protest sit-in,<a href=\"/news/2013/5/4/iraq-pressured-to-step-up-raid-probe\"> killing at least 44 protesters</a>.</p><p>Under al-Maliki, Baghdad also witnessed the deliberate displacement of Sunnis from their homes and the consolidation of Shia-dominated areas. This was a form of demographic engineering with the full support and complicity of the state.</p><p>As a result of these policies, sectarian politics escalated to the point where ethnic and religious identity became the main dividers of society, undermining national unity and plunging the country into civil conflict.</p><p>The constant assault on Sunni communities generated widespread discontent, which was easily exploited by extremist organisations – first al-Qaeda and then ISIL (ISIS).</p><h2 id=\"corruption-and-mismanagement\">Corruption and mismanagement</h2><p>The industrial-scale haemorrhaging of national wealth during the al-Maliki era was nothing short of staggering. The Iraqi parliament’s own transparency commission <a href=\"/video/2018/5/8/iraq-corruption-watchdog-320bn-stolen-over-15-years\">estimated</a> in 2018 that by then, $320bn had been lost to corruption since the US invasion; al-Maliki was in power for eight of those 15 years.</p><p>The money was used to fund the extravagant lifestyles of those close to al-Maliki, the purchase of expensive real estate, and deposits in shell companies and secret bank accounts. All of this is not a matter of administrative dysfunction but of large-scale thievery.</p><p>Iraq’s Federal Commission of Integrity carried out extensive documentation of such malpractices, but to this day, no one has been held accountable. Under al-Maliki, the independence of the judiciary was destroyed, rendering any process of accountability impossible.</p><p>Mismanagement also extended to the security and military forces. For years, the army was paying salaries to “ghost soldiers”; by 2014, the bill for this corruption scheme had grown <a href=\"/news/2014/12/1/iraq-pm-sacks-officials-over-ghost-soldiers\">to $380m a year</a>. The prime minister himself <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/02/02/133440159/group-claims-iraq-secret-prison-in-operation\">was found </a>to be running his own prison and commanding a special force of 3,000 soldiers loyal to him.</p><p>Years of corruption and dysfunction within the Iraqi army amid nearly $100bn in US funding led to the disaster of 2014, when military units dispersed in the face of advancing ISIL (ISIS) forces.</p><h2 id=\"al-maliki-s-return\">Al-Maliki’s return</h2><p>Al-Maliki did not spend the past 11 years in political isolation. Instead, he was at the centre of the political machinery, plotting and lining up all the necessary components for his ultimate return under the watch of successive US administrations.</p><p>A third term for him would likely deepen sectarian divisions and entrench corruption. Iraqi governance will continue to be undermined by his tendencies to create shadow power structures in which loyalists are empowered at the expense of institutions.</p><p>Al-Maliki’s return would also be significant regionally. After the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and the serious weakening of Hezbollah, Iraq has become Iran’s most critical regional security and financial asset.</p><p>Iran’s position in the region has not been this vulnerable in decades, but al-Maliki’s return would effectively preclude Iraq from embarking on a more independent path from Tehran in its domestic and foreign affairs.</p><p>His third term would also likely obstruct normalisation with Damascus. Al-Maliki has vocally opposed engaging Syria’s new leadership. Last year, he voiced his opposition to interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa attending the Arab League Summit in Baghdad and described him as “wanted by Iraqi courts on terrorism charges”.</p><p>In parallel, a new al-Maliki government would also pose a challenge to US interests. The appointment of Mark Savaya as a special envoy to Iraq by the administration of US President Donald Trump, the first such appointment in 20 years, demonstrated its intent on pushing through policies aimed at curbing Iranian influence.</p><p>Washington wants the pro-Iranian Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) dismantled and fully integrated into the Iraqi army. Al-Maliki is unlikely to undertake such a move because he is the “godfather” of these parallel armed structures. Dismantling them would mean destroying his own creation and severing his ties with Iran.</p><p>The issue at stake, however, is not just what policies al-Maliki will pursue. It is also the fact that Iraq is not able to escape a political cycle that has brought it nothing but catastrophe. It shows that the Iraqi political elite has learned nothing from the 2014 crisis.</p><p>Sectarian mobilisation and kleptocratic politics are still valid political options. Iraqi youth have repeatedly taken to the streets to protest this deeply flawed and dysfunctional status quo. Without significant changes to the incentive structure, accountability system, and sectarian distribution of power, Iraq is doomed to repeat the same grave mistakes of the past.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has justified US actions in Venezuela as necessary to secure US security and economic interests.</p><p>The unclassified version of the NDS, which is released every four years, is uncharacteristically laden with photos of the defence secretary and president and repeatedly targets the administration of former President Joe Biden.</p><p>Under Biden, the Pentagon described “revisionist powers” like China and Russia as the “central challenge” to US security.</p><p>The NDS followed the release in December of the National Security Strategy, which argued that Europe is facing civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to US interests.</p><p>The NDS noted that Germany’s economy dwarfs Russia’s, arguing that, therefore, Washington’s NATO allies are “strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe’s conventional defense, with critical but more limited US support”.</p><p>The strategy blueprint noted that this includes taking the lead in supporting Ukraine’s defence.</p><p>The document also addressed the question of Iran, repeating the US position that Tehran cannot develop nuclear weapons.

Many NATO allies had already increased their defence spending and offered to provide security guarantees to Ukraine against Russian threats.</p><p>For South Korea and Japan, the US Defense Department recognised the “direct military threat” from North Korea, led by Kim Jong Un, and noted that Pyongyang’s “nuclear forces are increasingly capable of threatening the US Homeland”.</p><p>About 28,500 US soldiers are stationed in South Korea as part of a defence treaty to deter the North Korean military threat. Seoul has raised its defence budget by 7.5 percent for this year after pressure from Trump to share more of the defence burden.</p><p>The NDS noted that South Korea “is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea, with critical but more limited US support”, which could result in a reduction of US forces on the Korean Peninsula. “This shift in the balance of responsibility is consistent with America’s interest in updating US force posture on the Korean Peninsula,” the document said.</p><p>Harsh Pant, a geopolitical analyst based in New Delhi, said the defence strategy is line with the Trump administration’s push to get allies to take control of their own security.</p><p>“The Trump administration has been advocating that the relationship that they see now in terms of security cooperation with their allies is one where allies will have to bear a heavier burden and pay their share,” Pant told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“America’s allies in the Indo-Pacific will have to be much more cognisant of their own role in shaping the regional security architecture. America will be there, and it will continue to have an overarching presence, but it won’t foot the bill in ways that it has done in the past,” said Pant, who is the vice president of the Observer Research Foundation think tank.</p><p>North Korea routinely criticises the US military presence in South Korea and their joint military drills, which the allies say are defensive but which Pyongyang calls dress rehearsals for an invasion.</p><p>Seoul’s Ministry of National Defence said on Saturday that the US forces based in the country are the “core” of the alliance, adding: “We will be cooperating closely with the US to continue developing it in that direction.”</p><p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said: “It is inconceivable that South Korea – which spends 1.4 times North Korea’s gross domestic product on defence and possesses the world’s fifth largest military – cannot defend itself. Self-reliant national defence is the most fundamental principle amid an increasingly unstable international environment.”</p><p>Lee made the comments after visiting China this month in an effort to improve ties with the country, which is Seoul’s largest economic partner, its top destination for exports and a primary source of its imports. Seoul wants to cultivate better ties with Beijing, which wields influence over North Korea and its leader.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-taiwan\">What about Taiwan?</h2><p>When the previous NDS was unveiled under Biden in 2022, it said the most comprehensive and serious challenge to US national security was China’s “coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences”. A part of that strategy, Washington said at the time, was Beijing’s ambitions concerning Taiwan.</p><p>The Pentagon said four years ago that it “will support Taiwan’s asymmetric self-defense commensurate with the evolving [Chinese] threat and consistent with our one China policy”.</p><p>China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has threatened to take it by force if necessary. In a New Year’s address, Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/chinas-xi-says-reunification-with-taiwan-unstoppable\">pledged to achieve the “reunification” of China and Taiwan</a>, calling Beijing’s long-held goal “unstoppable”. Chinese forces have carried out wargames in the Taiwan Strait, which separates the two.</p><p>In this year’s NDS, the US Defense Department does not mention Taiwan by name.</p><p>“The American people’s security, freedom, and prosperity are …  directly linked to our ability to trade and engage from a position of strength in the Indo-Pacific,” the document said, adding that the Defense Department would “maintain a favourable balance of military power in the Indo-Pacific”, which it called “the world’s economic center of gravity”, to deter Chinese threats.</p><p>It said the US does not seek to dominate, humiliate or strangle China but “to ensure that neither China nor anyone else can dominate us or our allies”. Instead, the US wants “a decent peace, on terms favourable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under”, the blueprint said, adding that, therefore, the US would deter China by “strength, not confrontation”.</p><p>“We will erect a strong denial defense along the First Island Chain (FIC),” the NDS said, referring to the first chain of islands off the East Asian coast. “We will also urge and enable key regional allies and partners to do more for our collective defense.”</p><p>Pant said it would be a mistake on the part of China “to read this as America leaving its allies”. He added that “there is an undercurrent [in Trump’s foreign policy] of how America wants to see a stable balance of power in the Indo-Pacific where China is not the dominant force.”</p><p>“And I think, therefore, for China, if it reads this as a weakening of American commitment to its allies, that would not really be in consonance with the spirit of this defence strategy.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In another case, the father of a five-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a US citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a five-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.</p><p>The events have led to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/minnesota-sues-trump-administration-over-immigration-crackdown\">protests</a> and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain people? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public and private spaces, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?</p><p>Legal experts weighed in on the public’s constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.</p><h2 id=\"what-rights-do-people-have-when-approached-by-ice\">What rights do people have when approached by ICE?</h2><p>Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone, including immigrants suspected of being in the US illegally, is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution’s <a href=\"/news/2025/4/30/a-constitutional-loophole-how-phone-inspections-test-us-civil-rights\">Fourth Amendment</a>.</p><p>“All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,” said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specialising in immigration cases.</p><p>The Fourth Amendment doesn’t stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.</p><p>For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions – such as a brief detention that’s not a formal arrest – require a “reasonable suspicion” that someone has committed a crime or is in the US illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.</p><p>Reasonable suspicion “has to be more than a guess or a presumption”, said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed, or would be committed.</p><p>Agents must meet a higher bar to arrest someone. They need “probable cause”, which generally requires sufficient evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.</p><h2><span>What is a ‘Kavanaugh stop’?</span></h2><p>Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.</p><p>In the Noem vs Perdomo case of 2025, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favour of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles, California. Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity” could be used as a “relevant factor” in determining reasonable suspicion as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.</p><p>Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had “often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they ‘looked like an immigrant’ or were in a high-crime area”, Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh’s guidance, “it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile”.</p><p>Critics of Kavanaugh’s opinion “argue that the ‘relevant factor’ language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling”, said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.</p><p>But Kavanaugh’s opinion was not cosigned by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court “has not made a definitive ruling on ‘Kavanaugh stops’ and their permissibility”, said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.</p><p>Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump vs Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.</p><h2 id=\"do-people-s-rights-differ-inside-their-homes-versus-in-a-public-space\">Do people’s rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?</h2><p>The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.</p><p>“This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,” Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as when an officer encounters a violent crime in progress or someone needing medical care.</p><p>Securing a judicial warrant is time-consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. “It’s much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,” she said.</p><p>In the past, federal immigration officers would typically not enter homes forcibly if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE, without a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/us-judge-orders-curbs-on-ice-agents-actions-against-minnesota-protesters\">judge</a>’s approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>Specific ICE officials have the authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require “probable cause to believe” that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.</p><p>A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press news agency reported on January 22.</p><p>The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and “those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo”.</p><p>The memo dated May 12, 2025, signed by acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence” but added that “the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the US Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose”.</p><p>If this policy were to be challenged in court, it is unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.</p><h2 id=\"what-can-people-do-if-they-think-ice-has-infringed-on-their-fourth-amendment-rights\">What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?</h2><p>If one believes that their rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, their options for suing for compensation are limited.</p><p>Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil <a href=\"/features/2026/1/23/are-ice-agents-trained-to-shoot-and-evade-lawsuits\">lawsuits</a> against federal officials for violating people’s rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions before tightening them again.</p><p>Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley’s law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, “In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.”</p><p>David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p><p>Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: “It’s not an easy path, and most people can’t afford to retain a lawyer.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The eruption of fighting has rocked a nation trying to recover from nearly 14 years of war.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The truce extension has offered a respite as the army closed in on the last SDF strongholds last week. Al-Sharaa abruptly announced the ceasefire on January 17, giving the SDF until Saturday night to lay down its arms and come up with a plan to integrate itself into the army or to resume fighting.</p><p>The extension gives the SDF more time for such a plan.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Raqqa, said the ceasefire extension has been received positively in the region. “The news certainly lifted the mood of the residents here in Raqqa,” he said.</p><p>He added that locals said they want long-term stability with schools, which “have not been operational in a meaningful manner in a decade”, reopening in the region.</p><p>Basravi said the government aims to use the coming two weeks to “cement a long-term ceasefire and focus on reconstruction efforts”.</p><p>State media reported on Sunday that two young people were killed by SDF gunfire in northeastern Syria despite the ongoing ceasefire.</p><p>One person was killed in Hasakah and another one in a rural area in Qamishli, according to to the state media report.</p><p>Meanwhile, the SDF claimed that “Damascus factions” are launching attacks on villages located in the west of Kobani city, and al-Jalbia located in the southeast of the city.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"extension-after-truce-expires\">Extension after truce expires</h2><p>An hour before midnight – three hours after the four-day truce expired – on Saturday, the Ministry of Defence announced that its forces would cease military operations for a further 15 days to support an ongoing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-begins-transferring-isil-linked-detainees-from-syria-to-iraq\">US operation</a> to transfer ISIL (ISIS) detainees from SDF prisons in Syria to Iraq.</p><p>The SDF confirmed the extension, saying it was reached “through international mediation while dialogue with Damascus continues”.</p><p>“Our forces affirm their commitment to the agreement and their dedication to respecting it, which contributes to de-escalation, the protection of civilians, and the creation of the necessary conditions for stability,” it said in a statement.</p><p>Basravi said Syrians in Raqqa have been celebrating not only the extended truce but also the release of people there, including minors, from <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/syrian-govt-says-it-controls-prison-in-raqqa-with-isil-linked-detainees\">al-Aqtan prison</a> who locals said have been imprisoned on unjust charges.</p><p>“The Syrian administration here is going through all of those case logs and looking for anyone who is underage or unjustly accused,” Basravi said. “They are separating dangerous detainees, particularly the ISIL ones, from everyone else.”</p><p>Kurdish authorities who previously managed al-Aqtan prison said in a statement on Saturday that a section of it held juveniles “who were involved in crimes” as well as “others who had fallen victim to recruitment and exploitation by ISIS”.</p><p>“Due to security circumstances, the Prisons Administration transferred these juveniles approximately three months ago from the juvenile detention centre to al-Aqtan Prison,” the statement said, adding that they received special treatment in accordance with international standards during their time there.</p><h2 id=\"kobani-s-humanitarian-crisis\">Kobani’s humanitarian crisis</h2><p>Basravi noted that the international community has been worried about the humanitarian conditions in the Kurdish-majority city of Kobani, also known as Ain al-Arab, in northern Syria, where some of the SDF forces have withdrawn as the Syrian army advanced in the region.</p><p>He added that the United Nations in Syria and the government confirmed the arrival of a humanitarian convoy of 24 trucks carrying food, fuel and relief items in the city, which has been harshly impacted by the hostilities, suffering days without power and water.</p><p>Dilo Doman, an armed Kurdish volunteer in the northeastern SDF-held town of Hasakah, said fighters were deployed on the front line with “high morale”.</p><p>“As far as it takes, we will not attack, but they might attack,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We are ready if the war erupts.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"fraught-government-sdf-talks\">Fraught government-SDF talks</h2><p>Al-Sharaa, whose forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in a lightning offensive in late 2024, has promised to bring all of Syria under state control, including SDF-held areas in the northeast.</p><p>But Kurdish authorities, who have run autonomous civilian and military institutions there for the past decade, have resisted joining with state and military institutions.</p><p>After a year-end deadline for the merger passed with little progress, Syrian troops launched their offensive this month.</p><p>They swiftly captured two key Arab-majority provinces from the SDF, bringing key oilfields, hydroelectric dams and facilities holding ISIL fighters and affiliated civilians under government control.</p><p>Labib Nahhas, a Syrian political analyst, believes the ceasefire extension happened because the SDF has not decided what to do with its agreement with the Syrian government.</p><p>“It is no secret that there is a massive division in the leadership ranks of the organisation – between the PKK-linked elements and what we could call the more moderate elements within the leadership,” he told Al Jazeera from London, referring to the Turkiye-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which is designated as a “terrorist” group by Turkiye, the United States and European Union.</p><p>“There has not been a decision. There have not been any real confidence-building measures between the Syrian authorities and the SDF,” Nahhas said, adding that the two sides’ communications have been based on exchanging accusations in the past few days.</p><p>ISIL swept across Syria and Iraq in 2014, taking over vast swaths of both countries and declaring Raqqa its de facto capital, committing massacres and other atrocities before ultimately being vanquished by a United States-led coalition, in which the SDF did most of the fighting.</p><p>There have been concerns of a regional ISIL resurgence, especially in Syria, where the group has carried out deadly attacks on Syrian and US forces.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But all of Ukraine is tired of war. We want our children to have quiet nights – no drones, no explosions.”</p><p>Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this winter, causing <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/psychological-war-on-society-russia-plunges-ukraine-into-darkness\">mass power cuts</a> in the Ukrainian capital, during a <a href=\"/gallery/2026/1/16/photos-residents-of-kyiv-endure-freezing-conditions-due-to-power-outages\">bitter cold snap</a> that has left many residents without electricity and running water.</p><p>But war fatigue had long set in.

Either “Russia, as the aggressor, decides it wants the war to end, or enough pressure is placed on Moscow to force that decision”.</p><p>Neither of those options, he said, is likely to materialise until spring when Russia will have completed this phase of targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during the winter months.</p><p>He said Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to wear people down and sow “domestic chaos” but added that although people are exhausted, Ukraine has repeatedly shown an ability to adapt.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4264180\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4264180\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4264180\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSCF4043-1769327903.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Igor Novikov, former advisor to Volodymyr Zelenskyy sits in his Kyiv office [Nils Adler/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4264180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Igor Novikov, former adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, believes Russia is not interested in a peaceful end to the war [Nils Adler/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>The US-brokered meeting in the Gulf state ended without a breakthrough.</p><p>“A lot was discussed, and it is important that the conversations were constructive,” said Zelenskyy, who sent Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov, military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov and other officials to the meeting.</p><p>“The central focus of the discussions was the possible parameters for ending the war.

I want my child to be safe. I want to be able to take the lift to our 23rd-floor apartment, to swim in the Black Sea again,” she said. “But I also cannot accept giving up land that so many people died defending.

They said he worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse.</p><p>As of Saturday evening, the family said they had still not heard from anyone at a federal law enforcement agency about their son’s death.</p><p>In their statement, the family lambasted the Trump administration’s claim that their son had attacked the officers who shot him. “The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said.</p><p>The family added that videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when federal agents tackled him, but holding his phone with one hand and using the other to shield a woman who was being pepper-sprayed.</p><p>“Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,” they said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, the federal employees’ labour union AFGE said it was “deeply stricken by this tragedy” while its president, Everett Kelley, paid tribute to Pretti, saying he “dedicated his life to serving American veterans”.</p><p>The American Nurses Association also said it was “deeply disturbed and saddened” by the killing, and called for a “full, unencumbered investigation” into the case. Pretti’s colleague, Dr Dmitri Drekonja, told ABC News that it was “galling and enraging” to hear the way federal officials were portraying the victim.</p><p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz condemned Pretti’s killing as part of a “campaign of organised brutality”, while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged the Trump administration to end its immigration crackdown there.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-driving-the-tensions-in-minneapolis\">What’s driving the tensions in Minneapolis?</h2><p>Trump, a Republican, launched the immigration crackdowns last year, targeting Democrat-led states and cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, saying the militarised operations were necessary to remove criminals from the US.</p><p>The crackdown in Minneapolis is the largest federal immigration enforcement operation ever carried out, according to officials, with some 3,000 agents deployed. The operation began in November, with officials tying it in part to allegations of fraud involving residents of Somali origin.</p><p>The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers and now, the deaths of several US citizens. Amid the tensions, children are skipping school or learning remotely, families are avoiding religious services and many businesses, especially in immigrant neighbourhoods, have closed temporarily, according to media reports.</p><p>Pretti is at least the sixth person to die during ICE enforcement efforts nationwide since last year, the AP reported, and the incident was one of at least five shootings in January involving federal agents conducting anti-immigration operations, according to Reuters.</p><p>At least six people have also died in ICE detention centres since the start of 2026, Reuters reported, following at least 30 deaths in its custody last year, a two-decade high.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>By any measure, Gaza’s devastation demands urgent and serious reconstruction. Homes, hospitals, schools, farms, cultural heritage, and basic infrastructure lie in ruins. Entire neighbourhoods have been erased. The humanitarian need is undeniable. But urgency should never become an excuse for illusion, spectacle, or political shortcuts.</p><p>The contrast between rhetoric and reality could not be sharper. While United States President Donald Trump and a group of world leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland, to sign the charter of the so-called Board of Peace and unveil glossy reconstruction plans, the killing in Gaza continued.</p><p>Since the ceasefire came into effect on October 10, no fewer than 480 Palestinians have been killed. Four of them <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/1/22/live-trump-to-lead-signing-of-charter-for-gaza-board-of-peace-in-davos\">were killed</a> on the very day the charter was signed by 19 ministers and state representatives, many of whom were less interested in the issue of Gaza and much more in being seen alongside Trump.</p><p>Against that backdrop, the board’s carefully staged optimism feels like performance rather than transformation. It resembles a sandpit where those signing up get to build sandcastles with Trump that will wash away with the first real wave.</p><p>The proposals may look impressive and sound hopeful, but structurally, they are hollow. They sidestep the real drivers of the conflict, marginalise Palestinian agency, privilege Israeli military priorities over civilian recovery, and align uncomfortably with longstanding efforts to maintain the occupation, displace Palestinians, and deny the right of return for the population uprooted in 1948 and 1967.</p><h2 id=\"gaza-is-not-a-real-estate-prospectus\">Gaza is not a real estate prospectus</h2><p>The glossy vision of presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner treats Gaza not as a traumatised society emerging from catastrophic violence, but as a blank investment canvas for luxury housing, commercial zones, data hubs, beachfront promenades, and aspirational gross domestic product (GDP) targets.</p><p>It reads less like a recovery plan and more like a real-estate prospectus. Development language replaces political reality. Sleek presentations replace rights. Markets replace justice.</p><p>But Gaza is not a failed start-up looking for venture capital. It is home to more than two million Palestinians who have endured siege, displacement, repeated wars, and chronic insecurity for decades. Reconstruction cannot succeed if it is detached from their lived experiences or if it treats Gaza primarily as an economic asset open to speculative investment, including by extreme Zionists, rather than as a human community struggling to preserve its identity and social fabric.</p><p>For many families, even modest homes in Gaza’s formal refugee camps represented a fragile bridge worth holding on to as a step towards an eventual return to places from which they were forced to flee, in what is today known as Israel.</p><p>These homes were valued not for their comfort or market worth, but for the social networks they sustained and their symbolic links to continuity, memory, and political claims. Palestinians are therefore unlikely to be swayed by offers of glitzy towers, luxurious villas, or promises of a “market economy” under siege. Their experience over the past decades has taught them that no level of material improvement can substitute for deeper aspirations tied to dignity, rootedness, and the right of return.</p><h2 id=\"a-future-designed-without-palestinians\">A future designed without Palestinians</h2><p>A glaring flaw of Trump’s plan is the systematic exclusion of Palestinians themselves from shaping the vision of their future. These plans are unveiled in elite conference halls, not debated with the people whose neighbourhoods have been flattened.</p><p>Without Palestinian ownership, legitimacy collapses. Experience from Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere has shown repeatedly that reconstruction imposed from the outside — however well branded — reproduces the very power imbalances that fuel instability in the first place.</p><p>Equally troubling is the plan’s deliberate avoidance of addressing the root causes of Gaza’s suffering: occupation, blockade, and military control. You cannot rebuild sustainably while continuing to preserve and fund the machinery that repeatedly destroys what is built.</p><p>No amount of concrete, branding, or foreign investment can substitute for political resolution. A territory that remains militarily besieged, economically sealed, and politically subjugated will never achieve durable recovery.</p><p>Prosperity cannot flourish inside a cage. The European Union learned this lesson the hard way through multiple reconstruction cycles it funded in Gaza, which may help explain why none of its members rushed to join the board, despite being able to afford the permanent membership fee and despite the political incentives of cultivating a more cordial relationship with Trump in light of the war in Ukraine and his threats on Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"aiding-israel-s-military-control-through-spatial-redesign\">Aiding Israel’s military control through spatial redesign</h2><p>There is also a serious risk that the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/23/analyst-breaks-down-map-of-trumps-gaza-plan#flips-6388132353112:0\">proposed physical design of Gaza</a> would entrench Israeli military strategy rather than restore Palestinian life. The plans envision buffer zones, segmented districts, and so-called “green spaces and corridors” that would break up the territory internally.</p><p>This kind of spatial engineering would facilitate surveillance, control, and rapid military access. Urban planning would become security architecture. Civilian geography would turn into militarised space. What is sold as modernisation would constitute a sophisticated system of containment, just like the illegal settlement networks and road systems in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The emphasis on reclaiming land from the sea using rubble may repeat the problems of Beirut’s reconstruction after the civil war, where newly reclaimed areas attracted disproportionate investment because they were free of unresolved ownership claims, ultimately allowing elites to appropriate the city’s waterfront and pull it away from public use.</p><p>The demographic implications of the plan are equally profound. Shifting Gaza’s population centre southward — closer to Egypt and further from Israel’s settlements — would quietly alter the political and social centre of gravity of Palestinian life.</p><p>It may ease Israeli security anxieties, but it would do so at the expense of Palestinian continuity, identity, and territorial coherence. Population engineering under the banner of reconstruction raises serious ethical concerns and risks externalising Gaza’s long-term humanitarian burden onto neighbouring states. This may also help explain Egypt’s absence from the signing ceremony and its decision to limit participation to its intelligence leadership.</p><h2 id=\"no-amount-of-political-theatre-can-replace-freedom\">No amount of political theatre can replace freedom</h2><p>The Board of Peace itself also deserves careful scrutiny. Its branding suggests neutrality and collective stewardship, yet its political framing remains highly personalised around Trump, with little clarity about how it is meant to operate in practice.</p><p>This is not the kind of multilateral peacebuilding mechanism envisaged by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803 of November 2025; it is political theatre. Peace mechanisms anchored in personalities rather than institutions and international law rarely survive political change.</p><p>At the heart of all this lies a familiar but dangerous assumption: that economic growth can substitute for political rights. History teaches the opposite. People do not resist simply because they are poor; they resist because they lack dignity, security, freedom of expression, and self-determination. No master plan can bypass these realities. No skyline can compensate for political exclusion.</p><p>This does not mean Gaza must wait for the perfect peace before rebuilding. Recovery must proceed urgently. But rebuilding must empower Palestinians rather than redesign their constraints. It must dismantle systems of control, not embed them into concrete and zoning maps. It must confront the political roots of destruction rather than cosmetically repackage its aftermath.</p><p>Until those foundations exist, the Board of Peace and Kushner’s vision risk becoming exactly what they resemble — a form of sandcastle diplomacy: impressive to the global public, comforting to elites, and destined to wash away when the first serious wave of political reality arrives.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
