In early 2014, she advocated against the use of force against tens of thousands of Russian soldiers who swarmed Crimea during an interregnum that followed the toppling of Yanukovych.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yanukovych won the presidency in 2010 and orchestrated a trial in which Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for “abuse of power”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After he fled to Russia, she was freed by pro-Western protesters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“She said that no soldier should leave the barracks and no tank should leave the box,” Romanenko said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tymoshenko has said the current corruption probe against her is aimed at barring her from taking part in a presidential election – even though elections are <a href=\"/features/2025/12/10/could-ukraine-hold-a-presidential-election-right-now-as-trump-demands\">banned during the war</a> against Russia’s invasion, which will enter its fifth year in February.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“It looks like the election is closer than it seemed, and someone decided to purge the rivals,” she wrote on Facebook on Wednesday, apparently referring to Zelenskyy. “… I’ve been fearless for a long time as I know I am honest before myself, the people and Ukraine.”</p><h2 id=\"no-competitor-for-zelenskyy\" dir=\"ltr\">‘No competitor for Zelenskyy’</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Analysts ridiculed her claim.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tymoshenko is “no competitor for Zelenskyy”, Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta think tank in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">She has “no chances of even making it to the second round,” he said, citing opinion polls that give Tymoshenko approval ratings of 3 to 4 percent and name her one of the “most hated” politicians in Ukraine.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“If presidential elections were held now, in the best case scenario, she would be number six, seven or eight,” Fesenko said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">However, the investigation and Tymoshenko’s diatribes against Zelenskyy could change the speed and efficiency of wartime decision-making.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Motherland sided with Zelenskyy on most bills, and the rift may jeopardise his control over the Verkhovna Rada.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, despite what Tymoshenko claims about her alleged danger to Zelenskyy during a presumed presidential campaign, the investigation is detrimental to the president and the overall war effort, Fesenko said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Anticorruption investigators are focused on Tymoshenko’s role as one of the Verkhovna Rada’s puppet masters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">She is “one of the few influential politicians in the Rada who deal with shadowy financial matters”, Fesenko said. “She’s been doing it her whole life.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In late December, anticorruption bodies charged two dozen lawmakers, including five with the Servant of the People, with corruption and vote rigging.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The scandal is going to boost media attention on the anticorruption bodies even though convictions of the alleged wrongdoers are far from guaranteed.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“She is going to get away with it,” a former Motherland lawmaker told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because he fears “retaliation” from Tymoshenko.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“She hates Zelenskyy’s guts. She thinks he stole her presidency” in 2019, he said. “And now she thinks that he [activated anticorruption officials against] her because she could win the vote, which is absurd because her ratings are way below his.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tymoshenko has posted bail of 33 million hryvnia ($761,000) and is not allowed to leave the Kyiv region.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Tuesday, a court will decide whether her assets should be frozen. Her trial may begin in months.</p></div></div></body></html>"

More Danish soldiers have been deployed to the island while European allies have sent small contingents in a symbolic show of support.</p><p>The language of sovereignty, self-determination and international law has suddenly become urgent. Danish politicians are speaking of principles, borders and the dangers of great power politics.</p><p>What is striking is not that Denmark is panicking but that it appears surprised.</p><p>Greenland is strategic. It always has been. Its location, resources and military value make it a desired prize in an increasingly competitive global order. The renewed American interest in the island is neither an anomaly nor a momentary excess of rhetoric. It is the logical expression of an imperial worldview – one that prioritises power, access and control over the formalities of international norms.</p><p>What makes the Greenland case uncomfortable for Denmark is not merely the threat itself. It is the mirror it holds up.</p><p>For decades, Denmark has been a reliable partner in advancing that very same imperial worldview elsewhere. It aligned itself closely with the US, not only diplomatically but also militarily. Denmark participated in wars that reshaped entire regions under the banner of security, values and alliance loyalty. Now as the same imperial logic is being applied to Danish territory, the abstractions of geopolitics suddenly become tangible.</p><p>This is the irony Denmark must confront.</p><p>The concern over Greenland rests on arguments Denmark knows well. That sovereignty matters. That territories are not commodities. That international law cannot be selectively applied. Yet these principles were notably absent from Denmark’s considerations when it joined the invasion of Iraq, a war launched without a legal mandate and justified by spurious claims that quickly collapsed.</p><p>These arguments were also diluted in Afghanistan, where two decades of war ended not in stability but in exhaustion and the return to the status quo. They disappeared almost entirely in Libya, where Danish aircraft played a decisive role in toppling its leader Muammar Gaddafi. What followed was a shattered state defined by militias, chaos and human trafficking.</p><p>In Syria, Denmark’s involvement, both direct and indirect, formed part of a broader Western intervention. A popular uprising was transformed into a prolonged proxy war with catastrophic consequences for civilians and regional stability.</p><p>Each of these interventions was framed as necessary. Each was presented as a moral obligation. Each was defended as part of a rules-based international order. In practice, each helped erode the very norms Denmark now invokes when Greenland enters the equation.</p><p>Palestine makes this contradiction impossible to ignore.</p><p>Israel is a close Danish ally, yet as Gaza has been reduced to rubble, Denmark’s political leadership has remained strikingly restrained. While international legal experts, humanitarian organisations and United Nations bodies have warned of genocide, Denmark’s response has been cautious to the point of silence. Calls for accountability have been muted. Moral clarity has been deferred.</p><p>At the same time, Danish industry remains entangled in the machinery of war. A Danish defence company continues to supply spare parts for F-35 fighter jets, aircraft that have played a central role in the bombardment of Gaza. When asked whether international arrest obligations would be enforced against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should he enter Denmark, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declined to give a clear answer.</p><p>Law is conditional. Principles are flexible. Denmark has long helped normalise a world in which power decides when law applies.</p><p>For years, imperial violence was something that happened elsewhere. To other people, in other regions. The consequences were exported. Destabilised states. Mass displacement. Radicalisation. The steady hollowing-out of international institutions. Europe absorbed some of the fallout but largely refused to connect it to its own political choices. Denmark was no exception.</p><p>Greenland collapses that distance. Gaza exposes the moral architecture beneath it.</p><p>What Denmark is experiencing now is not injustice. It is exposure.</p><p>The same arguments once used to justify intervention in the Middle East are now being repurposed closer to home. Strategic necessity. Security concerns. Global competition. These are not new concepts. They are simply being applied in a direction Denmark did not expect.</p><p>This moment reveals the limits of moral selectivity. International law cannot be defended only when it is convenient. Sovereignty cannot be sacred in the Arctic and disposable elsewhere. Small states cannot rely on principles they helped undermine and expect them to hold when global power dynamics shift.</p><p>For Europe as a whole, the implications are profound. Alignment with empire does not guarantee protection from it. Loyalty does not produce autonomy. A continent that tolerates the erosion of law abroad will eventually face its absence at home.</p><p>Greenland is not just a territorial concern. It is a reckoning.</p><p>The irony is complete. The question is whether Denmark and Europe will finally choose to learn from it.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Four candidates of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamist group and the NCP’s coalition partner, were also approved, as well as an NCP candidate, despite questions over dual citizenship. Another approved candidate belongs to the Khelafat Majlis, also an alliance partner of the Jamaat and the NCP.</p><p>The remaining seven candidates to be approved by the BEC belong to smaller parties or are contesting as independents, not allied with either of the two leading groups.</p><p>The NCP claims that its candidate, whose nomination was under scrutiny, had not informed it about his dual citizenship, and the party has decided to withdraw his candidacy in the election.</p><p>Mahabub Alam, an NCP leader who attended the BEC hearings where the complaints were heard, told Al Jazeera: “Requiring candidates to prove they have renounced foreign citizenship while accepting only future commitments constitutes selective and unconstitutional treatment.”</p><p>He claimed that the approach “favours certain parties”, alluding to the BNP, whose candidates are the largest beneficiaries of the BEC move to allow some dual citizens to contest. Alam pointed out that candidates who had submitted applications to renounce foreign citizenships could also withdraw those pleas before a final decision, without Bangladeshi authorities necessarily getting to know.</p><p>Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin rejected the allegations of bias, saying the decisions were guided by a desire to ensure participation.</p><p>“We want an election with participation from all sides,” he told candidates and their representatives after the hearings. “We have not delivered any judgement with bias.”</p><h2 id=\"past-track-record\">Past track record</h2><p>Bangladesh currently allows its citizens to obtain a second citizenship from a list of 103 countries.</p><p>However, Article 66(2) of its Constitution disqualifies a person if they acquire the citizenship of a foreign state.</p><p>The current battle lines are drawn over interpretations of what the Constitution says. Does a candidate need to complete the formal renunciation of foreign citizenship before submitting nomination papers? Or is applying to relinquish that citizenship sufficient to avoid disqualification?</p><p>Critics argue that accepting affidavits or verbal assurances weakens constitutional safeguards and allows selective enforcement.</p><p>Under United Kingdom procedures, for instance, a declaration of renunciation must be registered by the Home Office before it takes effect; until then, the applicant remains a British citizen.</p><p>The BEC has not publicly issued detailed legal reasoning for individual decisions so far.</p><p>The commission has, however, previously cancelled candidacies over dual citizenship. In January 2024, Shammi Ahmed, a nominee of Hasina’s Awami League party for Barishal-4 constituency, had her candidacy cancelled by the BEC over dual citizenship allegations — a decision later upheld by the Supreme Court’s Appellate Division.</p><h2 id=\"political-pressure-intensifies\">Political pressure intensifies</h2><p>The dispute moved beyond the Election Commission on Sunday evening when a Jamaat-e-Islami delegation, led by party chief Shafiqur Rahman, met interim government head Muhammad Yunus.</p><p>After the meeting, Syed Abdullah Muhammad Taher, Jamaat’s deputy chief, also accused the BEC of bias in decisions on candidate nominations, including on questions of dual citizenship.</p><p>Without naming any party, Taher said Jamaat had heard that pressure was being exerted on the commission to prevent the cancellation of nominations that should otherwise have been declared invalid due to legal flaws.</p><p>“We want to state clearly that the Election Commission must not bow to any pressure — whoever the party may be, even if it is Jamaat-e-Islami,” he said.</p><p>A day later, on Monday afternoon, an NCP delegation led by party convener Nahid Islam also met Yunus, accusing the BEC of acting under pressure from the BNP in allowing candidates accused of holding foreign citizenship to contest.</p><p>Speaking to journalists afterwards, Nahid said the commission had deviated from its legal position.</p><p>“There are candidates with dual citizenship in the BNP, and there are candidates with dual citizenship in Jamaat,” he said. “Which party they belong to is not the issue. The issue is whether the law is being applied equally to everyone.”</p><p>“It is clear that the commission has moved away from the legal position under pressure from one party and is using a flawed interpretation of the law to give these candidates an opportunity,” he added.</p><p>“If the Election Commission cannot maintain neutrality, how can we expect a fair election?” Nahid said, warning that continued bias would raise doubts about the credibility of the vote.</p><p>Nahid said the party would challenge the decisions in court and could take to the streets if necessary.</p><h2 id=\"ethically-problematic-too\">‘Ethically problematic too’</h2><p>Political analyst Mohiuddin Ahmad said allowing dual citizens to run was not only unconstitutional but also “ethically problematic”.</p><p>He questioned whether allegiance to another state could be reconciled with representing Bangladeshi voters.</p><p>“If the commission knowingly overlooks constitutional requirements, it undermines its mandate and risks invalidating the election itself,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Dilara Choudhury, a political analyst, said affidavits alone were insufficient to meet legal requirements and warned that the BEC risked losing moral authority if it failed to adhere strictly to procedure.</p><p>“If the Election Commission’s image as neutral is damaged, how can it deliver a credible election?” she said. “If the election becomes questionable and citizens lose trust, it will be a futile exercise — and the government formed through it will also face questions of legitimacy.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Turkiye sees the SDF as a Syrian branch of the PKK, an organisation that it has been at war with since 1984 and considers a “terrorist” group.</p><p>Abdi asked for five days for consultations, a request al-Sharaa rejected. The president gave the SDF leader until the end of Tuesday to accept the offer, warning that failure to do so would trigger military action and the collapse of the ceasefire.</p><p>Al-Sharaa on Monday spoke by phone with US President Donald Trump, and the two stressed the importance of preserving Syria’s territorial unity and independence and underlined the need to guarantee the rights and protection of the Kurdish people.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna, reporting from Damascus, said the US was in a “unique position to end this crisis” because it has close ties with both the SDF and Damascus.</p><p>Washington trained and equipped the SDF to fight ISIL and maintains about 900 soldiers in SDF-controlled areas.

The total value of the assets is reportedly believed to be close to the cost of damages incurred in Tehran.</p><p>Popular former footballer Voria Ghafouri, who had been arrested in 2022 for <a href=\"/news/2022/11/25/iran-arrests-footballer-ghafouri-for-spreading-propaganda\">supporting previous nationwide protests</a>, also had his cafe confiscated.</p><h2 id=\"trump-threats-crossing-red-line\">Trump threats ‘crossing red line’</h2><p>At the height of the protests, Trump called on Iranians to “take over” government institutions, alleging “help is on the way”, before expressing “great respect” for the Iranian leadership based on a claim that planned hangings for more than 800 political prisoners were halted.</p><p>But then on Saturday, Trump said it is time for an end to the 37-year rule of Khamenei in Iran – prompting some of the highest authorities of the Islamic Republic to shoot back.</p><p>In a statement carried by state media, the Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member constitutional watchdog that has to approve legislation before it becomes law, said it condemns the “insult and baseless rhetoric of the criminal and foolish” US president.</p><p>The council stressed that any transgression against the supreme leader “is considered crossing the red line of the devout people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and will entail heavy costs and serious consequences”.</p><p>Ghalibaf, the parliament chief, told a public session of parliament on Monday that Trump “used all of his non-existent credibility to extend chaos, insecurity and killings in Iran”.</p><h2 id=\"internet-blackout-remains-in-place\">Internet blackout remains in place</h2><p>Meanwhile, Hossein Afshin, deputy for scientific affairs to the Iranian president, told reporters on Monday that internet restrictions will “gradually” be lifted from the end of the week, but did not divulge further information.</p><p>NetBlocks and other international monitors said the occasional internet reconnections signal that the establishment may be testing ways to more vigorously enforce its controlled digital blackout of the Iranian population.</p><p></p><p>State media announced on Monday that the chief executive of Irancell, one of the country’s top mobile and internet carriers, was replaced.</p><p>The move came after “some of Irancell’s operators refrained from the order to restrict communications” on January 8 for several hours, according to the Tasnim news agency, also affiliated with the IRGC. That was the night when the internet and all mobile communications were abruptly cut off at an unprecedented scale.</p><p>According to state media, the reformist Ham-Mihan daily newspaper was confiscated on Monday, with two reports written about the protests cited as the reason.</p><p>State television also confirmed on Monday that its satellite broadcast was “disrupted by an unidentified source for moments” the night before. The feed appeared to show moments from the nationwide protests at the time of hijacking.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His attendance comes amid strained US ties with its European allies over his threat to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.</p><p>Here is more about the WEF and what to expect at the meeting.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-wef\">What is the WEF?</h2><p>The WEF is a think tank and event organiser based in the Swiss city of Geneva. The first summit held in Davos in 1971 was a gathering of business executives. However, over the years, it has expanded in scope, discussing issues as diverse as economic disparity, climate change, technology and global cooperation.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248969\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-What-is-the-World-Economic-Forum-1768737184.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - What is the World Economic Forum 2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"where-is-the-wef-summit-in-2026\">Where is the WEF summit in 2026?</h2><p>The summit is at the conference centre in Davos, an Alpine town in Switzerland, famous for its ski resort and home to about 10,000 people.</p><p>Davos, at a height of about 1,500 metres (nearly 5,000 feet), is located in the Graubunden canton in the eastern Alps of Switzerland.</p><p>It has been the venue of the WEF summit every year in January since 1971.</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-summit-at-davos\">When is the summit at Davos?</h2><p>The main sessions began on Monday, January 19, and the annual meeting will wrap up on January 23.</p><p>Sessions begin at 9am (08:00 GMT) every day.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-expected-to-attend-and-who-isn-t\">Who is expected to attend, and who isn’t?</h2><p>Nearly 3,000 high-level participants from business, government and beyond, plus untold numbers of activists, journalists and outside observers are expected to attend.</p><p>Organisers say a record of nearly 400 top political leaders, including more than 60 heads of state and government, and about 850 chairpersons and chief executives of many of the world’s leading companies, are attending.</p><p>Headlining the lineup is Trump, who is set to deliver a speech on Wednesday, and several cabinet ministers and top advisers, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and special envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p>Trump also wants to hold a meeting of his ‘Board of Peace’ on Gaza at the annual gathering, according to a report by Bloomberg news.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are among the who’s who attending the WEF summit.</p><p>Organisers say 55 ministers for economy and finance, 33 ministers for foreign affairs, 34 ministers for trade, commerce and industry, and 11 central bank governors are also expected.</p><p>Tech titans scheduled to be on hand include Jensen Huang of Nvidia, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, and Arthur Mensch of France’s Mistral AI.</p><p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala are among several top officials from international institutions.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-not-attending\">Who is not attending?</h2><p>Iran’s foreign minister will not be attending the summit, the organisers said on Monday, stressing it would not be “right” after the recent deadly crackdown on protesters in Iran. <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/iran-in-limbo-whats-next-for-country-under-internet-blackout\">Abbas Araghchi</a> had been scheduled to speak on Tuesday.</p><p>“The Iranian Foreign Minister will not be attending Davos,” the WEF said on X.</p><p>“Although he was invited last fall, the tragic loss of lives of civilians in Iran over the past few weeks means that it is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” it added.</p><p>Israel, accused of committing genocide in Gaza, has also been invited. President Isaac Herzog will represent Israel at the event.</p><p>Mozambique President Daniel Chapo cancelled his trip to Davos and will not attend the meeting due to massive flooding in his country. He said on social media late on Sunday that “the absolute priority at this moment is to save lives”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-on-the-agenda\">What is on the agenda?</h2><p>The theme this year is “A Spirit of Dialogue”. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues ranging from geopolitics and artificial intelligence to climate change.</p><p>Trump is expected to meet global business leaders on Wednesday, the Reuters news agency reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.</p><p>Business leaders, including CEOs in financial services, crypto and consulting, are invited to a reception after Trump’s address to the WEF’s annual meeting, the sources told Reuters on Monday. The agenda was unclear.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-different-this-year\">What’s different this year?</h2><p>The geopolitical context has become incredibly complex this year: Trump’s pronouncements and policies on subjects as diverse as Venezuela, Greenland and Iran — not to mention his aggressive tariff policies — have upended the world order and raised questions about the US role in the world.</p><p>European Union leaders have dubbed Trump’s threat to slap new tariffs over his Greenland takeover bid a “blackmail”.</p><p>The advent of AI – its promise and perils – has also become a hot topic. Business executives will examine how to apply it to boost efficiency and profits; labour leaders and advocacy groups will warn of its threat to jobs and livelihoods, and policymakers will look to navigate the best way forward between regulation and the right to innovate.</p><p>Davos conference organisers always trot out buzzwords for the meeting, and this year, it is “A Spirit of Dialogue” – around five themes of cooperation, growth, investment in people, innovation and building prosperity.</p><p>Critics say Davos is too much talk and not enough action to rectify the gaping inequality in the world and address troubles like climate change.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Something in the way the United States envoy said it – phase two – really made it sound like things might finally be turning the corner.</p><p>In less than 24 hours, another announcement followed. The White House named the members of a new <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/who-is-part-of-trumps-board-of-peace-for-gaza\">“Board of Peace”</a>, tasked with overseeing a technocratic committee that would manage the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza. The committee will be led by Dr Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian official, who is presented as part of a forward-looking plan for reconstruction and stability.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On paper, it appears to be a movement. Like structure. Like planning for a future beyond war.</p><p>But on the ground in Gaza, there isn’t a sense of confidence. There is doubt – and a lot of it.</p><p>Many Palestinians here struggle to understand how a board meant to rebuild Gaza can include people who have openly supported Israel, especially when the destruction is still everywhere you look, and no one has been held accountable.</p><p>Buildings are still in ruins. Families are still grieving. Entire neighbourhoods are gone. Against that backdrop, talk of governance and reconstruction feels disconnected from reality.</p><p>For families who have lost their homes, their loved ones, and their sense of safety, the contradiction is hard to ignore. It’s difficult to be asked to trust a future designed by people who seem untouched by the present pain and untouched by responsibility for it.</p><p>For those whose daily life is characterised by the constant buzz of drones and sudden Israeli air attacks, nothing’s really shifted.</p><p>Parents still think hard about where their kids will sleep tonight. Aid workers still map their routes, not by where help is most needed, but by which roads might actually get them through alive. Families still hush up at night, straining to hear if the quiet will hold or if the fighting will break out again.</p><p>All these official statements? They feel miles away from what’s actually happening. Phase two might exist in some news release, but for most people, life still feels stuck right where it started.</p><p>You don’t feel a ceasefire in speeches or headlines. You feel it in what’s missing, the sudden silence, the easing in your chest, the nights that don’t end with a jolt. That’s what people are waiting for. Not the label, not the milestone. Just the change itself.</p><p>After months of loss and exhaustion, it’s normal to want to believe things really are getting better. Diplomats cling to the idea of progress. Governments need to say momentum’s building. But the people actually living this? They just want something steady. They want to know tomorrow won’t be worse than today, that they can wake up and not flinch.</p><p>But right now, that feeling isn’t there. Promises are uneven, timelines keep slipping, and too many commitments just fade into the background. For people living through it, this doesn’t feel like peace on the move; it feels like everything’s hanging by a thread, ready to snap at any minute. Just calling it “phase two” doesn’t make it feel any safer.</p><p>And then there’s that quieter hurt that comes from hope getting stretched too thin. When official words don’t match real life, people learn to lower their expectations. Hope turns into something fragile – something you hold close but don’t trust too much, because getting let down again just stings. Announcing progress before anyone can feel it doesn’t build trust. It erodes it.</p><p>This isn’t about throwing out diplomacy. It’s just about honesty. If “phase two” is going to mean anything, people need to feel it in their daily lives: Fewer funerals, hospitals that actually work, roads that don’t feel like traps, days where fear isn’t always there.</p><p>Real peace grows in those small, ordinary moments, walking down the street without bracing yourself, sleeping through the night without planning how to run if things go wrong.</p><p>Until those moments show up, “phase two” is mostly just a symbol. And symbols, no matter how hopeful, can’t keep anyone safe. Only real change does that.</p><p>For people living day to day, peace isn’t about the next announcement. It starts when they can get through a night and believe the ceasefire will still hold in the morning.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He is 27, grew up in a middle-class neighbourhood of Dhaka, and became eligible to vote nearly a decade ago. He never did – not in Bangladesh’s national elections in 2018, nor in the 2024 vote.</p><p>“My vote had no real value,” he said.</p><p>Like many Bangladeshis in his age group, Alam’s political consciousness formed under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s long period of government, when opposition parties and election watchdogs repeatedly questioned the credibility of polls.</p><p>Over time, he said, disengagement with politics became normal, even rational, for a generation. “You grow up knowing elections exist, but believing they actually don’t have the power to decide anything. So you put your energy elsewhere… studies, work, even trying to leave the country,” he said.</p><p>This calculation began to shift for him in July 2024, when student protests over a government job reservation system favouring certain groups spiralled into a nationwide uprising. Alam joined marches in Dhaka’s Mirpur area and helped coordinate logistics for protests, as Hasina’s security forces launched a brutal crackdown.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Office later estimated that up to 1,400 people – most of them young – may have been killed before Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, ending nearly 15 years in power.</p><p>When Hasina left, Alam said the moment felt like something that had appeared permanent had broken. “For the first time, it felt like ordinary people could push for a change,” he said. “Once you experience that, you feel responsible for what comes next.”</p><p>Bangladesh is now heading for a national election on February 12, the first since the uprising. European Union observers have described the upcoming vote as the “biggest democratic process in 2026, anywhere”. And Alam plans to vote for the first time.</p><p>“I’m thrilled to exercise my lost right as a citizen,” he said.</p><p>He is not alone. Bangladesh has about 127 million registered voters, nearly 56 million of them between the ages of 18 and 37, according to the Election Commission. They constitute about 44 percent of the electorate, and are a demographic widely seen as the driving force behind Hasina’s downfall.</p><p>“Practically speaking, anyone who turned 18 after the 2008 parliamentary election has never had the chance to vote in a competitive poll,” said Humayun Kabir, director general of the Election Commission’s national identity registration wing.</p><p>“That means people who have been unable to vote for the last 17 years are now in their mid-30s… and especially eager to cast their ballots.”</p><p>This eagerness comes after three post-2008 elections that “were not considered credible”, Ivars Ijabs, the EU’s chief observer, said.</p><p>The 2014 polls saw a mass opposition boycott, and dozens of seats where Hasina’s Awami League party faced no contest. The 2018 vote, though contested, became widely known as the “night’s vote”, after allegations that ballot boxes had been filled before polling day.</p><p>The 2024 election, meanwhile, again went ahead amid a major boycott by opposition parties, with critics arguing that conditions for a “fair contest did not exist”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253029\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253029\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253029\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24224305623258-1768878892.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE- Protesters shout slogans as they celebrate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024.

Haq described the upcoming election as a psychological release valve after years of repression, during which young people “could not hold their representatives accountable; rather, those representatives appeared to them as oppressors”.</p><p>Many young people still do not trust the existing system, Haq argued, and some remain sceptical of the democratic transition itself.</p><p>Umama Fatema, a Dhaka University student who emerged as a prominent leader during the 2024 protests, said the uprising generated powerful expectations among young people: promises of “no corruption, no manipulation, equality of opportunity and political reform”.</p><p>But translating these aspirations into institutions has proven far more difficult. As the transition unfolded, Fatema said the reform process, led by the interim administration of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, alongside manoeuvring by political parties – including those born out of 2024’s protests – became increasingly complex.</p><p>“Very few people and their aspirations have been meaningfully involved and incorporated,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4253092\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4253092\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4253092\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25215551352377-1768885347.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Leader of National Citizen Party (NCP), Nahid Islam, addresses supporters during a political rally in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025.

A far-right Islamist party, the Jamaat’s opposition to Bangladesh’s independence during the 1971 war has long limited its mainstream appeal.</p><p>“Historically, those who rule us come to power with big promises,” Saha said. “But after a few years, power blinds them, and the same abuses repeat.”</p><p>The NCP, he said, initially felt different. “We thought of the NCP as a beacon of light. But seeing it align with a party that carries so much historical baggage made many of us lose hope.”</p><p>Fatema, who led the protests alongside several figures who later founded the NCP, said the party’s alignment with the Jamaat risks shrinking the significance of the July 2024 uprising. “Over time, it could seriously damage how this uprising is remembered in history,” she warned.</p><p>The NCP positioned itself at its launch as a generational alternative to Bangladesh’s traditional parties, promising what it called a “new political settlement” rooted in the 2024 July movement. But as talks advanced over the electoral alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, the party saw a wave of resignations, including from several senior figures and women leaders who had been expected to contest parliamentary seats.

But I want to see whether the system can at least function properly. That alone would be a major change,” she said.</p><p>For others, like Sakibur Rahman, 23, a voter from the eastern Brahmanbaria district who studies philosophy at the University of Dhaka, the appeal of democracy remains conditional.</p><p>“You can talk about democracy all day, but if people don’t feel safe, can’t speak freely and can’t earn a living, democracy feels abstract, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Rahman said he would support whichever party could credibly guarantee public safety, freedom of expression, religious freedom, and minorities living without fear.</p><p>For many women voters, the calculation is sharper still. Women make up nearly half of Bangladesh’s electorate, but young women say questions of dignity and everyday security will shape their ballot.</p><p>“We hear promises of women’s rights, but the lived reality is far from ideal. That will shape how many of my female friends will vote,” Akter, the master’s student, said.</p><p>Yet the political field they are being asked to choose from remains overwhelmingly male. Election Commission data shows that only 109 of the 2,568 candidates contesting the election, or about 4.24 percent, are women.</p><p>Fatema said the political space for women has narrowed rather than expanded since the uprising. “After August 5, women who speak about their agency, their contributions, and their right to representation have been suppressed in many ways,” she said.</p><p>“Harassment, from online abuse to sexual threats, has become routine in political spaces.” These pressures are pushing women out of visible political roles, just as the country enters a critical political transition, she added.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, a political observer and adjunct researcher at Western Sydney University’s Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative, said the disconnect between women’s prominence in protest movements and their marginalisation in formal politics raises doubts about the depth of reform.</p><p>“No structural change is possible without women’s political representation, and participation at the highest levels… both in parliament and in policymaking,” he said. “Without that, promises of any new political order remain incomplete.”</p><p>Fahmidul Haq of Bard College said political parties would have to approach young voters differently than in the past, by addressing “their traumas, desires, and demands sincerely”, and by campaigning with honesty and transparency.</p><p>“Young people are deeply sceptical of absurd promises,” he said, adding that those may in fact alienate them.</p><p>Still, something fundamental has changed. For Alam, the first-time voter from Dhaka’s Mirpur, July 2024 permanently altered how his generation relates to power.</p><p>“We now dare to question everyone,” he said. “Whoever comes to power, that habit won’t disappear.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The ministry’s claims could not be independently verified.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s armed forces are introducing a new approach to air defence, involving small groups of interceptor drones, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.</li>\n<li>The Kyiv Independent media outlet reported that Ukraine’s SBU secret service captured a Russian soldier suspected of executing nine Ukrainian prisoners of war in 2024.</li>\n</ul><p></p><h2 id=\"military-aid\">Military aid</h2><ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The Czech Republic will not sell or donate to Ukraine light combat planes that could shoot down incoming Russian drones, the country’s prime minister, Andrej Babis, said, rejecting a plan outlined by President Petr Pavel. Pavel earlier said that Ukraine had offered to buy some of the country’s subsonic L-159 jets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Peace talks</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine’s top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskii, said Moscow is showing no signs of interest in talks leading to a peace deal with Kyiv. It is instead boosting arms production, including a target of 1,000 drones per day, he added.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Kyiv has held “substantive” talks on security and economic issues with US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and envoy Steve Witkoff, with more discussions expected at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week, Ukraine’s security chief and top negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy said he hopes to sign documents with the US on post-war <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/zelenskyy-says-us-security-guarantee-text-ready-to-be-finalised-with-trump\">security guarantees</a> for Ukraine at Davos this week, adding that his team of negotiators had held several rounds of talks in the US.</li>\n<li>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, will travel to Davos this week and hold meetings with members of the US delegation on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, the Reuters news agency reported, citing two sources with knowledge of the visit.</li>\n</ul><p> </p><h3>Politics</h3><ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukraine will face enormous challenges to organise its first elections since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion, with its infrastructure shattered and millions of people displaced by war, the country’s election chief, Oleh Didenko, said, responding to Trump’s demand for Ukraine to hold the vote.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Russia jailed an American man for five years for illegally transporting weapons, a court announced, saying that a rifle was found on his yacht after it docked in the port city of Sochi last June. It identified the man as Charles Wayne Zimmerman, and said he “admitted his guilt in full”. It did not mention when exactly the man was sentenced, but said an appeal against the conviction had been rejected.</li>\n</ul><h3>Energy</h3><ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that the 330-kilovolt (kV) Ferosplavna-1 power line has been reconnected to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The power line is one of two high-voltage lines supplying electricity that powers the Russian-controlled nuclear power plant in Ukraine, and was disconnected earlier this month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukrainian Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Telegram that he had informed the head of the IAEA about Russian preparations for more strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities, including those that ensure the operations of nuclear plants.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia’s federal budget proceeds from taxes on oil and gas are expected to drop by 46 percent in January from the same month in 2025 due to weaker oil prices and a stronger rouble, according to an analysis by Reuters. Oil and gas revenue are key to funding Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Polish pipeline operator Gaz-System will increase gas transmission capacity to Ukraine between February and April, the company said in a statement, as Russia continues to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/zelenskyy-demands-faster-energy-imports-as-ukraine-reels-from-power-outages\">attack Ukraine’s energy sector</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><figure id=\"attachment_4252859\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4252859\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4252859\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260118__936N864__v1__MidRes__UkraineRussiaConflictWar-1768866879.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Local residents gather around a bonfire during an outdoor party to keep warm as many apartments remain without heating in Kyiv on January 18, 2026, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
