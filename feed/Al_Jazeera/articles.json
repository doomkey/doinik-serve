Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said Russia targeted the capital and four regions in the country’s north and east.</li>\n<li>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the worst-affected in the capital was the northeastern suburb of Troyeshchyna, where 600 buildings were without power, water and heat.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s Air Force said Russia unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles.</li>\n<li>At least 30 people, including a child, were also wounded during the same attack in the country’s second-largest city of Kharkiv. Mayor Ihor Terekhov said 25 drones had hit several districts in the city. Among those struck was a dormitory for displaced people and two medical facilities, including a maternity hospital, Terekhov wrote on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Minister of Energy Denys Shmyhal wrote on Telegram late on Saturday that more than 800,000 Kyiv households were still without power, as were a further 400,000 in the Chernihiv region, north of the capital.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said more than 3,200 buildings in Kyiv remained without heating in the late evening, down from 6,000 in the morning. Night-time temperatures were hovering around -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>\n</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha denounced the attack as “barbaric” in a statement posted on X. He accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting “cynically” for launching the attack amid United States-led trilateral talks on the war in the United Arab Emirates.</li>\n<li>In Russia, Ukrainian forces launched a “massive” attack on the border region of Belgorod on Saturday, damaging energy infrastructure, but causing no casualties. Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov described the incident as “the most massive shelling of the town of Belgorod”.</li>\n<li>Gladkov said the attack damaged “energy sites” and that fragments of a downed drone triggered a fire in a courtyard of a building. Reports from the area also said the shelling and sounds of explosions had gone on for some time.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The Russian Ministry of Defence said its forces had completed the takeover of the village of Starytsya in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region, close to the border with Russia.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">The General Staff of Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had launched six attacks on an area including Starytsya.

Arteta, though, acknowledged that his team will now be heavily tested.</p><p>“Yes, with Michael coming in, it’s going to bring new ideas; the intensity rises up – you could see [it] in the Manchester derby with their behaviour and the game that they ‍played,” Arteta said.</p><p>“We expect a tough match, but we will adapt to that for sure. We are at home, and we know how important that is going to be for us.”</p><h2 id=\"how-do-arsenal-shape-up-for-manchester-united-s-visit\">How do Arsenal shape up for Manchester United’s visit?</h2><p>Gabriel Jesus and Viktor Gyokeres are competing for a place in the starting lineup after both forwards impressed in Tuesday’s 3-1 Champions League <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/20/jesus-brace-helps-arsenal-down-inter-to-seal-champions-league-qualification\">win against Inter Milan</a>. Jesus scored twice, while substitute Gyokeres also found the net.</p><p>“We were waiting for that with ​the amount of games that are coming up, and they are all ‌going to have opportunities and minutes, so great to have them back and, especially, to have them in good form,” he said.</p><p>Arteta ‌also addressed Arsenal’s decision to send teenage midfielder Ethan Nwaneri on loan to Olympique de Marseille.</p><p>“At the end, you have to be thrown to the sharks ‌in an incredible atmosphere and club. It’s going to make so ⁠much good,” Arteta said of the move.</p><h2 id=\"arsenal-far-from-perfect-despite-topping-premier-and-champions-leagues\">Arsenal ‘far from perfect’ despite topping Premier and Champions leagues</h2><p>Arteta said his side had room for improvement, despite being unbeaten in their last 12 matches and winning all seven of their Champions League games this season, while Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola called Arsenal the ‌best team in the world.</p><p>“I think we’re the team that wants to be constantly better. We are doing a lot of things right, but we are far from perfect, and our only aim is to sustain ‍the level we are doing and try to improve again,” Arteta said.</p><p>“You need to dominate all the phases in the game if we want to have the chance to win major trophies.”</p><h2 id=\"manchester-united-must-not-get-carried-away-at-arsenal\">Manchester United must not get carried away at Arsenal</h2><p>United may ‌have lifted the mood around Old Trafford with their derby win over City, ‍but ‍Carrick on Friday urged his squad to balance renewed confidence with caution ahead of their trip to north London.</p><p>Carrick’s attack-minded side swept away the gloom hanging over the club with second-half goals from Bryan ​Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu last weekend, underlining their dominance against a disappointing City whose title ‍hopes suffered a significant setback.</p><p>“It has been a good week: a big result, a big performance and a big uplift with the feeling inside the stadium,” Carrick said ahead of Sunday’s clash.</p><p>“It is finding a balance ‍between getting the ⁠encouragement and confidence from the game and performance, and keeping level-headed and keeping our feet on the ground.</p><p>“We have got another big game coming up. One game does not make you a great team, but it gives us a great foundation to build on.</p><p>“[I’m] looking forward to the game; it’s a big challenge. They’re a very ​good team. They have so many strong points to their game. They ‌are where they are for a reason, we’re fully aware of that,” the 44-year-old Englishman added.</p><h2 id=\"casemiro-still-integral-to-united-despite-imminent-departure\">Casemiro still integral to United, despite imminent departure</h2><p>Carrick also addressed the future of Brazilian midfielder Casemiro, who announced on Thursday that he will leave the club at the end of the season, ‌when his contract expires.</p><p>Although the 33-year-old has a one-year extension option, a team source said the club has chosen not to ‌activate it.</p><p>Casemiro arrived at Old Trafford from Real Madrid in ⁠2022 for about 60 million pounds ($81.11m) and played a key role in United’s 2023 League Cup triumph, scoring in the final, as well as being part of their 2024 FA Cup win.</p><p>“The Casemiro announcement was for clarity as much ‌as anything,” Carrick said. “It was decided before I arrived; it wasn’t a knee-jerk decision.</p><p>“But the type of personality and character he is, it shows with his performance last week, where he is mentally, ‍and what it means to be here and finish the season strong.</p><p>“I’ve had the conversation with him. He’s desperate to do well and finish well.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"mainoo-can-be-united-s-main-man-for-years-to-come\">Mainoo can be United’s main man for years to come</h2><p>With Casemiro on the way out, Carrick was eager to turn his attention to Kobbie Mainoo, who he said has the quality and character to become a key player for the club after a frustrating spell during Ruben Amorim’s reign.</p><p>Mainoo started for the first time in the Premier League this season in the win against City.</p><p>The 20-year-old had, however, shot to prominence in the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, scoring as United beat City in the FA Cup final and playing a starring role in England’s run to the Euro 2024 final.</p><p>However, he struggled for game time during Amorim’s ill-fated 14-month spell as the Portuguese coach defied calls to play Mainoo alongside club captain Bruno Fernandes.</p><p>“This club needs young players coming through and being the foundation for what it means, not just for the players or the squad, but for the club and for the supporters,” said Carrick at his pre-match news conference ahead of Sunday’s trip to Premier League leaders Arsenal.</p><p>“I think that is something that we need to grasp, and we need to keep building on.</p><p>“Kobbie is a prime example. To come through so quickly and have the rapid rise, to play in some unbelievably big games and impact those big games at such a young age, shows an awful lot of quality, and in the terms of the character, and to be able to handle it.</p><p>“Part of a career is a few ups and downs, and sometimes, it goes in different trajectories. But I think we’ve seen last week what Kobbie can bring.”</p><h2 id=\"what-effect-did-united-s-win-against-city-have-on-carrick-s-team\">What effect did United’s win against City have on Carrick’s team?</h2><p>Victory over City lifted fifth-placed United to within one point of the Premier League’s top four. With fourth-placed Liverpool’s defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday, the Red Devils can move two points clear in fourth with victory against the Gunners.</p><p>The mood around Old Trafford was also transformed by the positive performance. Carrick is hoping it can be the foundation towards a positive end to the season as United aim to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in three years.</p><p>“It was a big result, big performance and a big uplift with the feeling inside the stadium,” added Carrick.</p><p>“It’s getting that balance between taking the encouragement and the confidence from the game, and keeping level-headed and our feet on the ground.</p><p>“One game doesn’t make you a great team, but it gives us a great foundation to build, so there’s a lot of confidence.”</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-last-time-arsenal-played-united\">What happened last time Arsenal played United?</h2><p>Manchester United provided a stern test for Arsenal in the first Premier League meeting of the season, with Amorim’s side the better of the teams but the Gunners <a href=\"/sports/2025/8/17/arsenal-capitalise-on-bayindir-error-to-win-1-0-at-manchester-united\">seeing off the challenge</a> with a 1-0 win.</p><p>Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game at Old Trafford in the 14th minute.</p><h2 id=\"head-to-head\">Head-to-head</h2><p>This will be the 255th meeting between two of English football’s great rivals, with United winning 99 of the matches.

Faultlines in the country’s leadership remain active, with the situation subject to devolve based on how Trump and his top officials proceed.</p><p>Here’s where things stand, and what could come next.</p><h2 id=\"operating-with-a-gun-to-its-head\">‘Operating with a gun to its head’</h2><p>Maduro has sat in prison in New York since the January 3 operation, awaiting trial on drug trafficking and so-called conspiracy to commit “narcoterrorism” charges.</p><p>But many of the circumstances leading up to his abduction have endured. A massive portion of the US’s military arsenal has remained deployed off the coast of Venezuela. A <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-seizes-a-seventh-venezuela-linked-oil-tanker\">blockade</a> on US-sanctioned oil tankers has stayed in place. The Trump administration has promised to continue strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, while not ruling out future Venezuela land operations.</p><p>“What we’re seeing is not a fully formed [US] strategy, but an evolving one,” Francesca Emanuele, a senior international policy associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Trump initially promised to “run” Venezuela, while dousing the prospect of seeking to install an opposition-led government. He has continued to downplay the proposition of opposition involvement, following a meeting last week with Maria Corina Machado, instead focusing on coordinating with interim President and former Maduro deputy Delcy Rodriguez.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The president’s early manoeuvres, which have included his first direct call with Rodriguez and the deployment of his CIA director to Caracas, have unabashedly emphasised US oil access to the country.</p><p>In that, Trump has sought to establish a “control mechanism”, according to Begum Zorlu, a research fellow at City, University of London, that “depends on fear: sanctions, oil leverage, and the threat of renewed force”.</p><p>“What emerges is not governance but a strategy of remote coercion, forcing the post-Maduro leadership to comply with US demands, particularly around oil access.”</p><p>Or as Emanuele put it: “The Venezuelan government is operating with a gun to its head, and that cannot be bracketed out of any serious analysis.”</p><h2 id=\"emphasis-on-oil\">Emphasis on oil</h2><p>In that context, the administration has made some early moves to access Venezuelan oil. Just days after Maduro’s abduction, Washington and Caracas announced plans to export up to $2bn worth of crude stuck at Venezuelan ports due to the ongoing US blockade.</p><p>Last week, the US announced the first $500m sale of the resource, with Rodriguez saying Caracas had received $300m in proceeds. She said the funds would be used to “stabilise” the foreign exchange markets.</p><p>But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group focusing on the Andes Region, said the current scheme by which the US is acquiring and selling Venezuela’s oil remains opaque. Several questions – made the more pressing by a history of corruption and patronage in Venezuela – have gone unanswered.</p><p>US lawmakers, meanwhile, have demanded that Trump officials “immediately disclose any financial interests” they have in the companies involved.</p><p>“Selling the oil is the easy part,” he told Al Jazeera. “But who determines how that money is spent? How will the goods and services purchased be administered, by what criteria and under whose direction?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s vision of US companies accessing and exploiting Venezuela’s vast oil reserves has run into headwinds from market realities, even as Venezuela’s parliament has opened debate on amending a hydrocarbon law to allow more foreign investment in the country’s state-run oil industry.</p><p>Just six days after Maduro’s abduction, Trump invited 17 oil companies to the White House to discuss investments in Venezuela, which he promised would meet “at least 100 billion dollars”. But even among a friendly crowd, top industry leaders pointed to a list of major reforms needed before the country was seen as <a href=\"/podcasts/2026/1/15/the-take-why-is-venezuela-uninvestable-for-big-oil\">investable</a>.</p><p>Trump, in turn, has pledged security for US companies operating in the country, including reportedly considering using private defence contractors. Little clarity has emerged.</p><p>The administration’s high-pressure approach to Venezuela, Zorlu explained, creates a “central contradiction: the coercive model designed to secure US control over Venezuelan oil may ultimately undermine the investment climate required to extract that oil at scale.”</p><h2 id=\"how-have-venezuela-s-leaders-responded\">How have Venezuela’s leaders responded?</h2><p>In the streets of Caracas, the atmosphere has remained “tense but calm”, according to Crisis Group’s Gunson.</p><p>“There is an unusually active presence on the streets of the capital of colectivos,” Gunson said, referring to pro-government paramilitary groups often deployed to smother dissent, “and the elite DAE unit of military counter-intelligence (DGCIM), which appears to be intended to send a message that no political opening is contemplated, at least for now.”</p><p>“No one is on the streets either celebrating or protesting, and for the most part, people are in a ‘wait and see’ frame of mind.”</p><p>Meanwhile, there has been little in the way of public discourse from the “three power centres” that dominate Venezuela’s government, as Gunson described: The civilian flank of Rodriguez and her brother, president of the National Assembly Jorge Jesus Rodriguez; the military under Defence Minister Padrino Lopez; and Interior Minister <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/who-is-diosdado-cabello-maduros-interior-minister-and-militia-boss\">Diosdado Cabello</a>, who controls the police and much of the intelligence apparatus, has influence in the army, and who “can also call on the colectivos”.</p><p>In their relatively staid response during the weeks since the US operation, “a government that is usually outspoken in denouncing US imperialism is clearly biting its tongue to avoid provoking Trump and [US Secretary of State] Rubio”, analyst Emanuele explained.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rodriguez has shifted from early public – if performative – defiance to a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/venezuelas-rodriguez-vows-release-of-more-prisoners-holds-call-with-trump\">more conciliatory</a> tone towards the Trump administration.

In response, Venezuela’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaffirmed its support for Havana, but avoided any direct reference to its future plans for oil.</p><p>“This suggests a calculated effort to preserve room for manoeuvre under US coercion,” Emanuele said.</p><p>“And it matters because this appears to be one of the conditions the Trump administration is attempting to impose on Venezuela as the price of continuing down a ‘negotiation’ track.”</p><h2 id=\"what-fault-lines-remain\">What fault lines remain?</h2><p>Analysts warned the early compliance seen among Venezuela’s leaders should not be seen as stability, particularly in a country where officials have for years relied on a sprawling system of patronage.</p><p>Gunson explained that the Rodriguez siblings “could be ousted at any point if the factions with the guns chose to do so”.</p><p>Notably, like Maduro, Padrino and Cabello remain under US indictment with a reward on their heads.</p><p>“For now, it is not in their interests, and they appear to be working in close coordination with the civilians,” he said. “That might change if their fundamental interests were threatened, especially in the event of an attempted political transition.”</p><p>“They have to be worried that the US could come back in to get them or that a political opening agreed with the Rodriguez siblings might lead to their prosecution either in Venezuela or in the US,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It remains impossible to gauge how deep the distrust runs in Caracas, although it has become a common suspicion that Maduro’s abduction required the cooperation of at least some members of his inner circle.</p><p>The Guardian news agency, citing four sources, reported on Thursday that Delcy Rodriguez had previously assured US officials she would cooperate in the event of Maduro’s ousting. The sources were adamant that Rodriguez “did not agree to actively help the US to topple” Maduro, the newspaper reported, and that the longtime leader’s abduction was not a pre-engineered coup.</p><p>The Reuters news agency also reported that US officials had been in contact with Cabello in the months preceding the operation, although it was unclear if they discussed future governance.</p><p>“We cannot clearly see the internal calculations among civilian leaders and the military, the fractures within the armed forces themselves, or where loyalties ultimately rest across the security apparatus,” researcher Zorlu said.</p><p>Beyond the possible faultlines between the civilian authorities and the security apparatus, she added, discord may also cut through “regime strategy”, and whether some in the government view US accommodations as an “existential threat”.</p><p>“The coming months are likely to reveal fractures that are not yet visible,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Kenya prepares for its next general election, due in less than 20 months’ time, 2026 will prove to be a critical year. With local and global restraints on political violence being hollowed out at the very time when trust in the credibility of the election system is at an all-time low, serious trouble beckons unless urgent steps are taken.</p><p>Violence in Kenyan elections is rarely the product of that perennial bogeyman, tribalism. It is almost exclusively a state-generated phenomenon that requires a particular alignment of circumstances. Two matter above all else: first, whether the election itself is credible; second, whether the incumbent is running for re-election.</p><p>Since the reintroduction of multiparty politics in 1991, Kenya has had seven competitive presidential elections. It was only in four of them that significant violence was witnessed; in all four, the inevitably unpopular incumbent was running. In 2002, 2013 and 2022, when no incumbent was on the ballot, violence was comparatively muted, even where the credibility of the election itself was contested.</p><p>The lesson is clear. It is the efforts to improve the credibility of the election and to enforce institutional restraints on state actors that are the best safeguard.</p><p>Kenya has come some way in this regard since the conflagration that followed the disputed 2007 election. The 2010 constitution introduced checks on the wanton exercise of state power, most importantly an independent judiciary, which has proven a credible venue for settling election disputes. Reforms to the election system to enhance transparency, most evident in the 2022 elections, have also taken some of the sting out of the polls.</p><p>Today, however, that progress is at risk. And President William Ruto is running for re-election.</p><p>Following a long delay, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) was reconstituted in July last year, albeit not without controversy following the <a href=\"https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/ruto-ignores-court-order-appoints-iebc-officials-5077924#story\">president’s initial decision to ignore a court order</a> stopping the appointment of commissioners following a legal challenge to their suitability.</p><p>That stained the commission’s credibility from the very start. The shambolic and violent by-elections for dozens of empty seats of senators and national assembly members, which took place in November, further damaged public confidence in the commission as an independent referee. This needs urgent addressing.</p><p>But the credibility of the election is down to more than just the IEBC. The Kenyan media has an especially important role to play. For years, out of fear of antagonising those in power, major media houses have treated the announcement of vote tallies as an official function best left to electoral bodies. That timidity has repeatedly undermined public confidence in election outcomes.</p><p>The 2022 election was a missed opportunity. Even with polling-station results publicly available, Kenyan media appeared unable – or unwilling – to independently aggregate figures and explain what the numbers were saying in real time. In 2027, the media cannot continue to ignore its responsibilities. There is time to collaborate, rebuild capacity and invest in data journalism. They should prepare to independently verify results and call the election, even when that makes power uncomfortable.</p><p>Media weakness is also increasingly being exploited through online disinformation. And the tools are becoming far more powerful. Kenya is no stranger to election manipulation in the digital age. It was one of the testing grounds for Cambridge Analytica, whose microtargeting operations during the 2013 election helped normalise data-driven psychological campaigning long before the scandal broke globally.</p><p>Today, artificial intelligence raises the stakes dramatically. AI-driven disinformation can flood platforms with synthetic content, fabricate audio and video, impersonate trusted voices, and target communities with tailored narratives at speed and scale.</p><p>In environments where trust in institutions is already thin, disinformation does not merely mislead. It can destabilise. It can delegitimise results before votes are cast, provoke panic or mobilisation based on false claims, and provide justification for repression in the name of preserving public order. A strong, capable, reliable and effective media will be crucial in mitigating such impacts.</p><p>Regional and international institutions and pressures have also been critical in containing the violent appetites of Kenyan elites, but these are now in decay. Today’s global environment makes such restraint far less likely. Across East Africa, governments are normalising repression as elections approach. In neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda, authorities have acted with impunity to suppress dissent and election protests.</p><p>And this regional shift is occurring alongside a broader collapse in global accountability. Western backing for Israel’s genocide in Gaza has accelerated the erosion of international norms, undermined institutions such as the International Criminal Court, and created a permissive environment for malevolent actors.</p><p>Given these circumstances, Kenya must focus on shoring up its internal defences. Time is running out to insist on reforms to insulate independent state institutions from political interference. Though the Kriegler Commission, set up in the aftermath of the 2007/8 election, recommended that any changes to election rules should be concluded at least two years before the polls, we are already past that deadline.</p><p>Still, 2026 presents an opportunity to rebuild the coalitions that can mobilise citizen action as a bulwark against state repression. In the 1990s, these included civil society organisations, the church and the media.</p><p>The Gen Z protests showed that Kenyan youth can also be a potent political force and it is likely that we will see them out on the streets yet again this year. The question is whether their elders will join them in standing up against state machinations.</p><p>Violence next year is not inevitable. But preventing it requires urgent action to protect the gains in electoral transparency and mobilise popular action as a shield against abuse of state power.</p><p>The clock is ticking.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

While in the past, the supreme leader has shown openness to partially curbing the nuclear programme, concessions over missiles and the so-called <a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\">axis of resistance</a> have been non-negotiable.</p><p>“It is unclear whether Iran is willing to formally accept restrictions” on these three elements, said Mohammad Ali Shabani, an Iran analyst and editor of news site Amwaj.media. “As Trump has threatened a renewed bombing campaign if Iran resumes enrichment, Khamenei seems paralysed in his decision-making,” he added.</p><p>Trump has said that he wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, an option that Iran has ruled out, insisting that its enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.</p><p>Concerning support for non-state actors in the region, Iran has been working on reconfiguring that network following the war last June with Israel, said Halireza Azizi, visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.</p><p>Israel has, in the past few years, degraded the arsenal and decapitated the leadership of what was Iran’s strongest ally in the region, Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Non-state actors in Iraq have become more involved in that country’s political system and, therefore, more cautious, and the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria has collapsed. And finally, Iran itself was directly attacked by Israel, the first time it has faced a full-scale attack from its chief regional enemy.</p><p>After that war, a heated debate on the actual benefit of working with non-state actors ensued in Iran, Azizi said. The argument that prevailed was that Iranian soil had been struck only after regional allies were weakened, and not before.</p><p>“So the policy [now] is to double down and try to revive that network” with some modification, Azizi said.</p><p>The focus, he said, has shifted to working with smaller groups in Iraq, find new ways to transfer weapons to Hezbollah and rely more on the Houthis in Yemen. It is too soon, and information is too limited, to assess whether the protests and the threat of a US strike have changed that calculus, but official channels indicate that there have been no modifications.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4236041\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4236041\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4236041\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12T165753Z_831722910_RC2AXIABFPBF_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS-1768318787.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C500&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iranian demonstrators gather in a street during a protest over the collapse of the currency's value, in Tehran, Iran, January 8, 2026.

At the height of the protests, tensions soared after Trump hinted that he was about to strike Iran over what he said was Iran’s brutal crackdown. But he toned down the rhetoric after <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">Gulf Arab nations</a> pushed him to refrain from attacking Iran – a move they fear would plunge the region into chaos.</p><p>On Thursday, Trump signalled that channels between Washington and Tehran were open. “Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk,” he said during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>But his remarks came as the US moves military assets to the Middle East, likely an attempt to strong-arm Iran into a deal. “We have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won’t have to use them,” Trump said on Friday.</p><p>Still, should Iran end up making major concessions, the perception of security and legitimacy may be hard to restore. For years, the implicit social contract between the Iranian people and the system has been based on the guarantee of security at the expense of social and political freedom. But that pillar of legitimacy was shattered by last year’s war with Israel, when at least 610 people were killed in Iran over 12 days.</p><p>“The social contract between state and society in Iran has withered over the decades, and with the disruptions to basic services over the past year amid electricity and water crises, the provision of security is now also under question,” Shabani said. “To ensure its longevity, the Islamic Republic is thus faced with the broader challenge of having to explain to the public what it can provide, and why it must continue to exist”.</p><p>According to Azizi, a transformation has already started with the political system moving from a clerical into a military leadership as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – an elite force established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution – has grown into the country’s most powerful economic and political actor.</p><p>“After the death or removal of Khamenei, we are not going to see the Islamic Republic as we know it,” Azizi said.</p><p>“Whether that it’s gonna give more impetus to the people to come to the streets to initiate regime change, or it’s going to result in a Soviet-style scenario of regime transformation with the security establishment reemerging in a different form, that is an open question, but change is inevitable.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
