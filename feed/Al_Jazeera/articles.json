The second iteration, Exercise Mosi II, was held in February 2023, coinciding with the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>South Africa had faced heat from the West for hosting the joint drills then.</p><p>A third edition was scheduled for late 2025, but it overlapped with a Group of 20 summit that was held in South Africa in November. Washington did not send any delegates. The ongoing Will for Peace 2026, now rebranded, is the third edition of the drills.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-at-stake-for-south-africa\">What’s at stake for South Africa?</h2><p>The exercises in South African waters will likely further raise tensions with Washington.</p><p>Since Trump took office again, South Africa-US ties have deteriorated over a range of issues, and Trump has imposed 30 percent tariffs on South African goods.</p><p>A part of the fallout is also rooted in the South African government’s decision to bring a genocide case against Israel, a top US ally, before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It accuses the Israeli government of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. In a preliminary ruling, the world court found it plausible that Israeli actions amounted to genocide.</p><p>When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House in May, hoping to mend ties, Trump falsely claimed that white South African farmers were facing systematic killings.</p><p>Ramaphosa rejected the claims. None of South Africa’s political parties says there is a “white genocide” happening in the country as the Trump administration claims.</p><p>Hosting the wargames at a time of global geopolitical upheaval has its own risks, given that the US sees some of the participants as a military threat.</p><p>Ramaphosa’s government also faces criticism from one of its largest coalition partners, the liberal Democratic Alliance (DA). A DA spokesperson, Chris Hattingh, said in a statement that the bloc has no defensive role or shared military plans to warrant such exercises.</p><p>The party said BRICS had “rendered South Africa a pawn in the power games being waged by rogue states on the international stage”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>To the government of the United Kingdom:</p><p> </p><p>We, the undersigned, write to you today as survivors of state violence.</p><p>We are a collective of former hunger strikers from Palestine, Ireland and Guantánamo Bay. Hunger strikes end only when power intervenes, or when people die. We learned, through pain, permanent damage, and watching our comrades fall, how states behave when prisoners have no choice but to refuse the only right afforded to them: food.</p><p>As such, we write in uncompromising solidarity with the hunger strikers held today in British prisons: Qesser Zuhrah, Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Kamran Ahmed, Teuta Hoxha, Jon Cink, Lewie Chiaramello, and Muhammad Umer Khalid. They are imprisoned on remand, without trial and without conviction. For some, their remand has lasted over a year, and for most, they will not see trial for two.</p><p>The UK government has chosen prolonged remand, isolation and their censorship. It has chosen to restrict their contact with loved ones, allow medical neglect, and deployed the language of terror in an insidious attempt to deliberately strip these prisoners of public sympathy and basic rights before any trial takes place.</p><p>We cannot forget what the hunger strikers today stand for. They stand for Palestine. They stand for dismantling the infrastructure of weapons that kills Palestinians. They stand for the end of the apartheid regime implemented by the Israeli government. They stand in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners. They stand for the complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.</p><p>For years, Palestinian prisoners have been subjected to systematic abuse inside Israeli prisons, including well-documented torture, extreme sexual violence, medical neglect, and death in custody. Yet, the UK government, through its unwavering support for the Israeli state continues to choose to be complicit in its actions. It chooses to continue to arm Israel and shield Israeli officials from accountability while Palestinian bodies – men, women and children – are violated and destroyed in their streets, in their homes, and behind bars.</p><p>The Palestine Action political prisoners began their hunger strike when they had no other choice. The state’s decision to rely on the use of the classification of “terror” to enforce the systematic repression of those who refuse to conform has left them with no other alternative as they seek the rights they are entitled to by law.</p><p>This is not a new phenomenon: the use of the word “terror” has long been used to manufacture fear, to poison public perception, to justify the repeated violation of even the most basic human rights. Once this label is attached, rights become conditional, liberty becomes transactional, and the presumption of innocence evaporates. The rule of law that is so proudly claimed to be upheld is swiftly desecrated in the face of a singular word, deployed by unscrupulous politicians determined to protect their own interests: “terrorist”.</p><p>The proscription of Palestine Action was not about safety. It was about control. The repeated and flagrant breaches of sub judice were not about convincing the public that this was a dangerous organisation; it was about condemning the prisoners before they stood trial. It was about isolating them, criminalising solidarity, and sending a warning to anyone who might speak or organise against the Israeli war machine.</p><p>No trial held under an atmosphere of state-manufactured fear can be deemed as fair, and no jury exposed to decades of terrorism rhetoric can operate free of bias. These prisoners were smeared the moment the announcement of their arrest made mention of a “terrorism connection”, despite those proceedings not having taken place.</p><p>We therefore demand the following:</p><p>1. An urgent ministerial meeting with families and legal representatives to agree on actions that will preserve the lives of the hunger strikers. Immediate bail for the Palestine Action prisoners (known as the Filton 24) and all hunger strikers.</p><p>2. Dropping of terror charges designed to criminalise dissent.</p><p>3. Fair trial conditions free from fear-driven narrative and political interference.</p><p>4. Immediate access to independent medical care chosen by the prisoners.</p><p>5. An end to censorship and restrictions on family visits.</p><p>In 1981, Britain chose to let the Irish hunger strikers die in the Long Kesh prison. In the 2000s, Britain chose silence over the plight of the detainees at Guantánamo Bay. For decades, Britain – along with other governments – continued to choose inaction in Palestine. Each time, British officials claimed responsibility rested elsewhere. Each time, history recorded the truth.</p><p>The Suffragettes, despite being force-fed and labelled as terrorists, are today celebrated as heroes and freedom fighters. The Long Kesh prisoners, despite the smears they faced, are now seen as a vital part of the peace achieved under the Good Friday Agreement. The Guantánamo Bay prisoners, despite their inhumane treatment and public consent for torture, remained untried and were largely released without conviction.</p><p>Just as they were all vindicated, history will too vindicate the Palestine Action prisoners who sought to stop the slaughter of innocent people, against the wishes and interests of the British government.</p><p>We are not merely observers, but witnesses to the injustice currently being dispensed by the hands of the state against people who history will no doubt vindicate, as it has done those hunger strikers who have gone before.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Signatories:</strong></p><p>Shadi Zayed Saleh Odeh, Palestine</p><p>Mahmoud Radwan, Palestine</p><p>Othman Bilal, Palestine</p><p>Mahmoud Sidqi Suleiman Radwan, Palestine</p><p>Loay Odeh, Palestine</p><p>Tommy McKearney, Ireland</p><p>Laurence McKeown, Ireland</p><p>Tom McFeely, Ireland</p><p>John Nixon, Ireland</p><p>Mansoor Adayfi (GTMO441), Guantanamo</p><p>Lakhdar Boumediene, Guantanamo</p><p>Samir Naji Moqbel, Guantanamo</p><p>Moath Al-Alwi, Guantanamo</p><p>Khalid Qassim, Guantanamo</p><p>Ahmed Rabbani, Guantanamo</p><p>Sharqawi Al-Hajj, Guantanamo</p><p>Saeed Sarim, Guantanamo</p><p>Mahmoud Al Mujahid, Guantanamo</p><p>Hussein Al-Marfadi, Guantanamo</p><p>Osama Abu Kabir, Guantanamo</p><p>Abdul Halim Siddiqui, Guantanamo</p><p>Ahmed Adnan Ahjam, Guantanamo</p><p>Abdel Malik Al Rahabi, Guantanamo</p><p>Ahmed Elrashidi, Guantanamo</p><p data-start=\"7835\" data-end=\"8231\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Courts have repeatedly declined to rule on its constitutionality.</p><p>Within days of the Venezuela operation, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/us-senate-passes-measure-to-restrict-trumps-military-actions-in-venezuela\">US Senate</a> advanced a resolution to limit further military operations in the Latin American country without <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/congresss-role-questioned-as-democrats-vow-to-rein-in-trump-on-venezuela\">congressional</a> backing, with five Republicans joining Democrats in supporting it. But this measure has little chance of being enacted, since it would need Trump’s signature if the Republican-controlled House passes it, which is uncertain.</p><p>For decades, presidents and Congress have battled over who has the institutional power to declare war.</p><p>The US Constitution assigns Congress the right to declare war. The last time Congress did that was at the beginning of World War II.</p><p>Since then, presidents have generally initiated military action using their constitutionally granted powers as commander-in-chief without an official declaration of <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/12/the-us-is-already-at-war-with-venezuela\">war</a>.</p><p>In August 1964, President Lyndon B Johnson asked Congress to back his effort to widen the US role in Vietnam. He received approval with the enactment of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which easily passed both chambers of Congress.</p><p>As public sentiment turned against the Vietnam War, lawmakers became increasingly frustrated about their secondary role in sending US troops abroad. So, in 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which was enacted over President Richard Nixon’s veto.</p><p>The resolution required the president to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and to terminate the use of US armed forces within 60 days unless Congress approves. If approval is not granted and the president deems it an emergency, an additional 30 days are allowed to end operations.</p><p>Presidents have often, but not always, followed the act’s requirements, usually framing any entreaties to Congress as a voluntary bid to secure “support” for military action rather than “permission”. This has sometimes taken the form of an “authorisation for the use of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/analysis-why-venezuelas-military-holds-the-key-to-countrys-future\">military</a> force” – legislation that amounts to a modern version of a declaration of war.</p><p>Trump has a point that presidents from both political parties have sought to assert power and limit lawmakers’ interference, including in court. But these arguments were never backed by court rulings.</p><p>Between 1973 and 2012, Congress’s nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found eight judicial decisions involving the War Powers Resolution, and “in each and every case” the ruling declined to offer a binding opinion, always finding a reason, such as a lack of standing to sue, to avoid taking a side.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Good’s ex-husband told AP that she wasn’t an activist and he hadn’t known her to participate in protests. Good had dropped off her 6-year-old son at school and was driving home when she encountered <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/we-have-to-stand-up-ice-killing-in-minneapolis-sparks-protests-across-us\">ICE</a>.</p><p>The Trump administration has ramped up Minneapolis immigration enforcement in recent weeks after news reports about allegations of daycare funding fraud involving the local <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/from-mogadishu-to-minneapolis-somalis-reject-trumps-bigoted-remarks\">Somali community</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>What is ‘domestic terrorism’?</strong></h2><p>Federal agencies have their own definitions of “domestic terrorism”.</p><p>According to a 2020 memo, the FBI, citing a specific section of the US Code, defines “domestic terrorism” as acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state criminal laws and appear intended to intimidate or coerce civilians; influence government policy by intimidation or coercion; or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses a similar definition, citing a different statute that defines “domestic terrorism” as dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources.</p><p>The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in 2023: “Unlike foreign terrorism, the federal government does not have a mechanism to formally charge an individual with domestic terrorism which sometimes makes it difficult (and occasionally controversial) to formally characterise someone as a domestic terrorist.”</p><p>In 2022, former FBI agent Michael German, then a fellow with New York University Law School’s Brennan Center for Justice, told PolitiFact that 51 federal statutes apply to “domestic terrorism”.</p><p>“I think there is and always has been confusion between rhetoric and the law in regard to terrorism,” German told PolitiFact after the Minneapolis shooting. “There is no law that authorises the US government to designate any group or individual in the US as a ‘domestic terrorist’.”</p><p>The federal government periodically revises how it describes threats. For example, in 2025, federal officials sometimes used the term “nihilistic violent extremists” to describe perpetrators who don’t subscribe to one ideology but appear to be motivated by a desire to, as one expert put it, “gamify” real-life violence. Experts told PolitiFact that the term is valid but cautioned against its overuse or citing it to obscure other ideological motivations, such as white supremacy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>The Trump administration has broadened the ‘domestic terrorism’ label</strong></h2><p>The DHS rhetoric around Good’s fatal shooting is similar to another immigration enforcement-related shooting in October. During DHS’s months-long immigration crackdown in Chicago called <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/lawsuit-alleges-horrific-conditions-at-us-immigration-facility-in-chicago\">“Operation Midway Blitz”</a>, a Border Patrol agent shot US citizen Marimar Martinez five times.</p><p>A DHS news release described Martinez as a “domestic terrorist” and accused her of ramming her vehicle into the Border Patrol agent’s car, carrying a semiautomatic weapon and having a “history of doxxing federal agents”.</p><p>A federal judge granted a motion from prosecutors to dismiss federal charges against Martinez in November.</p><p>“Ultimately, there was a determination when everything was evaluated that there were serious questions about the officers’ narratives,” legal analyst Joey Jackson told CNN.</p><p>The government’s use of the term goes beyond immigration and the DHS.</p><p>After conservative activist <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/who-was-charlie-kirk-what-we-know-about-the-shooting-and-the-suspect\">Charlie Kirk</a>’s murder, Trump issued a September 25 memo ordering the attorney general to expand “domestic terrorism” priorities to include “politically motivated terrorist acts such as organised doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder”.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order a few days before designating <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/what-is-antifa-what-does-trumps-major-terrorist-label-mean\">antifa</a>, a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists, as a “domestic terrorist” organisation.</p><p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi told federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to compile a list of groups “engaged in acts that may constitute domestic terrorism”.</p><p>Legal experts have raised alarms about the memo’s potential infringements on the First Amendment.</p><p>“Both the order and the memo are ungrounded in fact and law,” Faiza Patel, the director of liberty and national security at the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote. “Acting on them would violate free speech rights, potentially threatening any person or group holding any one of a broad array of disfavored views with investigation and prosecution.”</p><p>Experts have also pointed to the memo’s focus on left-wing violence. It does not mention the politically motivated assassination of Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, months before.</p><p>“When a policy directive targets one ideological family and leaves others to the footnotes, it sheds any pretense of neutrality,” Thomas E Brzozowski, former Department of Justice counsel for domestic terrorism, wrote on December 12.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>Experts raise questions about Noem’s ‘domestic terrorism’ label</strong></h2><p>Information is still <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/minneapolis-leaders-urge-transparency-independent-probe-after-ice-killing\">surfacing</a> about what transpired before Good was fatally shot. However, frame-by-frame analyses of video footage by The New York Times and The Washington Post found Good’s vehicle moved towards an ICE agent, but the agent was able to move out of the way and fire at least two of the three shots from his gun from the side of the car as Good veered away.</p><p>Brzozowski told PolitiFact that because Good was trying to drive away, to “characterise that as domestic terrorism, I think, is a stretch.”</p><p>However, he said the larger concern is that Noem is using the “domestic terrorism” term absent any actual findings before an<a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/fbi-takes-over-investigation-into-ice-agent-killing-of-woman-in-minneapolis\"> investigation</a>.</p><p>“Essentially within hours of the incident occurring, labelling this activity as domestic terrorism, what that does is effectively strip domestic terrorism of its significance,” he said, calling it a “blatantly partisan effort to label it as domestic terrorism”.</p><p>“Now what is domestic terrorism? Whatever the DHS secretary says it is? She can characterise anything she wants as domestic terrorism. She is doing so without any facts to go on.”</p><p>Shirin Sinnar, a Stanford University Law School professor, told PolitiFact: “While intentionally ramming a vehicle for a political purpose could amount to terrorism in a different context, the videos of the Minneapolis incident appear to show a woman attempting to drive away from ICE officers, not hit them. Here, the administration’s calling her a domestic terrorist is simply an attempt to malign a protester and justify her killing by an ICE officer.”</p><p>German told PolitiFact there isn’t any public evidence to suggest that Good was “engaging in conduct that could have been prosecuted under the terrorism chapter of the US Code”.</p><p>“So a government official calling her a domestic terrorist isn’t supported in the law and is entirely pejorative and prejudicial.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

During Al Jazeera’s visit, the electricity cut out more than five times in less than an hour.</p><p>“We try to reach a certain temperature for the child, but every time we do, the power cuts,” Abu Shaira explained.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>I work for the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), a Quaker organisation that has been present in Gaza for more than 77 years. AFSC began its work in 1948 when the United Nations asked it to organise relief efforts for Palestinian refugees who had been expelled from their land by Zionist forces.</p><p>For two years, AFSC’s Gaza staff helped set up and run 10 refugee camps in al-Faluja, Bureij, Deir el-Balah, Gaza City, Jabalia, Maghazi, Nuseirat, Khan Younis and Rafah. They worked to provide food, shelter and sanitation as well as setting up educational programmes for children.</p><p>In the decades that followed, AFSC’s programmes have provided support for agricultural development, kindergartens, midwife training, humanitarian aid and trauma healing. Since the start of Israel’s genocide in 2023, AFSC staff members in Gaza have provided more than a million meals, food parcels, fresh vegetables, hygiene kits and other essential supplies.</p><p>Now, for the first time since 1948, AFSC along with dozens of other international organisations is threatened with a ban from the Israeli government that puts lifesaving humanitarian work in jeopardy. This would have a devastating effect on the people of Gaza. And it cannot come at a worse time.</p><h2 id=\"a-continuing-genocide\">A continuing genocide</h2><p>The mass killing in Gaza has not stopped. Despite a ceasefire, Israeli forces are carrying out ongoing raids, air strikes and large-scale demolitions across Gaza. Since the ceasefire began on October 10, these attacks <a href=\"https://aje.io/bbgm2l?update=4206625\">have killed</a> more than 420 Palestinians and injured more than 1,150.</p><p>And it is not just the bombs. Floods in Gaza have destroyed tens of thousands of tents while badly damaged homes continue to collapse on residents. The absence of medicines and proper healthcare is killing people as well; about 600 kidney disease patients have died as a result of lack of treatment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel continues to prevent temporary shelters, medicines and other desperately needed supplies from entering.</p><p>These actions have reinforced a longstanding Israeli policy aimed at depopulating Gaza and annexing the land. Israel’s prohibitively restrictive new registration policies and efforts to prohibit or limit international aid are part of this effort. Silencing independent humanitarian voices and dismantling humanitarian infrastructure serve to create conditions on the ground that make life in Gaza impossible. Gaza cannot recover or thrive without comprehensive reconstruction that restores its health system, education sector and critical infrastructure.</p><p>Just two weeks before the ceasefire began, an Israeli air strike struck my family home, killing nine of my immediate relatives, including two of my siblings, their spouses and their children.</p><p>When I spoke to surviving family members shortly afterwards, they told me the “responsibility is light now” – a phrase they used to express that the number of people to care for is less now.</p><p>Since that phone call, I have not stopped thinking about what responsibility truly means. For me, it did not become lighter. It grew heavier. Nine children were left orphaned. With each life taken from my family, the weight of responsibility only increased – the responsibility to remember, to care for those left behind and to bear witness to what has been done.</p><p>But this responsibility is not mine alone. It belongs to every nation, institution and individual who has sat idly by while Gaza burns – and especially those nations who have sent the bombs that continue to kill and destroy.</p><h2 id=\"from-1948-to-2026\">From 1948 to 2026</h2><p>I first learned about the history of AFSC from my friend Ahmad Alhaaj, who benefitted from its work when he was a young refugee in 1948.</p><p>Ahmad passed away in Gaza City in January 2024. It is heartbreaking that he lived his entire life as a refugee, recounting stories of Israel’s 1948 massacres, only to spend his final days enduring a genocide. He died under siege and bombardment, ultimately losing his life because essential medicines were unavailable.</p><p>The story of Ahmad in Gaza in 2024 is tragically similar to his story in 1948. Then, he was 16 years old, a barefoot refugee following evacuation orders to Gaza from his village of al-Sawafir. What changed were the years; what did not was the condition of dispossession, displacement and abandonment.</p><p>But Ahmad’s story is not just about displacement. Ahmad’s story is a story of love – love for his village. He lived his entire life in Gaza as a refugee in a rented house, refusing to own a home so he would never forget his village or the house his parents were forced to leave behind. For Ahmad, ownership elsewhere risked erasing memory; remaining a renter was an act of fidelity.</p><p>This same love has been embodied by many Palestinians who chose Gaza, even under fire. It is a devotion to place that defies siege, displacement and death. Ahmad’s love reminds me of the dedication of my mentor and friend Refaat Alareer, who became Gaza’s great storyteller, giving voice to its people and its pain. On December 6, 2023, Israel killed Refaat along with his brother, sister and nephews in a targeted strike on his apartment.</p><p>Like Ahmad, Refaat paid for this love – this unbreakable connection to land and memory – with his life.</p><p>His poem If I Must Die has become a testament to this love and to an enduring hope – a message that has travelled beyond Gaza and transformed into a global story. Born of siege and resistance, the poem carries Gaza’s humanity to the world, insisting on life, memory and dignity even in the face of death.</p><h2 id=\"gaza-rising\">Gaza rising</h2><p>In 1948, the Greater Gaza District was home to 34 villages. One of them was Ahmad’s. For our grandparents, Gaza was understood as something far larger than the narrow strip it later became. Their sense of place was expansive, rooted in villages, fields and continuous geography.</p><p>Our parents, however, witnessed Gaza steadily shrink. What had once been one of the largest districts in historic Palestine was reduced in 1948 to roughly 555sq km (215sq miles). It later shrank further, to about 365sq km (140sq miles) after Israel established a so-called demilitarised zone – land that was eventually annexed at the direct expense of Gaza’s people.</p><p>Today, Israel occupies more than half of Gaza. It has imposed what is known as the “yellow line”, which functions as a new de facto border that continues to expand, annexing new territory. Palestinians who cross it are executed. Even <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/middleeast/children-killed-israeli-drone-firewood-gaza-intl-latam\">Fadi and Jumaa</a>, ages 8 and 10, were not spared. Gaza is not just besieged; it is being physically erased, metre by metre, generation by generation.</p><p>The Gaza we love goes beyond lines and borders. Although the majority of Palestinians in Gaza are refugees from towns that today lie inside Israel, Gaza is the place we call home.</p><p>Today, Gaza has liberated the imaginations and consciences of people across the world. It transcends geography and the artificial lines drawn on maps – yellow or green.</p><p>Israel can ban international organisations and journalists, arrest our medical workers and bomb our poets. It can destroy lives and homes and cause suffering beyond measure. But it cannot ban our struggle for justice or our innate human desire to help one another survive. Despite the many obstacles and challenges we face, our work to support people in Gaza and across the occupied Palestinian territory will continue.</p><p>Gaza means liberty, sacrifice and love, even amid tents and rubble. And it will rise again from the ruins, as it has done throughout history.</p><p data-start=\"7835\" data-end=\"8231\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
