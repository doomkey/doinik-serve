It comes as European leaders meeting in Davos warn the dispute risks a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/trumps-greenland-tariffs-whats-europes-bazooka-option-to-hit-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trade war</a> and a rupture in the NATO alliance.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-greenland\">Where is Greenland?</h2><p>Greenland is the world’s largest island, located mostly within the Arctic Circle between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Geographically, it is part of North America, lying northeast of Canada and west of Iceland, but politically it is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of Greenland is covered by the Greenland ice sheet, the second-largest body of ice on Earth. Because the interior is largely uninhabitable, most of Greenland’s population lives along the coastline. The capital city, Nuuk, located on the southwest coast, is Greenland’s largest city, home to about one-third of the island’s roughly 56,000 residents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3429559\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3429559\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3429559\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-Greenland-Map-jan-8-2024-1736341778.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Where is Greenland Map\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3429559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"countries-in-the-arctic-circle\">Countries in the Arctic Circle</h2><p>The Arctic Circle is an imaginary line at 66.5 degrees north that includes the North Pole, the northernmost point on Earth.</p><p>Eight countries, including Canada, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States, have land lying within this region.<br>\n<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256655\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND-Countries-in-the-Arctic-Circle-JAN-21-2026-1768987632.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND - Countries in the Arctic Circle - JAN 21, 2026-1768987632\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><br>\nSome Arctic countries are closer to each other than many people realise.</p><p>Greenland’s closest neighbour is Canada, and at its narrowest point, between the Nares Strait, the two countries are only 26km (16 miles) apart. Canada and Greenland also technically share a land border, having settled a decades-long dispute over Hans Island, a small rock in the strait, by dividing it in half.</p><p>Russia and the US are also neighbours, with Alaska and Russia separated by the Bering Strait, which is about 85km (53 miles) at its narrowest point – a distance similar to that between New York City and New Jersey.</p><p>In fact, when you count the Diomede Islands located within the Bering Strait, Russia and the United States are less than 4km (2.4 miles) apart. These small, rocky islands consist of Big Diomede, which belongs to Russia and hosts a weather station, and Little Diomede, part of Alaska. The islands are separated by the International Date Line, creating a 21-hour time difference and marking the boundary between North America and Asia.</p><h2 id=\"how-big-is-greenland\">How big is Greenland?</h2><p>On some map projections, which enlarge landmasses near the poles, Greenland appears much bigger than it really is.</p><p>In reality, the Arctic island covers 2.17 million square kilometres (836,330 square miles), making it roughly three times the size of the US state of Texas, or about the same size as Saudi Arabia, Mexico or the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3429322\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3429322\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3429322\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/INTERACTIVE-How-big-is-Greenland-jan8-2025-1-1736336584.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - How big is Greenland-jan8-2025 (1)-1736336584\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3429322\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"arctic-shipping-routes\">Arctic shipping routes</h2><p>Most of the Arctic is divided into exclusive economic zones (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles (370km) from the territorial waters of states and where they have jurisdiction over natural resources.</p><p>According to data from <a href=\"https://arctic-council.org/projects/arctic-ship-traffic-data-astd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arctic Ship Traffic Data</a>, the number of ships operating in the Arctic has increased 37 percent between 2013 and 2023, driven by melting ice and expanding economic opportunities in the region.</p><p>There are three main shipping routes in the Arctic, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>The Northern Sea Route (NSR)/Northeast Passage</strong> runs along the Arctic coast of Russia and could cut maritime travel between East Asia and Western Europe by 10-15 days compared with travelling via the Suez Canal. In Soviet Russia, the route was used for military supplies and extraction of resources in the Arctic. Now Russia uses it to transport liquified natural gas (LNG).</li>\n<li><strong>The Northwest Passage (NWP)</strong> crosses Canada’s Arctic Ocean and could cut maritime vessel journeys between East Asia and Europe by 10 days compared with vessels travelling via the Panama Canal.</li>\n<li><strong>The Transpolar Sea Route (TSR)</strong> goes from the centre of the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and is a direct route via the North Pole. While this route avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states, it is rarely used due to the presence of permanent sea ice. Due to melting ice caps, it is predicted that this sea route may be fully open to vessels by the 2050s, potentially even sooner with high-strength icebreakers.<br>\n<img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256653\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND-Arctic-shipping-routes-JAN-21-2026-1768987630.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND - Arctic shipping routes - JAN 21, 2026-1768987630\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-is-the-military-presence-in-the-arctic\">What is the military presence in the Arctic?</h2><p>Greenland has one major permanent US base, the Pituffik Space Base, and several smaller Danish military facilities.</p><p>Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is located in the northwest corner of the island. It supports missile warning, missile defence and space surveillance missions and satellite command and control. It is strategically positioned to counter Russian activities in the Arctic.</p><p>About 650 personnel are stationed at the base, including US Air Force and Space Force members, as well as Canadian, Danish and Greenlandic civilian contractors. Under a 1951 agreement with Denmark, the US is permitted to establish and maintain military facilities in Greenland as part of mutual defence within the NATO framework.</p><p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a US-Canadian joint military organisation, also operates systems from Pituffik in the form of a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) for the organisation’s space surveillance.</p><p>In Alaska, NORAD controls the Clear Space Force Station, equipped with missile warning, defence and space awareness capabilities. The US also implements forward operating locations – temporary military airfields and radar stations – in Alaska, which are used to extend US defence and response.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256657\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND-Military-bases-in-the-Arctic-JAN-21-2026-1768987635.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND - Military bases in the Arctic - JAN 21, 2026-1768987635\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\">Denmark manages the defence of Greenland through the Joint Arctic Command (JAC) with its headquarters in the capital, Nuuk. The base’s main tasks are surveillance and search and rescue operations, and the “assertion of sovereignty and military defence of Greenland and the Faroe Islands”, according to Danish Defence.</p><p>According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the Northern Sea route is central to Russia’s security posture in the Arctic. Control of the route sits with Rosatom, giving Moscow the ability to restrict foreign military traffic without direct government approval. In the eastern Arctic, access through the Bering Strait has pushed Russia to expand radar coverage, search and rescue capacity and airfields, including the Sopka-2 radar installations on Wrangel Island and Cape Schmidt.</p><p>In the central Arctic, Russia has hardened its military footprint. Bastion-P and Pantsir-S1 systems – mobile defence systems – are deployed on Novaya Zemlya and Kotelny Island, extending area-denial across air and sea approaches.</p><p>In the western Arctic, the Northern Fleet, which oversees Russia’s second-strike capability, is based in Severomorsk. CSIS says Moscow has also reactivated dozens of Soviet-era facilities, reopening airbases, radar stations and border posts across the region.</p><h2 id=\"chinese-investments-in-the-arctic\">Chinese investments in the Arctic</h2><p>China has emerged as a key player in the Arctic, stating its desire to create a “Polar Silk Road”, similar to the Belt and Road Initiative, where new shipping routes would emerge as ice sheets recede.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/07/arctic-energy-projects-overview?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carnegie Endowment</a>, China views the Arctic as a future transport and industrial corridor. A number of Chinese companies also have mining projects in Greenland, including for iron ore, rare earths and uranium. China also has projects focused on Arctic energy via Russia’s LNG sector.</p><p>Chinese state-owned firms have stakes in Novatek’s LNG projects and are a major buyer of Arctic gas. The Chinese have also supplied key equipment to Russia’s Arctic LNG projects, especially after Western sanctions on Russia.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-greenland-s-resources\">What are Greenland’s resources?</h2><p>Greenland is rich in <a href=\"/news/2025/3/11/mapping-greenlands-resources-population-centres-and-us-military-base\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">natural resources</a>, including zinc, lead, gold, iron ore, rare earth elements (REEs), copper and oil.</p><p>It is home to some of the world’s largest deposits of rare earths used in high-tech industries. These resources have attracted significant attention, including from President Trump.</p><p>Gold pockets exist in areas like Nanortalik and South Greenland. Greenland also has deposits of diamonds in the Maniitsoq region, just north of Nuuk.</p><p>Copper deposits are largely unexplored in Greenland, according to the Mineral Resources Authority, with areas in the northeast and central east largely untapped. Iron ore deposits are dotted around West Greenland, while nickel traces have been found around the island’s southwest coast.</p><p>Graphite, used mostly in EV batteries and steel-making, is also reported to exist in Greenland, with exploration around Amitsoq. While zinc has been found in the north of Greenland, titanium and vanadium deposits are located in the southwest, east and south of the territory. Tungsten is also found in central east and Northeast Greenland with assessed deposits in the south and west.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3570887\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3570887\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3570887\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-Greenlands-mineral-resources-MARCH9-20250D-1741681526.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Greenlands mineral resources-MARCH9-2025-1741681526\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3570887\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-brief-history-of-greenland\">A brief history of Greenland</h2><p>The first Inuit people settled in Greenland in about 2500 BCE.</p><p>In the 10th century, Norse explorers arrived in Greenland and established settlements.

It is one of Denmark’s two autonomous territories, with the Faroe Islands being the other.</p><p>In 1941, during World War II, the US and Denmark agreed to allow American forces to defend Greenland. Its strategic location was vital for countering German submarines and securing shipping routes. The US maintained a military presence throughout the Cold War, using Greenland for early-warning radar and monitoring Soviet activity.</p><p>In 2009, Greenland gained self-rule over most of its internal affairs, including control over natural resources and governance. However, Denmark still handles foreign policy, defence and funding.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4194284 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-Where-is-Greeland-basic-history-1766595219.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Where is Greenland basic history-1766595219\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

There can be no going back – On that, everyone agrees!” he added.</p><p>In a separate post, Trump shared a screenshot showing messages, presumably from Rutte, in which he wrote, “I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.”</p><p>In another post, he shared screenshots of messages from French President Emmanuel Macron, who wrote, “I do not understand what you are doing in Greenland.” In the messages, Macron also offered to set up a Group of Seven meeting in Paris on Thursday.</p><p>Trump also posted mockup images created using artificial intelligence (AI) tools on Tuesday, showing himself holding the US flag in Greenland with a sign stating “US territory”. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are depicted in the image, standing behind him.</p><p>Another image Trump shared shows him in an Oval Office meeting with European leaders. It includes a map on an easel showing the US flag spanning Canada, Greenland and Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-trump-want-greenland\">Why does Trump want Greenland?</h2><p>The sparsely populated Arctic island of 56,000 people – mostly Indigenous Inuit – is geographically in North America but politically part of Denmark, making it part of Europe. Greenland withdrew from the European Community (EC/EU) in 1985 after it gained home rule, but maintains a special association with the EU as an Overseas Country and Territory (OCT), which grants limited internal market access and EU citizenship to Greenland’s residents through Denmark.</p><p>Trump has long coveted Greenland because of its strategic location and plentiful mineral deposits, including highly sought-after rare-earth metals required for the manufacture of a wide range of technology from smartphones to fighter planes. The island has therefore drawn increasing interest from leading powers as climate change opens up new shipping lanes in the Arctic.</p><p>Currently, Greenland’s economy relies mainly on fishing; locals oppose large-scale mining, and there is no oil or gas extraction.</p><p>The island’s geographical position between the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans provides the shortest air and sea routes between North America and Europe, making it crucial for US military operations and early-warning systems, especially around the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap, according to the Trump administration.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-trade-tariffs-is-trump-threatening\">What trade tariffs is Trump threatening?</h2><p>On January 17, Trump said, starting February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would be charged a 10 percent tariff on their exports to the US.</p><p>On June 1, the tariff would be increased to 25 percent, he said. “This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>A day after Trump posted this threat to social media, the 27 EU members convened for an emergency meeting.</p><p>In a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/dangerous-downward-spiral-european-leaders-slam-trumps-tariff-threat\">joint statement</a>, the eight countries targeted by Trump with new tariffs said they “stand in full solidarity” with Denmark and the people of Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.</p><p>“Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,” the statement said.</p><p>“Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-action-could-europe-take-against-trump-over-greenland\">What action could Europe take against Trump over Greenland?</h2><p>European leaders are contemplating several responses to Trump’s threat, ranging from diplomacy to retaliatory tariffs to the extreme, last-ditch “trade bazooka” – the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) – which could target specific goods and services the US has a trade surplus in with the EU.</p><p>However, the never-before-used ACI, which was adopted by the EU in 2023 following restrictions placed on Lithuanian exports by China, would likely take months to implement. It requires the agreement of a minimum of 15 EU countries, representing at least 65 percent of the bloc’s population. It also requires a months-long investigation process.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-does-europe-depend-on-the-us\">How much does Europe depend on the US?</h2><p>Europe has a growing dependence on Washington in various sectors.</p><h3>Defence</h3><p>In recent years, Europe has become increasingly dependent on the US for military and intelligence support, especially since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>Even before that, the US was providing Ukraine with significant <a href=\"/news/2025/3/6/how-will-us-pause-on-intelligence-sharing-affect-ukraine\">intelligence</a> support, which has not been detailed publicly. However, reports and officials highlight two crucial roles it has played – first, satellite and signals intelligence help Ukraine anticipate and prepare for Russian attacks, and second, it helps locate enemy troops and bases so Ukrainians can target them with missiles, including long-range systems which can reach inside Russian territory.</p><p>European NATO states received 64 percent of their arms imports from the US between 2020 and 2024, up from 52 percent during 2015-19, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published in March 2025.</p><p>The US contributed about 16 percent of NATO’s common budgets, the joint largest contribution, matched only by Germany’s, according to a NATO breakdown published last year.</p><p>“Militarily, nearly half of Europe’s recent procurement comes from the US, especially in critical backbone capabilities such as combat aircraft, missiles, air defence, software-driven systems and sustainment,” Christine Nissen, chief analyst at the Copenhagen-based Think Tank Europa, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“These dependencies are deeply locked in through platforms, upgrades, spare parts, data and interoperability.”</p><h3 id=\"economic-access-to-us-markets-europe-holds-about-10tr-of-us-treasury-bonds-jnflation-and-problems-for-both-how-much-does-europe-depend-on-the-us-market-energy-after-2022-when-russia-invaded-ukraine-europe-reduced-energy-dependance-from-russia-but-increased-dependance-on-us-gives-the-us-leverage-by-2030-if-current-trends-follow-80-defence-increasingly-dependant-on-us-esp-with-war-in-ukraine-military-and-intelligence-support\">Economy</h3><p>Europe is also highly dependent on the US for the provision of technology services and economic infrastructure, such as cloud services, semiconductors, digital platforms, satellite services, cybersecurity, energy technologies and parts of the financial system, Nissen said.</p><p>“In many of these domains, Europe relies on US firms, standards and regulatory reach, which amplifies Washington’s leverage in a confrontation.”</p><p>Investors in European countries hold more than $10 trillion of US Treasury bonds.</p><p>Bonds are investments through which investors lend money to a government or a company for a set time in exchange for regular interest payments and the original capital back at maturity to whoever is holding the bond at the time. Bonds can be bought and sold on financial markets, so the issuer of the bond may ultimately pay back a different investor from the one who first bought it.</p><p>Bonds usually offer lower returns than stock market shares but are seen as low-risk, especially government bonds.</p><p>US Treasury bonds are particularly popular as they are viewed as “safe-haven” assets. If US-Europe relations turn hostile, however, that safe haven would become highly politicised as there could be a perceived danger that the US might not repay the initial capital brought to buy the bonds.</p><p>Furthermore, if there is a rift in transatlantic relations, investors could panic and start selling off US Treasury bonds en masse. When lots of people sell at the same time, the price of bonds drops. This would mean that the value of the bonds EU members own would decline, and they would lose money on their huge pile of US bonds.</p><p>While this would be bad for the US economically, it would also mean that European holders of the bonds would no longer be able to fully rely on this stash of “safe” assets and might have difficulty finding other places big and stable enough to move that money to.</p><p>http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aXFD5/1/</p><p>“The [economic] dependency is mutual but asymmetric. For the US, Europe is mainly a major market and industrial partner, a commercial dependence. For Europe, the reliance is operational, technological and security-critical,” Nissen said.</p><p>“That asymmetry gives Washington durable structural influence, regardless of who occupies the White House.”</p><h3>Energy</h3><p>Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Europe has imposed sanctions on Russian oil and has gradually reduced its energy dependence on Russia.</p><p>Europe’s imports of Russian gas fell by 75 percent between 2021 and 2025, according to a report by the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), published on Monday.</p><p>Instead, Europe increased energy imports from the US, especially liquefied natural gas (LNG).</p><p>Europe’s imports of US LNG jumped from 21 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2021 to 81bcm in 2025 – almost a fourfold increase. “This means that EU countries sourced 57 percent of their LNG imports from the US in 2025,” the IEEFA report states.</p><p>The report also states that if the EU takes all the US LNG it has signed up for, and does not cut its gas use, by 2030, the US could be supplying almost 75 to 80 percent of its imports.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-if-europe-us-relations-break-down\">What happens if Europe-US relations break down?</h2><p>Europe has a lot to lose.</p><p>“A serious rupture with the US would likely reduce Europe’s access to critical military support, technology, intelligence, energy flows and parts of the financial and digital ecosystem,” Nissen said.</p><p>That dependence is why Europe has usually tried hard so far not to clash with the US, she said.</p><p>“In the short term, Europe cannot meaningfully decouple without real capability and economic costs,” Nissen said.</p><p>Therefore, she added, Europe is unlikely to abruptly break from the US, but rather gradually shift away from it by building new trading partnerships and developing its production capabilities for essential goods and services.</p><p>“Over the past weeks, Europe has started to move more explicitly toward diversification as a strategic hedge: reducing single-supplier exposure, widening partnerships and strengthening internal resilience,” Nissen said.</p><p>“At the same time, there is a much stronger political focus on building European capabilities – in defence production, critical technologies, energy infrastructure and industrial capacity. The logic is not decoupling from the US, but lowering vulnerability and increasing European room for manoeuvre over time.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_696a4d67-1768574311.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"620\" data-end=\"1042\">“Bubble” is probably the word most associated with “AI” right now, though we are slowly understanding that it is not just an economic time bomb; it also carries significant public health risks. Beyond the release of pollutants, the massive need for clean water by AI data centres can reduce sanitation and exacerbate gastrointestinal illness in nearby communities, placing additional strain on local health infrastructure.</p><h2 id=\"ai-s-energy-consumption-is-massive-and-increasingly-water-dependent\">AI’s energy consumption is massive and increasingly water-dependent</h2><p data-start=\"1117\" data-end=\"1420\">Generative AI is artificial intelligence that is able to generate new text, photos, code and more, and it has already infiltrated the lives of most people around the globe. ChatGPT alone is reported to receive around one billion queries in a single day, pointing to huge demand at the individual level.</p><p data-start=\"1422\" data-end=\"1922\">This, however, is only the tip of the iceberg. Companies such as Google, Apple and Microsoft are now embedding AI into their key products. Applications that utilise search results are quickly moving to have AI as a new standard in their algorithms. Whether it is shopping on Amazon or booking a flight or a hotel, AI is now being used in searches, and that demands more energy. As an example, a single AI-powered Google search is estimated to use up to 30 times more energy than its standard version.</p><p data-start=\"1924\" data-end=\"2319\">Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the current industry answer to this. They are chips that demand energy and produce heat. Though the thousands of small cores on GPUs enable parallel processing of massive, repetitive maths carried out by AI algorithms, a single chip can use up to 700 watts. This means that three chips alone can use roughly the same amount of energy as a home electric oven.</p><p data-start=\"2321\" data-end=\"2868\">The large amount of heat produced by data centres is cooled by up to hundreds of thousands of gallons of fresh water each day. With thousands of heat-generating chips stacked next to and on top of one another, a simple fan does not do the trick. Instead, water is pumped or immersed between and around chips in order to avoid system overheating. A recent report from the United Kingdom’s Government Digital Sustainability Alliance predicts that AI will increase global water usage from 1.1 billion cubic metres to 6.6 billion cubic metres by 2027.</p><p data-start=\"2870\" data-end=\"3284\">Some companies are attempting to use seawater in cooling. However, fresh water continues to be widely used for cooling in many facilities. Water recycling is another option, but not a simple one. Several companies use a “closed-loop system” to reduce the total amount of water needed. Nevertheless, dust and minerals collected during cooling can degrade water quality over time, requiring treatment or replacement.</p><h2 id=\"how-ai-driven-water-scarcity-threatens-public-health\">How AI-driven water scarcity threatens public health</h2><p data-start=\"3344\" data-end=\"3752\">Data centres being placed where water is already scarce can quickly translate into a healthcare burden, even before pollution becomes an issue. In 2023, Microsoft reported that 41 percent of its water withdrawals were from areas with water stress. Google, on the other hand, said that 15 percent of its water consumption occurred in areas with high water scarcity. Amazon did not disclose comparable figures.</p><p data-start=\"3754\" data-end=\"4277\">It is well established that water scarcity correlates with infections, malnourishment and declining hygiene. While most such studies focus on areas that are already impoverished, in many cases, these are exactly the places where data centres are planned to be built. In addition, the underlying cause remains the same. Less fresh water for local populations pushes households to prioritise drinking and cooking over washing hands, food or bathing. Naturally, this also leaves less water available for cleaning living spaces.</p><p data-start=\"4279\" data-end=\"4658\">The World Health Organization recognises that unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation and hygiene are conducive to the spread of diseases such as cholera and other diarrhoeal illnesses, along with a range of other pathogens. To make matters worse, several diseases associated with water scarcity can pass from person to person, raising the risk of sustained local transmission.</p><p data-start=\"4660\" data-end=\"4970\">The health burden on children is particularly alarming, as infections and deaths are more common than among adults. In fact, 84 percent of the global burden of diarrhoeal disease is borne by children under five, and infections with diarrhoeal pathogens have been linked to cognitive impacts later in childhood.</p><p data-start=\"4972\" data-end=\"5346\">Although it is too early to draw direct causal links between AI data centres and water-related diseases, the known facts make this a significant concern. It is established that AI data centres can significantly deplete local water supplies. It is also established that communities with poor water access face heightened risks of gastrointestinal disease and other illnesses.</p><p data-start=\"5348\" data-end=\"5655\">To claim that AI data centres are directly causing gastrointestinal disease would be poorly supported. However, the warning signs are increasingly difficult to ignore. When risks are foreseeable and severe, governments should not wait for people to start dying before putting preventative policies in place.</p><h2 id=\"marginalised-communities-are-already-reporting-polluted-water\">Marginalised communities are already reporting polluted water</h2><p data-start=\"5724\" data-end=\"6452\">In Newton County, Georgia, in the United States, Meta has built an AI data centre, and residents have reported discoloured, sediment-filled water coming out of their taps, which they attribute to the facility. Similarly, in Fayette County, residents have reported sediment in their water, which they believe coincided with nearby data centre construction. Another report from California suggests that a data centre planned along the San Francisco Bay in Bayview-Hunters Point has raised concerns about compounding environmental burdens in an already polluted community. In all these cases, the local population includes a significant Black and African American presence, a pattern that has raised environmental justice concerns.</p><p data-start=\"6454\" data-end=\"6743\">Accumulated residues can result in effects ranging from acute gastrointestinal illness to chronic conditions such as cancer. Microbial contamination can cause poisoning and acute disease, while chemical residues are associated with long-term harm, often acting as a slow, invisible threat.</p><p data-start=\"6745\" data-end=\"7145\">With plans for data centres in African countries such as Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa, further questions arise about who will bear the brunt of their environmental impacts and whether affected communities will receive sufficient protection or support. Weak regulatory oversight in some of these countries makes this uncertain. In many cases, serious community effects may go unreported altogether.</p><h2 id=\"why-corporate-water-promises-and-regulation-matter\">Why corporate water promises and regulation matter</h2><p data-start=\"7203\" data-end=\"7526\">Only 0.5 percent of the planet’s water is fresh water, and water is not only needed for data centres. It is also required for the power plants that generate electricity for them. The manufacture of chips and wiring similarly demands water, making water use an AI supply-chain issue rather than merely a data-centre problem.</p><p data-start=\"7528\" data-end=\"7991\">Many companies are promising sustainability, with some even claiming they aim to be “net water producers” or “water positive”. Even if such targets are achieved, which remains questionable, they must deliver benefits to the communities from which water is extracted. Providing more water for affluent areas while depleting supplies in places such as Newton County may satisfy corporate accounting standards, but local residents will still suffer the consequences.</p><p data-start=\"7993\" data-end=\"8792\">To meet their ethical obligations to the public, governments must rapidly catch up with the pace of AI expansion and data-centre construction. A healthy population is a productive one, and a lower public-health burden can reduce government spending while supporting development. More fundamentally, there is a collective moral obligation to build a sustainable future for coming generations by safeguarding water security and averting environmental catastrophe. This begins with legislation mandating transparent corporate reporting on water use and enforcing meaningful standards for sustainable management. Regulation must prioritise human wellbeing over short-term, extractive technological growth. As with climate change, unrestrained innovation risks further harm to both people and the planet.</p><p data-start=\"7993\" data-end=\"8792\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The United States attack on Venezuela on January 3 should be understood not simply as an unlawful use of force, but as part of a broader shift towards nihilistic geopolitics in which international law is openly subordinated to imperial management of global security. What is at stake is not only Venezuela’s sovereignty, but the collapse of any remaining confidence in the capacity of the United Nations system, and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council, to restrain aggression, prevent genocide, or uphold the core legal norms they claim to defend.</p><p>The military intervention, its political aftermath, and the accompanying rhetoric of US leadership together expose a system in which legality is invoked selectively, veto power substitutes for accountability, and coercion replaces consent. Venezuela thus becomes both a case study and a warning: not of the failure of international law as such, but of its deliberate marginalisation by those states entrusted with managing global security.</p><p>From the standpoint of international law, this action constitutes a crude, brazen, unlawful and unprovoked recourse to aggressive force, in clear violation of the core norm of the UN Charter, Article 2(4), which reads: “All Members of the United Nations shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” The only qualification to this prohibition is set out in Article 51: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.” This flagrant violation of Venezuelan territorial sovereignty and political independence was preceded by years of US sanctions, weeks of explicit threats, and recent lethal attacks on vessels allegedly transporting drugs, as well as seizures of tankers carrying Venezuelan oil.</p><p>This unilateral action was further aggravated by the capture of Venezuela’s head of state, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, by US Special Forces, reportedly guided by the CIA, to face charges of “narco-terrorism” in a US federal court, in apparent violation of sovereign immunity. This imperial posture, openly disregarding the immunity of foreign leaders, was underscored by President Trump’s declared intention to direct Venezuelan policymaking for an indefinite period, ostensibly until the country was “stabilised” sufficiently to restore oil production under the auspices of major US corporations, including Chevron, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. When asked who was in charge of Venezuela’s governance, Trump responded impatiently, “We are in charge.”</p><p>There is more politically at stake in this drastic reversal of the US Good Neighbour Policy, associated with Latin American diplomacy since 1933 and the presidency of Franklin D Roosevelt, than initially meets even the most discerning eye. Of course, this tradition of cooperative relations was repeatedly undermined after the Castro revolution in Cuba and Salvador Allende’s electoral victory in Chile.</p><p>Most informed observers assumed that the attack on Venezuela aimed at achieving regime change, installing Maria Corina Machado, an ardent advocate of US intervention, longtime leader of the anti-Maduro opposition, and 2025 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, whose acceptance speech lavishly praised Trump as the more deserving candidate. The most unexpected development of the intervention has been the bypassing of Machado, and the installation instead of Vice President Delcy Rodriguez as Venezuela’s new president. Washington claimed confidence that Rodriguez would cooperate with US interests, particularly in relation to Venezuelan oil and other resources, and restore stability on terms compatible with US priorities. Trump even declared that had Machado declined the Nobel Prize on the grounds that he deserved it, she would have become Venezuela’s president.</p><p>A more plausible explanation is that Machado lacked sufficient domestic support to stabilise the country, whereas Rodriguez appeared willing to accommodate US economic demands, particularly those relating to control over Venezuela’s resource wealth, while enjoying broader popular support. The pre-attack “pro-democracy” narrative promoted by US state propaganda gained limited credibility from this continuity of leadership, rather than a symbolic march into Caracas alongside Machado to preside over her inauguration as Venezuela’s new puppet leader. Yet after meeting Trump on January 9, executives of major US oil corporations, widely assumed to be the principal beneficiaries of the intervention, expressed reservations about resuming operations, citing concerns over instability following the US takeover.</p><h2 id=\"clarifying-relations-between-international-law-and-global-security\"><strong>Clarifying relations between international law and global security</strong></h2><p>This military operation in Venezuela, together with its political aftermath, clearly violates international law governing the use of force, as authoritatively codified in the UN Charter. Yet even this apparently straightforward assessment contains ambiguity. The charter’s institutional design privileges the five victorious powers of the second world war, granting them permanent membership of the Security Council and an unrestricted veto. In effect, responsibility for managing global security was deliberately entrusted to these states, which also became the first nuclear weapons powers, enabling any one of them to block Security Council action even when supported by a 14–1 majority.</p><p>The Security Council is the only political organ of the UN authorised to issue binding decisions, aside from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ, however, operates under voluntary jurisdiction, as states may withhold consent to what is known as “compulsory jurisdiction”. As a result, the management of global security has in practice been left to the discretion of the Permanent Five, usually dominated by the US or paralysed by vetoes.</p><p>In this sense, the Venezuelan operation should be understood less as signalling the collapse of international law than as an expression of nihilistic geopolitical management. If so, the appropriate remedy is not simply to strengthen international law, but to strip geopolitical actors of their self-assigned managerial role in global security. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in 2022 can be viewed similarly: a geopolitical failure, shaped by irresponsible NATO provocations, culminating in Russia’s own provoked yet egregious breach of Article 2(4).</p><p>The Venezuelan operation further erodes any residual confidence in the capacity of the Permanent Five, and especially Trump’s United States, to manage peace, security or genocide prevention. It therefore reinforces the need to consider alternative frameworks, either by curtailing the veto or by shifting security governance beyond the UN to counter-hegemonic mechanisms, including BRICS, China’s Belt and Road Initiative, and emerging South–South development frameworks.</p><p>It must nevertheless be emphasised that international law remains indispensable and effective in most areas of cross-border interaction. In domains such as diplomatic immunity, maritime and aviation safety, tourism and communications, negotiated legal standards are generally respected and disputes resolved peacefully. International law functions where reciprocity prevails, but has never constrained great-power ambition in the domain of global security, where asymmetries of hard power dominate.</p><h2 id=\"the-2025-us-national-security-strategy-nihilistic-geopolitics\"><strong>The 2025 US national security strategy: Nihilistic geopolitics</strong></h2><p>To understand Venezuela’s place within Trump’s worldview, it is essential to examine the National Security Strategy of the United States, released in November 2025. Trump’s cover letter is suffused with narcissism and contempt for internationalism, including international law, multilateral institutions, and the UN. He proclaims: “America is strong and respected again — and because of that, we are making peace all over the world.” Such rhetoric, pathological in any ordinary individual, is alarming when issued by a leader who controls the use of nuclear weapons. Trump concludes by promising to make America “safer, richer, freer, greater, and more powerful than ever before”.</p><p>The NSS repeatedly invokes “pre-eminence” as the central objective of US foreign policy, to be pursued by any means necessary. The Venezuelan intervention appears as a sequel to US complicity in Israel’s genocide in Gaza, and a possible prelude to further projects, including control over Greenland and renewed military threats against Iran. Yet the document’s primary focus is Latin America, framed through a revival of the Monroe Doctrine, now reinforced by the explicitly named “Trump Corollary,” colloquially dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine”.</p><p>This hemispheric turn abandons the post–Cold War ambition of global US leadership pursued by Obama and Biden, which consumed vast resources in failed state-building ventures in Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, it prioritises resource extraction, securing oil, rare earths and minerals with immense benefits for US corporations, while marginalising NATO and abandoning multilateralism, underlying the recent US withdrawal from participation in 66 separate institutional entities, including the climate change treaty. Venezuela, with its vast oil reserves, strategic location and authoritarian populist government, provided an ideal testing ground — and conveniently diverted attention from Trump’s personal entanglements with Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>In practical terms, the intervention resembles a coup rather than regime change, accompanied by an explicit demand that the new leadership take orders from Washington as the price of political survival. Trump and his Cuban exile secretary of state, Marco Rubio, openly linked Venezuela to future regime-change efforts in Colombia and Cuba, with Trump issuing a crude threat to Colombian President Gustavo Petro and US forces reportedly killing 32 Cuban members of Maduro’s Presidential Guard.</p><h2 id=\"implications\"><strong>Implications</strong></h2><p>It remains uncertain whether Delcy Rodriguez’s government will negotiate an arrangement that preserves formal sovereignty while surrendering substantive control. Such an outcome would signal an embrace of digital-age gunboat diplomacy, reversing the UN principle of Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources, and reinstating a hierarchical hemispheric order. This vision even contemplates the subordination of Canadian sovereignty to Washington’s political and economic preferences.</p><p>International reactions to the assault on Venezuela have been muted, reflecting fear, confusion or perceived futility. Meanwhile, geopolitical rivalry intensifies, particularly with Russia and China, raising the spectre of a new Cold War or nuclear conflict. The NSS makes clear that US preeminence requires excluding all extra-hemispheric powers from the region, by its repeated referencing of “our Hemisphere”.</p><p>The Venezuelan episode thus exemplifies a broader strategy: the rejection of international law, the marginalisation of the UN, and the unilateral assertion of US dominance in the Western Hemisphere, along with potential intervention almost anywhere on the planet, but with immediate relevance to Greenland and Iran.</p><p data-start=\"11253\" data-end=\"11451\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the only way to deter Israel.”</p><p>The demolition was carried out during a wider crackdown on humanitarian aid.

Al-Sharaa has used varying tactics against the group, recently announcing a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree</a> on Kurdish rights while also confronting the group militarily.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The SDF’s losses are al-Sharaa and his government’s gains. But the most significant sign of Syria’s improved standing may come from the fact that the United States, which has long backed the SDF as a partner in fighting ISIL (ISIS), has given its backing to al-Sharaa and the Syrian forces after these latest developments.</p><p>“This is a big win internally for al-Sharaa,” Rob Geist Pinfold, a lecturer at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera. “It certainly shores up his legitimacy in Syria, particularly among Sunni Arabs.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"ceasefire-and-agreements\">Ceasefire and agreements</h2><p>These recent advancements by the Syrian government have stripped away much of the SDF’s leverage.</p><p>“This was about [the Syrian government forces] taking control of the most resource-rich parts of SDF territory that had the demographically highest number of Arabs, so they managed to play this very well by having a limited offensive but, at the same time, getting the tribal networks to rise up against SDF rule; and once they did that, it was basically game over for the SDF,” Geist Pinfold, said.</p><p>When the Assad regime fell in December 2024, the SDF was hesitant to throw its hat into the ring with the new forces in Damascus. Negotiations between Mazloum Abdi, the SDF’s leader, also known as Mazloum Kobani, and al-Sharaa culminated in an agreement on March 10, 2025 to integrate the Kurdish-led forces into the Syrian government forces.</p><p>However, details of the agreement were still to be ironed out. The SDF did not want to give up the hard-fought gains it had made during the last 14 years of conflict. It has previously called for autonomous control or decentralised rule in the northeast.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Tension had simmered between the two sides, manifesting in recent clashes in Aleppo and an SDF withdrawal from the city across the Euphrates River. Syrian government forces advanced towards the northeast and have now taken territory, including the cities of Raqqa and Deir Az Zor.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/syria-sdf-ceasefire-hangs-in-balance-after-renewed-clashes-faltering-talks\">ceasefire was agreed</a> on Monday, but clashes continued on Tuesday in the Hasakah region of northeast Syria, as Kurds there and in the diaspora feared incursions by government forces.</p><p>Recent discussions seemed to have settled on a formula where the SDF leadership would maintain control over three Kurdish-led divisions in Syrian forces, while the rest of the fighters would integrate as individuals. Analysts said it now looks as though individual integration is more likely to go ahead.</p><p>“They [the Syrian government] have achieved a very big milestone by forcing the SDF to integrate as individuals,” Labib Nahhas, a Syrian analyst, told Al Jazeera. “But vetting will be a huge challenge because we are talking about 50 to 70 or 80,000 soldiers, so this is a massive infiltration from a security point of view.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"kurdish-rights\">Kurdish rights</h2><p>Before this significant development, the SDF had been negotiating with Damascus over a few key points. In addition to discussions about integration, it wanted some form of autonomy or political decentralisation and the recognition of Kurdish rights.</p><p>On January 16, on the back of fierce fighting between government forces and the SDF in Aleppo, al-Sharaa issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree</a> formally recognising Kurdish as a “national language” and restoring citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians.</p><p>The decree, which declared Newroz, the spring and new year festival celebrated by Kurds, a national holiday and banned ethnic or linguistic discrimination, addressed one key SDF demand.</p><p>Under the Assad regime, Kurds were an oppressed minority in Syria. Their language and identity were not officially recognised and often suppressed by the state.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The move was described by Obayda Ghadban, a researcher with Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, as historic.</p><p>“It has recognised the cultural, linguistic rights of Kurdish Syrians, which is a grievance that has been accumulating for decades,” he told Al Jazeera. “This was seen as a gesture of goodwill by the SDF and regained the momentum of negotiations that have been going [on] for more than a year now.”</p><p>Al-Sharaa announced a four-day ceasefire with the SDF on Tuesday and said if a deal could be reached, government forces would leave Kurdish-majority cities like Hasakah and Qamishli to handle their security themselves.</p><p>Despite the carrot-and-stick approach, some analysts felt al-Sharaa’s recognition of Kurdish rights was likely a political tactic.</p><p>“Had a similar decree been issued six months ago in the context of relative peace between the two sides, I believe the situation would have been very different,” Thomas McGee, Max Weber fellow at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The fact that no recognition of Kurdish rights came for the full first year after the fall of al-Assad is indeed significant. With this decree suddenly coming out within the context of large military developments shows that the Syrian government considers recognition of Kurdish rights as a tactical issue rather than such rights being considered innate and unconditional.”</p><p>Shortly after the announcement, al-Sharaa announced a military operation in Deir Hafir, a town in the north, 50km (31 miles) east of Aleppo, where SDF forces had retreated after evacuating the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh in Aleppo. Some Syrians and analysts told Al Jazeera that the SDF’s reputation had suffered amid the fighting in Aleppo, even among some Kurds, but it did not mean Kurds would throw their weight behind the government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“[Al-Sharaa] wanted to do this before the military operation,” Wladimir van Wilgenburg, an analyst of Kurdish politics based in Erbil, Iraq, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The Kurdish sentiment will not change much towards the government because it doesn’t recognise any form of local autonomy, and both <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/who-are-the-kurds-2\">the main Kurdish parties</a> want some form of autonomy or decentralisation.”</p><h2 id=\"us-and-turkiye\">US and Turkiye</h2><p>International actors will also have their eyes on the developments in northeast Syria.</p><p>Turkiye appears to be a big winner in the latest developments. The country <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/syrian-government-and-kurdish-led-sdf-fail-to-progress-on-military-merger\">warned the SDF</a> in early January that its “patience is running out” with the group.</p><p>“Ankara has welcomed the ceasefire and Full Integration Agreement, and it is certainly in Turkish interests,” McGee said. “Ultimately, on the SDF/self-administration integration, Turkiye and Damascus have long shared the same general red lines.”</p><p>There has also been a discussion about foreign fighters in SDF-controlled areas, which, under the ceasefire agreement, Nahhas said, the SDF was required to expel any “PKK-linked or affiliated individuals or operatives”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Then there is the United States, which helped broker the ceasefire due to its close relationship with the SDF and Damascus. The US currently has about 900 soldiers in the SDF-controlled parts of Syria for countering ISIL, and analysts said it was unlikely those troops would withdraw.</p><p>But under the Trump administration, relations between Washington and Damascus have warmed considerably.</p><p>Al-Sharaa, who had been considered a “terrorist” by the US when the Assad regime fell in 2024, visited the White House in November 2025, marking a remarkable turnaround in barely a year. Shortly after that visit, Syria <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/syria-signs-up-to-us-led-coalition-against-isil\">joined</a> the anti-ISIL coalition.</p><p>After a phone call with al-Sharaa, US President Donald Trump released a statement on Monday supporting Syria’s unity and “fight against terrorism”.</p><p>Not every US official was pleased with the recent events. US Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, posted on X on Tuesday his support for the SDF.</p><p>“You cannot unite Syria by the use of military force as Syrian government leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa is trying to do,” he wrote. “This move by Syrian government forces against SDF members is fraught with peril.”</p><p>Graham and others may be concerned about reports of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/isil-fighters-flee-jail-as-syrian-army-clashes-with-kurdish-led-sdf\">39 escaped ISIL detainees</a> from prisons previously held by the SDF, or, on the other side, SDF claims that government forces killed female Kurdish fighters.</p><p>But the sentiment in the US seems to be shifting heavily in favour of Damascus. On Tuesday afternoon, US Special Envoy for Syria Tom Barrack posted on X that the US was throwing its support behind al-Sharaa and choosing Damascus over the SDF.</p><p>“The greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria right now lies in the post-Assad transition under the new government led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa,” Barrack wrote. “This shifts the rationale for the US-SDF partnership: the original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps.”</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

You know, the ball was coming as a bomb, forehand and backhand.”</p><p>If the 22-year-old does win the Australian Open to complete the career Grand Slam of all four majors, he will be the youngest man to do so, surpassing compatriot Rafael Nadal.</p><p>The unpredictable Medvedev, runner-up in 2021, 2022 and 2024, is trying to keep his emotions in check this year and was on his best behaviour against Frenchman Quentin Halys.</p><p>He lost a tight first set but the result was never in doubt as he surged to the finish line 6-7 (9/11), 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.</p><p>“It was a very tough match, happy I managed to fight,” said the Russian, who faces Fabian Marozsan of Hungary next.</p><p>American Tommy Paul, Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo and Tomas Etcheverry, Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Russian Andrey Rublev also safely negotiated the second round.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256449\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256449\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256449\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260121__93FK8XX__v1__HighRes__TennisAusOpen-1768980202.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Aryna Sabalenka in action\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256449\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Belarus’s Aryna Sabalenka serves against China’s Bai Zhuoxuan during their singles match on day four [William West/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"sabalenka-gauff-on-form\">Sabalenka, Gauff on form</h2><p>Four-time major winner Sabalenka raced 5-0 clear of qualifier Bai Zhuoxuan, ranked a lowly 702, on centre court before wobbling to give the Chinese player a glimmer of hope.</p><p>But the top seed quickly snuffed it out to race home 6-3, 6-1 and set up a clash next with Russian-born Anastasia Potapova, now representing Austria, who dispatched 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.</p><p>“Super happy to close the (first) set, it gives me confidence that my game is there, my focus is there,” said Sabalenka, who is bidding for a third Australian Open title in four years.</p><p>“Step by step.

It will certainly engulf the wider region and have an impact on ordinary people around the globe”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last week, Iran shut its airspace, likely in anticipation of a US attack. Diplomats from Middle East countries, particularly from Gulf Arab countries, lobbied Trump not to attack.</p><p>The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which had been in the South China Sea in recent days, on Tuesday passed through the Strait of Malacca, a key waterway connecting the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, ship-tracking data shows.</p><p>While US defence officials stopped short of saying the carrier strike group was headed to the Middle East, its location in the Indian Ocean means it is only days away from moving into the region.</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-latest-threat\">Trump’s latest threat</h2><p>Araghchi’s comments came a day after Trump repeated a warning that Iran would be wiped “off the face of this earth” if it ever succeeded in assassinating the US leader.</p><p>“I have very firm instructions. Anything happens, they’re going to wipe them off the face of this earth,” Trump said in a News Nation interview that aired on Tuesday.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, in response to any threats facing Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iranian General Abolfazl Shekarchi was quoted as saying Trump already knew Tehran would not hold back if the tables were turned.</p><p>“Trump knows that if a hand of aggression is extended toward our leader, we will not only sever that hand, and this is not a mere slogan,” Iranian state media reported, quoting Shekarchi. “But we will set their world on fire and leave them no safe haven in the region.”</p><p>Trump issued a similar warning to Iran a year ago, shortly after returning to the White House, when he told reporters, “If they do it, they get obliterated.”</p><h2 id=\"deadly-protests\">Deadly protests</h2><p>Iran is still reeling from violence unleashed during some of the biggest <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/iran-just-getting-started-on-punishing-rioters-arrested-during-protests\">antigovernment protests</a> since the Islamic revolution in 1979.</p><p>Human rights groups are working to confirm the number of people killed during the protests. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said the death toll had reached at least 4,519, while more than 26,300 people have been arrested.</p><p>On Sunday, an Iranian ‌official in the region told the Reuters news agency that the authorities ‍had verified at least 5,000 people had been killed in protests, including about 500 security personnel, blaming “terrorists and armed rioters” ⁠for killing “innocent Iranians”.</p><p>Iranian authorities have increasingly pointed the finger at foreign powers for the unrest, accusing longstanding geopolitical rivals – mainly Israel and the US – of fomenting instability and directing operations on the ground.</p><p>Al Jazeera has been unable to independently assess the death toll.</p><p>Videos that have slipped out of Iran despite an internet shutdown appear to show security forces repeatedly using live fire to target apparently unarmed protesters, something unaddressed by Araghchi.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
