Critics have questioned whether Jeri’s outfit — which had a deep hood that rendered him nearly unrecognisable — was meant to be a disguise.</p><p>Additional footage placed Jeri at another one of Yang’s businesses days later. Jeri also allegedly met a second Chinese businessman, Jiwu Xiaodong, who was reportedly under house arrest for illegal activities.</p><p>Jeri has dismissed some of the off-the-books meetings as planning for an upcoming Chinese-Peruvian friendship event. Others, he said, were simply shopping trips for sweets and other food. He has denied wrongdoing but has acknowledged taking the meetings was a “mistake”.</p><p>“I have not lied to the country. I have not done anything illegal,” Jeri told the news outlet Canal N.</p><p>But critics have accused Jeri of using his position for influence-peddling at the unregistered interactions.</p><p>Similar accusations erupted earlier this month when Peruvian media highlighted the irregular hiring of several women in Jeri’s administration and contracts he awarded as possible evidence of bribery.</p><p>The debate over Jeri’s removal comes as Peru hurtles towards a general election on April 12, with the presidency up for grabs. Jeri will not be running to retain his seat.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.”</p><p>It was not clear from his message what those legal reasons might be. But Trump’s post comes two days after the US House of Representatives successfully passed a bill to require documents that prove citizenship before voter registration.</p><p>That bill, however, is unlikely to go any further, as it faces steep odds in the Senate.</p><p>In the US, it is illegal for non-citizens to participate in elections, and voter fraud is exceedingly rare.</p><p>Nevertheless, Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that election rigging is widespread. Trump himself has continued to falsely claim that he won the 2020 presidential election, despite bipartisan pushback from election officials about the accuracy of the tally.</p><p>But faced with drooping poll numbers, Trump has turned his attention to November’s midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress for the last two years of his term.</p><p>Already, Trump has expressed fears that, should the Democrats claim the majority in the Republican-held House of Representatives, he could face a third impeachment.</p><p>He was successfully impeached twice in his first term, once for abusing his office and a second time for inciting an insurrection, after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p><p>The midterms featured prominently in Trump’s message on Friday. He urged Republicans to leverage popular support for voter ID laws in their campaigns for November.</p><p>“Republicans must put this at the top of every speech – It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND,” Trump wrote.</p><p>A study from the Pew Research Center in 2025 found that US citizens from both major parties overwhelmingly supported requiring photo identification before registering to vote.</p><p>The rate was higher among Republicans, 95 percent of whom supported such measures. But approximately 71 percent of Democrats also favoured such legislation.</p><p>But voting rights advocates and Democratic leadership have largely opposed such measures.</p><p>They argue that providing photo identification could be burdensome for members of low-income and marginalised communities who may not have easy access to documents that prove their identity.</p><p>That, in turn, could disenfranchise US citizens who might otherwise cast a ballot.</p><p>Voter ID laws are not uncommon in the US, though: Roughly 36 states have measures on the books that require residents to show proof of identity before voting, though they vary as to their strictness.</p><p>Congress has also weighed such bills before, including last year. But a renewed push has begun as the midterm elections approach and Trump pressures states for increased federal control over elections.</p><p>The US Constitution requires that states, not the federal government, administer the “times, places and manner of holding elections”. Election organising, therefore, takes place at the state and local level.</p><p>But Trump has threatened to take away that constitutional power. Speaking to conservative podcaster Dan Bongino earlier this month, the president suggested the federal government should take over the election process.</p><p>“We should take over the voting, the voting, in at least, many, 15 places,” Trump said, tripping over his words slightly. “The Republicans ought to nationalise the voting.”</p><p>His comments coincided with the reintroduction of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act earlier this month.</p><p>The expanded version of the bill initially required proof of citizenship, not just at the time of voter registration but ahead of each ballot cast, in the form of a passport or a birth certificate – documents many US citizens lack.</p><p>That provision has since been amended, but critics have also blasted measures that would require state voter rolls to go to the federal government as unconstitutional.</p><p>The bill passed the House on Wednesday with 218 votes in support and 213 against. Only one Democrat, Henry Cuellar, voted in favour of the latest SAVE Act.</p><p>But even with its House passage, the legislation is unlikely to attract enough backing to overcome the Senate filibuster, a tool which allows the minority to block passage of a bill if it fails to attract at least 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber.</p><p>Trump railed against the filibuster, and Democrats in general, in his social media post on Friday.</p><p>“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” he wrote.</p><p>He also called upon the Supreme Court to reject Democrats’ priorities, calling them “corrupt”, “deranged”, “demented” and “evil”.</p><p>But advocacy groups like the Brennan Center for Justice called on the Senate to reject the latest voter ID push.</p><p>“These bills are part of a broader federal agenda to sow distrust in our elections, undermine election administration, and discourage Americans from making their voices heard,” the Brennan Center said in a statement.</p><p>“Congress should stand firm once again and reject the SAVE Act.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

This is the person who fixes your problems,” the aide added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>‘The only safety net they have’</h3><p>Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a constitutional law scholar at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the People’s Party may have made a strategic mistake by neglecting “to combat the entrenched influence of Baan Yai” over local voters.</p><p>“Because resources are so scarce, rural populations do not view an MP as a representative in the civic sense … instead, they see them as a ‘clan leader’,” Khemthong explained.</p><p>“They remain tethered to this patronage system because it is effectively the only safety net they have,” he said.</p><p>Thailand’s last election in 2023 delivered a shock warning to some of those dynasties – in Chiang Mai and Chonburi – as younger voters could not be counted on to respect the influence of the Baan Yai at the polls.</p><p>That year, a so-called “orange wave” got behind the strong pro-democracy and reform message of the Move Forward Party – the People’s Party predecessor – after nine years of military rule by former army chief Prayut Chan-ocha.</p><p>Move Forward won that election, but it was promptly dissolved as a political party by the courts over its intention to reform the country’s draconian royal defamation laws, which protect Thailand’s powerful monarchy from criticism.</p><p>Move Forward rose from the ashes and came back as the People’s Party. But with its front-line leaders banned from politics, the movement struggled to reorganise across Thailand, another reason given for the party’s shortfall at the polls last weekend.</p><p>History also appears to be repeating.</p><p>Barely 24 hours after polling stations closed, Thailand’s National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) forwarded a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to ban 44 of the People’s Party Members of Parliament – including Natthaphong – from politics.</p><p>The Supreme Court’s decision could result in a lifetime ban for the progressive MPs – the latest legal blows to its momentum.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/will-pro-military-message-bring-thailands-most-hawkish-party-to-power\">Nationalism also played a big part</a> in Anutin’s win, particularly in the wake of the recent border war with neighbouring Cambodia.</p><p>Bhumjaithai cast itself as the party that got behind the military during the conflict and cast its political rivals as less able to protect the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"politicians-buy-the-poverty-of-rural-people\">‘Politicians buy the poverty of rural people’</h2><p>Now, as <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/as-thais-head-to-polls-can-the-reformist-peoples-party-break-the-cycle\">election analysts assess the results</a>, it appears that the return of the Baan Yai was the most crucial to Anutin’s decisive win, as old political power brokers consolidated under Bhumjaithai’s conservative credentials and refrained from splitting the vote share, which would have been advantageous to the progressive bloc.</p><p>“Voter turnout is at a historic low in the last 30 years, only 65 percent, according to the Election Commission,” said Prinya Thaewanarumitkul, a Thai politics expert and an academic at Thammasat University in Bangkok.</p><p>“When voter turnout is low, the ‘organised votes’ [mobilised supporters] and the influence of the ‘Baan Yais’ become the deciding factors,” he said.</p><p>Preliminary results show that Bhumjaithai made significant gains from central Thailand to the northeast, as well as the southernmost border area with Malaysia – many seats being won due to support from political families who expressed their support publicly for Anutin before the vote.</p><p>Beyond the drop in support for reformers and MPs losing their seats, the vote has left many Gen Z supporters at a loss as to why people did not choose to change Thailand for the better. They wonder why their countrymen appear to have thrown their support behind conservatism rather than change, especially when the poor are falling further behind the rich in Thailand’s slowing economy.</p><p>For People’s Party voter Arsikin Singthong, 22, who lives in Thailand’s southern Muslim-majority border province of Pattani, the reason can be found in money, politics and rural poverty.</p><p>“These Baan Yai politicians buy the poverty of rural people. This is the game,” Arsikin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But they can’t buy the urban population any more because we have already woken up,” she said.</p><p>The return of the political dynasties as power brokers reflects the systemic poverty still found in many parts of rural Thailand, analysts say.</p><p>The northeast, north and south lean towards political dynasties and populist promises in nearly all Thai elections, they say.</p><p>“The country is fundamentally split by resource allocation,” said Chulalongkorn University’s Khemthong.</p><p>“A younger generation has managed to break free from these patronage networks,” Khemthong said, referring to urban voters who form the People’s Party support base in Bangkok and elsewhere.</p><p>“They have the luxury of dissent because they have exited the system that still binds those left behind,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Then, on June 6, it abruptly announced Abrego Garcia had been returned, only to file criminal charges against him and seek his deportation a second time.</p><p>Another case involved a Guatemalan man, identified only by his initials OCG.</p><p>He had been under a court protection order that barred him from being returned to Guatemala, for fear that his identity as a gay man would subject him to persecution.</p><p>But the Trump administration detained and deported him instead to Mexico, which in turn sent him back to Guatemala. He subsequently went into hiding for his safety.</p><p>In June, OCG was returned to the US after a court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. It also noted that OCG’s deportation “lacked any semblance of due process”.</p><p>Lopez Belloza continues her studies at Babson College remotely from Honduras as she awaits the outcome of her legal proceedings.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If you saw a building burning down with children inside, you wouldn’t hesitate to bang down the door to save those children’s lives. It is exactly the same principle. You don’t care about the value of the door. It is about those lives. It is about the liberation of Palestine. And so we do our bit to shut down the Israeli weapons trades from Britain.”</p><p>The group has been a thorn in Starmer’s side since Israel began its genocidal onslaught in Gaza.</p><p>Palestine Action-linked activists have carried out several raids, often leaving their mark in red spray paint intended to symbolise blood.</p><p>Dozens are currently being held on remand in relation to two actions.</p><p>Some prisoners, known as part of the “Filton 24”, are alleged to have participated in a break-in at a UK subsidiary of Elbit Systems in Bristol.</p><p>Others are accused of involvement in a break-in at the UK’s largest air base in Oxfordshire, where they were alleged to have spray-painted two Voyager refuelling and transport planes. It was after this raid that the government banned Palestine Action.</p><p>They all deny the charges against them, such as burglary and criminal damage.</p><p>Six of the “Filton 24” were recently <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/uk-pro-palestinian-activists-not-guilty-of-aggravated-burglary\">acquitted</a> of aggravated burglary; five of them were bailed.</p><p>“At its core, Palestine Action is an organisation that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality. A very small number of its actions have amounted to terrorist action,” the High Court judges said.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have protested against the ban. Almost 3,000 of them have been arrested for raising placards with slogans such as: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”</p><p>“The government committed a huge crime against its own population,” said Ammori. “It was unlawful for them to ban Palestine Action, and when they banned Palestine Action, they subsequently did thousands of unlawful arrests against their own citizens and tried to prosecute them through the courts for terrorism offences, for holding up signs.”</p><p>Despite Friday’s ruling, the ban remains in place pending appeal.</p><p>The UK’s Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “disappointed” by Friday’s ruling and intends to appeal – earning further criticism from rights groups and some fellow Labour politicians.</p><p>John McDonnell, an MP who voted against the proscription, said on X, “I thought it was unjust. We have a right to protest, to assemble, and to speak freely in this country – that has been secured largely by direct action over centuries. I am urging the government to abide by that tradition and not to appeal this judgement.”</p><p>“Shabana Mahmood needs to take a step back,” said Ammori. “She’s completely betrayed the Palestinian people since she’s become minister … it’s only going to backfire on her.</p><p>“Palestine Action’s ban will be lifted … We won today in the High Court … If they try and appeal, we’ll beat them again.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

So is our nation,” Johnson wrote on the social media site X, as she thanked Trump for his “continued commitment to second chances”.</p><p>Johnson said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones “personally” shared the news with Newton, who won three Super Bowls with the team.</p><p>The White House did not return a request for comment Thursday night on why Trump, an avid sports fan, pardoned the players.</p><p>Klecko, a former star for the New York Jets, pleaded guilty to perjury after lying to a federal grand jury that was investigating insurance fraud. A defensive lineman, Klecko was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2023. He was a two-time Associated Press All-Pro player and a four-time Pro Bowler.</p><p>Newton, an offensive lineman, pleaded guilty to a federal drug trafficking charge after authorities discovered $10,000 in his pick-up truck as well as 175 pounds (79kg) of marijuana in an accompanying car driven by another man. Newton was a two-time All-Pro player and six-time Pro Bowler.</p><p>Lewis, formerly of the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns, pleaded guilty in a drug case in which he used a cellphone to try to set up a drug deal not long after he was a top pick in the 2000 NFL draft. Lewis, a running back, was named an All-Pro once and was a one-time Pro Bowler. He was named the 2003 AP Offensive Player of the Year.</p><p>Henry, who played for the Denver Broncos, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic cocaine for financing a drug ring that moved the drug between Colorado and Montana. He was a running back for three teams and a one-time Pro Bowler.</p><p>And Cannon — who played with the Houston Oilers, Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs — admitted to counterfeiting in the mid-1980s after a series of bad investments and debts left him broke.</p><p>Cannon was a two-time All-Pro player and a two-time Pro Bowler. Cannon also won the 1959 Heisman Trophy while starring for Louisiana State University, where he had one of the most memorable plays in college football history: an 89-yard punt return for a touchdown against Ole Miss. He died in 2018.</p></div></div></body></html>"
