But Donald Trump returned to the White House in January and quickly ended their US dream.</p><p>Gomez found herself spending the holiday in northern Venezuela for the first time in eight years. She dressed up, cooked, got her son a scooter and smiled for her in-laws. Hard as she tried, though, she could not ignore the main challenges facing returning migrants: unemployment and poverty.</p><p>“We had a modest dinner, not quite what we’d hoped for, but at least we had food on the table,” Gomez said of the lasagne-like dish she shared with her partner and in-laws instead of the traditional Christmas dish of stuffed corn dough hallacas. “Making hallacas here is a bit expensive, and since we’re unemployed, we couldn’t afford to make them.”</p><p>Gomez, her two sons and her partner returned to the city of Maracay on October 27 after crossing the US-Mexico border to Texas, where they were quickly swept up by US Border Patrol amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. They were deported to Mexico, from where they began the dangerous journey back to Venezuela.</p><p>They crossed Central America by bus, but once in Panama, the family could not afford to continue to Colombia via boat in the Caribbean. Instead, they took the cheaper route along the Pacific’s choppy waters, sitting on top of sloshing petrol tanks in a cargo boat for several hours and then transferring to a fast boat until reaching a jungled area of Colombia. They spent about two weeks there until they were wired money to make it to the border with Venezuela.</p><p>Gomez was among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who left their home country in the last decade, when its economy came undone as a result of a drop in oil prices, corruption and mismanagement. She lived in Colombia and Peru for years before setting her sights on the US with hopes of building a new life.</p><h2 id=\"steady-deportations\">Steady deportations</h2><p>Trump’s second term has dashed the hopes of many like Gomez.</p><p>As of September, more than 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, had returned to South America since <a href=\"/features/2025/12/19/how-ice-deports-refugees-and-migrants-despite-years-of-good-conduct\">Trump moved to limit migration to the US</a>, according to figures from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. In addition, Venezuelans were steadily deported to their home country this year after <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/trump-warns-maduro-not-to-play-tough-as-china-russia-back-venezuela\">President Nicolas Maduro</a>, under pressure from the White House, did away with his longstanding policy of not accepting deportees from the US.</p><p>Immigrants arrived regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a US government contractor or Venezuela’s state-owned airline. More than 13,000 migrants returned this year on the chartered flights.</p><p>Gomez’s return to Venezuela also allowed her to see the now 20-year-old daughter she left behind when she fled the country’s complex crisis. They talked and drank beer during the holiday, knowing it might be the last time they shared a drink for a while – Gomez’s daughter will migrate to Brazil next month.</p><p>Gomez is hoping to make hallacas for New Year’s Eve and is also hoping for a job. But her prayers for next year are mostly for good health.</p><p>“I ask God for many things, first and foremost life and health, so we can continue enjoying our family,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Now we wait for him to wake up from anaesthesia,” his wife Michelle announced in an Instagram post.</p><p class=\"p1\">Bolsonaro has been serving a 27-year term since November for an attempted coup. He was granted court permission to leave prison after federal police doctors confirmed that he needed the procedure.</p><p class=\"p1\">Doctors say Bolsonaro’s double hernia causes him pain. The former leader, who was in power between 2019 and 2022, has gone through several other surgeries since he was stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in 2018. He was also diagnosed with skin cancer recently.</p><p class=\"p1\">Doctors for the far-right president from 2019 to 2022 anticipated that his hospitalisation would last between five and seven more days.</p><p class=\"p1\">The surgery was to repair an inguinal hernia – a protrusion in the groin area due to a tear in the abdominal muscles.</p><p class=\"p1\">“It is a complex surgery,” Dr Claudio Birolini said on Wednesday. “But it is a standardised … scheduled surgery, so we expect the procedure to be carried out without major complications.”</p><p class=\"p1\">After the operation, doctors are to assess whether Bolsonaro can undergo an additional procedure: blockage of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm, for recurrent hiccups, Birolini said.</p><p class=\"p1\">Brazil’s Supreme Court sentenced Bolsonaro to prison in September after he was found guilty of having led a scheme to prevent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office and to retain power.</p><p class=\"p1\">Bolsonaro has maintained his innocence, declaring he was a victim of political persecution.</p><p class=\"p1\">He has been confined to a small room with a minibar, air conditioning and a television at the federal police headquarters in Brasilia.</p><h2 id=\"succession\">Succession</h2><p class=\"p1\">Early on Thursday, his eldest son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, told reporters before the surgery that his father had written a letter confirming he had appointed him as the Liberal Party’s presidential candidate in next year’s election. Flavio announced on December 5 that he would challenge Lula, who is seeking a fourth nonconsecutive term, as the party’s candidate.</p><p class=\"p1\">The senator read the letter to journalists, and his office released a reproduction of it to the media.</p><p class=\"p1\">“He represents the continuation of the path of prosperity that I began well before becoming president, as I believe we must restore the responsibility of leading Brazil with justice, resolve and loyalty to the aspirations of the Brazilian people,” Bolsonaro said in the handwritten letter, dated Thursday.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4195856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/afp_694d70875921-1766682759.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, son of former President Jair Bolsonaro, attends a session of the committee discussing the bill that reduces the sentences of those convicted of attempted coup d'etat in Brasilia, on December 17, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4195856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, son of former President Jair Bolsonaro, in Brasilia, on December 17, 2025 [AFP]</figcaption></figure><p class=\"p1\">According to Flavio, the letter sought to clarify any “doubt” about his father’s support for his presidential bid.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Many people say they had not heard it from his own mouth or had not seen a letter signed by him. I believe this clears up any shadow of doubt,” he said after reading the letter.</p><p class=\"p1\">The former president and several of his allies were convicted by a panel of Supreme Court justices for attempting to overthrow Brazil’s democratic system following his 2022 election defeat.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The first wave was the 1920 Cork hunger strike, during the Irish War of Independence. Some 65 people suspected of being Republicans had been held without proper trial proceedings at the Cork County Gaol.</p><p>They began a hunger strike, demanding their release and asking to be treated as political prisoners rather than criminals. They were joined by Terence MacSwiney, the lord mayor of Cork, whose profile brought significant international attention to the independence cause. The British government attempted to break up the movement by transferring the prisoners to other locations, but their fasts continued. At least three prisoners died, including MacSwiney, after 74 days.</p><p>Later on, towards the end of the conflict and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, imprisoned Irish Republicans protested against their internment and the withdrawal of political prisoner status that stripped them of certain rights: the right to wear civilian clothes, or to not be forced into labour.</p><p>They began the “dirty protest” in 1980, refusing to have a bath and covering walls in excrement. In 1981, scores of people refused to eat. The most prominent among them was Bobby Sands, an IRA member who was elected as a representative to the British Parliament while he was still in jail. Sands eventually starved to death, along with nine others, during that period, leading to widespread criticism of the Margaret Thatcher administration.</p><p id=\"india-s-mohandas-karamchand-gandhi-who-was-later-popularly-known-as-mahatma-gandhi-used-hunger-strikes-as-a-tool-of-protest-against-the-british-colonial-masters-several-times-his-fasts-referred-to-as-satyagraha-meaning-holding-on-to-truth-in-hindi-were-considered-by-the-politician-and-activist-not-only-as-a-political-act-but-also-a-spiritual-one\">India’s Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was later popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, used hunger strikes as a tool of protest against the British colonial rulers several times. His fasts, referred to as Satyagraha, meaning holding on to truth in Hindi, were considered by the politician and activist not only as a political act but also a spiritual one.</p><p>Gandhi’s strikes sometimes lasted for days or weeks, during which he largely sipped water, sometimes with some lime juice. They achieved mixed results – sometimes, the British policy changed, but at other times, there were no improvements. Gandhi, however, philosophised in his many writings that the act was not a coercive one for him, but rather an attempt at personal atonement and to educate the public.</p><p>One of Gandhi’s most significant hunger strikes was in February 1943, after British authorities placed him under house arrest in Pune for starting the Quit India Movement back in August 1942. Gandhi protested against the mass arrests of Congress leaders and demanded the release of prisoners by refusing food for 21 days. It intensified public support for independence and prompted unrest around the country, as workers stayed away from work and people poured out into the streets in protest.</p><p>Another popular figure who used hunger strikes to protest against British rule in colonial India was Jatindra Nath Das, better known as Jatin Das. A member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, Das refused food while in detention for 63 days starting from August 1929, in protest against the poor treatment of political prisoners. He died at the age of 24, and his funeral attracted more than 500,000 mourners.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2183392\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2183392\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2183392\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AP23122282045915-1683024691.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinian kids wave their national flag and hold posters showing Khader Adnan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2183392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinian kids wave their national flag and hold posters showing Khader Adnan following his death on May 2, 2023 [Majdi Mohammed/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"palestinian-prisoners-in-israeli-prisons\">Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons</h2><p>Palestinians held, often without trial, in Israeli jails have long used hunger strikes as a form of protest. One of the most well-known figures is <a href=\"/news/2023/5/2/palestinian-hunger-striker-khader-adnan-dies-in-israeli-prison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Khader Adnan,</a> whose shocking death in May 2023 after an 86-day hunger strike drew global attention to the appalling treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli government.</p><p>Adnan, who was 45 when he starved to death at the Ayalon Prison, leaving behind nine children, had repeatedly been targeted by Israeli authorities since the early 2000s. The baker from the occupied West Bank had once been part of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group as a spokesperson, although his wife later stated publicly that he had left the group and that he had never been involved in armed operations.</p><p>However, Adnan was arrested and held without trial multiple times, with some estimates stating that he spent a cumulative eight years in Israeli prisons. Adnan would often go on hunger strike during those detentions, protesting against what he said was usually a humiliating arrest and a detention without basis. In 2012, thousands in Gaza and the West Bank rallied in a non-partisan show of support after he went 66 days without food, the longest such strike in Palestinian history at the time. He was released days after the mass protests.</p><p>In February 2023, Adnan was once again arrested. He immediately began a hunger strike, refusing to eat, drink, or receive medical care. He was held for months, even as medical experts warned the Israeli government that he had lost significant muscle mass and had reached a point where eating would cause more damage than good. On the morning of May 2, Adnan was found dead in his cell, making him the first Palestinian prisoner to die in a hunger strike in three decades. Former Palestinian Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti described his death as an “assassination” by the Israeli government.</p><h2 id=\"hunger-strikes-at-guantanamo-h2-p-following-the-2002-opening-of-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-camp-of-the-united-states-in-cuba-where-hundreds-of-terror-suspects-were-held-prisoners-often-with-no-formal-charges-they-used-hunger-strikes-in-waves-to-protest-against-their-detention-the-camp-is-notorious-for-its-inhumane-conditions-and-prisoner-torture-there-were-15-detainees-left-by-january-2025\">Hunger strikes at Guantanamo</h2><p id=\"following-the-2002-opening-of-the-guantanamo-bay-detention-camp-of-the-united-states-in-cuba-where-hundreds-of-terror-suspects-were-held-prisoners-often-with-no-formal-charges-they-used-hunger-strikes-in-waves-to-protest-against-their-detention-the-camp-is-notorious-for-its-inhumane-conditions-and-prisoner-torture-there-were-15-detainees-left-by-january-2025\">Following the 2002 opening of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp of the United States in Cuba, where hundreds of “terror” suspects were held prisoners, often with no formal charges, they used hunger strikes in waves to protest against their detention. The camp is notorious for its inhumane conditions and prisoner torture. There were 15 detainees left by January 2025.</p><p>The secret nature of the prison prevented news of earlier hunger strikes from emerging. However, in 2005, US media reported mass hunger strikes by scores of detainees – at least 200 prisoners, or a third of the camp’s population.</p><p>Officials forcefully fed those whose health had severely deteriorated through nasal tubes. Others were cuffed daily, restrained, and force-fed. One detainee, Lakhdar Boumediene, later wrote that he went without a real meal for two years, but that he was forcefully fed twice a day: he was strapped down in a restraining chair that inmates called the “torture chair”, and a tube was inserted in his nose and another in his stomach. His lawyer also told reporters that his face was usually masked, and that when one side of his nose was broken one time, they stuck the tube in the other side, his lawyer said. Sometimes, the food got into his lungs.</p><p>Hunger strikes would continue intermittently through the years at Guantanamo. In 2013, another big wave of strikes began, with at least 106 of the remaining 166 detainees participating by July. Authorities force-fed 45 people at the time. One striker, Jihad Ahmed Mustafa Dhiab, filed for an injunction against the government to stop officials from force-feeding him, but a court in Washington, DC rejected his lawsuit.</p><h2 id=\"protests-against-apartheid-south-africa\">Protests against apartheid South Africa</h2><p>Black and Indian political prisoners held for years on Robben Island protested against their brutal conditions by going on a collective hunger strike in July 1966. The detainees, including Nelson Mandela, had been facing reduced food rations and were forced to work in a lime quarry, despite not being criminals. They were also angry at attempts to separate them along racial lines.</p><p>In his 1994 biography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela wrote that prison authorities began serving bigger rations, even accompanying the food with more vegetables and hunks of meat to try to break the strike. Prison wardens smiled as the prisoners rejected the food, he wrote, and the men were driven especially hard at the quarry. Many would collapse under the intensity of the work and the hunger, but the strikes continued.</p><p>A crucial plot twist began when prison wardens, whom Mandela and other political prisoners had taken extra care to befriend, began hunger strikes of their own, demanding better living conditions and food for themselves. Authorities were forced to immediately settle with the prison guards and, a day later, negotiate with the prisoners. The strike lasted about seven days.</p><p>Later, in May 2017, South Africans, including the then Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was imprisoned in a different facility during apartheid, supported hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners by participating in a collective one-day fast. At the time, late Robben Island veteran Sunny “King” Singh wrote in the South African paper Sunday Tribune that hunger strikes in the prison never lasted more than a week before things changed, and compared it with the protracted situation of Palestinian strikers.</p><p>“We were beaten by our captors but never experienced the type of abuse and torture that some of the Palestinian prisoners complain of,” he wrote. “It was rare that we were put in solitary confinement, but this seems commonplace in Israeli jails.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The DMZ proposals, he said, were part of a 20-point peace plan seeking the end of the Ukraine war that Zelenskyy on Tuesday said was backed by the US.</p><p>Here is what we know about the plan and whether demilitarised zones could work in Ukraine:</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-20-point-peace-plan\">What is the 20-point peace plan?</h2><p>Zelenskyy unveiled the plan in a two-hour briefing with journalists, reading aloud from a highlighted and annotated copy. The plan was formulated by negotiators from Washington and Kyiv in Florida over the weekend.</p><p>Here’s where negotiations stand on key issues:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Ukraine’s NATO membership: </strong>Russia has insisted from the start of the war that it will not accept Ukraine as a part of NATO. The Trump administration, too, has made clear that Ukraine must give up its hopes of joining the military alliance. But Ukraine continues to resist pressure to introduce constitutional amendments explicitly stating that it will stay neutral and not seek NATO membership. “It is the choice of NATO members whether to have Ukraine or not,” Zelenskyy said on Tuesday. “Our choice has been made. We moved away from the proposed changes to the Constitution of Ukraine that would have prohibited Ukraine from joining NATO.”</li>\n<li><strong>Territorial concessions: </strong>Zelenskyy said any proposal requiring Ukraine to withdraw its troops would have to be approved through a national referendum. Ukraine has repeatedly pointed to its constitution, which prevents the government from changing the country’s borders on its own. But many analysts believe that Ukraine might need to settle for a middle path – not recognising Russian-occupied regions officially while acknowledging that it does not actually control them.</li>\n<li><strong>Elections: </strong>Zelenskyy said Ukraine would hold a presidential election only after a peace agreement is signed. US President Donald Trump has been pushing for elections in Ukraine while Russia has used the absence of elections during the war to question Zelenskyy’s legitimacy.</li>\n<li><strong>Demilitarised zones: </strong>Zelenskyy said any areas that Ukraine pulls out from will become DMZs, which he also called free trade zones. “They are looking for a demilitarised zone or a free economic zone, meaning a format that could satisfy both sides,” he said on Tuesday, referring to US negotiators.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-are-the-proposed-dmzs-in-ukraine\">What are the proposed DMZs in Ukraine?</h2><p>Russia has demanded full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which constitute the Donbas, historically Ukraine’s industrial belt.</p><p>Its troops currently control almost all of Luhansk and 70 percent of Donetsk.</p><p>The latest proposal would involve Ukrainian soldiers pulling out of the territory in the Donbas that they control – as long as Russia does not seek to occupy the region. Instead, that region is to become a DMZ.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, Russian troops are in control of a nuclear plant that Ukraine has tried – so far in vain – to get back.</p><p>The latest proposal suggests turning the region around the nuclear plant into a DMZ, too.</p><p>But it is unclear how the proposed DMZs – if both sides were to agree to them – would be governed, who might ensure that both sides play by the rules and how resources there, such as the nuclear plant, could be shared.</p><p>“It’s a point in the plan that is supposed to satisfy both sides,” Marina Miron, an analyst at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“However, I don’t see how this is going to function because in Ukraine Zelenskyy said that Russia would have to withdraw its forces, and we’re talking about the Donbas, and I don’t see that happening, especially if Russia is winning on the battlefield.”</p><p>Miron explained that Ukraine designating demilitarised zones in this peace plan was a tactic by Kyiv to signal that it was ready for peace, thereby pushing “the diplomatic burden on Russia”.</p><h2 id=\"has-russia-responded\">Has Russia responded?</h2><p>Moscow has not accepted or rejected the latest peace plan so far.</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that Russia was “formulating its position” on the plan. He did not comment on the specifics of the plan.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-other-demilitarised-zones-in-the-world\">What are other demilitarised zones in the world?</h2><p>Several DMZs exist. They include:</p><h3>Korean Demilitarized Zone</h3><p>The Korean DMZ is a 4km-wide (2.5-mile-wide) buffer zone separating North Korea and South Korea.</p><p>It was established in 1953 after the signing of an armistice ended the fighting of the <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2020/6/25/assassinations-nuclear-tests-hugs-70-years-of-the-korean-war\">Korean War</a>.</p><p>The war had broken out in June 1950 when North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel and invaded South Korea in an attempt to reunify the peninsula.</p><p>Korea was temporarily divided at the 38th parallel by the US and the Soviet Union after World War II. This division placed Kim Il Sung’s Soviet-backed Workers’ Party of Korea in control of the North and the US-supported Syngman Rhee government in control in the South.</p><p>The conflict lasted three years with Soviet- and Chinese-backed North Korean troops fighting against US-led United Nations forces. It killed an estimated two million people and devastated cities and villages on both sides.</p><p>The war concluded with an armistice signed by the US, China and North Korea, but South Korea refused to agree, and no formal peace treaty was ever concluded. More than 70 years later, the two Koreas remain technically at war.</p><h3>UN Disengagement Observer Force Zone in the Golan Heights</h3><p>The UN established a narrow strip of land as a DMZ in the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/29/what-is-the-golan-heights-and-who-controls-it\">Golan Heights</a> in 1974 after the war that year between Israel and Syria and an armistice signed by the two countries.</p><p>The broader Golan Heights is a rocky patch of land that under international law belongs to Syria. Israel captured it during the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed it in 1982 in a move recognised only by the US.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2005/6/17/un-force-to-stay-in-golan-heights\">Observer Force Zone</a> separates Israeli-occupied territory from the remaining part of the Golan Heights that is still under Syria’s control. The zone is still monitored by UN peacekeepers.</p><h3>Sinai Peninsula demilitarised zones</h3><p>DMZs were established in the Sinai Peninsula as part of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. The treaty divided the Sinai Peninsula into four security zones with different military restrictions.</p><p>These zones are monitored by an international peacekeeping force called the Multinational Force and Observers.</p><h3>Aland Islands</h3><p>The Aland Islands are a small archipelago in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland. They are an autonomous, Swedish-speaking region of Finland.</p><p>They have been demilitarised since 1921 as per a decision by the now nonexistent League of Nations. Finland and Sweden took the issue to the league because in the early 20th century, the islands were part of Finland, which gained independence from the Russian Empire in 1917.</p><p>After this, many Alanders wanted to reunite with Sweden, which spurred tensions.</p><h3>Antarctica</h3><p>Antarctica has been established as a demilitarised zone under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty.</p><p>This forbids military activity and nuclear testing, ensuring the continent is used exclusively for peaceful purposes and scientific research.</p><p>This is because several nations had made overlapping territorial claims in Antarctica, raising fears of future conflicts.</p><h3>Preah Vihear Temple</h3><p>The Thailand-Cambodia border, shaped by French colonial-era delineation, contains ambiguous boundaries and overlapping claims.</p><p>These disputes have grown more contentious as both countries strengthened their institutions and the strategic value of certain areas increased.</p><p>One of the contested zones is the culturally significant Preah Vihear Temple from the Khmer Empire, which is symbolically important to both nations. In 1962, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the temple belonged to Cambodia.</p><p>Disputes erupted from 2008 to 2011, marked by exchanges of artillery fire, mass displacements and duelling legal interpretations of the ICJ ruling.</p><p>In 2011, the ICJ ordered a provisional demilitarised zone around the temple.</p><h2 id=\"have-dmzs-worked-before\">Have DMZs worked before?</h2><p>DMZs have been considerably successful in some cases, such as in the case of the Koreas.</p><p>The zone between North and South Korea has prevented the two from large-scale military conflict.</p><p>On the other hand, violence has broken out between Thailand and Cambodia this year over their border dispute, killing nearly 100 people in July and December and displacing about a million, according to official counts. The two countries reported <a href=\"/news/2025/12/24/new-clashes-as-cambodia-thailand-hold-first-talks-to-end-latest-violence\">new clashes</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>In other cases, such as in the Golan Heights or Sinai Peninsula, demilitarised zones have prevented direct, large-scale clashes.</p><p>However, Israel has repeatedly violated the Golan Heights buffer zone, especially over the past year, using the chaos after the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024 to grab territory and expel Syrian families. The UN has criticised Israel’s DMZ violations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

An interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has been in power since August 2024, following the ouster of then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a student-led uprising. The Yunus administration has announced elections on February 12, after which it is to peacefully transfer power to an elected government.</p><p>Rahman’s mother, the former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has been hospitalised in a critical condition since November 23.

But he also drew allegations of cronyism, corruption and political violence. A military-backed caretaker government that held office between 2006 and early 2009 investigated those allegations.</p><p>In March 2007, he was arrested by army units that dramatically pulled up outside his luxury Dhaka house late at night. Months later, he was released on bail and flew to the United Kingdom for medical treatment  — not returning until Thursday.</p><p>Rahman and the BNP have consistently described the accusations against him as politically motivated, but his reputation for corruption extended beyond his political opponents. Rahman’s name popped up in leaked diplomatic cables, published by WikiLeaks in 2011, where American diplomat James F Moriarty <a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-201716\">described him</a> as a symbol of “kleptocratic government and violent politics”.</p><p>Recommending blocking his entry into the United States, the American embassy in Dhaka wrote: “In short, much of what is wrong in Bangladesh can be blamed on Tarique and his cronies.”</p><p>He was subsequently convicted by the Awami League government on charges of money laundering, fraud and political violence – including a grenade attack on rival Hasina’s rally in 2004 that killed at least 20 people.</p><p>But after the August 2024 uprising against Hasina, the charges and convictions against Rahman have mostly been stayed or overturned, facilitating his return to Dhaka.</p><p>Addressing his supporters at a rally in Dhaka on Thursday, Rahman said, “Just like 1971, people from all walks of life, all together, defended the independence and sovereignty of this country in 2024,” referring to the country’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, and Hasina’s ouster last year.</p><p>He called for an inclusive Bangladesh, saying, “It is time for us all to build the country together. We want to build a safe Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, no matter who a woman, man, or child is, they should be able to leave their homes safely and return safely.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195276\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195276\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4195276\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-25T021834Z_112429989_RC2ENIAEYGJ7_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-BNP-1766656418.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"rahman\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4195276\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A supporter waves a flag on top of a footbridge as people arrive at a rally to welcome Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman after his return from London, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on December 25, 2025 [Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-was-rahman-in-exile\">Why was Rahman in exile?</h2><p>Since 1991, Khaleda and Hasina – two female leaders of opposing political dynasties – have alternated power for more than three decades, barring a few transitional heads.</p><p>Hasina, who led the Awami League, entered politics after the assassination of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh’s founding president, who was killed along with most of his family in a military coup in August 1975; Khaleda rose after the assassination of her husband, Ziaur Rahman, a former army chief who became president and was killed in a failed coup in May 1981.</p><p>The parties have remained political rivals for decades, except for a brief period when they joined forces to regain power from a military leader, General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, in the late 1980s.</p><p>In 2009, after Hasina returned to power in Dhaka after eight years in opposition, Zia’s BNP found itself on the other side of the crackdown during Hasina’s long, uninterrupted years of rule.</p><p>While several BNP leaders and activists faced abuse, jail, and trials, Rahman had flown to the UK in September 2008, after he was released on bail following nearly 18 months in detention during the 2007-08 emergency rule.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195447\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195447\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4195447\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20001123__APH2000112129683__v1__MidRes__BangladeshDefanceDayHasinaKhaleda-1766663138.jpg?w=768&amp;resize=768%2C490&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"hasina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4195447\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, right, speaks with opposition leader Khaleda Zia, during a ceremony to celebrate Bangladesh’s annual Armed Forces Day, on November 21, 2000, in Dhaka [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-is-the-significance-of-rahman-s-return\">What is the significance of Rahman’s return?</h2><p>After years at the helm in Dhaka, Hasina was confronted last year by a popular, student-led uprising. The protests began as a campaign against a controversial affirmative-action policy for government jobs, but amid a brutal crackdown by security forces, escalated into wider demands for an end to her rule. The United Nations says up to 1,400 people were killed.</p><p>Anger grew over her iron-fisted 15-year leadership, during which thousands of political opponents and critics were arrested, killed, tortured or forcibly disappeared. In elections widely viewed as illegitimate, Hasina won landslides in 2014, 2018 and 2024.</p><p>Ultimately, protesters overran her residence after she fled Bangladesh by helicopter on August 5, 2024, to India.</p><p>Last month, Hasina was sentenced to death by hanging after she was found guilty of crimes against humanity for ordering the deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising, by a tribunal. The Awami League, her party, has been barred from participating in the February elections.</p><p>Meanwhile, interim leader Yunus met Rahman during a visit to London in June.</p><p>Rahman has also returned at a time when his mother, Khaleda, is in hospital.

Bangladesh follows a first-past-the-post system in its elections, so in a multiparty contest, candidates do not need a majority to win.</p><p>The National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by a faction of student leaders after the uprising, has been struggling to convert street power into electoral strength due to weak organisation and limited funds. The party trails far behind the BNP, with just 6 percent support, according to the IRI poll.</p><p>With Hasina’s Awami League barred from participation in the election, Rahman’s BNP looks poised in a favourable electoral landscape for the post-Yunus period in Bangladesh.</p><p>Danilowicz, the former US diplomat, noted that the upcoming election is BNP’s to lose; “The party has demonstrated great resilience over the past 17 years; it has been out of government, with party leaders facing the full repressive force of the state,” he said.</p><p>Now, upon his return, Rahman also faces the weight of his own political legacy: “The challenge will be integrating [Rahman’s] small core of trusted lieutenants who stuck with him throughout his exile with the broader party apparatus that was assembled by his mother, and which remained in the country.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
