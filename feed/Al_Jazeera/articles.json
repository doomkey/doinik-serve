Until now, no president had sought to oust a Fed official.</p><p>A Supreme Court ruling is expected by the end of June.</p><h2 id=\"pressure-on-fed-independence\">Pressure on Fed independence</h2><p>Conservative Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that the administration had handled the case “in a very cursory manner”. Though the case involves Trump’s asserted cause to fire Cook, Alito said, “No court has ever explored those facts. Are the mortgage applications even in the record in this case?”</p><p>“There’s a million hard questions in this case,” Alito said.</p><p>In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions meant to insulate the central bank from political interference, requiring governors to be removed by a president only “for cause,” though the law does not define the term nor establish procedures for removal.</p><p>Clement told the justices that Trump’s position would transform tenure protections for Fed governors into “at-will employment”.</p><p>“That makes no sense,” Clement said. “There’s no rational reason to go through all the trouble of creating this unique, quasi-private entity that is exempt from everything from the [congressional] appropriations process to the civil service laws, just to give it a removal restriction that is as toothless as the president imagines.”</p><p>Roberts expressed doubts about Sauer’s arguments that the president’s assertion of a cause is not reviewable, or that judges cannot reinstate a fired officer.</p><p>Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed doubts about the real-world effects of the administration’s arguments.</p><p>“Your position,” Kavanaugh told Sauer, “that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines – I mean, that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve.”</p><p>Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett also questioned why the Trump administration has denied Cook a hearing to defend herself, saying that it “would not have been that big of a deal” for Trump to sit down with Cook and lay out the alleged evidence against her.</p><p>Barrett also asked Sauer about the practical implications of allowing Trump’s firing of a Fed governor.</p><p>“We have amicus [friend-of-the-court] briefs from economists who tell us that if Governor Cook is [fired], that would trigger a recession. How should we think about the public interest in a case like this?” Barrett asked, adding: “If there is a risk [at this preliminary stage of the case], doesn’t that counsel caution on our part?”</p><p>Sauer said that Cook was notified in August of her termination, and that has not affected the markets. Sauer urged the justices to weigh the predictions of doom for the US economy by economists in briefs submitted in the case supportive of Cook with a “jaundiced eye”.</p><p>US District Judge Jia Cobb in September ruled that Trump’s attempt to remove Cook without notice or a hearing likely violated her right to due process under the US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment. Cobb also found that the mortgage fraud allegations likely were not a legally sufficient cause to remove a Fed governor under the law, noting that the alleged conduct occurred before she served in the Fed post.</p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined Trump’s request to put Cobb’s order on hold.</p><h2 id=\"you-re-fired\">‘You’re fired’</h2><p>Conservative and liberal justices alike posed sharp questions to Sauer on his contention that Cook was not entitled to formal notice and a hearing before removal by the president.</p><p>Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Sauer what such a hearing would look like and whether Cook would have a right to legal counsel.</p><p>Sauer responded that the court in the past has been very reluctant to “dictate procedures to the president” and that it would be up to Trump to decide.</p><p>“Calling Ms. Cook into the [White House] Roosevelt Room, sitting across a conference table, listening for, I don’t know how long, how much evidence is a lawyer required, and then making a decision? Could that suffice?” Gorsuch asked, adding: “Just a meeting across a conference table finished with, ‘You’re fired’?”</p><p>Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas asked Sauer on what basis the justices should conclude that the Fed is “an executive branch agency and hence that the president does have a removal authority”.</p><p>“There’s an academic dispute about whether or not the Federal Reserve’s Open Market operations constitute executive power or something else, essentially private conduct. However, Congress has over the years kind of packed on traditional executive powers on the Federal Reserve,” Sauer replied.</p><p>As a Fed governor, Cook helps set US monetary policy with the rest of the central bank’s seven-member board and the heads of the 12 regional Fed banks. Her term in the job runs to 2038. Cook was appointed in 2022 by Democratic former US President Joe Biden and is the first Black woman to serve in the post.</p><p>Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed Sauer to reconcile two seemingly conflicting positions: his claim that the president has broad discretion to remove a Fed governor, and his recognition that Congress included tenure protections for Fed governors to shield the Fed’s independence from White House interference.</p><p>“How does that further the aims of the statute?” Jackson asked.</p><p>Alito voiced scepticism toward Clement’s argument that a Fed governor’s conduct before taking office cannot provide a basis for removal by the president, asking Cook’s attorney to address a series of increasingly egregious hypothetical scenarios.</p><p>“How about if, after the person assumes office, videos are disclosed in which the office holder is expressing deep admiration for Hitler or for the Klan?” Alito asked.</p><p>The president sought to fire Cook on August 25 by posting a termination letter on social media citing the mortgage fraud allegations disclosed by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee.</p><p>The administration ‍this month opened a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/12/trump-administration-opens-criminal-probe-into-fed-chair-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">criminal investigation into Powell</a> over remarks he made to Congress last year about a Fed building project, a move he similarly called a pretext aimed at gaining influence over monetary policy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/21/trump-live-news-us-president-in-davos-as-greenland-threats-spark-outrage\">Trump’s speech in Davos</a> the following day, the US president made clear that times had changed. He nodded to Venezuela, where his forces conducted a raid to <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abduct</a> the country’s President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. He criticised Europe, calling the countries there weak.</p><p>And he constantly referenced his desire to take Greenland, no matter what Greenlanders, or Denmark – the country they are part of – think.</p><p>“We want a piece of ice for world protection. And they won’t give it,” Trump said. “So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.”</p><p>Trump has made clear that the old way of doing things does not interest him. The post-World War II rules-based order concepts of sovereignty, and the resolution of disputes through negotiations, no longer mattered.</p><h2 id=\"not-an-ally-but-a-predator\">Not an ally but a predator</h2><p>The actions of Trump and his administration have forced lawmakers across Europe and the West to confront their reliance upon the US and weigh the difficulties of confronting the world’s most significant superpower, which NATO’s former deputy allied commander for Europe, Richard Shirreff, described on Tuesday as having turned from “ally” to “predator”.</p><p>Limited attempts on the part of Europe to counter US ambitions in Greenland have seen the deployment of a token number of troops to the island, only to be met by American fury and the immediate threat of tariffs.</p><p>“The rules-based order is over, and its ending reflects the decades-old fallacy that European and US values and security interests were the same,” said Geoffrey Nice, a human rights lawyer and former lead prosecutor in the war crimes trial of Serbia’s former president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p><p>Over the years, the US has exempted itself from numerous international treaties, such as the <a href=\"/news/2025/4/8/which-countries-are-international-criminal-court-members\">International Criminal Court</a>, whose warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin was actively <a href=\"/news/2023/7/26/biden-administration-moves-to-assist-icc-in-russia-investigation\">pursued</a> by former US President Joe Biden, despite Washington’s refusal to accept the jurisdiction of the court itself.</p><p>Similarly, when the International Court of Justice ruled against the US in a 1986 case on Washington’s support for rebels in Nicaragua, the US simply dismissed the ruling. Other international obligations, such as those on <a href=\"/news/2020/11/4/us-formally-quits-paris-climate-deal-amid-election-uncertainty\">climate</a>, or <a href=\"/news/2018/5/8/donald-trump-declares-us-withdrawal-from-iran-nuclear-deal\">commitments</a> to Iran to ease sanctions in return for greater transparency of its nuclear programme, have been similarly shrugged off.</p><p>“The reality has been that, time and again, the US has placed its own interests and its own sovereignty first. The United States’ interest in international law, going back to the Nuremberg, has always been ad hoc rather than treaty based,” Nice told Al Jazeera, referring to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. “What’s compounded this is that, for over 80 years, Europe and others have deluded themselves that this isn’t the case.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4254856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4254856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4254856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-03-15T171551Z_996838961_RC2QDDAQMMC6_RTRMADP_3_GREENLAND-PROTEST-1768930265.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters take part in a a demonstration march ending in front of the U.S. consulate, under the slogan, Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people, in Nuuk, Greenland, March 15, 2025.

Western leaders have largely ignored the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, raising questions about whether international law matters for some, but not for others.</p><p>“The idea of holding to a singular — and often deeply hypocritical — rules-based order is finished, to the extent it ever truly existed,” said HA Hellyer of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3780565\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3780565\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3780565\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25167484059469-1750138929.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The deadliest day of shootings near Gaza's food distribution centres\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3780565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Critics say the hypocrisy of the global rules-based order has been exposed during Israel’s war on Gaza [Abdel Kareem Hana/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>“The recognition of that reality by the Canadians and Europeans is landing very differently across the world. For some, similar to Europe and Canada, it feels like a shocking collapse,” Hellyer said. “For others, it’s simply the moment when a system that never protected Black and brown populations, or the ‘Global South’, is finally being named for what it was.”</p><p>“It’s telling that the supposed breaking point for the rules-based order is really the threat to Greenland, not the devastation of Gaza, or other examples before now,” Hellyer added. “The cases are not identical, and I’m not equating them — but it’s difficult to argue that talk of annexation is more offensive to international norms than the destruction of an entire people and territory. But in the case of Israel, the main underwriter of the rules-based order – i.e., the US – did not only work to ensure no accountability for the violation of international law, but actively emboldened and empowered those violations.”</p><p>There is nothing new about Western commentators claiming that events on their own doorstep define the state of the world, regardless of conditions elsewhere, said Karim Emile Bitar, a professor of international relations at the Saint Joseph University of Beirut.</p><p>“This is why we see such a stark contrast between Western attitudes toward Gaza as opposed to Western attitudes when a blue-eyed, blonde Ukrainian lady arrives as a refugee,” he said.</p><p>“When a territory that is part of the ‘European Union’ is under threat, they completely shift course and no longer try to use the usual mendacious justifications that were used for decades and decades.”</p><p>For smaller countries that have been forced to rely upon alliances rather than rules for decades, or much of the Global South, the collapse of the rules-based order will mean little. For those in the Global North and their representatives at Davos, it represents a seismic shift.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This observational documentary follows them through birthday celebrations, 4am medication, difficult medical consultations and quiet, emotional moments together. Their bond gradually goes beyond conventional parent–child roles, as Hassen works tirelessly to preserve joy, dignity and a sense of normal life for Saliha. As the cancer spreads and her chances fade, they face impossible choices: treatment versus comfort, hope versus honesty, a son’s devotion versus his mother’s exhaustion. After Saliha’s death, we see Hassen back in the studio, hosting live television while still guided by her memory, redefining his mother as “a notion of love” that continues to shape him. Raw but unsentimental, the film captures caregiving as both an act of endurance and a profound declaration of love itself.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 21 Jan 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">21 Jan 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

The operation involved heavy shelling and ground assaults.</p><p>According to a 2022 report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights, the campaign resulted in approximately 40,000 deaths, and 17,000 people went missing.

He played a key security role in the 1970 coup, which brought overthrew the former head of state, Salah Jadid, and brought Hafez al-Assad to power.</p><p>In the late 1970s, as the regime faced internal opposition, Rifaat advocated for extreme measures. In a 1979 speech at a Baath party congress, he reportedly suggested “Stalinist” methods to purge opposition and proposed closing mosques to curb “sectarian ideology”.</p><p>His influence peaked in the early 1980s, but tensions with his brother were mounting. In November 1983, while Hafez was ill, Rifaat attempted to seize control, deploying his own forces in Damascus. The confrontation ended in a standoff.</p><p>By 1984, Hafez had regained control. Rifaat was stripped of his command, appointed to the ceremonial post of vice president and sent into exile. Reports at the time suggested he received $200m from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as part of a settlement to leave the country.</p><p><strong>Exile and legal troubles</strong></p><p>Rifaat spent the next 36 years primarily in Europe, where he faced multiple legal challenges over the source of his wealth.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>France:</strong> In 2020, a French court <a href=\"/news/2021/9/9/french-jail-term-confirmed-for-uncle-of-syrias-assad\">sentenced him to four years</a> in prison for money laundering and misappropriation of Syrian public funds, confiscating real estate assets worth an estimated $100m.</li>\n<li><strong>Switzerland:</strong> In August 2023, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Rifaat for his <a href=\"/news/2024/3/12/switzerland-to-try-syrias-rifaat-al-assad-for-war-crimes\">alleged role in war crimes</a> committed in Hama in 1982.</li>\n<li><strong>Assets Frozen:</strong> Authorities in the UK and Spain also froze family assets and investigated him for illicit financial activities.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Return and death</strong></p><p>To avoid imprisonment in France, Rifaat returned to Syria in October 2021. Despite his previous calls in 2011 for Bashar al-Assad to step down, he appeared voting for his nephew in the May 2021 election at the Syrian embassy in Paris.</p><p>Following the fall of the Assad government in December 2024, Lebanese security officials reported that Rifaat had left Syria for Dubai, where he passed away in January 2026.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But others have so far been reluctant to join. Observers argued this reluctance of many invited states to make immediate commitments reflects growing concern that the Trump administration is seeking to use the BoP’s expansive charter to bypass, or even replace, the UN.</p><p>Here is what we know so far about the board, its structure and mandate, the countries that have agreed to join, those still undecided and why hesitation remains widespread.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-board-of-peace\">What is the ‘board of peace’?</h2><p>First proposed in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, the board was initially framed as a mechanism to support the administration, reconstruction and economic recovery of the Gaza Strip.</p><p>The White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2026/01/statement-on-president-trumps-comprehensive-plan-to-end-the-gaza-conflict/\">formally announced</a> the creation of the BoP last week. However, the organisation’s 11-page charter, comprising eight chapters and 13 articles, does not mention <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/scepticism-hope-gaza-reacts-trump-board-of-peace\">Gaza</a> once.</p><p>Instead, it proposes a broad mandate for a new international organisation that “seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”.</p><p>The governance structure has three layers: the BoP, an executive board and a chairman with sweeping authority.</p><p>According to the White House, a “founding executive council” sits at the top. The board of peace votes on budgets, policy and senior appointments while the executive board, which consists of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">seven members</a>, is responsible for implementing the mission.</p><p>Members of the executive board include former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p>The chairman is Trump himself. He serves as the final authority on the interpretation of the charter and holds veto power over key decisions, including membership removal and executive board actions.</p><p>Board members “will oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza’s stabilization and long-term success”, the White House said, including “governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilisation”.</p><p>Below the founding council is the “Gaza executive board”, tasked with regional coordination and supported by representatives from Arab countries. Its mandate is to help “support effective governance” in Gaza.</p><p>At the bottom of the hierarchy is the “national committee for the administration of Gaza” (NCAG), which is to be led by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority deputy minister.</p><p>Alongside these civilian structures is a military pillar, led by US General Jasper Jeffers as commander of the “international stabilisation force” with a mandate that includes “permanent disarmament”.</p><p>Membership in the BoP is limited to states invited by the chairman. Member states are represented by heads of state or senior government officials and must contribute to operations in line with their domestic laws.</p><p>While general membership terms last three years, this limit does not apply to states contributing more than $1bn in the first year, which would grant them a permanent seat.</p><p>Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Trump praised the initiative. “I wish the United Nations could do more. I wish we didn’t need a board of peace, but the United Nations – and, you know, with all the wars I settled, United Nations never helped me on one war,” he told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-been-invited-and-which-have-agreed-to-join\">Which countries have been invited and which have agreed to join?</h2><p>Soon after the announcement, invitations were sent to dozens of countries across the world.</p><p>Leaders of at least 50 nations have confirmed receiving invitations, including close US allies such as the UK, France, Canada, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Australia.</p><p>US adversaries <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/trump-asks-putin-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-even-as-ukraine-war-rages\">China and Russia</a> were also invited.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">Israel confirmed</a> it will join the BoP after approval from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu’s office announced on Wednesday that he would participate in the initiative despite the International Criminal Court (ICC) having issued a warrant for his arrest over alleged war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>His decision comes even after earlier criticism from his office over the composition of the executive committee, which includes Turkiye, a regional rival.</p><p>Netanyahu’s participation, despite the ICC warrant issued in 2023 accusing him of overseeing crimes against humanity in Gaza, is likely to intensify concerns about the board’s objectivity, particularly given Trump’s central role in controlling its membership and direction.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Pakistan also confirmed on Wednesday that it would participate, according to a <a href=\"https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/pakistan-accepts-invitation-for-joining-the-board-of-peace-bop-with-the-view-to-achieving-lasting-peace-in-gaza\">statement</a> from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>“Pakistan expresses the hope that with the creation of this framework, concrete steps will be taken towards the implementation of a permanent ceasefire, further scaling up of humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, as well as reconstruction of Gaza,” the statement said.</p><p>Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said on Wednesday that the country’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, would join the board.</p><p>Other countries that have agreed to join include the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Argentina, Hungary and Belarus.</p><p>Andreas Krieg, associate professor of security studies at King’s College London, said countries joining the BoP were motivated by “access and leverage”.</p><p>“They will want a direct line into the White House; a seat in the room where contracts, corridors, crossings and timelines are decided; and a chance to shape what ‘post-Hamas’ means before facts harden on the ground,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that participation also amounts to “buying insurance” against future exclusion.</p><p>Filippo Boni, a senior lecturer in politics and international studies at the Open University in the UK, said invited states face a stark choice.</p><p>“Either join the board and undermine the UN or refuse to join,” he said, “and potentially face tariffs from the US.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-rejected-the-bop\">Which countries have rejected the BoP?</h2><p>At least four countries – France, Denmark, Norway and Sweden – have confirmed they will not join. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed the decision to reporters in Davos on Wednesday.</p><p>Denmark is already under pressure from Washington over Greenland. Trump has repeatedly suggested the US should acquire the semiautonomous Danish territory, even threatening force if Copenhagen refuses – although in his speech to the WEF on Wednesday, Trump said he would not use force.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-countries-hesitant-to-be-part-of-the-bop\">Why are countries hesitant to be part of the BoP?</h2><p>Several other countries across the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, including India, Indonesia, Egypt, Japan and Thailand, have also been invited but have yet to make a decision.</p><p>Most of Europe – including US allies like the UK, Germany and Italy – have not said whether they will join the board.</p><p>China and Russia haven’t confirmed participation in the board either.</p><p>For many nations, including China, that reluctance isn’t surprising, Boni suggested. Several of these countries advocate for UN principles and laws as the guiding pillars of international relations. Beijing, meanwhile, “has proposed its own global governance framework through the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), so it will likely move cautiously on Trump’s proposed plan”, he said. Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2025, the GGI is a governance framework aimed at promoting multilateralism although Beijing has not outlined many specifics.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4257327\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257327\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4257327\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/epa_6970dc375558-1769004087.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"epa12665085 Displaced Palestinian children play at Bilal Mosque in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza Strip, 20 January 2026, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

But he warned that the initiative’s success depends more on politics than on its structure.</p><p>“As long as President Trump’s political authority remains intact, the structure is likely to function,” he said, noting that the top tiers are filled with figures closely aligned with Trump.</p><p>Trump began his second term as president a year ago and is set to remain in office until January 2029, a year longer than the BoP’s UN mandate.</p><p>Boni said any countries willing to pay $1bn for a permanent seat would make that decision based more on “a political choice than an economic one”.</p><p>“The choice is to either challenge multilateralism and the rule-based international order with the UN at its centre or to continue abiding by it, thereby refusing to endorse US leadership under this new framework,” he said.</p><p>Krieg suggested that some wealthy states may see value in paying for influence although even they may proceed cautiously.</p><p>“Beyond the Gulf, a country like Japan could afford it, but I would expect Tokyo to be cautious about a paywall model that weakens UN norms. India can afford it too, but Delhi rarely pays to join someone else’s club unless the return is concrete and immediate,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"is-the-bop-a-replacement-for-the-un\">Is the BoP a replacement for the UN?</h2><p>Perhaps the most serious concern surrounding the BoP is its potential role as a rival to the UN, which has served as the cornerstone of global diplomacy for eight decades despite multiple failings – and repeated violations of its rules by powerful states like the US and its allies like Israel.</p><p>But Khan rejected the idea that the UN’s failure to act decisively in Gaza reflected an institutional collapse</p><p>“The UN was prevented from acting. It did not choose inaction,” he said, alluding to repeated US vetoes against Israel that paralysed the Security Council.</p><p>Trump was a vocal critic of the UN during his first term from 2017 to 2021 and has cut funding to several UN-affiliated bodies during his second stint in the Oval Office.</p><p>But Boni pointed out that while the UN Charter enshrined principles such as the equal rights of large and small states after World War II, the board of peace charter is essentially a list of rules to join the club “where no such principles seem to be present”.</p><p>Krieg said fears that the BoP could hollow out the UN are well founded.</p><p>“You do not need to abolish the UN to hollow it out. You can drain attention, drain money and create a habit where the big calls move to ad hoc bodies chaired by major powers,” he said.</p><p>Trump’s BoP poses that risk, he added.</p><p>“The UN still carries something the board cannot easily replicate – near-universal membership, legal standing and the machinery of agencies that can operate at scale. The risk is that the board turns the UN into a service provider that takes instructions rather than sets terms,” Krieg said.</p><p>“If other capitals want the UN to survive as the main stage, they will resist joining the board, fund UN channels and treat the board as a temporary tool tied to Gaza rather than a model for global conflict management.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

I was interrogated first by members of the Hadrami Elite Forces, then they handed me to the Emiratis officers,” Ali told Al Jazeera over the phone, saying he was detained twice – first in 2016 and then again in 2017.</p><p>The prison, Ali says, was not even suitable for animals. “Closed, dark rooms, hands tied and blindfolded. Twenty days went by without a chance to clean your body. They used physical and body <a href=\"/news/2018/6/20/yemeni-prisoners-say-uae-officers-sexually-torture-them-ap\">torture</a>, solitary confinement several times, beating many times,” Ali recalls.</p><p>The 30-year-old says he was first detained following a bomb blast in Hadramout. “I was falsely accused of being a member of the Islah Party,” he said, denying he was a member of the party, which is the main opposition party in Yemen. The country’s Muslim Brotherhood also falls under its umbrella.</p><p>“I do not have any affiliation with any political party. Even the interrogator later told me, ‘I have nothing against you, but the Emiratis wanted you,'” Ali said.</p><p>In 2019, he was transferred to the central prison in Hadramout and appeared before a judge, following which, he was released without charge.</p><h2 id=\"uae-secret-prisons\">UAE secret prisons</h2><p>Ali’s case and many other prisoners have come under the spotlight again after Hadramout Governor Salem al-Khanbashi on Monday announced the discovery of “secret prisons at sites where UAE forces were stationed”.</p><p>The governor “expressed his regret at what was found inside the UAE bases and camps – especially in the vicinity of Rayyan International Airport – of equipment and contents unrelated to regular armies, including explosives, detonators and dangerous components usually used by terrorist groups, in addition to the discovery of secret prisons at those forces’ deployment sites,” according to the state-run Yemeni News Agency (SABA).</p><p>The UAE forces <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/uae-to-pull-forces-out-of-yemen-as-tensions-rise-with-saudi-arabia\">withdrew</a> from Yemen on January 3 after Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) chairman Rashad al-Alimi annulled a joint defence agreement with Abu Dhabi and asked UAE forces to leave within 24 hours.</p><p>This came after the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces took control of Hadramout and al-Mahrah provinces in early December. The STC control of Hadramout, which borders Saudi Arabia, was seen as a national security threat by Riyadh.</p><p>Saudi Arabia-led coalition forces bombed Mukalla, the capital of Hadramout, targeting what Riyadh said was a UAE-linked weapons shipment destined for the STC. Soon, government forces, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, regained the two provinces in early January, triggering the collapse of the STC. The UAE denied supplying weapons to the southern separatists.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Deputy Governor of Hadramout al-Jilani told Al Jazeera that “four illegal detention sites” affiliated with UAE forces in the governorate had been “identified”.</p><p>“Such practices are a blatant violation of the Yemeni constitution, applicable laws, and all international and humanitarian charters and agreements that criminalise detention outside the judicial framework,” he said, adding that local authorities in the governorate will carry out comprehensive and transparent investigations and hear the testimonies of victims and witnesses to gather evidence to hold those responsible accountable.</p><p>In the meantime, the UAE’s Ministry of Defence issued a statement categorically denying the accusations, describing them as “false and misleading allegations and claims that are not based on any evidence or fact”.</p><p>“These allegations are attempts to mislead the public opinion and to defame the armed forces of the United Arab Emirates, the statement read.</p><h2 id=\"shocking-scenes\">Shocking scenes</h2><p>The government’s National Commission to Investigate Alleged Violations of Human Rights (NCIAVHR) has been tasked with investigating the cases of torture in prisons. Officials from the body have visited prisons and are speaking with victims.</p><p>”The secret detention centres were in state institutions and service facilities, such as al-Rayyan Airport [in Mukalla], the Republican Palace, al-Dhabba Port, and the central prison known as ‘Al-Manoura Prison’,” committee member Ishraq Al-Maqtari told Al Jazeera, adding that Emirati forces had converted them into private, secret detention centres after adding some inhumane modifications.</p><p>“Most of the modifications included building very small, extremely narrow rooms unfit for human detention, some far from public life in the desert, and some of them were constructed underground,” she said.</p><p>Al-Maqtari further described that detention centres were built with “punitive specifications, such that a detainee could not stand in them even for short periods, let alone attempt to sit or sleep”.</p><p>“Some rooms were also used as presses for torture, where a person is held for very long periods, even though they are unfit to remain in for a few hours,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"justice-and-accountability\">Justice and accountability</h2><p>Since the UAE forces withdrew, protests have been regularly held demanding disclosure of the fate of hundreds of abducted and forcibly disappeared people in UAE prisons, particularly in the interim capital, Aden.</p><p>The NCIAVHR has said it will head to other governorates where secret detention facilities have been reported, including in the Socotra Archipelago governorate, Aden, Lahj, Taiz and Al Hodeidah.</p><p>NCIAVHR member al-Maqtari, who has been meeting victims and their families, says “they demanded the need to hold accountable the bodies and individuals who detained and tortured them, along with restoring their dignity and compensating them for the horrific, inhumane torture and humiliations they were subjected to.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

We have very little inflation.”</p><p>For Trump’s one-year anniversary, we looked at a wide range of price data for the past year and found that overall prices are still increasing, although some specific items, such as eggs and gasoline, have seen price declines.</p><h2 id=\"immigration\">Immigration</h2><p>On <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/trump-suspends-immigrant-visas-for-75-countries-whos-affected\">immigration</a>, Trump said his administration was prioritising deporting criminals. “We’re focused on the murderers, the drug dealers,” he said.</p><p>In his first year, Trump has <a href=\"/news/2025/11/15/us-immigration-crackdown-arrests-under-way-in-charlotte-north-carolina\">deported</a> somewhere between 300,000 to 600,000 people.

He said the US has “secured a record-breaking $18 trillion in commitments for new investments”.</p><p>The White House website since mid-November has shown a figure of $9.6 trillion. In addition, experts have cautioned PolitiFact that some of the $9.6 trillion in pledges may not come to fruition and others are unrealistically large compared to the gross domestic product of the countries involved.</p><h2 id=\"gasoline-prices\">Gasoline prices</h2><p>Trump also said <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/24/trump-says-petrol-and-grocery-prices-are-down-facts-say-otherwise\">gasoline</a> is “at $1.99 in many states”. In the second week of January 2026, the average price per gallon nationally was $2.78, compared with $3.11 in January 2025.</p><p>No state has seen its average price fall below $2. The lowest average price in any state in mid-January was $2.34 per gallon, in Oklahoma.</p><p>Four states – Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming – had at least seven stations selling gasoline for less than $2 on January 20, according to the gas price app Gas Buddy, and a handful of other states had between one and four stations selling gasoline for under $2.</p><h2 id=\"jobs\">Jobs</h2><p>Trump said that under his predecessor, Joe Biden, “one out of four jobs added was a government job.”</p><p>This is exaggerated. Over four years, the economy added more than 16 million <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/20/us-economy-adds-119000-jobs-in-september-as-unemployment-rate-rises\">jobs</a>, of which about 1.8 million were federal, state or local government positions; that’s about 11 percent of the total.</p><p>During Biden’s final year in office, the economy added more than 2 million <a href=\"/economy/2024/6/28/gdp-inflation-jobs-biden-and-trumps-economic-records-compared\">jobs</a> overall, compared with 473,000 in 2025 under Trump.</p><h2 id=\"fentanyl-overdoses\">Fentanyl overdoses</h2><p>Trump said 300,000 people died last year because of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/15/trump-signs-executive-order-labeling-fentanyl-weapon-of-mass-destruction\">fentanyl</a> overdoses, but that’s far above the most recent federal data.</p><p>In the 12 months before August 2025, about 69,000 people in the US died from all types of drug overdoses, not just fentanyl, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.</p><h2 id=\"ending-wars\">Ending wars</h2><p>Trump repeated his <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/new-cambodia-thailand-clash-whats-up-with-the-other-wars-trump\">assertion</a> that he’d “ended eight unendable wars in 10 months”, an exaggerated claim similar to one we rated <a href=\"/news/2025/10/20/trump-claims-no-other-us-president-ever-ended-a-war-is-it-true\">Mostly False</a>.

While this route avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states, it is rarely used due to the presence of permanent sea ice.

The base’s main tasks are surveillance and search and rescue operations, and the “assertion of sovereignty and military defence of Greenland and the Faroe Islands”, according to Danish Defence.</p><p>According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the Northern Sea route is central to Russia’s security posture in the Arctic. Control of the route sits with Rosatom, giving Moscow the ability to restrict foreign military traffic without direct government approval. In the eastern Arctic, access through the Bering Strait has pushed Russia to expand radar coverage, search and rescue capacity and airfields, including the Sopka-2 radar installations on Wrangel Island and Cape Schmidt.</p><p>In the central Arctic, Russia has hardened its military footprint. Bastion-P and Pantsir-S1 systems – mobile defence systems – are deployed on Novaya Zemlya and Kotelny Island, extending area-denial across air and sea approaches.</p><p>In the western Arctic, the Northern Fleet, which oversees Russia’s second-strike capability, is based in Severomorsk.

These resources have attracted significant attention, including from President Trump.</p><p>Gold pockets exist in areas like Nanortalik and South Greenland. Greenland also has deposits of diamonds in the Maniitsoq region, just north of Nuuk.</p><p>Copper deposits are largely unexplored in Greenland, according to the Mineral Resources Authority, with areas in the northeast and central east largely untapped. Iron ore deposits are dotted around West Greenland, while nickel traces have been found around the island’s southwest coast.</p><p>Graphite, used mostly in EV batteries and steel-making, is also reported to exist in Greenland, with exploration around Amitsoq. While zinc has been found in the north of Greenland, titanium and vanadium deposits are located in the southwest, east and south of the territory.

It is one of Denmark’s two autonomous territories, with the Faroe Islands being the other.</p><p>In 1941, during World War II, the US and Denmark agreed to allow American forces to defend Greenland. Its strategic location was vital for countering German submarines and securing shipping routes. The US maintained a military presence throughout the Cold War, using Greenland for early-warning radar and monitoring Soviet activity.</p><p>In 2009, Greenland gained self-rule over most of its internal affairs, including control over natural resources and governance.

Trump added that he would meet “the various parties” in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/air-force-one-turned-back-as-it-carried-trump-to-davos\">Davos</a>, Switzerland, during this week’s annual summit of the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/world-economic-forum-at-davos-2026-dates-location-and-what-to-expect\">World Economic Forum (WEF)</a>.</p><p>Last weekend, Trump threatened to increase trade tariffs for European countries which oppose his attempt to acquire Greenland. Since the tariff threats, the European Union has been contemplating its response, with some members calling for the implementation of the bloc’s never-before-used <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/trumps-greenland-tariffs-whats-europes-bazooka-option-to-hit-back\">“trade bazooka” option</a> of retaliatory tariffs and restrictions.</p><p>Given Europe’s decades-long dependence on Washington, which has only deepened in recent years, could the EU take action against the US, and could that risk a serious transatlantic rift?</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-about-greenland-this-week\">What has Trump said about Greenland this week?</h2><p>Trump made a series of posts on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, reiterating his ambition to acquire Greenland and stating that he would meet European leaders in Davos to discuss the issue.</p><p>In one post, Trump wrote that he had a “very good telephone call” with Rutte about Greenland. “I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back – On that, everyone agrees!” he added.</p><p>In a separate post, Trump shared a screenshot showing messages, presumably from Rutte, in which he wrote, “I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.”</p><p>In another post, he shared screenshots of messages from French President Emmanuel Macron, who wrote, “I do not understand what you are doing in Greenland.” In the messages, Macron also offered to set up a Group of Seven meeting in Paris on Thursday.</p><p>Trump also posted mockup images created using artificial intelligence (AI) tools on Tuesday, showing himself holding the US flag in Greenland with a sign stating “US territory”. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are depicted in the image, standing behind him.</p><p>Another image Trump shared shows him in an Oval Office meeting with European leaders. It includes a map on an easel showing the US flag spanning Canada, Greenland and Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-trump-want-greenland\">Why does Trump want Greenland?</h2><p>The sparsely populated Arctic island of 56,000 people – mostly Indigenous Inuit – is geographically in North America but politically part of Denmark, making it part of Europe. Greenland withdrew from the European Community (EC/EU) in 1985 after it gained home rule, but maintains a special association with the EU as an Overseas Country and Territory (OCT), which grants limited internal market access and EU citizenship to Greenland’s residents through Denmark.</p><p>Trump has long coveted Greenland because of its strategic location and plentiful mineral deposits, including highly sought-after rare-earth metals required for the manufacture of a wide range of technology from smartphones to fighter planes. The island has therefore drawn increasing interest from leading powers as climate change opens up new shipping lanes in the Arctic.</p><p>Currently, Greenland’s economy relies mainly on fishing; locals oppose large-scale mining, and there is no oil or gas extraction.</p><p>The island’s geographical position between the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans provides the shortest air and sea routes between North America and Europe, making it crucial for US military operations and early-warning systems, especially around the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap, according to the Trump administration.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-trade-tariffs-is-trump-threatening\">What trade tariffs is Trump threatening?</h2><p>On January 17, Trump said, starting February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would be charged a 10 percent tariff on their exports to the US.</p><p>On June 1, the tariff would be increased to 25 percent, he said. “This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p><p>A day after Trump posted this threat to social media, the 27 EU members convened for an emergency meeting.</p><p>In a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/dangerous-downward-spiral-european-leaders-slam-trumps-tariff-threat\">joint statement</a>, the eight countries targeted by Trump with new tariffs said they “stand in full solidarity” with Denmark and the people of Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.</p><p>“Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,” the statement said.</p><p>“Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-action-could-europe-take-against-trump-over-greenland\">What action could Europe take against Trump over Greenland?</h2><p>European leaders are contemplating several responses to Trump’s threat, ranging from diplomacy to retaliatory tariffs to the extreme, last-ditch “trade bazooka” – the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) – which could target specific goods and services the US has a trade surplus in with the EU.</p><p>However, the never-before-used ACI, which was adopted by the EU in 2023 following restrictions placed on Lithuanian exports by China, would likely take months to implement. It requires the agreement of a minimum of 15 EU countries, representing at least 65 percent of the bloc’s population. It also requires a months-long investigation process.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-does-europe-depend-on-the-us\">How much does Europe depend on the US?</h2><p>Europe has a growing dependence on Washington in various sectors.</p><h3>Defence</h3><p>In recent years, Europe has become increasingly dependent on the US for military and intelligence support, especially since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>Even before that, the US was providing Ukraine with significant <a href=\"/news/2025/3/6/how-will-us-pause-on-intelligence-sharing-affect-ukraine\">intelligence</a> support, which has not been detailed publicly. However, reports and officials highlight two crucial roles it has played – first, satellite and signals intelligence help Ukraine anticipate and prepare for Russian attacks, and second, it helps locate enemy troops and bases so Ukrainians can target them with missiles, including long-range systems which can reach inside Russian territory.</p><p>European NATO states received 64 percent of their arms imports from the US between 2020 and 2024, up from 52 percent during 2015-19, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) published in March 2025.</p><p>The US contributed about 16 percent of NATO’s common budgets, the joint largest contribution, matched only by Germany’s, according to a NATO breakdown published last year.</p><p>“Militarily, nearly half of Europe’s recent procurement comes from the US, especially in critical backbone capabilities such as combat aircraft, missiles, air defence, software-driven systems and sustainment,” Christine Nissen, chief analyst at the Copenhagen-based Think Tank Europa, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“These dependencies are deeply locked in through platforms, upgrades, spare parts, data and interoperability.”</p><h3 id=\"economic-access-to-us-markets-europe-holds-about-10tr-of-us-treasury-bonds-jnflation-and-problems-for-both-how-much-does-europe-depend-on-the-us-market-energy-after-2022-when-russia-invaded-ukraine-europe-reduced-energy-dependance-from-russia-but-increased-dependance-on-us-gives-the-us-leverage-by-2030-if-current-trends-follow-80-defence-increasingly-dependant-on-us-esp-with-war-in-ukraine-military-and-intelligence-support\">Economy</h3><p>Europe is also highly dependent on the US for the provision of technology services and economic infrastructure, such as cloud services, semiconductors, digital platforms, satellite services, cybersecurity, energy technologies and parts of the financial system, Nissen said.</p><p>“In many of these domains, Europe relies on US firms, standards and regulatory reach, which amplifies Washington’s leverage in a confrontation.”</p><p>Investors in European countries hold more than $10 trillion of US Treasury bonds.</p><p>Bonds are investments through which investors lend money to a government or a company for a set time in exchange for regular interest payments and the original capital back at maturity to whoever is holding the bond at the time. Bonds can be bought and sold on financial markets, so the issuer of the bond may ultimately pay back a different investor from the one who first bought it.</p><p>Bonds usually offer lower returns than stock market shares but are seen as low-risk, especially government bonds.</p><p>US Treasury bonds are particularly popular as they are viewed as “safe-haven” assets. If US-Europe relations turn hostile, however, that safe haven would become highly politicised as there could be a perceived danger that the US might not repay the initial capital brought to buy the bonds.</p><p>Furthermore, if there is a rift in transatlantic relations, investors could panic and start selling off US Treasury bonds en masse. When lots of people sell at the same time, the price of bonds drops. This would mean that the value of the bonds EU members own would decline, and they would lose money on their huge pile of US bonds.</p><p>While this would be bad for the US economically, it would also mean that European holders of the bonds would no longer be able to fully rely on this stash of “safe” assets and might have difficulty finding other places big and stable enough to move that money to.</p><p>http://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aXFD5/1/</p><p>“The [economic] dependency is mutual but asymmetric. For the US, Europe is mainly a major market and industrial partner, a commercial dependence. For Europe, the reliance is operational, technological and security-critical,” Nissen said.</p><p>“That asymmetry gives Washington durable structural influence, regardless of who occupies the White House.”</p><h3>Energy</h3><p>Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Europe has imposed sanctions on Russian oil and has gradually reduced its energy dependence on Russia.</p><p>Europe’s imports of Russian gas fell by 75 percent between 2021 and 2025, according to a report by the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), published on Monday.</p><p>Instead, Europe increased energy imports from the US, especially liquefied natural gas (LNG).</p><p>Europe’s imports of US LNG jumped from 21 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2021 to 81bcm in 2025 – almost a fourfold increase. “This means that EU countries sourced 57 percent of their LNG imports from the US in 2025,” the IEEFA report states.</p><p>The report also states that if the EU takes all the US LNG it has signed up for, and does not cut its gas use, by 2030, the US could be supplying almost 75 to 80 percent of its imports.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-if-europe-us-relations-break-down\">What happens if Europe-US relations break down?</h2><p>Europe has a lot to lose.</p><p>“A serious rupture with the US would likely reduce Europe’s access to critical military support, technology, intelligence, energy flows and parts of the financial and digital ecosystem,” Nissen said.</p><p>That dependence is why Europe has usually tried hard so far not to clash with the US, she said.</p><p>“In the short term, Europe cannot meaningfully decouple without real capability and economic costs,” Nissen said.</p><p>Therefore, she added, Europe is unlikely to abruptly break from the US, but rather gradually shift away from it by building new trading partnerships and developing its production capabilities for essential goods and services.</p><p>“Over the past weeks, Europe has started to move more explicitly toward diversification as a strategic hedge: reducing single-supplier exposure, widening partnerships and strengthening internal resilience,” Nissen said.</p><p>“At the same time, there is a much stronger political focus on building European capabilities – in defence production, critical technologies, energy infrastructure and industrial capacity. The logic is not decoupling from the US, but lowering vulnerability and increasing European room for manoeuvre over time.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
