Amazon MGM Studios, which is distributing the film, says that it will give viewers “unprecedented access” into Melania’s life.</p><p>Marc Beckman, the film’s producer, said in an interview this week that the first lady spearheaded the film’s creative direction.</p><p>“This is not a political film at all,” Beckman said.</p><p>The movie highlights her fashion choices, diplomatic engagements and the operations surrounding her Secret Service protection. Beckman said viewers also will see moments that capture the president’s sense of humour.</p><h2 id=\"when-will-the-movie-be-released-in-theatres\">When will the movie be released in theatres?</h2><p>The film will debut on Thursday at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, which Trump has asserted control over and been appointed chairman of.</p><p>Melania held a private screening at the White House on January 24, attended by about 70 people, including several business executives. The first lady said in a social media post that she was “humbled” and called the release “a historic moment”.</p><p>The film was set for release in approximately 1,600 screens worldwide on Friday, including about 1,500 in the United States. The premiere will be simulcast in 21 theatres nationwide on Thursday for invited guests to help build excitement for the launch.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-melania-s-budget\">What was Melania’s budget?</h2><p>Amazon MGM Studios bought the rights to the film in a $40m deal, in addition to $35m for a splashy advertising campaign, including a black-and-white projection of the film’s trailer onto The Sphere in Las Vegas.</p><p>The New York Times has reported that the figure includes a related docuseries that will be released later this year. Amazon paid about $26m more than the second-highest bid for the film, which came from Disney, and the film’s advertising budget is about 10 times the size of other high-profile documentaries.</p><p>Beckman, who produced the film, oversaw the movie deal with Amazon MGM Studios, plus a follow-up documentary series set for release later this year focusing on some of Melania Trump’s priorities, including children in foster care.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-did-the-first-lady-get-paid-for-the-movie\">How much did the first lady get paid for the movie?</h2><p>Melania served as executive producer of the film, giving her substantial control over editorial decisions, and will reportedly receive 70 percent of the $40m sum herself, according to the news service AFP.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-advance-ticket-sales\">What are advance ticket sales?</h2><p>Trump has urged his supporters to see the film, saying that tickets are “selling out, FAST!”</p><p>According to media outlet Puck News, the documentary is expected to earn about $5m during its opening weekend in the US and Canada, according to projections from the National Research Group (NRG).</p><p>Other figures from the market researcher Boxoffice are lower, predicting opening-weekend ticket sales of between $1 and $2 million.</p><p>Neither estimate would put the film on track to break even. No major publication has reviewed the film thus far, but the critical reception is also expected to be underwhelming.</p><p>The Guardian has reported that the chief executive of Vue, one of the largest cinema operators in the United Kingdom, said that ticket sales have so far been “soft”, with just one ticket sold for the first screening on Friday at the firm’s flagship Islington branch in London.</p><p>Across social media, the film and its PR campaign have drawn ridicule with several internet users posting screenshots showing cinemas that have sold no seats for screenings of “Melania.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-film-s-budget-compare-with-other-documentaries\">How does the film’s budget compare with other documentaries?</h2><p>Analysts have compared Melania with other well-known documentaries.</p><p>In a CNN segment, polling analyst Harry Enten noted that the 2004 Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, about the buildup to the US invasion of Iraq, had a budget of $6m, or a little more than $10m adjusted for inflation.</p><p>Enten said that the documentary brought in about $24m over its opening weekend, about $41m adjusted for inflation.</p><p>“Melania, not anywhere close,” Enten added.</p><p>“Am I Racist?”, a satirical documentary criticising “woke” culture by right-wing political commentator Matt Walsh, made about $4.5m over the opening weekend in 2024. It went on to become the year’s highest-grossing documentary film, with a budget of just $3m.</p><p>“2016: Obama’s America”, another documentary by a right-wing figure, Dinesh D’Souza, grossed a total of $33.5m domestically after being released in 2012. The film had a budget of $2.5m, about $3.5m in inflation-adjusted dollars.</p><h2 id=\"who-directed-melania\">Who directed ‘Melania’?</h2><p>The filmmaker Brett Ratner, known for the Rush Hour franchise, directed the film.</p><p>His involvement marked an unexpected return to filmmaking after a series of sexual assault allegations largely derailed his career in 2017. Ratner has denied those allegations.</p><p>Beckman, who is also an adviser and agent for Melania Trump, told the Los Angeles Times that Ratner was “one of the most talented directors of our lifetime” who knows “not just how to create something that’s gorgeous, but also how to reach the passions and emotions of his audience”.</p><p>The 56-year-old Ratner is also set to direct a fourth Rush Hour film for Paramount Studios, which merged with Skydance Media with the approval of the Trump administration in July.</p><p>“He was very talented,” Melania Trump told Fox. “He was the best one, and he was great to work with.”</p><p>Ratner shares producer credits with the first lady, Beckman and Fernando Sulichin of New Element Media. Filming began in December 2024.</p><p>The merger placed David Ellison, son of close Trump ally and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, in charge of operations. Trump had reportedly urged Ellison to reboot the Rush Hour franchise.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-melania-controversial\">Why is the ‘Melania’ controversial?</h2><p>The documentary’s substantial price tag, compared with relatively modest box office expectations, has led many to speculate that the film was bought at an inflated price to win favour with the Trump administration.</p><p>Trump’s second term has already come under scrutiny for its close ties to powerful donors and companies, which have poured money into Trump’s lavish inauguration fund, his push to build a ballroom at the White House, and a series of crypto holdings tied to Trump and his family.</p><p>An analysis by Bloomberg found that the family generated about $1.4bn from <a href=\"/news/2024/11/12/why-is-trumps-election-as-us-president-prompting-a-bitcoin-surge\">crypto ventures</a> during Trump’s first year back in office, which has treated the industry with a light touch and tossed out lawsuits and probes into alleged wrongdoing by prominent donors.</p><p>In that context, some see the documentary as a high-priced donation to the president known for his personalistic approach to wielding power.</p><p>Conversely, in South Africa, the country’s main cinema houses have pulled the documentary with the distributor citing “the current climate”, without elaborating, local media reported.</p><p>The South African government has strained ties with Trump’s administration, which has repeated false accusations that Pretoria is behind a “white genocide” of the Afrikaans community.</p><p>Nevertheless, Ted Hope, who worked at Amazon from 2015 to 2020 and played a central role in kickstarting the company’s film division, suggested to the New York Times that Amazon’s purchase of the film “equated with currying favour”.</p><p>“This has to be the most expensive documentary ever made that didn’t involve music licensing,” Hope said. “How can it not be equated with currying favour or an outright bribe?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

response to Israel’s Genocide in Gaza and yet rushing to ‘defend human rights’ in Iran – Europe’s PR stunt mainly seeks to cloak that it is an actor in severe decline,” Araghchi wrote on social media.</p><p>“Moreover, as the continent is certain to be massively impacted by an all-out war in our region – including the knock-on effects of surging energy prices – the EU’s current posture is deeply damaging to its own interests.”</p><p>That was echoed by the General Staff of the Iranian armed forces, which denounced the IRGC listing as “illogical and irresponsible” and said it marked “a clear sign of hostility towards the Iranian nation and the country’s independence”.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from the Iranian capital Tehran, noted that the “unprecedented” escalation between Iran and the EU comes amid a US military build-up in the Middle East, which has raised concerns about a <a

He was particularly concerned about being blamed for an accident resulting from neglected infrastructure.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Previously, the production plant received a month of maintenance, but this was gradually cut down to 20 days, and sometimes even 15, where only the most urgent tasks were prioritised,” he said.</p><p>“The risk of a potential catastrophe was very real, both for the staff and for the surrounding communities.”</p><p>On April 20, 2016, less than a year after Ramos left, an explosion rocked the Pajaritos complex, where he had worked before transferring to the Morelos complex just five kilometres away. The incident killed 32 people and injured more than 130 workers.</p><p>Pemex, over the years, has been responsible for soil contamination, rising methane emissions, and pipeline spills, with chronic leaks impacting local communities and marine fauna. This lack of infrastructure maintenance has worsened as the state-owned giant contends with significant financial and operational constraints and a massive debt burden.</p><p>For the past two decades, Pemex has struggled to increase production as mature oil fields decline, while it carries a debt of $100bn and has failed to attract private investment. Concerns are growing for the sustainability of the oil company and the future of Mexico’s energy sector amid regional changes, financial instability and a strong reliance on imports from the United States.</p><p>Despite being a crude oil producer, Mexico remains dependent on refined products and natural gas imports from the US. Mariana Castaneda, director of Grupo Estrategia Politica, a public affairs consulting firm, told Al Jazeera that domestic fuel production currently falls 21 percent short of demand. This gap, she said, is expected to widen, even as most refineries operate at or near their maximum capacity.</p><p>Rafael Vaquera Salazar, a professor at Monterrey Technological University (TEC), told Al Jazeera that despite the country’s vast reserves and long history of extraction, the outlook for recovery remains bleak.</p><p>Now there is a new challenge.</p><p>Following the US invasion of Venezuela that resulted in the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/explosions-heard-over-venezuelan-capital-caracas-amid-us-tensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">abduction</a> of then-President Nicolas Maduro and his wife on January 3, the regional energy landscape has become unstable, complicating long-term planning.</p><p>While shifts in Venezuela’s oil industry could impact Mexico’s own production, Vaquera said that the timeframe and specific conditions remain uncertain.</p><p>Both Venezuelan and Mexican crude are heavy, and US Gulf Coast refineries are specifically equipped to process this type of oil. “A competitive situation could arise where whoever offers the biggest discounts will secure the refining capacity,” he pointed out.</p><p>About 60 percent of Pemex’s crude oil exports go to the US. While imports from Venezuela were limited by sanctions, volumes are expected to rise with renewed activity.</p><p>Even though oil executives told US President Donald Trump that significant reforms are needed before they commit to Venezuela, a market that Exxon CEO Darren Woods called “<a href=\"/economy/2026/1/9/trump-promises-oil-executives-total-safety-if-they-invest-in-venezuela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">uninvestible</a>”, that may not really be the case.</p><p>In the oil industry, it doesn’t really matter who you do business with. What matters is the guarantee that investments will be secure and stable, Vaquera told Al Jazeera. “If I have certainty and stability, I can make investments,” he said. “Even if it means dealing with the devil.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"aid-to-cuba-and-an-ailing-state-oil-company\">Aid to Cuba and an ailing state oil company</h2><p>Mexico has been sending oil shipments to Cuba since 2023 through Pemex subsidiary Gasolina Bienestar. These shipments, which were once sporadic, became consistent under the administration of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who framed them as humanitarian aid.</p><p>Last year, between January and September 30, Mexico shipped 17,200 barrels of crude oil per day and 2,000 barrels of refined products, according to a report submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has also defended the oil shipments as humanitarian aid, yet they continue to fuel tensions with the Trump administration.</p><p>On January 26, reports emerged that Pemex had halted oil shipments to Cuba amid rising tensions. The following day, Sheinbaum declined to confirm or deny the reports, stating that the move was a “sovereign decision” by the state oil company.</p><p>Camila Acosta, an independent journalist in Havana, told Al Jazeera on January 15 that 60 percent of the island faces blackouts. These are driven by fuel shortages and crumbling infrastructure, along with declining oil shipments, the longstanding US embargo and the Trump administration’s tactic of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-seizes-a-seventh-venezuela-linked-oil-tanker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seizing Venezuelan oil tankers</a>.</p><p>“People are fed up with the blackouts, having to cook with firewood, not being able to refrigerate food – or having it spoil – and the lack of water because, without electricity, it can’t be pumped,” she said.</p><p>Acosta said that Mexico now stands as the Cuban regime’s “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/venezuela-and-mexico-how-trump-is-trying-to-choke-cubas-oil-supplies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifeline</a>” as Trump pledged in early January to stop Venezuelan oil shipments to Cuba. However, there is growing concern over how much worse the crisis could become if Mexican shipments were to cease entirely.</p><p>“Pemex is in serious financial trouble, and given the public pressure, I don’t know how much longer they can sustain these shipments to the island,” Acosta added.</p><p>Following a series of reforms since 2013, a 2025 reform under Sheinbaum changed Pemex’s status from a “Productive State Enterprise” to a “Public State Enterprise”. This legal change prioritises public benefit over economic profitability.</p><p>Castaneda says that the current administration recognises the need for private capital to guarantee Pemex’s financial viability, provided it doesn’t compromise national sovereignty.</p><p>“The goal is to ensure that sovereignty and Mexican oil remain in the hands of Mexicans. But Pemex itself has acknowledged that without support and participation from the private sector, it is practically impossible to face the challenges Pemex has, including its debt,” she added.</p><p>Pemex owes roughly $30bn to its suppliers despite official promises to accelerate payments. Castaneda said that while the government has been making payments, the amounts remain insufficient compared with the total debt, though it does offer some reassurance to the market. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from Al Jazeera.</p><p>Ramos, the former worker, said that this debt has severely affected local businesses, such as those providing maintenance, supplies, and technical and transportation services, which rely on those funds to stay afloat and pay their employees. He noted that in Coatzacoalcos, many residents are moving to cities like Monterrey for work.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Pedro Aguirre, CEO at Verifigas, a firm that provides technical verification in Mexico’s energy sector, told Al Jazeera that the government’s push for private capital is falling short of expectations.</p><p>The combination of Mexico’s 2025 <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/5/30/what-to-know-about-mexicos-first-of-its-kind-judicial-elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">judicial reforms</a> – which increase legal uncertainty – alongside Pemex’s operational challenges and the risks surrounding payment, have caused many companies to have second thoughts.</p><p>Last year, Aguirre said, the Mexican government provided Pemex with nearly 400 billion pesos ($23bn), more than double the approved amount, to stabilise its finances and bolster its reliability.</p><p>“The uncomfortable question that remains is, how long will this deficit be sustained?” Aguirre said. “And who, in a few years, will make the decision to say enough is enough.”</p><p>For 2026, Pemex’s budget grew 7.7 percent. Its strategy relies on hitting 1.8 million barrels per day, up from last year’s average of 1.6 million, and increasing domestic fuel processing at the Dos Bocas and Deer Park refineries to reduce imports. The Ministry of Energy is not granting interviews at this time.</p><p>But the growing financial support has also raised questions about which other key sectors are being impacted.</p><p>Castaneda said that despite government efforts to ensure that overall investment continues, sectors such as health, education and infrastructure have been diminished or neglected.</p><p>“It is like a blanket, isn’t it? If you pull on one side, the other side is revealed,” Castaneda said. “In other words, if there is more on one side, there will be less on the other.”</p><p>Pemex’s precarious financial position has been further strained by fuel theft, commonly known as huachicol. While criminal organisations traditionally siphoned gasoline from pipelines, the practice has evolved into a more complex scheme, involving a network of organised crime, Mexican and US companies, and corrupt officials. Fiscal fuel theft involves misclassifying fuel imports to evade the required taxes.</p><p>“For many years, these networks were importing diesel, in particular, but labelling it as lubricants or waste. This creates a fiscal shortfall. Funds that the state did not receive and should have received,” Vaquera added.</p><p>According to Aguirre, from Verifigas, the country lost about $10bn in 2025 due to this illicit trade, resulting in a massive deficit of public funds. He describes it as an “increasingly sophisticated fraud” that exposes governance failures and has direct impacts on community safety, local market competition, and Pemex’s economy.</p><p>While the US and Mexican governments have sanctioned and arrested people for their involvement in the huachicol fiscal, many in Mexico are still calling for high-ranking politicians within the Morena ruling party to be held accountable.</p><p>In September, Vice Admiral Manuel Roberto Farias Laguna, a relative of a former navy secretary, was arrested alongside other businessmen and public officials for alleged involvement in organised crime and fuel smuggling. He is the highest-ranking official detained to date in connection with these investigations.</p><p>For Vaquera, the issue is less about the money and more about how those funds are used. He warns that it can be used to install handpicked candidates in elections, influence authorities, or facilitate money laundering.</p><p>“It’s about who kept it [the money] and the political power they acquired by having all that money or economic power,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At first, it seemed like Friday’s deadline to pass a new spending package would pass without much fuss.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But an impasse has emerged in the waning days before the deadline. The shift came amid public outrage at the latest shooting death resulting from US President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement drive.</p><p>In the days since immigration agents killed US citizen <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/who-was-alex-pretti-the-nurse-shot-dead-by-federal-agents-in-minneapolis\">Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Saturday, Democrats have drawn a stark line.</p><p>They have pledged to approve no funding increases for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the agencies spearheading Trump’s deportation drive, unless it agrees to place guardrails on its use of force.</p><p>An initial vote on Thursday saw every Democrat and, surprisingly, a handful of Republicans vote against a funding package.</p><p>That came shortly after Tom Homan, the US border security chief, said immigration agents would shift their approach in Minnesota but vowed to maintain a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/trump-border-czar-says-staying-in-minnesota-until-problems-gone\">continued presence</a> in the state.</p><p>Lawmakers in the Senate now have until midnight on Friday (05:00 GMT on Saturday) to find a solution. Here’s how we got here and what comes next:</p><h2 id=\"what-s-in-the-legislation\">What’s in the legislation?</h2><p>Republicans will need to reach a 60-vote threshold in the 100-seat Senate to pass the funding legislation. They currently control 53 seats, meaning they will need both party unity and the support of at least seven members of the Democratic caucus to pass funding.</p><p>All told, the legislation includes six separate bills to fund the Department of Defense, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of the Treasury, and, most notably, DHS.</p><p>The bills are all linked in a sprawling $1.2 trillion package passed by the US House of Representatives last week. Without the funding, non-essential services in those departments would grind to a halt.</p><h2 id=\"why-not-vote-separately-on-dhs-funding\">Why not vote separately on DHS funding?</h2><p>Any changes to the House-approved package — including voting separately on DHS funding — would require overcoming lengthy procedural hurdles in the Senate.</p><p>Then, the legislation would have to return to the House of Representatives for a new vote.</p><p>The House is currently in the middle of a weeklong recess, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, is unlikely to call his chamber’s representatives back to Washington for a second vote.</p><p>Thursday’s initial 45-55 vote in the Senate scuttles the prospect of the wholesale package being quickly approved, raising the possibility over the funding bills being broken up to separate the controversial DHS funding.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-funding-is-there-for-dhs\">How much funding is there for DHS?</h2><p>Compared with last year, the new spending package would add $400m more to the detention budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and $370m more for its enforcement budget.</p><p>That is on top of a $170bn windfall for DHS included in last year’s sprawling tax-and-spending law, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” It earmarked about $75bn for ICE over the next four years.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-funding-controversial\">Why is the funding controversial?</h2><p>Rights advocates have <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/public-opinion-shifts-on-ice-as-advocates-warn-of-us-inflection-point\">condemned</a> the current funding bill for providing yet more funding to ICE, the agency at the heart of Trump’s deportation drive.</p><p>Just this month, US immigration officers have been connected to two high-profile shooting deaths in Minneapolis: Pretti’s killing on Saturday by two US Border Patrol agents, and the shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on January 7. Both shooting victims were US citizens.</p><p>Last week, a handful of House Democrats broke with their party to vote for the spending package. At the time, seven Democrats backed the funding legislation, while 206 opposed it.</p><p>The vote was ultimately 220 to 207, with Republican Thomas Massie joining the majority of the Democrats in opposition.</p><p>This latest budget fight comes less than three months after a record-breaking, 43-day-long government shutdown came to a close on November 12, 2025. Polls show such disruptions are widely unpopular across the political spectrum.</p><h2 id=\"what-were-the-expectations-leading-up-to-this-week\">What were the expectations leading up to this week?</h2><p>In the run-up to Friday’s shutdown deadline, Democrats in the Senate were bracing for a similar fracture among their party members.</p><p>Several had been expected to hold their noses and vote to support the spending bill, in part fearing the political optics of another government shutdown.</p><p>On January 20, Democratic Senator Patty Murray argued against shutting down the government yet again, calling it an ineffective tactic to curb ICE.</p><p>“ICE must be reined in, and unfortunately, neither a [continuing resolution] nor a shutdown would do anything to restrain it, because, thanks to Republicans, ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap whether or not we pass a funding bill,” she wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/senatorpattymurray/posts/heres-my-statement-on-the-homeland-security-funding-bill-that-was-just-releasedw/122251211276177122/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>Murray called on her party to instead focus its efforts on winning the upcoming midterm elections. “The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-has-democratic-sentiment-changed\">Why has Democratic sentiment changed?</h2><p>Pretti’s killing on Saturday changed the dynamic for Democrats.</p><p>His shooting by US Border Patrol agents was followed by a swarm of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/trump-administration-maga-allies-spread-misinformation-on-pretti-killing\">baseless claims</a> from the Trump administration, accusing Pretti — a nurse who treated US veterans — of being a “domestic terrorist”. That, in turn, fuelled further outrage at his death.</p><p>Senator Murray was among those who shifted her stance in the wake of the killing. Her response was unequivocal.</p><p>“I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” she wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/PattyMurray/status/2015501477603594259\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on the social media platform X. “Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences.”</p><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, also abandoned earlier assurances that a shutdown would be avoided.</p><p>Left-wing senators Catherine Cortez Masto, Jacky Rosen and Angus King have also announced they will not vote in favour of the funding bill as is, despite having broken from party ranks to end the last shutdown in November.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/2016281815783186597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on Wednesday on X, Schumer showed little sign of yielding.</p><p>“In the wake of ICE’s abuses and the administration’s recklessness, Senate Democrats will NOT pass the DHS budget until it is rewritten,” he wrote.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"will-the-party-remain-united\">Will the party remain united?</h2><p>To date, the party has yet to present a list of demands on changes to the DHS funding.</p><p>Reforms floated by Democrats include requiring judicial warrants for immigration arrests, doing away with the Trump administration’s detention quotas, and mandating that federal agents unmask themselves and wear identification.</p><p>Other proposed measures involve prohibiting US Border Patrol agents from being deployed within the interior of the US and requiring that local and state authorities be involved in use-of-force investigations.</p><p>State officials in Minnesota have complained in recent weeks that they have been shut out of the federal investigations into the killings of Good and Pretti.</p><p>While Trump has distanced himself from his administration’s comments calling Pretti a “terrorist”, his more <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trump-promises-to-de-escalate-minnesota-crisis-after-alex-pretti-shooting\">conciliatory tone</a> has not extended to Democratic officials.</p><p>On Wednesday, he again blamed Democrats for escalating tensions in Minnesota and warned that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was “playing with fire” for failing to fall in line with his immigration policies.</p><p>Top Democrats, in turn, have dismissed any promises for reform not codified in law.</p><p>“If the government shuts down yet again, it will be because congressional Republicans refuse to place guardrails on this reckless president and the ICE agency,” Senator Dick Durbin said during a floor speech on Wednesday.</p><p>“In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to join us in that endeavour before [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem and her squad take another innocent life.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
