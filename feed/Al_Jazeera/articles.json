If Moscow’s allies are weakened, then Russia also gets weaker, the simplistic logic goes.</p><p>Although he criticised US interventionism in the past, US President Donald Trump is newly infected with the regime change fever once spread by his Democratic predecessors.</p><p>What it reminds one of most is the export of revolution – a short-lived policy of Soviet Russia spearheaded by the father of the Red Army, Leon Trotsky. It resulted in several pro-Bolshevik governments emerging across Europe – in Hungary, Bavaria and Latvia. None of them lasted long.</p><p>One of the Bolsheviks’ lesser-known revolutionary projects was the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic, which existed in 1920-21 in Iran’s Gilan province on the Caspian Sea. The idea was to try to spread the proletarian revolution all the way to India, but eventually the Red Army had to retreat, and its local allies were quickly overthrown.</p><p>Fast-forward a century, and Iran again finds itself as a destination for revolutionary export, only now with American and Israeli hawks behind the attempt to foment something along the lines of Ukraine’s Maidan. Iran’s theocratic regime is hardly palatable, and resistance to it is organic, but the constant threat of US and Israeli intervention appears to be its strongest pillar and the source of immunity against domestic unrest. Iranians know better than to risk having their country transformed into another Syria or Libya.</p><p>Iran’s entire 20th-century history is that of constant resistance to subjugation by outside powers, including Russia or the USSR. Iran was also the place where Soviet and Western interests often converged – as in the 1953 coup d’etat against Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, in their shared opposition to the Iranian revolution of 1979 and in their support for the Iraqi side in the Iran-Iraq War.</p><p>It is only in the later years of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule that Tehran and Moscow formed a tentative alliance, which grew much tighter when Iran helped Russia with crucial drone technology at the beginning of the Russian all-out invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>There is an important similarity in the historical trajectories of Iran, Russia, as well as China. These are three of the very few long-existing states that Western powers tried but failed to colonise at various stages in history. The authoritarian instincts in all three could be fairly explained by the constant need to mobilise against the Western threat.</p><p>But Russia’s role in this triad is the most ambiguous, given that – despite its conflict with the West – it was also one of those European powers which tried to colonise chunks of both Iran and China.</p><p>That explains Moscow’s extremely Europe-centric attitude to Iran’s current predicament. Putin’s government is single-mindedly focused on one project – winning the war in Ukraine, which it sees as a proxy conflict with the West. Russian military expeditions in the Middle East and Africa are only important for Putin insofar as they help to stretch the West’s resources, creating additional leverage and trade-offs for the Kremlin. Russia’s situational alliances with regimes in Iran, Venezuela and North Korea fall into the same category.</p><p>Regime ideologues in Moscow like to repeat the apocryphal phrase attributed to Tsar Aleksandr III: “Russia has only two allies – the army and the navy”. In this worldview, Russia’s allies and client regimes are little more than expendable chess pieces in the nuclear superpowers’ global game.</p><p>All of Putin’s military adventures outside the former Soviet space began after the start of the war in Ukraine in 2014 and as a reaction to Western support of the Ukrainian authorities, which he sees as a puppet government installed through a “coup”, as he describes the Maidan revolution.</p><p>Russia intervened in Syria as well as in Libya and went on to expand its zone of influence in Central and Western Africa, mostly at the expense of the French.</p><p>Did it help Russia to set up a global neo-empire? No, a few initial successes were often followed by setbacks, most prominently when the regime of Moscow’s Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, fell in 2024. But a global empire has never been the point. The point is that Putin is very close to ending the war in Ukraine on his terms, and his efforts in other regions helped to bring about what most Russians will see as an outright victory in a conflict with the West’s mighty war machine.</p><p>Russia’s brutally inhumane air strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure are gradually rendering large population centres, like Kyiv, uninhabitable in midwinter. Ukraine’s European allies appear powerless to change that predicament.</p><p>But while Putin is entirely focused on a single chessboard, Trump is performing a simultaneous match with a plethora of players, bizarrely including the US’s traditional European NATO allies.</p><p>The Trump administration’s obsession with regime change in Iran, Venezuela, and especially in Greenland does not undermine Putin – it is a godsend. The situation, when the US is bogged down in several absurd and dangerous geopolitical projects while attempting to play a quasi-neutral peacemaker in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, is ideal for Moscow.</p><p>But despite outward absurdity, there might be a logic behind what Trump is doing. It is about the natural human tendency to choose an easier path. A painstaking chess match with Putin, which Trump indeed did not start himself, is infinitely harder and fraught with embarrassing defeat. Venezuela and Iran are both easier targets.</p><p>But as the latest events show, even in these countries, the goal of proper regime change might appear a bit too arduous for the current US leader to follow through. All Trump cares about is an instant, cost-free PR boost, so he needs the softest of targets to achieve that. Maduro proved to be one, but who could be next?</p><p>Iran and Greenland interventions are risky, Cuba not so much. But – as far as regime change efforts go – there is also one leader who annoys Trump to no end, who can be removed without military intervention and who stands in the way of the US president’s goal of being seen as the world’s greatest peacekeeper: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>It is no wonder that on Wednesday, Trump abruptly returned to undermining Ukraine by saying its leader, rather than Putin, was the main obstacle to peace.</p><p>Mired in a huge corruption scandal, deadlocked politically and militarily, Zelenskyy comes across as the softest of potential targets, the very opposite of his archrival Putin. It is not hard to predict how the US president’s political instincts might play out.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Two small dressers on either side of the bed are submerged under books and tissue paper. Only the mattress, adorned by a colourful crocheted throw, isn’t buried under other objects.</p><p>Jo, the director of Hoarder Clean Up UK, is spending the morning in this semidetached home in a southeast London suburb. Her client, Emily, a pseudonym, is a woman in her mid-30s who asked that her identity be withheld for privacy reasons.</p><p>Emily has booked Jo for half a day to start clearing her elderly mother’s room so that a new bed can be delivered. When Jo arrived, she briefly met the mother downstairs, and the petite, frail-looking woman seemed wary of the cleanup plan despite having ordered the bed herself. Emily gently reminded her mother why Jo was there, and the older woman reluctantly agreed before retreating to the living room.</p><p>Jo sets down her bin bags, rubber gloves, cleaning spray, a brush and a duster on top of a desk by the door. Her arms akimbo, she begins surveying the cluttered space.</p><p>“This is what it’s like,” says Emily, her hands motioning towards the piles, her face flushed as she follows Jo’s gaze across the room. “There’s also mould on the windows, and the toilet needs dealing with. I know it’s probably not the worst case you’ve seen, but I just want her to be comfortable.”</p><p>“No problem,” Jo says, smiling as she reaches for an empty box she’s spotted under the desk. She asks Emily if she can help decide what should be kept, and the latter agrees. “We’ll work quickly but also be careful,” Jo tells her.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117551\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117551\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117551\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Midway-through-a-hoarder-cleaning-job-1763557990.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jo Powell dons gloves as she sifts through a hoarder's belongings, carefully picking out important mementoes.

Outside of work, she swears and cracks jokes often, but on this job, sensing the tension in the home, she is attentive but not overly serious, with the air of someone accustomed to being invited into people’s lives in vulnerable moments.</p><p>Her voice is reassuring but decisive when she speaks to Emily, taking charge of the situation by suggesting which areas of the room to prioritise for the cleaning, and moving in a light-footed fashion from one spot in the crammed room to another, without knocking anything over. There’s a deftness and agility in her hands as she picks out small, otherwise inconspicuous souvenirs from the first box she reaches for.</p><p>She suggests sorting objects into different piles: paper recycling, plastic recycling, donations, items to keep, and, one for things that need to be thrown out. She works methodically, checking whenever something looks like it might matter, whether it’s dusty bank letters, insurance policies or a good luck charm from a temple in Japan. For outdated documents containing biographical details, she suggests Emily shred them.</p><p>The two women settle into an easy rhythm, chatting as they work. Jo’s tone is warm as she helps Emily decide what stays and what goes.</p><p>Emily mentions her middle-aged brother, who is autistic and lives in the house. He reacts adversely to changes in his environment, and Emily is worried about how he will respond today.</p><p>“The last time I tried to clear the room,” she recalls, “he nearly broke the door down. I almost called the police.”</p><p>Then she exhales sharply, making an unexpected admission: her mother was diagnosed with late-stage cancer just two weeks ago.</p><p>“She’s had a very full life, but she’s still finding it hard to take in,” Emily says quietly. “The prognosis is three to six months.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Jo says, straightening up. For a few moments, her busy hands are still. “That must be so hard. For her, but also for you.”</p><p>Gradually, as they work, the room begins to reveal the mother’s past as a civil servant with a penchant for travel.</p><p>The “keep” pile, the artefacts of her life, fills two green boxes. It includes thick files with notes from a linguistics course, sheets of Vietnamese greetings from a cruise holiday, a programme from a passion play staged in a German town once every decade, trinkets from Patagonia, holographic postcards of Huskies from the Arctic Circle, yellowing cards written to her late husband before marriage, funeral invitations and travel guidebooks.</p><p>Jo is nimble and decisive. The dedicated piles grow. They consist of stacks of supermarket brochures, old skincare products and receipts for food for a long-deceased cat. Filled bags are brought downstairs to the recycling bin or placed into the boot of Jo’s car. Emily seems to relax as the room sheds its weight.</p><p>Suddenly, Emily’s mother appears. She’s in the doorway, gripping the frame. Her eyes dart around the partly cleared room.</p><p>“I was so afraid that this is what I’d find!” she says, her voice breaking and her hands trembling. “There’s so much history here, no one else understands. I’m going to come back later, and I won’t even recognise my own home!”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117540\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117540\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117540\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jo-Powell-carefully-going-through-items-in-a-bedroom-thats-been-hoarded-to-ensure-that-nothing-important-is-mistakenly-discarded-1763557965.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jo Powell carefully goes through items in a hoarder's bedroom, ensuring that nothing important gets thrown away.

Her role involved answering the phone and speaking to customers, and quite soon into her job, she was struck by how emotional the calls were.</p><p>“It really affected me, having people crying down the phone,” she recalls. “[People who hoard] are so ashamed. It’s [often] a mental health issue at the end of the day.”</p><p>A turning point came in 2021, when a young woman called about trauma cleaning after her father’s suicide. Jo, whose stepbrother had taken his own life 12 years earlier, stayed on the line with the woman, offering support long after the work call would normally have ended.</p><p>It struck her that she might be someone who could show up differently for clients in crisis. Then came the case that sealed her decision: The company had a client whose toilet had for years been filled to the brim with paper and faeces, so she resorted to containers and bags that she couldn’t face dealing with.</p><p>“Bear in mind, people are mortified letting strangers see this,” Jo says. “No one’s been inside their homes in 10, 20, sometimes 40 years.”</p><p>The woman tearfully rang her during the clearing process, humiliated that a neighbour had complained and asked if the skip that had been placed in the communal parking area for the job could be removed.</p><p>By then, Jo realised that she’d listened to too many firsthand accounts of hoarding clients being shamed or berated, instead of being treated with sensitivity.</p><p>“That was when I was like, ‘Wow, I need to go and do something on my own,’” she says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117535\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117535\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117535\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Midway-through-the-cleanup-1763557953.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An example of hoarding seen halfway through a cleanup.

She believes that her difficult personal experiences have helped her navigate the fear and sorrow she encounters in her clients.</p><p>“I lost my parents when I was quite young,” she explains. “I was 20 when my dad died, and [I] was in a very, very bad way. My mum was also already ill at the time, but we didn’t know that.”</p><p>When her mother passed away two years later, Jo moved in with a friend, and she found herself regularly staying up until three in the morning, cleaning to cope with her grief.</p><p>At the time, Jo was also on antidepressants and working at a clothing retailer.</p><p>“I was like a zombie,” she recalls. “But nobody would’ve known, because I was the life and soul of the place. Then, as soon as I walked out to the car, I’d think, ‘You don’t need to put on this façade any more.’”</p><p>More than two decades on, Jo’s mental health still fluctuates, but she believes this allows her to relate to the people she helps and understand what it’s like to hide one’s pain.</p><p>Many of her hoarding clients might appear put-together in public but have homes crammed with objects they can scarcely wade through. Among her clients are bankers, surgeons, high-ranking civil servants and a judge. The shame they carry cuts across different walks of life, she observes, regardless of how they appear in public.</p><p>“People think that hoarding is just about clutter,” she adds. “It’s not.”</p><p>When people struggle to let go of possessions, she explains, “It’s about fear, and often about trauma.”</p><p>She’s observed that bereavement is a common factor among her clients: after losing loved ones, some react by accumulating more possessions that otherwise appear of no value to others. In some cases, she’s visited homes where younger members of the family hoard because they have older relatives who do.</p><p>“Because [a hoarding disorder] is about mental health, literally anyone can be affected by it,” she emphasises. “A lot of the time, buying and keeping things is about control, so you have all these things around you that you don’t even open, but you look forward to.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117531\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117531\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117531\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/A-menu-for-Mothers-Day-written-by-the-client-to-her-mother-when-she-was-a-child-1763557939.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C577&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"While cleaning through a hoarder's bedroom, Jo Powell finds a menu written by the client's daughter for Mothers' Day, a sweet reminder of her childhood.

As Emily’s mother recoils at the sight of her partially cleared room, her brother is stamping upstairs, holding travel brochures he has retrieved from the recycling bin.</p><p>“You’ve thrown these away,” he accuses his sister. She snaps back instantly, anger contorting her face: “You’re not helping at all!” He backs away.</p><p>Jo steps in. She doesn’t flinch or rush towards Emily’s mother, but defuses the situation by picking up one of the green boxes and showing it to her.</p><p>“We’re really being very careful,” Jo tells her gently. “We’re keeping everything important to you. Please don’t worry.”</p><p>At this, the elderly woman’s shoulders soften, and she sinks onto the edge of her bed.</p><p>Emily’s lower lip quivers as tears form.</p><p>“I’m sorry for raising my voice,” she says to Jo. “You must think I’m so hard-hearted.”</p><p>Jo shakes her head firmly and gives her shoulder a squeeze.</p><p>Emily gathers herself, then guides her mother downstairs. When she returns minutes later, she’s more composed. Jo pauses the sorting.</p><p>“Are you all right?” she asks her with concern. Emily nods, holding back emotion.</p><p>Jo tells her that moments like these are common under stress and that she shouldn’t feel bad.</p><p>“You’re doing a lot on your own,” Jo says, and asks if she has anyone supporting her through this.</p><p>“Not really,” Emily admits. “Just my husband, who’s been great.” Jo nods before they resume sorting.</p><p>A folded card made of thick cream paper emerges from one of the boxes. Emily opens it and lets out a short, surprised laugh.</p><p>“Oh, this must’ve been me, before I could spell,” she says.</p><p>She is holding a Mother’s Day menu written in colourful ink: a sliced pear in exchange for two kisses, a “main coarse” of scrambled eggs and cereal for different numbers of hugs. Her expression is half-amused, half-sad as she murmurs: “It’s funny. I wasn’t that close to her growing up, only later.”</p><p>As the appointment winds down, Jo sets aside a cluster of objects on the desk, mostly souvenirs from Emily’s mother’s travels that she thinks will bring her solace.</p><p>“We shouldn’t do any more today,” Jo advises. “It’d be too much for her.”</p><p>Jo will return the following week to continue the clearing.</p><p>Hours later, Jo’s phone buzzes. It’s a message from Emily. Her mother is pleased with how the room looks, and with time, Emily hopes she’ll come to appreciate the change even more.</p><p>Jo admits that it’s one of the more complicated jobs she’s encountered.</p><p>“A lot of the time, it’s about persuading people to part with heaps of empty boxes, milk cartons, stuff that’s rotted all the way through. Most of what’s hoarded can’t be saved,” she reflects. “But in that room, there were so many things that genuinely meant something to her. We can’t throw them away, especially since she’s close to the end of her life.”</p><p>The presence of family members with conflicting views made the job harder, she adds.</p><p>“You really do get caught in the crossfire.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117558\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117558\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117558\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/An-old-childrens-poetry-book-that-Jo-Powells-mother-used-to-read-to-her-from-1763558012.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An old children's poetry book that Jo Powell's mother used to read to her from-1763558012\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4117558\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An old children’s poetry book that Jo’s mother used to read to her [Amandas Ong/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"i-just-can-t-sit-down\">‘I just can’t sit down’</h2><p>A week before the cleanup, Jo was at home in Whitstable, on the north coast of Kent, where she lives with her three young sons and partner.</p><p>In the small room she uses as her office, shelves and drawer-tops are crowded with tongue-in-cheek signs printed with swear words and figurines of raised middle fingers, trinkets that make her smile. Some are gifts from friends and relatives, while others she purchased herself. Framed family pictures line the walls of her home, and by her desk is a photo of Bailey, her pet Doberman, whom she credits with keeping her alive when she was depressed after her parents’ deaths.</p><p>“If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be here, a million percent,” she says about her now-deceased pet.</p><p>Even though she’s at home, her eyes flit everywhere, always looking for something to clean. Keeping still and not being busy with her hands, she says, means having to “think about [herself]”, which she declares with a shudder, is the “worst thing”.</p><p>She admits that she struggles to relax. When her partner suggests they watch a film together, she often finds it too difficult to sit still.</p><p>“I just can’t sit down,” she says with a slightly regretful laugh. “I need to hoover. I need to clean the windows, look after the plants.</p><p>“It’s exasperating for him when I get up and start doing stuff,” she adds.</p><p>She even keeps her hands busy when she’s on call for work, doodling or crafting little objects out of whatever scrap material is nearby.</p><p>Calls and messages from potential clients come in every 15 minutes, several asking if she and her team — Jo now has five employees — can remove mould in their homes, which is the bulk of their cleaning work. When her rap music ringtone sounds, she answers the phone in a friendly manner, patiently addressing each query and asking for photos before sending quotes.</p><p>Typically, the fee for half a day’s work involving two cleaners comes to 600 pounds ($800), with a full day costing 1,200 pounds ($1,600).</p><p>Though she tries to keep fees affordable by industry standards, she’s aware that the cost might still be too high for some. She hopes to secure charitable funding in the future, so everyone who needs help can get it. For a change of scene in her work day, she carries her laptop into the light-filled extension to her living room overlooking a sloping garden with two chicken coops in the corner. Her 14-year-old dog, Harvey, snoozes at her feet.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4117529\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4117529\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117529\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bedroom-after-half-a-days-work-1763557928.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bedroom after half a day's work-1763557928\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4117529\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily’s mother’s bedroom after half a day’s work [Amandas Ong/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"making-them-feel-human\">‘Making them feel human’</h2><p>One of her colleagues calls about a hoarding client they’ve helped recently — a woman who lived with rubbish all around her home and cat faeces scattered across the floor.</p><p>Jo insists that her staff keep bagged waste discreetly inside the properties or gardens until there’s enough to fill a dump truck. The aim is to spare people the embarrassment of having neighbours witness a skip being filled over several days. She also tries to work only with waste-removal firms that are respectful to her clients.</p><p>This time, however, something’s gone wrong. The contracted removal team was rude to the woman and invoiced her directly instead of billing Jo’s company, as they should have. Upset, the woman forwarded the invoice to Jo’s colleague, explaining how distressed she was.</p><p>“I’m not having that,” Jo says sternly. “I don’t want to use this company any more if they’re going to be judging people like this.”</p><p>When she ends the call, she’s glum.</p><p>“I already know we’ve lost her confidence. We probably needed more visits to her property to really clean it out, but that chance is gone now,” she sighs.</p><p>“It’s so sensitive, and her emotions are so heightened. I’m putting myself in her shoes – she probably wouldn’t want us to come back. Even though we’ve done nothing wrong.”</p><p>Jo learned quickly when she started hoarder cleaning to adapt to her customers’ needs.</p><p>“Everyone is different, and it’s important to respect that,” she says. “Some people don’t want sympathy; they just want to crack on with it. Others want to talk, and you leave knowing their life stories. It’s not just manpower. It’s moral support.”</p><p>Her job, she believes, is to take “baby steps” towards helping people “feel dignified and making them feel human again”, rather than “ransacking the place like a bull in a china shop”.</p><p>“It sounds corny,” she says enthusiastically, “but I just love being able to help others. I genuinely do want to make a difference.”</p><p>When recalling past cases, she grows animated, as if she’s right there at the scene again.</p><p>One early client lived just a stone’s throw from the department store Harrods, in one of the most expensive parts of London.</p><p>“You know what it’s like when you can’t find something, and you think, I’ll just buy another one? Well, she was like that with umbrellas,” Jo says, chuckling at the memory.</p><p>“I think we counted 24 of them.”</p><p>Jo and her colleague built a good rapport with the woman over several days of clearing, with the three having lunch together.</p><p>She convinced the woman to donate many of her unneeded belongings to charity. Eventually, they cleared her bed so she could sleep in it for the first time in years, instead of on a chair. The woman was so grateful to Jo that she asked her to go duvet shopping with her to celebrate.</p><p>Another time, Jo helped a client who had lived with her mother until the parent died. She sensed the woman was still grieving, and her mother’s room was almost completely hoarded to the door.</p><p>While cleaning, Jo found a gift bag with a pebble inside. Instead of throwing it away, she asked if it might be sentimental. The client became emotional, explaining that the pebble was tied to a happy memory with her late mother. “It’s why we have to take care while cleaning, even if there’s a lot of stuff to get through,” Jo says. “Even really small objects that you might miss might really matter to somebody.”</p><p>Some jobs, meanwhile, have been disconcerting.</p><p>Jo was once clearing out piles of paper and books from a client’s study when her assistant entered, whispering in alarm that he was sitting outside, stroking his collection of long knives.</p><p>As she cleaned, “he followed me around quite a bit,” Jo remembers. “That was really uncomfortable.”</p><p>Her assistant, who had a black belt in jiujitsu, made sure Jo was never left alone in a room with the man.</p><p>And yet, despite concern for her safety, Jo felt sympathy for the man. Through snippets of conversation, she learned that he had a wife and two adult sons who no longer had anything to do with him.</p><p>“In one of the bedrooms, there were still board games and toys from the time the boys were small, and none of it was salvageable,” she remembers, her tone sombre.</p><h2 id=\"the-need-to-hoard\">The need to hoard</h2><p>Something Jo often tells the people she helps to put them at ease is that everybody — including her — “feels the need to hoard in some way”.</p><p>She goes to retrieve a large box from her garage, and brings it to her office. Inside, wrapped in layers of paper and bubble wrap, is a heavy black metal bull figurine.</p><p>“Oh no!” she exclaims in dismay as she gingerly removes it. “Look, its horn has fallen off!”</p><p>Her mother had loved bulls and collected dozens of them. Some sit on shelves around Jo’s home today, but the rest are in storage.</p><p>“My mum’s gone nearly 21 years now, but I can’t bear to sell them or get rid of them,” she explains. “What’s the point of my keeping them? Bulls are not even my thing,” she adds, but the objects are a link to her mother.</p><p>“This is what I tell my clients: Something could seem like a waste to everyone else, but we still want to hold on to it.”</p><p>She takes out a plastic container full of her mother’s belongings that she hasn’t touched in decades.</p><p>“I don’t even know what some of these are,” she confesses, rifling through envelopes stuffed with documents. “Probably from her time in America when she was working there.”</p><p>She gets visibly excited when she finds a book of children’s poetry, its browning pages coming apart at the bind.</p><p>“Oh my God, I remember this! My mum used to read it to me,” she says.</p><p>As she tenderly puts everything back into the box, she adds ruefully, “And now it’s probably going to go back into storage, and I’ll never look at it again.”</p><p>Jo heads outside, where her chickens peck at the grass near the small patch of earth where her favourite cockerel, Shim, was buried four months ago. The colourful splint she once made for him when he had a bad leg – with its three bright toes jutting upward – lies on top of his burial spot.</p><p>“It actually worked really well,” she says. “But he just suddenly died.”</p><p>Jo pauses, watching the other chickens move across the grass. “Chickens are very good at hiding what’s really wrong with them,” she says.</p><p>As she returns to the house, she muses about another query for hoarder cleaning she’s just received. Each time she sees a new message, she’s reminded that every potential client represents someone who summoned up the courage to reach out after years, possibly decades, of managing alone.</p><p>“You come across so much in this job, there’s really nothing I haven’t seen,” she says. “People need to know that they can get help without being judged. So it’s really important to tailor how you act with each individual and get to know them as much as you can.”</p><p>What she carries forward from her own experience of grief and late-night cleaning is an understanding of what it means to push through life’s struggles: not perfectly, but with determination and not alone.</p><p>“That’s what I’m trying to do with my work,” she says. “Just to be there for my clients, and support them through something difficult, with a laugh if that’s possible.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

His children and those of the other families facing imminent eviction have stopped going to school as well. Everyone is terrified about what might happen if they leave their homes for even a moment – while trying to have a last precious few moments together.</p><p>“I’m 50 years old. I was born here,” says Rajabi as he looks across the valley of Silwan. “I opened my eyes in this house. My laughter, my sadness, my joy, and all my friends and loved ones are in this neighbourhood.” He is quiet for a moment and the silence is filled by the cooing of pigeons in the coops he and his brother take care of on their shared roof.</p><p>After a moment, he resumes. “Today, the house that is my dream, that is all my memories – they want to destroy it in a single second and put a settler in our place. This is an enormous pain in the heart, a pain you can’t imagine.</p><p>“This isn’t a building or property that will be destroyed – these are memories they want to erase.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244738\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244738\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244738\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kayed-Rajabi-side-profile-portrait-1768576413.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batn al-Hawa evictions\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244738\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kayed Rajabi looks out from the rooftop of the home he has been ordered to leave so Israeli settlers can move in [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"constant-psychological-pressure\">‘Constant psychological pressure’</h2><p>At the turn of the new year, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected final appeals by 150 Palestinians across 28 families in the Batn al-Hawa neighbourhood of Silwan facing eviction from their homes.</p><p>In all, approximately 700 residents of the neighbourhood, spanning 84 families, are now facing imminent forced displacement, which, according to Israeli NGO Ir Amim, would amount to the largest coordinated expulsion of Palestinians from a single neighbourhood in East Jerusalem since 1967, when Israel’s occupation began.</p><p>Twenty-four homes belonging to the extended Rajabi family alone are subject to eviction orders, affecting 250 people.</p><p>On January 12, the 28 families which had launched appeals received official letters from the Israeli execution office under the Ministry of Justice demanding they vacate their homes within 21 days. The family of Khalil al-Basbous, a neighbour of the Rajabis, has already been forcibly evicted from their home as a result of the latest court decision.</p><p>For as long as they can remember, the rooftop of Rajabi and his younger brother, Wa’il, 44, overlooking Al-Aqsa Mosque, has been a meeting place for family and neighbours to have breakfast together and drink tea. “You’d find 50 of my family members coming here, and we’d fill the neighbourhood with our celebrations of Ramadan and Eid,” recalls Rajabi.</p><p>He reels off the names of all the family members and friends from past Ramadans who have already been forced out of their homes in their street.</p><p>“The memories were so sweet before the settlers came,” says Rajabi. “The best memories, the best neighbourhood, the best neighbours – our neighbours who were replaced by the settlers.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244749\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244749\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244749\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Seized-and-grafittid-home-in-Batn-al-Hawa-1768576490.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batn al-Hawa evictions\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244749\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A seized home bearing grafitti in Batn al Hawa, East Jerusalem [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>As he is speaking, a commotion begins outside the terrace of houses.

We grew up together, we opened our eyes together. We used to play, me and their sons and daughters.</p><p>“I cried every day after they were thrown out of their home so easily.”</p><p>Now, settlers occupy all the homes bordering Kayed and Wa’il’s building. “We are under constant psychological pressure from the settlers,” said Wa’il. “We are not living.”</p><p>Rajabi and his brother’s apartments in the building they share with their mother are simple – a kitchen, a small living room, a bedroom for each of them and their wives, and another room for their many children. “This house isn’t a villa, it’s not a palace,” says Rajabi. “But we are happy and comfortable here.

Local Palestinians then gained sole ownership of the area over time.</p><p>Just before the 1967 war, which saw Israel seize control of East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, the Sinai Peninsula and the West Bank, the Rajabi family was living in the Sharaf neighbourhood in the Old City of Jerusalem.</p><p>In 1966, the Jordanian government advised the Rajabis to leave that neighbourhood before violence erupted. They fled to nearby Batn al-Hawa, buying land there from the existing Arab owners. After the war in 1967, the Sharaf neighbourhood was destroyed by the occupying Israeli authorities, who replaced it by expanding the modern-day Jewish Quarter.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244757\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244757\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244757\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Signed-contract-from-Rajabis-of-buying-land-in-Batn-al-Hawa-in-Jordanian-times-1768576550.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batn al-Hawa evictions\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244757\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The signed contract showing the Rajabis’ purchase of their land in Batn al-Hawa in 1966 [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Then, in 2001, the Israeli courts revived the long-dormant Benvenisti Trust, which had been created in the 19th century to manage land and property in the Batn al-Hawa area and provide homes there to Jewish Yemeni families.</p><p>The Israeli courts appointed two representatives from the settler organisation Ateret Cohanim to oversee that trust, which was historically entitled to buildings in 5.5 dunums (1.36 acres or 0.55 hectares) of land that today comprise dozens of family homes – despite the lack of any connection between these individuals and the Benvenisti Trust or the Yemeni Jewish community that had once been there.</p><p>Such court decisions have been made on the basis of Israeli laws, which allow for Jewish-owned lands vacated before and after the 1948 war to be returned to Israeli hands – regardless of any connection to the original inhabitants – following Israel’s conquests in 1967. Such rights are expressly denied to the many more Palestinians who also lost their homes in the aftermath of the wars in 1948 and 1967, including the Rajabis and other families in Batn al-Hawa.</p><p>“You’re turning these people away from our homes of 60 years because 120 years ago, their lands were ours,” remarked Zuheir Rajabi, 54, leader of the Batn al-Hawa community council, and cousin of Wa’il and Kayed. “So where are our lands, our homes in Katamon, Jaffa, Haifa, the Jewish Quarter, that we were forced to leave?”</p><p>Ateret Cohanim is one of the main Israeli organisations attempting to advance the transfer of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, replacing them with Israeli settlers. Earlier, the organisation offered to buy homes from families in this working-class neighbourhood for millions of dollars apiece. Nearly all Silwan residents refused. Then, as it fought through Israeli courts to assert control over the land and its buildings, Ateret Cohanim began sending eviction letters to families in Batn al-Hawa in 2015.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244754\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244754\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244754\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Settler-family-accompanied-by-armed-security-guard-in-batn-al-hawa-1768576521.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batn al-Hawa evictions\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A settler family is accompanied by an armed security guard in Batn al-Hawa [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"homes-for-the-poor\">Homes ‘for the poor’</h2><p>According to Aviv Tatarsky, a researcher for the Jerusalem-based Israeli nongovernment organisation Ir Amim, documents from the Benvenisti Trust stipulated that if there were no poor Jewish families in need, other poor families should reside in these lands in their stead. But “the homes [in Batn al-Hawa] are given to ideological settlers, not to Jewish families that are poor,” notes Tatarsky. “The Palestinian families who are evicted are, of course, under the poverty line. So this is a very direct, explicit contradiction to the way the trust is supposed to function.”</p><p>Official investigations concluded this year by the Israeli Registrar of Charitable Trusts into the Ateret Cohanim-controlled Benvenisti Trust found multiple irregularities, including that all financial activities were conducted via Ateret Cohanim’s bank accounts rather than the Benvenisti Trust. “It’s very clear that the trust is just a cover for the actions of the settler organisation,” says Tatarsky.</p><p>Nonetheless, Ateret Cohanim has continued its efforts, unabated, to forcibly evict the Palestinian residents of the neighbourhood. After rebuffing earlier attempts to buy them off, by Zuheir Rajabi’s account, the families in the neighbourhood have spent “hundreds of thousands of shekels” in court since 2015, attempting to reverse or at least delay eviction proceedings.</p><p>While declining to address some of the particular issues regarding Ateret Cohanim’s involvement in the properties around Batn al-Hawa, Daniel Lurie, executive director and international spokesperson for Ateret Cohanim, told Al Jazeera that the current actions in the neighbourhood are “righting an historical injustice done by barbaric violent Arabs [and the British] towards Yemenite and Sephardi Jews – who drove out the Jews from a known Jewish neighbourhood in the 1920-30s”.</p><p>“Taking hate-filled violent Arabs out of any neighbourhood [based on Supreme Court rulings] or from Israel is a good thing,” his statement said.</p><p>The entire process has now culminated in the latest court decision, which rejected the final appeals legally available for the 28 families that are now to be evicted by the start of February, including Zuheir Rajabi’s.</p><p>“We’re truly exhausted,” says Rajabi, the community representative, inside his home, which is slated for eviction in the coming days. As he speaks, his eyes dart to the video feeds of the security cameras he has installed outside his home.</p><p>“We’ve been in the courts for 12 years with no results. Anything that benefits the settlers and the extreme right wing gets implemented, but nothing [positive] happens for the Palestinian Arab citizen. It’s impossible.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244769\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244769\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244769\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Zuheir-Rajabi-outside-his-home-with-Harem-al-sharif-mural-and-al-aqsa-in-background-1768576661.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batn al-Hawa evictions\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244769\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zuheir Rajabi stands outside his home, with a view of al-Aqsa mosque in background [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"they-scatter-us-cut-us-up-like-salad-grind-us-up\">‘They scatter us, cut us up like salad, grind us up’</h2><p>Wa’il Rajabi says he does not know where his family will go when they are forcibly evicted from their home in the coming days. Few of the low-income families here do. “We will stay until our last breath, steadfast, sitting in our homes,” he says.</p><p>According to Wa’il Rajabi, who earns 9,000 shekels per month, also working for the Jerusalem municipality, rent for any available homes in East Jerusalem is a minimum 5,000 to 7,000 shekels per month, with another 1,000 shekels going towards electricity and water. “How are you going to live on 2,000, 3,000 shekels? What are you going to eat? What are you going to drink? What are you going to dress your child in? How are you going to educate him? How are you going to go to and from work? It’s unreasonable,” said Wa’il, the breadwinner for a family of nine. “They sentenced us to death.”</p><p>As the families in the neighbourhood face eviction one by one – and now at a dramatically accelerated pace – the neighbourly and family bonds are being ripped apart. “It feels like the community is ending,” says Wa’il.</p><p>“We were all together here, but now you don’t know where one lives – one is in Beit Hanina, one is in Shu’fat, one is in Ras al-Amud,” his brother, Kayed, says. “They scatter us – cut us up like salad, grind us up.”</p><p>Through this traumatic period, parents spend their nights soothing children from the nightmares they are having about violent settlers coming to throw them out of their homes.</p><p>“Sometimes I joke with them, laugh with them, tell them stories, just to make them stop being scared, to stop thinking, to ease their stress,” says Wa’il. “But deep down, I know that no matter how we finish the story, they’ll always come back to the same topic.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244736\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244736\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244736\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Joury-Rajabi-on-the-steps-leading-up-to-the-street-from-their-home-1768576392.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Batn al-Hawa evictions\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244736\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Joury Rajabi stands on the steps leading up to the street from their home in Batn al-Hawa, East Jerusalem, which her family has been ordered to leave [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>In the children’s last moments together, every second feels precious, but fragile. “I wish we could live peacefully and play like before,” laments 11-year-old Joury, Wa’il’s youngest daughter, on the family rooftop.</p><p>Out on the street one recent afternoon, one of the little girls she plays with was performing cartwheels when armed border police walked through their impromptu football game.</p><p>Moments later, a family of Israeli settlers, accompanied by armed security, passed right by them.</p><p>Joury recalls another time when the children were playing in the street and an Israeli settler started throwing garbage at them. “We defended ourselves,” she says. “The settler called the police. So since that day, we have not been able to play. If we stay there, the police will come and beat us up and humiliate us and stuff.”</p><p>The children spend these last days asking their parents the same questions:</p><p>“Why are they making us leave our homes? Where will we go?”</p><p>But their parents don’t have any answers for them.</p><p>However, in their last days together, the children snatch what time they can together on the stairs in front of Wa’il and Kayed’s home, playing football or paddle games.</p><p>“These days, sometimes, us kids have breakfast together,” says Joury. “Sometimes, we talk about growing up. Sometimes, we talk about defending each other or doing something like that. And we play when we can. We try to enjoy ourselves during these days because we will be separated from each other, from all our friends and family.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

A so-called “charter” that accompanied the letter also pointed to loftier goals, according to several reports.</p><p>In Trump’s letter to Milei, the US president said the board would seek to “solidify Peace in the Middle East”, adding that it would “embark on a bold new approach to resolving Global Conflict” at the same time.</p><p>The Financial Times, meanwhile, quoted the accompanying “charter” as saying that “the Board of Peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Durable peace requires pragmatic judgment, common sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed,” said the charter, which did not directly reference Gaza, according to the newspaper.</p><p>Two diplomatic sources also told the Reuters news agency that the invitations included a “charter” that outlined a wider mandate for the body.</p><p>“It’s a ‘Trump United Nations’ that ignores the fundamentals of the UN charter,” one diplomat aware of the ‌letter told the news agency,</p><p>A senior US official, meanwhile, told The Associated Press news agency that an expanded role for the board of peace remains “aspirational”.</p><p>The official added that Trump and his advisers believe such a role is possible, particularly as Washington and other UN members have repeatedly expressed frustration with the international organisation.</p><p>However, the official said the board of peace was not intended to replace the UN.</p><h2 id=\"gaza-focus\">Gaza focus</h2><p>To be sure, the Trump administration has so far publicly said that the board of peace will initially focus on Gaza.</p><p>On Friday, Trump announced that Tony Blair, the United Kingdom’s former prime minister, would be among the board’s founding executive members, alongside Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.</p><p>Also initially announced were Marc Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management, World Bank Group President Ajay Banga, and Robert Gabriel, a US deputy national security adviser.</p><p>Many of those figures were also named to a separate “Gaza executive board”, which is set to oversee a technocratic committee of Palestinians, named the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG). The committee is expected to handle day-to-day governance in Gaza in lieu of Hamas.</p><p>The 11-member executive board includes Blair, Kushner and Witkoff, as well as Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Hakan Fidan, Qatari diplomat Ali Al Thawadi, UN Middle East peace coordinator Sigrid Kaag, United Arab Emirates Minister of State for International Cooperation Reem Al-Hashimy, and Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay.</p><p>Beyond Argentina’s Milei and Pena, Turkiye and Egypt have confirmed their respective leaders, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, have been invited to join the wider board of peace. A European Union official said that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also been invited to represent the EU.</p><p>Four sources told Reuters that the leaders of France, Germany, ⁠Australia and Canada were also invited to sit on the board, although there was no official confirmation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The White House said it would announce more members in the coming weeks.</p><p>Still, the initial announcement of board members sparked outrage among many in the Middle East for not including any Palestinians, but instead elevating staunch supporters of Israel.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, raised opposition to the Gaza executive board on Saturday, saying its composition “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy”.</p><p>A statement from Netanyahu’s office did not specify what exactly it opposed about the board’s makeup.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bloomberg news reported on Saturday that the Trump administration is asking countries for $1 billion to say on the board of peace.</p><p>The White House responded to the report, calling it “misleading”. It said there was no minimum membership ​fee to join the board, but appeared to confirm the $1 billion fee for “permanent membership”.</p><p>“This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity,” the ‌White House said on X.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Casualty figures for both sides since the beginning of the war have been difficult to independently verify.</li>\n<li>The Russian TASS news agency reported that Russian forces have captured the settlement of Pryvillya in the Donetsk region and Pryluky in the Zaporizhia region, citing the Ministry of Defence in Moscow.</li>\n<li>The ministry said that Ukrainian forces lost about 1,305 personnel in the last 24 hours, and that Russian air defences shot down 214 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones and two long-range Neptune missiles.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Defence Ministry also said that it carried out attacks on Ukrainian energy and transportation infrastructure across 167 locations over the past 24 hours, along with deployment areas for Ukrainian forces and “ammunition depots, assembly workshops, storage sites, pre-flight preparation and launch sites for long-range unmanned aerial vehicles”.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"energy-strikes\">Energy strikes</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Russian forces continued their campaign of strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure over Saturday night, carrying out attacks in the Kyiv and Odesa regions, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy. Ukrainian authorities have characterised the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/russian-attacks-cause-energy-emergency-in-freezing-ukraine-says-zelenskyy\">Russian attacks</a> as an effort to weaponise the current cold weather, degrading the country’s energy system.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said in a post on the messaging app Telegram that more than 20 settlements in the Kyiv area were left without power as a result of the strikes.</li>\n<li>The mayor of the city of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, said that constant <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/as-russian-attacks-worsen-ukraines-energy-woes-trump-rebukes-kyiv\">Russian attacks</a> were straining the energy system of Ukraine’s second-largest city, stating the system that provides residents with essentials, such as heating and electricity, was “constantly operating at its limits”. He said that three people were injured in overnight strikes.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during an energy coordination meeting that the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia are facing the most acute energy challenges. He added that the country must <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/zelenskyy-demands-faster-energy-imports-as-ukraine-reels-from-power-outages\">increase energy imports</a> and seek additional equipment from allies.</li>\n<li>The Ukrainian news outlet Kyiv Independent reported that foreign embassies plan to stay in Kyiv despite the power outages, infrastructure issues, and predictions of extreme cold, with weather forecasts predicting temperatures as low as –20 degrees Celsius (–4 degrees Fahrenheit) later this month. The outlet reported that about 80 foreign diplomatic missions are based in Kyiv.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s HUR military intelligence body has said that Moscow is planning attacks meant to disconnect Ukraine from three nuclear power plants in the coming days.
