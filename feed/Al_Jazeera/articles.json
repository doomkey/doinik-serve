The night is chilly, and for the first time in weeks, everything is still for a moment – the Israeli settlers’ celebrations have finished for the day.</p><p>But the village of Ras Ein al-Auja, situated in the eastern West Bank’s Jericho governorate, has been all but wiped out.</p><p>The village was one of the last Palestinian herding communities in this part of the Jordan Valley, but now, the herders’ sheep have gone – most of them stolen or poisoned by settlers or sold off by villagers under pressure. Their water has been cut off – the Ras Ein spring declared off-limits by the neighbouring settlers for the past year.</p><p>And for the past two weeks, most of the community’s homes have been dismantled. Many of the families forced out have burned their furniture before they have left, not wanting to leave it for the invading settlers to use.</p><p>“By God, it’s a difficult feeling,” Ghawanmeh says. He is at a loss for words, fidgeting by the fire and at times rubbing his face in misery and exhaustion. ”Everyone left. Not one of them [remains]. They all left.”</p><p>Since the start of this year, about 450 of the 650 Palestinian inhabitants of Ras Ein al-Auja have fled their homes – for many the only place they have ever lived – because of violence by Israeli settlers.</p><p>Other than the 14 Ghawanmeh families, including a large number of children, who say they have nowhere else to go, the rest are packing up and leaving in the coming days.</p><p>This rapid displacement of hundreds of people marks the largest expulsion from a single Bedouin community as a result of Israeli settler violence in modern times – a feat that has elicited taunting celebrations by the encroaching settlers and left lives in ruins for Bedouin families now deprived of shelter, livelihoods and community.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256931\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256931\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256931\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ras-Ein-Dismantling-buildings-PC-Looking-1-1768996609.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ras Ein\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256931\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians dismantle their homes as settler violence forces them out of Ras Ein al-Auja [Courtesy of Looking the Occupation in the Eye]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"no-land-no-sheep-no-water-no-safety\">No land, no sheep, no water, no safety</h2><p>Until the New Year, the people of Ras Ein al-Auja had held out on their lands despite an onslaught of physical attacks, thefts, threats, movement restrictions and destruction of property by settlers – a state of being that is now all too common for rural Palestinian communities across the West Bank.</p><p>Settlers have been enabled by rapid growth in the number of settlement outposts springing up across the West Bank. Settlements and these outposts are illegal under international law. They are also built without the legal permission of Israeli authorities but in practice are largely tolerated and offered protection by Israeli forces, especially in recent years under the far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>International law stipulates that occupying powers like Israel must not move their own civilian populations into occupied territories, such as the West Bank, where about 700,000 settlers now reside.</p><p>In December, another 19 settler outposts built without government approval were retroactively <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/illegal-settlement-expansion-how-israel-is-redrawing-occupied-west-bank\">approved</a> by Israel’s government as official settlements. In all, the number of settlements and outposts in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem has risen by nearly 50 percent since 2022 – from 141 to 210 now.</p><p>This recent explosion of settler outposts has given way to a more recent yet even more dangerous phenomenon: <a href=\"/news/2023/6/4/better-to-die-there-palestinians-mourn-ein-samiya-eviction\">shepherding outposts</a>.</p><p>Each of these outposts mimics the Bedouins’ way of life but with settlers’ own grazing flocks. They are typically run by a single armed Israeli settler supported by several armed teenagers often funnelled in by government-funded programmes intended to support “at-risk” troubled youth.</p><p>Using animal grazing as a means to overrun Palestinian shepherds and seize their lands, such settlers had managed by April 2024 to take over about 14 percent of the West Bank, according to the Israeli NGO Kerem Navot. That figure has increased since then by at least tens of thousands of dunums (1 dunum equals 0.1 hectares and a quarter of an acre), according to Kerem Navot’s founder, Dror Etkes.</p><p>The outposts serve as a launching pad for attacks, controls on Palestinian movement and army-coordinated arrests, which have unfolded in places like Ras Ein al-Auja.</p><p>Routinely, settlers steal and poison the livestock that Palestinian shepherds, who largely inhabit these remote areas, rely on for their livelihoods. On top of this, settlers are preventing Palestinian shepherds who still have flocks from accessing the grazing lands they’ve always used. Settlers have built fences and engage in intimidation and violence, forcing Palestinians to buy expensive animal fodder to sustain their flocks instead.</p><p>Settlers also target the basic resources that Bedouin Palestinians rely on for themselves. Like most other Palestinian communities in the West Bank’s Area C, which Israel fully controls, the people of Ras Ein al-Auja are denied access to electricity by Israeli authorities. The Israeli Civil Administration, which controls zoning and planning in Area C, rarely grants permits for Palestinians to build infrastructure, including connecting to the grid or installing solar energy systems. The solar panels the villagers have put up have frequently been destroyed by settlers.</p><p>In addition, these Palestinian shepherding communities, often located in dry regions, are now <a href=\"/features/2026/1/5/israeli-settlers-consume-water-seven-times-more-than-palestinians\">denied</a> sufficient access to water, including from the lush springs found in Ras Ein al-Auja which once made this village one of the most prosperous of the shepherding communities.</p><p>“They prevented us from getting water,” Ghawanmeh says. “They prevented us from bringing the sheep to the water and getting water from the spring.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256915\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256915\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256915\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ras-Ein-Home-dismantled-except-floor-PC-Looking-1-1768996268.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ras Ein\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256915\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Palestinian home is dismantled except for the floor in Ras Ein al-Auja, nearly all of whose inhabitants have been forced out by violent Israeli settlers [Courtesy of Looking the Occupation in the Eye]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"near-total-impunity\">Near-total impunity</h2><p>Israeli settlers have also been emboldened by a wide-scale armament programme spearheaded at the start of Israel’s genocidal war in the Gaza Strip by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and the near-total impunity they enjoy when they carry out attacks. While <a href=\"/features/2025/12/24/victory-against-israeli-west-bank-settlement-offers-palestinians-some-hope\">court rulings in favour of Palestinians</a> and against settlers have occurred, they are rare.</p><p>According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 1,800 settler attacks – about five per day – were documented in 2025, resulting in casualties or property damage in about 280 communities across the West Bank, and besting the previous year’s record of settler attacks by more than 350. A total of 240 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 55 children, were killed by Israeli forces or settlers in 2025.</p><p>These unprecedented levels of settler and soldier violence alongside the wholesale deprivation of basic resources that rural Palestinians need to survive have led to the erasure of dozens of rural Palestinian communities.</p><p>In January and February 2025, the Israeli military forcibly displaced about 40,000 people from refugee camps in <a href=\"/features/2025/10/15/israeli-arson-bulldozers-and-forced-labour-in-the-west-banks-tulkarem\">Tulkarem</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/22/deadly-israeli-raid-in-jenin-leads-to-mass-displacement-destruction\">Jenin</a>, according to the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. Since the Gaza war began in October 2023, settler violence has forced out 44 Palestinian communities in the West Bank consisting of 2,701 people, nearly half of whom are minors. Thirteen more communities comprising 452 people have been partially transferred. These people end up wherever they can find a place to stay, resulting in fractured communities and families.</p><p>Such figures of displacement have not been seen in the West Bank in decades.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256943\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256943\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4256943 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ras-Ein-dismantling-building-frame-PC-Looking-1-1768996744.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C523&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ras Ein\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256943\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians take their houses apart before fleeing the village of Ras Ein al-Auja in the eastern West Bank [Courtesy of Looking the Occupation in the Eye]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"two-years-of-psychological-pressure\">‘Two years of psychological pressure’</h2><p>For 27 months, Ras Ein al-Auja has been subjected to all of these types of attacks and restrictions. In the past year, multiple Israeli shepherding outposts have sprung up at different corners of the village, which extends for 20,000 dunums (20sq km or 7.7sq miles), and have come increasingly closer to Palestinian homes.</p><p>“Two years of psychological pressure at night,” remarks an exhausted Ghawanmeh, who explains the haphazard shifts the men of his village have been taking to keep watch. “If you sleep, the settlers will burn your house.”</p><p>Under the pressure of settler attacks, poisonings and thefts, the number of sheep belonging to the community has dwindled from 24,000 to fewer than 3,000. Settler attacks and invasions have become so constant that nine solidarity activists – some progressives from Israel and others from other countries – were required to keep an around-the-clock protective presence.</p><p>Without anywhere else to go – and knowing from both settler threats and accounts from displaced relatives elsewhere that settlers would likely follow them anyway – the people of Ras Ein al-Auja had hung on by a thread.</p><p id=\"that-is-until-the-latest-settler-outpost\">That is, until the latest settler outpost.</p><p>Following a pattern seen in other now-displaced Bedouin communities like nearby Mu’arrajat, some of whose inhabitants fled to Ras Ein al-Auja, settlers began erecting outposts directly next to people’s homes at the beginning of the year – right in the middle of the community.</p><p>“Life has completely stopped ever since,” Ghawanmeh says. Families have barricaded themselves inside their houses, terrified of the settlers who now routinely graze their flocks just outside Palestinian homes.</p><p>Then, the spate of attacks this month compelled far more families to flee and take their remaining sheep with them. Almost three-quarters of the community has now gone. These families are now scattered across the West Bank although most are now in the cramped towns and cities of Area A, which makes up 18 percent of the West Bank and is administered by the Palestinian Authority.</p><p>As a result, these communities’ centuries-old traditions as Bedouins are coming to an end.</p><p>“There’s a saying among the Bedouins: ‘Upbringing outweighs origins,’” Ghawanmeh says. “It means you were raised here, you eat from the land, you drink from the land, you sleep on the land. You are from it, and it is from you.”</p><p>“To leave your house and leave your village”, he adds, “it is very, very, very difficult. But we are forced to.”</p><p>The children who remain have been left rudderless and afraid at night as they look at empty, scarred patches of land where once their friends and family lived. “Children are scared, scared that the settlers, the [settler security guards], will come,” Ghawanmeh says.</p><p>Al Jazeera requested comment from the Israeli military about the accusations made in this article and to ask for details about what action is being taken to prevent settler attacks on Palestinian communities, including Ras Ein al-Auja. We received no response.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256954\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256954\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256954\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ras-Ein-several-men-dismantling-home-PC-Looking-1-1768996809.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ras Ein\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256954\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Residents of Ras Ein al-Auja prepare to leave as Israeli settler attacks have intensified on their community, property and livestock this year [Courtesy of Looking the Occupation in the Eye]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"even-if-you-sing-for-me-until-tomorrow-i-won-t-be-happy\">‘Even if you sing for me until tomorrow, I won’t be happy’</h2><p>As the swell of violence and land thefts gives way to a steady exodus of the last remaining villagers, a couple of musicians come to provide some relief from another day of traumatic separation and displacement.</p><p>“I hope they’ll feel seen, and I hope they’ll feel happy for at least a few moments and that they can feel like children, even if it’s just for a few minutes,” says Kai Jack, a Norwegian solidarity activist and professional contrabass player.</p><p>About a dozen children huddle in plastic chairs in a tin shack that once served as the meeting place for the community’s many families to hear this rare performance. As they listen to a handful of Palestinian folk songs, the children, at first timid, relax and begin to clap and sing to staples like Wein a Ramallah (Where? To Ramallah).</p><p>For the first time in weeks, the children even manage to crack a few smiles.</p><p>And then, Jack and the accompanying violinist, Amalia Kelter Zeitlin, settle into playing the Palestinian lullaby Yamma Mawil al-Hawa (Mother, What’s with the Wind?). The children’s mothers, looking on from the sidelines, begin to softly sing along:</p><p>“My life will continue through sacrifice – for freedom.”</p><p>As the song ends, the mothers join the children in rounds of applause. “Beautiful?” Jack asks.</p><p>“Very,” replies one of the mothers who explains how she helps her child fall to sleep with this very song. “And it has been so long since they were able to [sleep well].”</p><p>As the performance ends and the children crowd around Jack’s enormous bass, a few of the remaining Ghawanmeh brothers retreat outside, their minds unable to rest as they contemplate their inevitable expulsion.</p><p>“These songs are for the children,” Naif Ghawanmeh says. “We are tired inside. Very tired.”</p><p>One of his small nephews, Ahmed, just 2 years old, begins to sing the chorus of Wein a Ramallah. For one brief moment, the atmosphere is almost festive. But while he is happy the children are relaxing, Ghawanmeh shrugs it off himself.</p><p>“By God, look at me,” he says over the fire, which is burning whatever supplies they didn’t want to leave for the settlers to take. “Even if you sing for me until tomorrow, I won’t be happy. You see, I’m tired inside. For two years, I’ve been suffering from oppression, hardship and problems day and night from the settlers.</p><p>“I’m tired inside.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p><strong>Dhaka, Bangladesh –</strong> The fast-paced, rhythm-driven song’s lyrics could come across as commentary about life in rural Bangladesh.</p><p>“The days of boat, the sheaf of paddy and the plough have ended; the scales will now build Bangladesh”, the words go.</p><p>In reality, though, the song is a political anthem supportive of Bangladesh’s Jamaat-e-Islami party that went viral on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok in early November.</p><p>It speaks of the symbols of parties that have governed Bangladesh that it argues Bangladeshis now want to reject: The boat is the symbol of the Awami League (AL) of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted by a student-led uprising in August 2024; the sheaf of paddy is the symbol of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); and the plough, the election symbol of the Jatiya Party, a former ally of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League, founded by a military ruler in the 1980s.</p><p>The Jamaat’s symbol is scales.</p><p>On February 12, the country is scheduled to vote in what is shaping up to be a direct contest between the BNP and a Jamaat-led alliance. On-the-ground campaigning starts on Thursday, January 22. But online, parties have been battling it out for months, trying to attract Gen Z voters who played a key role in overthrowing Hasina, and now could play a pivotal role in determining who forms the next government.</p><p>The pro-Jamaat song’s online popularity, for instance, sparked a frenzied race among parties to launch songs in an election climate when mass rallies are no longer the only way to reach millions of voters: Social media is often as powerful a tool.</p><p>HAL Banna, a London-based filmmaker who composed and sang the pro-Jamaat song, told Al Jazeera it was initially produced for a single candidate in Dhaka. “When people started sharing it, other candidates realised it connected with ordinary voters and began using it,” he said.</p><p>The BNP came up with its campaign song, its lyrics suggesting that the party – only marginally ahead of the Jamaat in opinion polls – puts the country before itself. “Amar agey amra, amader agey desh; khomotar agey jonota, shobar agey Bangladesh [Us before ourselves, the country before us; people before power, Bangladesh above all],” the song says.</p><p>The National Citizen Party, formed by students at the forefront of the anti-Hasina protests in 2024, also came up with its song that went viral.</p><p>But music has been only one part of a wider digital push.</p><p>Short, dramatised videos, emotional voter interviews, policy explainers and satire have also flooded social media.</p><p>This year, the online war is bigger than a parliamentary contest alone.</p><p>On February 12, voters will also decide on a referendum on the July National Charter, a reform package the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus says must be endorsed to institutionalise changes in the state institutions introduced after the 2024 July uprising.</p><h2 id=\"why-online-matters\">Why online matters</h2><p>According to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, Bangladesh had about 130 million internet users as of November 2025, accounting for roughly 74 percent of its estimated 176 million population.</p><p>According to a report released in late 2025 by DataReportal, a global digital research and analytics platform report, the country has approximately 64 million Facebook users, nearly 50 million YouTube users, 9.15 million Instagram users and more than 56 million TikTok users aged 18 and above. X, by contrast, has a relatively small footprint with about 1.79 million users.</p><p>That digital reach, say analysts, helps explain why political parties are investing heavily in online narratives.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4259091\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4259091\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4259091\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25345466759430-1769060287.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4259091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man gets a haircut in a salon where a television broadcasts Bangladesh’s Chief Election Commissioner A.M.M. Nasir Uddin’s address to the nation, in Dhaka [Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>Election Commission data show that 43.56 percent of voters are aged between 18 and 37, many of them first-time voters or young Bangladeshis who effectively felt disenfranchised under Hasina. National elections in 2013, 2018 and 2024 were marred with irregularities, crackdowns on opposition leaders and activists, and boycotts that turned them into sham votes. That experience has turned frustration into determination to participate in the upcoming vote, say analysts.</p><h2 id=\"digital-strategies\">Digital strategies</h2><p>Bangladeshi authorities have banned the Awami League from political activities, including participation in the February elections.</p><p>That has turned the elections into a bipolar competition.</p><p>On one side is a BNP-led alliance, which presents itself as the experienced governing alternative to the Awami League’s excesses – Hasina’s government was accused of mass killings, forced disappearances and corruption. The BNP ruled Bangladesh between 1991 and 1996, and then again between 2001 and 2006.</p><p>On the other side is a Jamaat-led alliance, which includes the NCP.</p><p>Mahdi Amin, a BNP leader, told Al Jazeera that the party is focusing on distributing policy proposals and collecting voter feedback. “BNP remains a political party with a track record of governing the country. We have specific plans in every sector,” he said.</p><p>To drive online engagement, the BNP has launched websites such as MatchMyPolicy.com, where voters can register agreement or disagreement with policy proposals the party says it would implement if elected.</p><p>Like the BNP, the Jamaat-e-Islami has also launched a website – janatarishtehar.org – that it has said is aimed in part at seeking the opinion of voters to prepare the party’s election manifesto.</p><p>Jubaer Ahmed, a Jamaat leader, said that the party’s online efforts were focused on sharing “the narratives we believe in”. Asked about other parties and their efforts, Ahmed said: “We observe others, but we don’t follow. Our competition will be intellectual.”</p><h2 id=\"is-anyone-winning-the-online-battle\">Is anyone winning the online battle?</h2><p>Analysts caution against declaring a clear victor.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, an adjunct fellow at Western Sydney University’s Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative, pointed to apparently different areas of focus in the two campaigns’ strategies.</p><p>Hasan said BNP’s online content often packages its key pledges into short, captioned videos and shareable cards. For instance, some posts promote a proposed “Family Card” scheme under which 5 million women and households would receive 2,000–2,500 taka ($16-20) a month or essential goods if the BNP is elected. Other clips and graphics talk of a “Farmer Card” plan, promising fair prices for fertilisers, seeds and pesticides, plus incentives, easier loans and insurance coverage for farmers.</p><p>On the other hand, he argued, pro-Jamaat online content often focuses on attacking the BNP as “no different” to the Awami League.</p><p>Qadaruddin Shishir, editor of the fact-check outlet The Dissent, said that Jamaat-aligned online campaigns also seek to tap into anti-India messaging: Hasina is in exile in India after fleeing in August 2024, and New Delhi has refused to send her back despite multiple requests from Dhaka.</p><p>“These themes increasingly circulate beyond Jamaat’s base, including among young users, through memes and copied formats,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4259086\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4259086\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4259086\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24249502624720-1769059917.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4259086\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students and other activists carry Bangladesh’s national flag during a protest march organized by Students Against Discrimination to mark one month since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down after a mass uprising, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on September 5, 2024 [Rajib Dhar/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"referendum-goes-viral-too\">Referendum goes viral, too</h2><p>This year, the online battle is not limited to party-versus-party competition. It also centres on a state-backed referendum on a set of broad-based reforms outlined in what has come to be known as the July Charter – named after the uprising that led to Hasina’s removal.</p><p>Bangladesh’s interim government has launched a digital campaign in favour of a ‘Yes’ vote, using official websites and social media platforms. Interim leader Yunus’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam told Al Jazeera the strategy reflects a media landscape where traditional outlets have steadily lost reach.</p><p>“Legacy media is being used less and less,” Alam said, adding that online campaigning was necessary to secure public approval to institutionalise the reforms.</p><p>The charter proposes limits on prime ministerial power, stronger checks on security forces, and safeguards to prevent election manipulation. It also calls for judicial independence and constitutional reforms aimed at stopping the return of authoritarian rule.</p><p>The NCP, which emerged from the July uprising, has also campaigned online for a ‘Yes’ vote in the referendum.</p><p>To be sure, said analysts and content creators, offline campaigning remains critical. HAL Banna, composer of the pro-Jamaat song that set off the trend of viral campaign songs online this election season, said physical campaigning still has no match when it comes to “reach and impact”.</p><p>But, he said, “online campaigns set discussion topics among people offline”. With an electorate as young as Bangladesh’s, that can be the difference between winning and losing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its administration and enforcement is lawful,” he added. “What we’ve been concerned with, as a council, is the enforcement tactics that ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Dion expressed optimism that ICE would adopt a more tailored approach to apprehending local suspects.</p><p>While the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, has seen nearly 2,000 immigration officers flood its streets, the mayor predicted that Maine would not see the same “massing of federal agents”.</p><p>“We’re seeing very individualised activity by ICE. A person here, a neighbourhood there,” he said. “Their conduct, at least as it is current in Maine, seems to be focused, which would indicate to me – and this is the speculation – that they’re functioning on the basis of an actual court warrant.”</p><p>That, he said, marked a departure from the “random, show-me-your-papers kind of experience” that residents had experienced in Minnesota.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258906\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258906\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4258906\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26020860789940-1769044646.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A memorial for Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4258906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Well-wishers on January 20 visit a makeshift memorial for Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis [Angelina Katsanis/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"outrage-at-ice-operations\">Outrage at ICE operations</h2><p>Still, while Dion advocated for a wait-and-see approach to the ICE operation, other city officials took a harder stance.</p><p>One Portland city councillor,  Wesley Pelletier, described the unfolding raids as part of “an agenda of white nationalism and might makes right”.</p><p>“This is a war of terror that’s being waged on our city by the federal government,” Pelletier said. “We’ve seen people of all ages getting thrown on the ground and getting thrown into trucks.”</p><p>So far, Fox News quoted ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde as saying the agency had made 50 arrests so far as part of operation “Catch of the Day”. Hyde added that ICE had identified nearly 1,400 individuals to detain in Maine.</p><p>Wednesday’s statement from the Department of Homeland Security highlighted four arrests as examples, showing people from Sudan, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Angola.</p><p>It described the four individuals as “the worst of the worst” and accused them of crimes ranging from aggravated assault to endangering the welfare of a child, though it was unclear in one case if the accusation had resulted in a conviction.</p><p>“We are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,” McLaughlin said in the statement.</p><p>But Democratic officials in the state suggested that the Trump administration had refused to coordinate in the lead-up to “Catch of the Day”, heightening anxiety on the local level.</p><p>On January 14, nearly a week before the operation was launched, Governor Mills posted on social media that she had “attempted, unsuccessfully thus far, to confirm” the upcoming surge in federal immigration enforcement.</p><p>In a video statement, she said the state had reached out to local governments in Portland and Lewiston to prepare. She added that she too felt “angry” about the expected surge.</p><p>“Our goal, as always, will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said.</p><p>“To the federal government, I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused. Those tactics are not welcome here to the people of Maine.”</p><p>She also took a jab at the trend of federal agents using masks and other facial coverings to conceal their identities.</p><p>“Look, Maine knows what good law enforcement looks like because our law enforcement are held to high professional standards,” Mills said. “They are accountable to the law. And I’ll tell you this: They don’t wear a mask to shield their identities, and they don’t arrest people in order to fill a quota.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258904\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258904\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4258904\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26021661845569-1769044429.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Janet Mills\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4258904\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Democratic Governor Janet Mills has openly opposed Trump administration policies [File: Robert F Bukaty/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-political-rivalry\">A political rivalry</h2><p>Mills and Trump have long been political adversaries, with their feud erupting in a public forum.

I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a really easy one. And enjoy your life after, governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics,” he said.</p><p>The interaction made national news and cemented the frosty relationship between the two leaders, with Trump demanding an apology and slamming the Democratic governor for months afterwards.</p><p>His administration also took a series of escalating actions designed to target Mills, including launching an education probe in her state, suspending a marine research grant and freezing other federal funds to Maine.</p><p>In response to this week’s ICE deployment, Mills issued a short statement acknowledging the Trump administration’s latest efforts.</p><p>“Together, we will continue to place the safety and civil rights of Maine people above all else, and remain vigilant in our defense of due process and the rule of law,” she <a href=\"https://x.com/JanetMillsforME/status/2014129811023696338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>Maine is set to hold its next gubernatorial race in 2026, as part of the year’s midterm election cycle.</p><p>Having served two terms as governor, Mills is not eligible for re-election and will instead be making a run for the US Senate, challenging Republican incumbent Susan Collins.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This enormous, unsecured island is actually part of North America. That’s our territory,” he said.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256655 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND-Countries-in-the-Arctic-Circle-JAN-21-2026-1768987632.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GREENLAND - Countries in the Arctic Circle - JAN 21, 2026-1768987632\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Trump proceeded to assert that no nation other than the US can secure Greenland, and that it was therefore essential for European leaders to turn the self-governing island over to US control.</p><p>“I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said.</p><p>He proceeded to describe the NATO alliance as a money sink for the US, one that failed to offer the country any benefits.</p><p>“We never asked for anything, and we never got anything,” Trump said.</p><p>The president’s remarks failed to acknowledge NATO’s assistance after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when the US invoked the alliance’s collective defence clause and member states sent military air defence in response.</p><p>Still, Trump continued to portray NATO as a moot investment, one that would not yield benefits unless forced.</p><p>“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won’t do that,” he said.</p><p>“That’s probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”</p><p>Earlier this month, White House officials said Trump was considering “a range of options” for acquiring Greenland, including military action. At Davos, Trump again issued a warning to Denmark, setting an ultimatum to hand over Greenland.</p><p>“We’ve never asked for anything else. And we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn’t. So they have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember,” he said.</p><p>Hours later, the US president announced the “framework” for a Greenland deal, though it is unclear to what extent Denmark or Greenland had input or what the deal might look like.</p><p>Rutte later told Fox News that the issue of Greenland’s sovereignty did not come up in their conversation.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258194\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258194\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4258194\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty_6971317c13-1769025916.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"NUUK, GREENLAND - JANUARY 21: Residential houses stand next to fjord on January 21, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland.

And when America booms, the entire world booms. It’s been the history,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"367\" data-end=\"497\">“When it goes bad, it goes bad,” he added. “You all follow us down, and you follow us up. And we’re at a point that we’ve never – I don’t believe we’ve ever been. I never thought we could do it this quickly.”</p><p data-start=\"499\" data-end=\"722\">Trump, who returned to the White House for a second term in 2025, said he had expected economic improvements to take longer.</p><p data-start=\"724\" data-end=\"788\">“My biggest surprise is I thought it would take more than a year, maybe like a year and one month. But it’s happened very quickly.”</p><p data-start=\"790\" data-end=\"921\">He then turned his attention to Europe, offering a bleak assessment of the continent’s trajectory. Trump blamed the continent’s challenges on policies related to green energy and migration, without providing evidence to support the claim.</p><p data-start=\"923\" data-end=\"1021\">“Certain places in Europe are not recognisable, frankly, any more. They’re not recognisable,” Trump said, echoing anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p><p data-start=\"1023\" data-end=\"1113\">“I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258397\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258397\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4258397 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-21T151927Z_1505331004_RC2R5JAFUD0U_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-TRUMP-1769028490.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"US President Donald Trump \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4258397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump gestures during the 56th annual World Economic Forum [Jonathan Ernst/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"tariffs-and-the-trade-deficit\">Tariffs and the trade deficit</h2><p data-start=\"332\" data-end=\"522\">Defending his prolific use of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, Trump credited the measures with chipping away at the US’s trade deficit and boosting domestic production.</p><p data-start=\"524\" data-end=\"741\">“With tariffs, we’ve radically reduced our ballooning trade deficit, which was the largest in world history. We were losing more than $1 trillion every single year, and it was just wasted. It was going to waste,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"743\" data-end=\"1128\">“But in one year, I slashed our monthly trade deficit by a staggering 77 percent. And all of this with no inflation, something everyone said could not be done,” he added.</p><p data-start=\"1130\" data-end=\"1265\">Trump also pointed to what he described as gains in exports, manufacturing and industrial capacity as evidence of the policy’s success.</p><p data-start=\"1774\" data-end=\"2042\">“During the process, we’ve made historic trade deals with partners covering 40 percent of all US trade, some of the greatest companies and countries in the world. We have countries as our partners, too. The European nations, Japan, South Korea, they’re our partners,” he said.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"trump-on-venezuela-going-to-do-fantastically-well\">Trump on Venezuela: ‘Going to do fantastically well’</h2><p data-start=\"219\" data-end=\"495\">Speaking about Venezuela’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/why-access-to-venezuelas-heavy-oil-is-tremendous-news-for-us-refiners\">economy and oil sector</a>, Trump said the country had suffered a sharp decline because of past policies under socialist leaders like Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez.</p><p data-start=\"219\" data-end=\"495\">But he forecast that the South American country is now poised for a rapid turnaround, driven in part by cooperation with the US and international energy companies.</p><p data-start=\"219\" data-end=\"495\">Trump has taken an active interest in Venezuela’s governance since a January 3 military operation to <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/5/live-venezuelas-maduro-to-appear-in-court-trump-threatens-more-strikes\">abduct Maduro</a> and transport him to the US to face criminal charges. He has since confirmed that the US has extracted 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela following Maduro’s ouster.</p><p data-start=\"497\" data-end=\"609\">“Venezuela has been an amazing place for so many years, but then they went bad with their policies,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"611\" data-end=\"841\">“Twenty years ago, it was a great country, and now it’s got problems. But we’re helping them. And those 50 million barrels, we’re going to be splitting up with them, and they’ll be making more money than they’ve made in a long time.”</p><p data-start=\"611\" data-end=\"841\">Trump proceeded to praise the interim government of President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s former vice president, for cooperating with his ambitions in Venezuela.</p><p data-start=\"973\" data-end=\"1217\">“Venezuela is going to do fantastically well,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"973\" data-end=\"1217\">“We appreciate all of the cooperation we’ve been given. We’ve been given great cooperation. Once the attack ended, the attack ended, and they said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’ More people should do that.”</p><p></p><p data-start=\"1219\" data-end=\"1365\">He went on to predict a dramatic economic recovery for the oil-rich nation, citing renewed foreign investment and support from major energy firms.</p><p data-start=\"1367\" data-end=\"1641\">“Venezuela is going to make more money in the next six months than they’ve made in the last 20 years,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"1367\" data-end=\"1641\">“Every major oil company is coming in with us. It’s amazing. It’s a beautiful thing to see. The leadership of the country has been very good. They’ve been very, very smart.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3925817\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INTERACTIVE-Venezuela-oil-fields-and-pipelines-1756997792.png?quality=80\" alt=\"oil\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"onto-the-topic-of-energy\">Onto the topic of energy</h2><p data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"286\">Trump then turned to energy policy, highlighting a shift in his stance on nuclear power and reiterating his longstanding criticism of renewable energy.</p><p data-start=\"288\" data-end=\"509\">“We’re going heavy into nuclear. I was not a big fan because I didn’t like the risk, the danger, but the progress they’ve made with nuclear is unbelievable, and the safety progress they’ve made is incredible,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">“We’re very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.”</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">His statements follow a news release from the US Department of Energy on Tuesday that announced Trump would be “unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance” by expanding infrastructure to create such energy.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">Trump has also grown his personal business ties with private nuclear power firms. In December, the Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump is the majority owner, announced a $6bn merger with TAE Technologies, a fusion energy company.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">While Trump has warmed to nuclear power, he doubled down on his opposition to green energy initiatives designed to combat climate change. Calling such efforts the “Green New Scam” – his spin on the “Green New Deal” – he blamed Europe’s economic wobbles on efforts to embrace renewable technology.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"621\">“There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place, and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,” he told his audience at Davos.</p><h2 id=\"canada-should-be-grateful\">‘Canada should be grateful’</h2><p data-start=\"79\" data-end=\"222\">From his podium, Trump also responded to Tuesday’s remarks from Canadian <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/rupture-in-the-world-order-speeches-by-carney-world-leaders-at-davos\">Prime Minister Mark Carney</a>.</p><p data-start=\"79\" data-end=\"222\">The leader of Canada’s Liberal Party, Carney had encouraged world leaders to prepare for a future without US leadership and warned that the “great powers” of the world appeared to be abandoning “even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power”.</p><p data-start=\"79\" data-end=\"222\">While Carney did not explicitly mention Trump, it was clear his remarks were aimed at the US leader. Trump replied more directly during his turn at the Davos podium.</p><p data-start=\"229\" data-end=\"283\">“Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,” Trump said.</p><p data-start=\"290\" data-end=\"510\">“They should be grateful. But they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-says-he-is-meeting-zelenskyy\">Trump says he is meeting Zelenskyy</h2><p>Trump also spoke about the war in Ukraine, and his efforts to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>“I’m dealing with President Putin, and he wants to make a deal,” Trump said.</p><p>“I believe I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy, and I think he wants to make a deal. I’m meeting him today. He might be in the audience right now.”</p><p>A post on Zelenskyy’s social media account, however, showed the Ukrainian leader at his presidential office in Kyiv on Wednesday, holding a meeting on the energy situation following Russian strikes. His office confirmed he is in Ukraine, not at Davos.</p><p>Still, Trump insisted that he would help navigate Ukraine and Russia to an end to their war, which began nearly four years ago in February 2022.</p><p>“They’ve got to get that war stopped. Because too many people are dying, needlessly dying. Too many souls are being lost. It’s the only reason I’m interested in doing it. But in doing it, I’m helping Europe. I’m helping NATO,” he said.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"those-beautiful-sunglasses\">‘Those beautiful sunglasses’</h2><p>At one point in his meandering speech, Trump stopped to poke fun at French President Emmanuel Macron, mocking the aviator sunglasses he wore to Davos.</p><p>“I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?” Trump asked.</p><p>Macron’s office said the choice to wear sunglasses during his speech, which took place indoors, was to protect his eyes because of a burst blood vessel.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4256725\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4256725\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4256725\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-20T155101Z_1849653387_RC215JAXVF57_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-1768989838.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"France's President Emmanuel Macron attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4256725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">France’s President Emmanuel Macron attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum [Denis Balibouse/Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Ten percent caps would save borrowers about $100bn a year, according to a 2025 report from Vanderbilt University.</p><p>“One of the biggest barriers to saving for a down payment has been surging credit card debt,” Trump said.</p><p>The comments mark a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in Washington.</p><h2 id=\"an-unlikely-alliance\">An unlikely alliance</h2><p>Progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren, a ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said last week in an interview with CNBC that the president called her to discuss the possibility of working together on the proposal.</p><p>“Great, let’s get something done,” Warren said in the interview.</p><p>Trump’s comments echo an existing bill authored by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which also caps interest rates at 10 percent, but would last for a longer period of time and sunset in 2031. The bill, however, has been sitting stagnant in Congress. It was most recently referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in early February 2025.</p><p>The interest rate cap push comes as an increasing number of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of the US economy. A Wall Street Journal poll released earlier this month found that 54 percent disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy, a sentiment echoed by a recent CNN poll that found that 63 percent disapprove.</p><p>“I think we should test it,” Dimon said. “The government can do it, they should force all the banks to do it in two states, Vermont and Massachusetts [where Sanders and Warren represent], and see what happens.”</p><p>“People crying the most will not be the credit card companies. It will be the restaurants, retailers, travel companies, the schools, the municipalities, because people will miss their water payments, this payment and that payment,” Dimon said.</p><p>“President Trump is generating a lot of headlines from his credit card interest rate idea, but we’re still waiting for him to generate savings for real people. Last week, he said interest rates would be capped by January 20; this week, he says he needs help from Congress. I think it remains to be seen whether he’s serious about delivering on his promise,” Julie Margetta Morgan, president of economic think tank The Century Foundation, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"political-hurdles\">Political hurdles</h2><p>Banking executives like Dimon and Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser have said there are slim chances of this getting passed by Congress.</p><p>Beyond support from Trump and progressive Democrats, the bill will run into hurdles in Congress. Earlier this month, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the proposal could have “negative secondary effects”.</p><p>“The president is asking Congress to pass legislation, so he’s not going to try to personally set credit rates. That makes it highly unlikely we’ll see a 10 percent cap put in place anytime soon,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management. “It does give him an opportunity to point the finger at Congress if it doesn’t happen.”</p><p>On Wall Street, credit card company and bank stocks are fairly mixed on the heels of Dimon’s comments. Mastercard is down by 1.1 percent as is Visa by 1.7 percent. American Express, on the other hand, is up 1.9 percent since the market opened on Wednesday.</p><p>Bank stocks are trending upwards. Bank of America is up 0.5 percent, Wells Fargo by 0.1 percent and Citigroup by 1.2 percent in midday trading. JPMorgan Chase stock is about even on the day.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And the US has long-established laws and norms to protect the rights of journalists to report on sensitive topics from whistleblower sources.</p><p>But on January 14, the administration of President Donald Trump carried out a search warrant targeting Natanson’s home. Over the past year, she has been reporting on changes to the federal government under Trump, with 1,169 new sources reaching out to her with material.</p><p>The Justice Department has argued that the search warrant was necessary to collect information regarding Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, a government contractor who was arrested on January 8 for allegedly removing classified documents.</p><p>The sweep of Natanson’s home, however, resulted in the removal of her work computer, her Post-issued cellphone, her personal MacBook Pro, a one-terabyte hard drive, a voice recorder and a Garmin watch.</p><p>In court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.588772/gov.uscourts.vaed.588772.9.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filings</a> opposing the seizure, lawyers argued that Natanson’s electronics contained “years of information about past and current confidential sources and other unpublished newsgathering materials, including those she was using for current reporting”.</p><p>“Almost none of the seized data is even potentially responsive to the warrant, which seeks only records received from or relating to a single government contractor,” the complaint argues.</p><p>The complaint added that the six devices seized contained many terabytes of data, spanning her journalism career.</p><p>“Natanson’s devices contain essentially her entire professional universe: more than 30,000 Post emails from the last year alone,” it says.</p><p>The Post has sued the Justice Department for the return of the materials, and that case is slated to be heard before a federal court in Virginia.</p><p>“The outrageous seizure of our reporter’s confidential newsgathering materials chills speech, cripples reporting, and inflicts irreparable harm every day the government keeps its hands on these materials,” the newspaper wrote in a statement.</p><p>“We have asked the court to order the immediate return of all seized materials and prevent their use. Anything less would license future newsroom raids and normalize censorship by search warrant.”</p><p>The Trump administration has faced scrutiny for its combative approach to the media, and critics have accused it of seeking to erode the right to free speech, whether in newspapers or through legal protest.</p><p>Trump and his allies, however, have said they remain committed to ferreting out “leakers” in the government who release confidential material to the media.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi, for instance, accused Natanson of “reporting classified and illegally leaked information”.</p><p>“The leaker is currently behind bars,” she wrote in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2011456849711612019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>, referring to Perez-Lugones.</p><p>“The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation’s national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.”</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that stance, warning that the Trump administration would reserve the right to pursue legal action against anyone it believed to be engaging in illegal practices.</p><p>“The administration is not going to tolerate leaks, especially from within the national security apparatus of the United States government that put our nation’s integrity and our national security at risk, full stop,” she said.</p><p>“Legal action will be taken against anyone, whether it’s a member of the press or whether it’s an employee for a federal agency, who breaks the law.”</p><p>The First Amendment of the US Constitution declares that the government can make no law “abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press”.</p><p>Over the decades, the Supreme Court has ruled that the government may curtail the media when faced with a “clear and present danger”, but that the burden falls on the authorities to prove such a danger exists.</p><p>The Washington Post was involved in one of the cases that upheld that standard, New York Times v United States in 1971.</p><p>That case saw the administration of Republican Richard Nixon seek to stop the Times and the Post from publishing classified materials known as the Pentagon Papers – but the Supreme Court determined that their publication amounted to protected speech.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He warned that the new tax would remain in place until the country showed “a real commitment to jointly confronting drug-trafficking and illegal mining at the border”.</p><p>“We have made genuine efforts to cooperate with Colombia, even while facing a trade deficit exceeding $1bn annually,” Noboa wrote.</p><p>“But while we have insisted on dialogue, our military continues to confront criminal groups linked to drug trafficking at the border without any cooperation from Colombia.

But the tight relations have also bolstered Trump’s efforts to expand US authority throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Twice over the past year, Noboa has hosted Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem: once in July and a second time before the November ballot referendum.</p><p>“Ecuador has been an excellent partner to the U.S. in our work to stop illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and smugglers on land and on the seas,” Noem <a href=\"https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1986537214294302765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> at the time.</p><p>Trump has made tariffs a hallmark of his second term in office, calling the term “the most beautiful word” in the dictionary. Since returning to the White House in January 2025, he has enacted a sweeping tariff campaign, which includes a baseline tariff of 10 percent on nearly all trading partners and additional individualised tariffs for certain countries.</p><p>Trump has argued that tariffs protect domestic industries while feeding government coffers. He has also used the economic penalty as a means of forcing trading partners to submit to policy demands.</p><p>Last year, for instance, Trump threatened the US’s neighbours, Mexico and Canada, with tariff hikes if they failed to adequately combat drug smuggling and cross-border immigration.</p><p>His administration has similarly imposed a tariff on China to incentivise the country to staunch the flow of fentanyl.</p><p>But critics have questioned the legality of Trump’s tariff campaign and its coercive nature. Economists have also warned that the tax hikes on imports could result in higher consumer prices domestically.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4258209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4258209\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4258209\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25349828664417-1769026036.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gustavo Petro speaks to police in uniform\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4258209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President Gustavo Petro delivers a speech during a police ceremony in Bogota, Colombia, on December 15, 2025 [Fernando Vergara/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fraying-relations-with-petro\">Fraying relations with Petro</h2><p>For his part, Noboa appears to be using the threat of tariffs not only to force compliance with Ecuador’s crime crackdown but also to strike back at Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro.</p><p>A former rebel fighter, Petro was elected in 2022 as his country’s first left-wing president. But he has faced criticism, both domestically and abroad, about his efforts to combat drug trafficking.</p><p>Colombia remains the world’s largest producer of cocaine. In a 2024 report, the United Nations said the country had seen 10 consecutive years of rising production potential. Nearly 253,000 hectares (645,000 acres) in the country were dedicated to the cultivation of coca leaves, the raw ingredient in cocaine.</p><p>Complicating efforts is a six-decade-long internal conflict in Colombia. The slow-simmering conflict has long pitted government forces, right-wing paramilitaries, left-wing rebels and criminal networks against each other.</p><p>Since taking office, Petro has departed from the heavy-handed crackdowns of his right-wing predecessors, instead opting for a “Total Peace” plan that involves dialogue with armed rebels and criminal groups.</p><p>His administration has also overseen a shift away from the forced eradication of coca crops, largely grown by impoverished rural farmers. Instead, it has pursued a strategy of voluntary crop substitution, while attacking the laboratories and facilities that process the leaf into drugs.</p><p>Petro has claimed his strategy has resulted in the destruction of nearly <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1995948716440821836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18,400</a> drug-making labs. In addition, last November, his administration claimed to have made Colombia’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/colombia-hails-historic-blow-after-largest-cocaine-bust-in-a-decade\">largest drug bust</a> in a decade, seizing 14 tonnes of cocaine.</p><p>But right-wing figures like Trump have called for “<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/presidential-determination-on-major-drug-transit-or-major-illicit-drug-producing-countries-for-fiscal-year-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more aggressive action</a>” from Colombia.

His election was buoyed, in part, by a pledge to tamp down on Ecuador’s burgeoning crime crisis.</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Ecuador has shed its reputation as an “island of peace” in Latin America, as criminal activity spiked.</p><p>That trend coincided with a steep rise in murders. As of 2024, the think tank Insight Crime found that Ecuador had a homicide rate of 44.6 for every 100,000 people, the highest proportion of any South American country. A total of 7,062 homicides were reported that year.</p><p>Experts say the crime wave reflects, in part, Ecuador’s strategic position between Colombia and Peru, the world’s second-largest cocaine producer.</p><p>But the timing of Noboa’s tariffs has raised questions about the president’s motives — and whether he was strictly focused on crime, rather than politics.</p><p>On Tuesday, one day before the new tariffs were unveiled, Petro <a href=\"http://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2013731006914666929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on social media a message in support of Ecuador’s former Vice President Jorge Glas, a left-wing figure.</p><p>In 2024, Noboa had authorised a controversial raid on Mexico’s embassy in Quito to arrest Glas on bribery charges. Glas currently resides in a maximum security prison, and Petro has accused the Ecuadorian government of using “psychological torture” against the former politician.</p><p>“Just as I demanded the release of political prisoners in Venezuela and Nicaragua, I believe Jorge Glass should be released,” Petro wrote on Tuesday.</p><p>The Glas case has been a source of ongoing tension between Petro and Noboa, leading some critics to speculate whether the tariffs were, in part, a response to Tuesday’s post.</p><p>Ecuador and Colombia are among each other’s top trading partners, and the new taxes are likely to spur questions about the future of regional trade agreements.</p></div></div></body></html>"
