Israel says its military onslaught was in response to the Hamas-led attacks that left at least 1,139 people dead in Israel, but rights groups have slammed its scorched earth tactics in Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"1201\" data-end=\"1385\">Starmer emphasised that the recognition of Palestine has long been a part of Labour Party policy and forms a central pillar of a broader peace initiative that the government has been developing over time.</p><p data-start=\"621\" data-end=\"1016\">“As our election manifesto said, Palestinian statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people. It is not in the gift of any neighbour and is also essential to the long-term security of Israel,” a statement issued by the prime minister’s office said.</p><p data-start=\"621\" data-end=\"1016\">“We are committed to recognising a Palestinian state as a contribution to a renewed peace process which results in a two-state solution, with a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state.”</p><h2 id=\"what-specific-conditions-did-starmer-set-for-recognising-palestine\">What specific conditions did Starmer set for recognising Palestine?</h2><p>Starmer laid out a series of conditions he said Israel must fulfil if it wishes the UK not to recognise Palestinian statehood, which include:</p><ul>\n<li>Take substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza</li>\n<li>Agree to a ceasefire</li>\n<li>Commit to a long-term, sustainable peace, reviving the prospect of a two-state solution</li>\n<li>Allow the UN to restart the supply of aid</li>\n<li>Make clear there will be no annexations in the West Bank.</li>\n</ul><p>The prime minister also reiterated the demands that remain in place for Hamas, which are:</p><ul>\n<li>Release all captives</li>\n<li>Sign up to a ceasefire</li>\n<li>Commit to disarmament</li>\n<li>Acknowledge that they will play no part in the government of Gaza.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The UK government will assess the extent to which the two parties, Israel and Hamas, have met its conditions before taking a call in September.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-recognising-palestine-as-a-state-mean-and-which-other-countries-have-done-so\">What does recognising Palestine as a state mean, and which other countries have done so?</h2><p>As of now, the State of Palestine is recognised as a sovereign nation by 147 of the 193 UN member states, about 75 percent of the international community.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Three other European countries, Spain, Ireland, and Norway, officially recognised Palestine last year.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">France will recognise a Palestinian state during the UNGA in September.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"205\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">According to experts, the recognition may have limited practical effect, but diplomatically, it could be significant, potentially pressuring the US, one of Israel’s main backers, to reconsider its stance.</p><p data-start=\"126\" data-end=\"401\">“Even if this is not a big step in the humanitarian sense – if you are starving in Gaza, these words of diplomats and politicians maybe don’t matter that much – but diplomatically, this is massive. And what really struck me was the specificity of Starmer’s demands,” William Lawrence, a former US diplomat, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"403\" data-end=\"735\">“And if the whole world, all turn to Trump with that sort of specific outline and common cause, it will have an effect on Trump. All of this matters, even if it doesn’t fix the problem instantaneously. Everyone is moving in the right direction now, both in terms of pressuring Israel and in terms of pressuring the United States,” Lawrence added.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"is-the-uk-really-preparing-to-recognise-palestine-and-why-now\">Is the UK really preparing to recognise Palestine, and why now?</h2><p id=\"according-to-al-jazeera-s-milena-veselinovic-starmer-is-currently-under-significant-pressure\">According to Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic, Starmer is currently under significant pressure.</p><p>“He is under a lot of pressure, domestically, here from the public, as well as from his own members of parliament to make some move on this issue; people have been moved by those images of people starving in the last few days,” Veselinovic said while reporting from London.</p><p>Last week, 221 members of parliament from nine political parties signed a letter addressed to Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy, urging them to recognise a Palestinian state. That number has since risen to 255.</p><p></p><p>Veselinovic added that the UK is not promising to recognise a Palestinian state.</p><p>“[This is not] like when the French President Macron said he will do that, he will recognise the Palestine state in September, this is a way of pressure that the UK government is hoping to apply on the Israeli government to try to improve the conditions on the ground in Gaza,” she added.</p><h2 id=\"will-it-have-any-practical-effect-on-the-situation-in-gaza\">Will it have any practical effect on the situation in Gaza?</h2><p>Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, said the move will hopefully “affect the situation on the ground” and lead to a ceasefire in Gaza.</p><p>The world had seen “the most horrific scenes” in Gaza and the time had come to “abate the suffering of the Palestinian people”, he said speaking at the UN.</p><p>Scepticism, however, remains high as some question the sincerity behind recent announcements.</p><p data-start=\"316\" data-end=\"624\">Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Bishara said leaders, including Starmer and Macron, continue to support Israel in its war on Gaza.</p><p data-start=\"316\" data-end=\"624\">“We need to see some measures being taken other than just lofty rhetoric, because they are in no position to be talking about peace and justice when they are accomplices in genocide,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"1696\" data-end=\"2261\">Bishara also criticised the lack of specifics from the two leaders when they announced their plans to recognise a Palestinian state.</p><p data-start=\"1696\" data-end=\"2261\">“Is it a state in 10 percent of the West Bank? Or is it a state on all territories occupied in 1967 – including East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza – as contiguous sovereign territories?” he added.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-israel-responded\">How has Israel responded?</h2><p>“Starmer rewards Hamas’s monstrous terrorism &amp; punishes its victims,” Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on X.</p><p>Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said the UK move “harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages”, adding that Starmer’s announcement followed “the French move and internal political pressures”.</p><p>France became the first G7 member to announce its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, with President Macron describing the decision as part of the country’s “historical commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

While guidance varies by country and according to the severity of the incident, it is generally good practice to move inland or to higher ground.</p><p>It is also important to avoid beaches, harbours and coastal roads. If people find themselves on a boat, it’s crucial to follow official maritime guidance, as it can sometimes be safer to stay at sea. Listening to local authorities via radio, phone alerts or sirens is key.</p><p>Low-lying areas should be avoided until officials declare them safe; multiple waves can occur hours apart. People who feel a strong earthquake and are near the coast should evacuate immediately.</p><p>If possible, it’s important to help others, especially the elderly, children and people with disabilities. Guidance states to stay away from rivers and estuaries, as tsunamis can travel upstream. Finally, it’s good to remain calm and to prioritise safety over material possessions.</p><h2 id=\"when-and-where-did-the-quake-strike\">When and where did the quake strike?</h2><p>The earthquake, which struck at 8:25am Japan time (11:25 GMT), was the strongest in the Russian region since 1952, according to the Russian Academy of Sciences, and struck at a depth of 19.3km (12 miles). The shallow earthquake damaged buildings and injured several people in the remote Russian region.</p><p>At a magnitude of 8.8, it is believed to be the sixth strongest earthquake in history. A 2010 earthquake in Chile, the last quake recorded at 8.8, killed 523 people and destroyed more than 370,000 homes.</p><p>The quake was centred 119 km (74 miles) east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.</p><p>A resident in the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky told Reuters news agency that the earthquake rumbled for several minutes. “I decided to leave the building,” said Yaroslav, 25. “It felt like the walls could collapse any moment. The shaking lasted continuously for at least three minutes,” he was quoted as saying.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On July 10, Thanos Plevris, the Greek minister for migration, announced new legislation that would effectively deny asylum to those who reach the Greek shores following a treacherous journey through the Mediterranean from Africa. “Greece will not tolerate the uncontrolled entry of thousands of irregular migrants from North Africa,” Plevris said during an interview. Reactions against Greece’s new legislation were immediate: Human rights organisations described it as illegal and called for its withdrawal. The Plenary of Greek Bar Associations emphasised that denying the right to asylum is a violation of international and EU legislation.</p><p>On the same day, but on the other side of the continent, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined a “ground-breaking deal” with France, which he said would target small boats and smuggling gangs and send “a clear message that these life-threatening journeys are pointless”. The UK-France deal has been criticised by all sides of the political spectrum. Organisations such as Doctors Without Borders called it “reckless”, “ill-fated” and “dangerous”, while the Migrants’ Rights Network emphasised that the new agreement will not prevent people from trying to cross to the UK.</p><p>Greece and the UK’s new plans to curb migration are set to fail, and the reason is simple: migration deterrence does not work.</p><p>A decade ago, in the summer of 2015, the European Union faced a crisis it did not expect and for which it had not prepared. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS), Syria’s brutal civil war and instability in Afghanistan led thousands of people to seek safety and security in the European Union. The “long summer of migration” marked the beginning of the so-called refugee crisis in the EU. Yet the EU did not have a clear plan; the European Agenda for Migration, which had been agreed upon in May 2015, had not yet been tested.</p><p>Today, the narrative of a crisis continues to shape migration policy across Europe. In Greece, it has served to justify restrictive deterrence measures since 2015, making new crackdowns unsurprising. For Greece’s neoliberal government, migration is a blemish on the narrative of its economic success. In the UK, it is used to fuel far-right sentiment. In both cases, migration policy is crafted not only to deter arrivals but also to satisfy domestic political demands.</p><p>Neither migration plan should be viewed in isolation from the rise of the far right across the continent. The adoption of far-right rhetoric surrounding the illegalisation of migrants has been used in both countries to justify inhumane policies. The justification for Greece’s new policy centres on a questionable narrative of an “invasion” from Africa – a trope the Migration Minister has invoked repeatedly. For Greece’s minister of migration, the Greek border, and by extension the European border, must be reinforced so that only “real refugees” can enjoy the benefits of European protection. For the British government, small boats have the power to “undermine [the country’s] border security”, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, and should therefore be prevented from entering.</p><p>Although each migration plan is the product of different political processes in Greece, the EU and the UK, their design and the narratives used to justify them are similar in several ways. They both conceptualise the migrant and the border in similar terms. For each state, the migrant is seen as a threat to the border, and the border is viewed as in need of protection. The migrant who reaches each country’s shores is criminalised, and the term “illegal migrant” has gained prominence among government officials. The border, in turn, is seen as a security mechanism that must be defended against those trying to reach it. Together, these approaches create an “us versus them” narrative of division. Migrants are reduced to their migratory identity; they are seen as a mass, and their individual experiences no longer matter. As such, migrants become worthy or unworthy of international protection, desirable or undesirable to the Western nation-state. Only those perceived as “real refugees” are deemed deserving of international protection. The “undesirables” are turned into nothing and are expelled by the border. As a result, a narrative of fear is promoted and a crisis is manufactured.</p><p>Although the events at the European border became known as a “refugee crisis”, they were, in fact, a crisis of the European border.</p><p>During the border crisis, the European border regime emerged stronger than ever before, and the EU’s neoliberal imagination of a borderless world collapsed. Walls were erected throughout the continent, new border technologies were deployed to deter and expel the “undesirables”, and pushbacks, human rights violations and violence were normalised. Death continues to loom over the European continent’s borders. The UK-France deal may have been described as ground-breaking, but the EU-Turkiye deal in 2016 paved the way for such “swap” policies. These agreements fail. The EU-Turkiye deal may have reduced the number of people crossing the Aegean Sea in the short term; however, it did not stop them. Instead, it shifted migratory routes, opened new ones, and made migratory journeys more complicated and dangerous.</p><p>The reason for their failure is simple: human movement cannot be controlled. Arguably, it can be prevented or delayed, but it cannot be stopped.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>These policies are rooted in racism and are deliberately designed to create division. Their main aim is to separate human beings and determine who is worthy of living in safety and who should be expelled from Western territory. They should not be viewed in isolation from the EU’s and the UK’s colonial and capitalist pasts. At the same time, the spectacle of the border is fully staged: It produces the illusion of control over a manufactured crisis that cannot truly be controlled. In reality, the essence of migration deterrence is not to succeed but to convince citizens that it is necessary.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The United States, which designated ADF/IS-CA a “terror” organisation in 2021, describes it as “one of the most lethal terrorist groups in Africa” based on the number of civilian deaths linked to its members.</p><p>An earlier reprisal assault by the ADF between July 8 and 9 saw 41 civilians killed in Irumu territory, Ituri, according to MONUSCO. In May, it was North Kivu’s Babili sector that was attacked, with 18 civilians killed. The group also claimed a separate attack in January on the town of Lubero in North Kivu, with 41 people killed and 11 kidnapped.</p><h2 id=\"multiple-armed-groups-in-the-eastern-drc\">Multiple armed groups in the eastern DRC</h2><p>The ADF is one of a multitude of armed groups – some experts say about 100 – operating in the mineral-rich but poorly governed eastern DRC. The region is one of the most complex conflict zones in the world.</p><p>ADF’s attacks in July came as the DRC was enjoying some relief from the M23 rebels, arguably the strongest of all the armed groups. M23, the UN says, is <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/un-experts-cast-blame-on-rwanda-and-uganda-what-are-they-doing-in-drc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backed by Rwanda</a>. Aiming to take power in Kinshasa, it launched lightning offensives in January and seized vast swaths of territory in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu. Thousands died and hundreds of thousands were displaced in the six-month war. In July, the US and Qatar brokered DRC peace efforts with Rwanda and M23, respectively, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/19/dr-congo-m23-rebels-sign-deal-in-qatar-to-end-fighting-in-eastern-congo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leading to a ceasefire.</a></p><p>Minde of the ISS said the ADF is likely taking advantage of the military resources diverted to confront M23, resulting in more frequent attacks since January.</p><p>“Strategically, this allows them to freely move in Ituri and North Kivu while attention remains fixed on the M23 conflict,” he said. The group’s focus on rural communities, Minde added, was to foster fear and dependence, facilitate control over land and illicit resources, and to find more recruits.</p><p>Combined, M23 and the ADF have wrought the most havoc in eastern DRC, with some research suggesting that there might have been a non-aggression pact between the two at some point. The Armed Conflict and Location Event Data Project (ACLED) noted in a June report that M23 and ADF/IS-CA action between January and March 2025 killed 1,600 people, making that quarter the deadliest since 2002, when the DRC was in the throes of a civil war.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3750867\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3750867\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3750867\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/getty_683f17da44-1748965338.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"M23 rebels guard a unit of surrendering Congolese military troops.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3750867\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">M23 rebels guard a unit of surrendering Congolese military soldiers who were to be recruited into the rebel group in Bukavu in February [File: Hugh Kinsella Cunningham/Getty]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"uganda-s-stakes-in-the-adf-battle\">Uganda’s stakes in the ADF battle</h2><p>Uganda poses the main challenge to the ADF. Some 2,000-4,000 Ugandan soldiers have deployed in the DRC since November 2021, where they lead Operation Shujaa, which also involves the Congolese army and MONUSCO forces. Kampala’s decision to deploy followed a series of bomb attacks in Uganda that year. Since 2021, two leaders of separate ADF factions – Salim Mohammed and Benjamin Kisokeranio – have been captured.</p><p>However, there are concerns that <a href=\"/news/2025/6/17/are-commercial-interests-driving-ugandas-military-operations-in-dr-congo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uganda is expanding</a> into territory not affected by ADF attacks. Due to the DRC’s civil war history, which saw countries neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda take over Congolese territory and reportedly steal minerals, foreign armies on DRC soil remain a testy subject in Kinshasa.</p><p>In June, the Ugandan army spokesperson, Felix Kulayigye, defended his government’s stance while speaking to Al Jazeera, admitting that the country needed to protect commercial interests in the DRC. Uganda exports goods like palm oil, cement, and refined petroleum to the DRC, and is Kinshasa’s biggest trading partner in the sub-region.</p><p>“Who is consuming Uganda’s products?” Kulayigye asked Al Jazeera at the time. “Can commerce take place where there is instability? If we have commercial interests in eastern DRC, are those protectable or not?”</p><p>Already, Uganda has a negative reputation in the DRC. Kampala allegedly backed the M23 armed group by allowing the group passage into Congolese territory, according to a UN expert group report. President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda’s Paul Kagame are longtime allies. Back in 2022, the Ugandan army chief General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also President Museveni’s son, openly expressed support for M23 on the social media site, X.</p><p>The ADF’s increasing attacks could lead to rising insecurity in the fragile DRC, and across the sub-region, Minde of ISS said.</p><p>“[ADF] might want to take advantage of the pacifist moment following the US and Qatar-brokered peace deal, to remind the world of its existence,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>From the Baltic states to the Black Sea, Central and Eastern European (CEE) governments remain anxious about their security in the face of Russian aggression. Despite NATO’s enduring pledge to Article 5, many officials in countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Romania continue to express concern over a potential US shift in focus towards Asia‑Pacific and the Middle East, creating fears of weakening American vigilance in Europe. This anxiety has heightened in light of Russia’s steady military rebuilding and escalating hybrid threats targeting critical infrastructure across the region.</p><p>To be clear, President Trump has long criticised NATO members for failing to hit defence spending targets and has even suggested the US might withhold protection from countries that do not meet the 2 percent of GDP target. In response, the June 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague marked a turning point: all member states agreed to raise combined defence and related spending to 5 percent of GDP by 2035, including 3.5 percent for core military capabilities and 1.5 percent for broader security measures such as logistics, cyber resilience and support for Ukraine, which was viewed as an “ironclad” commitment to NATO Article 5 and a pledge of continued backing for Ukraine.</p><p>For all the robust signalling, however, the agreement’s gradual timeline – 2035, with a review in 2029 – and its flexible accounting, where spending on Ukraine aid, infrastructure upgrades and cyber projects all count, leave the Eastern flank states uneasy because timely implementation will be essential for credibly deterring Russia.</p><p>Moreover, tensions over US-EU burden sharing remain, as shown recently when, during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump announced that the US would send Patriot air defence systems to Europe “for Ukraine” but insisted that European allies foot the bill by donating the interceptor missiles themselves.</p><p>The breakdown in diplomatic decorum with European partners has been on display for a while, notably during the March Signalgate incident in which Trump’s Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called Europe “pathetic” and suggested European NATO states were “freeloading”, and during the infamous February diplomatic debacle when Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was publicly humiliated during a joint White House news conference with Trump.</p><p>Yet despite the turbulence, CEE capitals cannot afford the luxury of disengagement from the second Trump administration. Indeed, the volatility reinforces the need for these states to remain actively engaged and push for better outcomes. This is for several reasons.</p><p>First, the US military presence has long served as the cornerstone of regional deterrence against Russian expansionism. Even as Washington’s commitment to European security appears uncertain, CEE’s security architecture has been fundamentally anchored in US guarantees since the end of the Cold War. The traumatic historical experience of Western abandonment during critical 20th-century junctures, such as the 1938 Munich Agreement, when Czechoslovakia was handed over to Nazi Germany by Western powers, has left a deep-seated awareness that diplomatic decoupling from Washington often correlates with heightened vulnerability along NATO’s eastern flank. This is why Poland and the Baltic states (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) have for years hosted US troops and air defence systems, alongside NATO battlegroups. NATO’s eastern flank countries have routinely cautioned that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, “they are next.”</p><p>This concern is particularly acute in light of the Trump administration’s active push to broker a flash ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine, reportedly involving territorial concessions to Moscow. President Trump has made clear he wants to be remembered as “a peacemaker and unifier”, a theme he emphasised again in his second inaugural address. His advisers have floated frameworks that would freeze the conflict along current front lines, potentially recognise Russian control over Crimea and parts of Donbas, and block Ukraine’s NATO aspirations. But Ukrainians are not seeking peace at any price, nor should the Europeans. Any deal that cedes Ukrainian territory or is seen as legitimising Russian aggression risks emboldening the Kremlin, weakening NATO’s credibility and undermining Europe’s long-term security architecture.</p><p>Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale incursion, the Kremlin has repeatedly tested NATO’s Article 5 resolve through various provocations along the eastern flank, including airspace violations and missile incidents. For example, in February 2024, Estonia was subjected to electronic warfare from Russian territory that disrupted GPS signals across its eastern border regions, affecting both civilian infrastructure and military communications systems. One month later, a Russian cruise missile entered Polish airspace for 39 seconds before returning to Ukrainian territory. Moreover, in August 2023, Russian fighter jets conducted aggressive intercepts of NATO surveillance aircraft over the Baltic Sea, coming within dangerous proximity and executing unpredictable manoeuvres that risked mid-air collisions.</p><p>Such a status quo can deteriorate quickly should Putin’s aggression, under a Trump-brokered deal, enable Russia to carve out a piece of Ukraine or achieve troop disengagement from Eastern Europe. Russia may also continue its military buildup after the war stops, buying time for later aggressions and compounding the challenge for CEE and Europe.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Against this backdrop, CEE leaders would do well to pursue a dual-track strategy, despite the volatility of current US foreign policy.</p><p>First, the region’s engineering workforce and industrial might have an outsized role to play in rearming Europe in the face of US disengagement and Europe’s stepped-up defence pledges, particularly in partnership with Germany. In Germany, this shift of actively repurposing idle civilian manufacturing facilities into military production hubs is already firmly under way. Its defence firms have been actively converting shuttered or underperforming automotive facilities, such as those in Berlin and Neuss, and rail plants in Gorlitz, to produce Leopard tanks, Puma IFVs and artillery systems, into hybrid military production hubs. This industrial push is enabled by Germany’s domestic reforms, notably Berlin approving a sweeping defence procurement law that simplifies contracting, raises tender thresholds and fast-tracks construction for military infrastructure.</p><p>Such deliberate reallocating of resources from beleaguered civilian industries toward military industrial output holds clear implications for allied production networks in CEE. In addition, CEE countries have been ramping up their own heavy manufacturing capacity, with Poland and Slovakia stepping up joint production of artillery and armoured vehicles, and Czechia’s Czechoslovak Group surging to the forefront of Europe’s munitions supply chain, with a 4-billion-euro ($4.6bn) revenue spike and an 11-billion-euro ($12.7bn) order book anchored in Ukraine bound exports.</p><p>The CEE region, with its faltering car manufacturing competitiveness now worsened by Trump car tariffs, needs to latch onto this opportunity to tackle both its security and economic imperatives. In doing so, it can benefit from the 800-billion-euro ($921.8bn) defence mobilisation plan, coupled with its proposal for 150 billion euros ($172.8bn) in EU-backed loans, approved in Brussels on March 6.</p><p>Second, hedging against US security disengagement through the combination of strategic industrial repositioning and European solidarity must be complemented by persistent efforts to secure better outcomes through diplomatic channels with Washington.</p><p>This remains necessary even as ideological alignment frays, because transactional partnerships can still deliver meaningful security benefits. To that end, the region can leverage some of its unique strategic assets, including Poland’s substantial arms purchases from US manufacturers, Romania’s critical Black Sea security infrastructure and the Baltic states’ sophisticated cybersecurity capabilities, with an administration that prizes transactional diplomacy.</p><p>The path forward requires setting aside both illusions and grievances at a time when security guarantees must be earned rather than assumed. In this emerging reality, Eastern European nations can meaningfully partake in rearming Europe while demonstrating their value as partners, as they navigate the shifting fault lines of post-American Europe.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
