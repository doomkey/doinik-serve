But his three young daughters shook with fear, worried that Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza – which was supposed to have been suspended after the introduction of a ceasefire in October – had returned.</p><p>Israel has repeatedly attacked Gaza since that ceasefire began, accusing the Palestinian group Hamas of ceasefire violations. Hamas denies that, and Palestinians point out that it is Israel that has used overwhelming force since the ceasefire began, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/israel-has-violated-gaza-truce-nearly-500-times-in-44-days-killed-hundreds\">violating it</a> 500 times, and killing more than 342 civilians, including <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/at-least-67-palestinian-children-killed-in-gaza-since-ceasefire-began-un\">67 children</a>.</p><p>The five killed in Gaza City’s al-Abbas area, where Faiq lives, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/violence-never-ended-israeli-attacks-kill-nearly-two-dozen-in-gaza\">were among 24 killed</a> on Saturday across the Gaza Strip by Israel.</p><p>“This is a nightmare, not a ceasefire,” Faiq said. “In a single moment after some calm, life turns as if it’s a war again.”</p><p>“You see body parts, smoke, shattered glass, killed people, ambulances.

He described losing 30 members of his extended family in February 2024, including his parents and his brother’s children, after an Israeli strike on a house they were all staying in. The strike severely injured his wife, forcing doctors to amputate one of her fingers.</p><p>“My mother and father were killed, my brother’s son, my aunt, my cousins … the whole family was gone,” Faiq recalled.</p><p>Faiq has since moved his family across Gaza City and to central Gaza to escape Israeli forces, all in search of “a safety that doesn’t exist”, as he puts it.</p><p>Since October, he has been trying to adapt to what he calls “the so-called ceasefire”, but says there is still no safety.</p><p>“Every few days, there’s a wave of bombardment and targeted strikes, and everything is turned upside down without warning.”</p><p>“We are exhausted,” he added. “Life in Gaza is 99 percent dead, and the ceasefire was just 1 percent of an attempt to revive it. But we have lost hope in everything.”</p><p>Faiq used to work with his father in the clothing trade, but the war has meant that they have lost everything. He can’t reach his home, which is inside what Israel terms the “yellow line”, under total Israeli control, with access for Palestinians heavily restricted.</p><p>“There’s no construction there, no work, no infrastructure, no life, and no safety,” Faiq said. “So, where is the end of the war?”</p><p>“Today I just sit at home 24 hours a day, and there’s no sign of life,” he added. “We’re surviving on bitterness … We’re not just frustrated. We’re in a catastrophe. Let us live … let us reopen our shops … reopen the crossings … let us live our lives.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4131363\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4131363\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4131363\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/873A8149-1764111919.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Man stands in front of blue tarp\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4131363\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinian political analyst Ahed Farwana says that Israel wants the state of limbo in Gaza to continue [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"no-second-phase\">No second phase</h2><p>The question of what comes next in Gaza continues to be endlessly debated, both inside and outside of the Palestinian enclave.</p><p>United States President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\">20-point </a><span><a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/heres-the-full-text-of-trumps-20-point-plan-to-end-israels-war-on-gaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plan</a> for</span> Gaza now calls for a transitional technocratic government, made up of “qualified Palestinians and international experts”, all under the supervision of an international “board of peace”, to be headed by Trump himself.</p><p>The plan also talks about an economic development strategy and an international stabilisation force, all designed to signal that stability and progress are on the cards for Gaza.</p><p>But the details are still unclear, particularly as the US and Israel reject any future role for Hamas, and the sheer amount of devastation left behind by Israel in Gaza, meaning that a rebuild of the territory will take years.</p><p>Israel itself is also unwilling to fully commit to an end to the war, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under pressure from his far-right political allies.</p><p>Ahed Farwana, a Palestinian political analyst and a specialist in Israeli affairs, believes that Israel wants the current state of limbo in Gaza to continue and avoid moving on to the reconstruction of the Strip.</p><p>“The Israeli occupation is working to entrench a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/despite-ceasefires-in-gaza-and-lebanon-the-war-isnt-over-for-netanyahu\">situation similar</a> to what is happening in southern Lebanon by escalating matters every now and then and through continuous assassinations,” said Farwana.</p><p>Israel agreed to a ceasefire with the Lebanese group Hezbollah in November 2024 after a one-year conflict that saw most of the latter’s leadership killed. However, since then, Israel has continued to periodically attack Lebanon, including on Sunday, when a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel\">Hezbollah military commander</a> was killed in Beirut, and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/israeli-attack-on-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon-kills-at-least-13\">at least 13 people</a> were killed in an attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon on November 18.</p><p>Farwana believes that Israeli attacks in Gaza are not merely a military tactic, but part of a long-term vision to perpetuate chaos and avoid any upcoming political obligations.</p><p>“Netanyahu does not want to move to the second phase,” the analyst told Al Jazeera, referring to the next phase of the ceasefire, where sensitive topics such as the reconstruction and administration of Gaza would be addressed. Instead, he thinks that Israel plans to expand the area under its control “to seize as much land as possible from the Gaza Strip so that it has the upper hand in any future arrangements” for the enclave.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4131379\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4131379\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4131379\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/873A8132-1764112674.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Woman collects water from a tank\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4131379\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Raghda Obeid spends her days searching for food and water for her family [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"internal-motives\">Internal motives</h2><p>Many observers believe that Netanyahu’s desire to avoid moving forward with the ceasefire deal is partly the result of domestic political calculations.</p><p>With Israeli politics divided more by whether a politician’s stance is for or against Netanyahu, rather than left or right, the prime minister knows that a fall from power could spell the end of his political career and lead to investigations into his role in the failures that allowed for the October 7 attack. He currently faces multiple trials for corruption, a legal process that would likely speed up should he lose the upcoming elections, expected sometime before October 2026.</p><p>But despite the Netanyahu government’s evasion tactics when it comes to the ceasefire, Farwana says it is unlikely that the scale of Israel’s attacks in Gaza will return to what they were before the implementation of the agreement.</p><p>“There are significant pressures, especially from the US administration,” said Farwana. “Donald Trump wants his plan – the so-called [board of peace], stability forces, and other components – to succeed.”</p><p>“The situation will remain limited to expanding the yellow zone and to ongoing targeted attacks every now and then. It may expand gradually, but not to the point of returning to square one.” But that state of limbo, Farwana said, means that the people of Gaza will ultimately not be able to feel “any real calm”.</p><p>It is a situation Raghda Obeid, a 32-year-old mother of four, knows all too well.</p><p>She has already been through endless cycles of displacement, and her home in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City is completely destroyed. Now, what terrifies her the most is that the war will return.</p><p>Raghda is currently living with her family in a tent in western Gaza City. An Israeli strike hit the area last week.</p><p>“The moment of the last strike was terrifying, just like the first day of the war,” Raghda said, recounting how her children were terrified. “We could see the smoke from afar, people were running and screaming in the streets, carrying the killed and their torn bodies.”</p><p>“I was also terrified. I’m an adult, and I was scared. I said, ‘That’s it, the war is back, and it’s our turn now,'” she added with a sad smile.</p><p>Like most of the population of Gaza, Raghda and her family are at the mercy of aid organisations, relying on them for food, with few opportunities for work available.</p><p>The reality is that they will be living in a tent for the foreseeable future, including during the winter, and the harsh weather it will bring.</p><p>Each day, Raghda and her husband’s mission is to find food and fetch water. Their children run from place to place looking for a community kitchen to secure a meal.</p><p>“I don’t know what is expected of us. It’s been more than two years, and we are entering the third, displaced and broken like this. Isn’t there any solution for us?”</p><p>“We have no income,” Raghda said. “Our life is nonexistent. We live off the community kitchen and water. Our life is a war without an actual war.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It claimed that these boats were involved in drug trafficking, but authorities have released no evidence showing narcotics were present, and legal scholars argue that even if drugs were found, the attacks would likely still violate international law.</p><p data-start=\"1019\" data-end=\"1321\">The US military footprint in the region is now the largest it has been in decades, with roughly 15,000 US personnel stationed across the Caribbean.</p><p data-start=\"1643\" data-end=\"1729\">Trump has repeatedly insisted he is not seeking to topple the Venezuelan government.</p><p data-start=\"1731\" data-end=\"2062\">Still, recent developments have heightened concerns about potential US intervention. On Saturday, the Reuters news agency reported – citing four US officials – that Washington was preparing to enter a new phase of operations related to Venezuela, and two of those officials said the options included attempting to overthrow Maduro.</p><p data-start=\"2064\" data-end=\"2310\">Last month, Trump authorised the CIA to conduct <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/trump-seems-to-confirm-report-that-he-greenlit-cia-operations-in-venezuela?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">covert operations</a> in Venezuela.

Cartel de los Soles is a term that Venezuelans use to describe high-level corruption by the country’s senior officials and leaders, but it isn’t an organised cartel, per se.</p><p data-start=\"2654\" data-end=\"2760\">Trump told advisers on Monday that he intends to speak directly with Maduro at a date yet to be announced.</p><h2 id=\"a-caribbean-tour\">A Caribbean tour</h2><p data-start=\"2792\" data-end=\"2903\">Amid the soaring tensions, top US military officials began a tour of the Caribbean this week, meeting with leaders in the region.</p><p data-start=\"2905\" data-end=\"3303\">Dan Caine, the top US military officer, travelled to Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday for talks with Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar. According to a summary released by Caine’s office, the two reaffirmed bilateral ties and “exchanged views on challenges affecting the Caribbean region, including the destabilizing effects of illicit narcotics … and transnational criminal organization activities”.</p><p data-start=\"3305\" data-end=\"3503\">Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also assured Persad-Bissessar of Washington’s commitment to “address shared threats and deepen collaboration across the Caribbean”, the Pentagon said.</p><p data-start=\"3505\" data-end=\"3587\">He began his tour of the Caribbean on Monday with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/top-us-military-adviser-tours-caribbean-as-pressure-on-venezuela-deepens\">a stop in Puerto Rico</a>, where he met US troops.</p><p data-start=\"3589\" data-end=\"3940\">Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to continue the diplomatic push on Wednesday in Santo Domingo, where he will meet Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader and Defence Minister Carlos Antonio Fernandez Onofre.

Persad-Bissessar, however, has openly supported the attacks.</p><p data-start=\"4142\" data-end=\"4377\">In early September, she said she had no sympathy for drug traffickers, declaring that “the US military should kill them all violently”.

And that decision will be made by the career agents and analysts here at the FBI.”</p><p>In the video, lawmakers said they needed troops to “stand up for our laws … our Constitution”. Kelly, who was a fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut and then retiring at the rank of captain, told troops that “you can refuse illegal orders”.</p><p>The lawmakers did not mention specific circumstances in the video.</p><p>At an event in Michigan on Tuesday, Slotkin pointed to the Trump administration ordering the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, which officials accuse of ferrying drugs, and continued attempts at deploying National Guard troops into US cities despite some legal setbacks.</p><p>“It wasn’t that there was any one incident; it was the sheer number of people coming to us and saying, ‘I’m worried. I am being sent to Washington’ or ‘I’m being sent to LA or Chicago, North Carolina now, and I’m concerned I’m going to be asked to do something that I don’t know if I should do,'” said Slotkin. “So that’s where it came from.”</p><p>Troops, especially uniformed commanders, do have specific obligations to reject orders that are unlawful, if they make that determination.</p><p>Broad legal precedence also holds that just following orders, colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defence”, as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler, does not absolve troops of responsibility.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Building on that sense of momentum, Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, who led negotiations in Geneva, told US news website Axios that the security guarantees Ukraine was seeking looked “very solid”.</p><p>Speaking at the White House, Trump conceded that resolving the Ukraine war was “not easy”, but added, “We’re getting close to a deal.”</p><p>“I thought that would be an easier [deal], but I think we’re making progress,” he said.</p><p>Taking to his Truth Social platform later on, he said that he would send envoy Steve Witkoff to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to iron out “a few” remaining differences over the deal.</p><p>He said he hoped to meet “soon” with Putin and Zelenskyy, “but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages”.</p><p>Russia, which had hammered Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with a deadly barrage of missiles the previous night, seemed unconvinced of progress.</p><p>Russia has not yet seen the modified plan, which remains unpublished, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov underlined that it should reflect the “spirit and letter” of an understanding reached between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at their Alaska summit earlier this year.</p><p>“If the spirit and letter of Anchorage is erased in terms of the key understandings we have established, then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation [for Russia],” Lavrov warned.</p><p>Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said there was a lot of “uncertainty” at the Kremlin, though there had allegedly been “behind-the-scenes interactions” between Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US counterpart Steve Witkoff, “who reportedly worked on the initial stage” of Trump’s plan.</p><p>The Russian side, she said, was not happy about revisions to the peace plan.</p><p>“Unlike the initial American plan presented by Donald Trump, which consisted of 28 points, the so-called European version doesn’t include withdrawing the Ukrainian armed forces from Donbas, it allows Kyiv to join NATO, and it doesn’t limit the size of its armed forces,” Shapovalova said.</p><p>Still, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll had earlier emerged upbeat from meeting with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, with his spokesman saying: “The talks are going well and we remain optimistic.”</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X that there were “a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States”.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said it was “unclear when those talks will happen, who will be involved, and what they will look like”. But, she added, it was clear they would not be imminent, given the upcoming American Thanksgiving holiday on November 27.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"macron-urges-pressure-on-putin\">Macron urges ‘pressure’ on Putin</h2><p>As the US strained to bridge the gap between Ukraine and Russia, leaders in the coalition of the willing, who have pledged to underwrite and guarantee any ceasefire, moved fast on security guarantees and a reconstruction plan for Ukraine.</p><p>In the video meeting, co-chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with Zelenskyy and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in attendance, the leaders decided to set up a task force between the US and coalition countries to “solidify” security guarantees.</p><p>Trump has not committed to providing back-up for a post-ceasefire “reassurance force” for Ukraine. The plan for the force involves European allies training Ukrainian troops and providing sea and air support, but would be reliant on US military muscle to work.</p><p>Speaking after the video call, Macron said discussions in Geneva had shown that there should be no limitations to the Ukrainian army, contrary to what had been outlined in the initial draft of the US plan.</p><p>He also said a decision on using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction, at the heart of a political and legal impasse in a Europe seeking funding for Ukraine, would be “finalised in the coming days” with the European Commission.</p><p>Western countries froze approximately $300bn in Russian assets in 2022, mostly in Belgium, but there has been no consensus on how to proceed. Some support seizing the assets, while others, like Belgium, remain cautious owing to legal concerns.</p><p>According to reports, Trump’s plan would split the assets between reconstruction and US-Russia investments.</p><p>Macron hit out at Russia, saying “continued pressure” should be put on Moscow to negotiate. “On the ground, the reality is quite the opposite of a willingness for peace,” he said, alluding to Russia’s overnight attacks on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, which left seven dead and disrupted power and heating systems.</p><p>In his daily evening address, Zelenskyy said: “What is especially cynical is that Russia carried out such strikes while talks are under way on how to end the war”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
