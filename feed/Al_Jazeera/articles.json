has kicked off his inaugural visit to China with a focus on resetting trade relations and deepening cooperation.</p><p>Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday, Merz told Chinese Premier Li Qiang that Germany sought to build on the decades-old economic ties with China, while emphasising the need to ensure fair cooperation and open communication.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“We have very specific concerns regarding our ⁠cooperation, which we want to improve and make fair,” said Merz, in an acknowledgement of the strain faced by Germany’s manufacturing sector from Chinese competition.</p><p>Li, who met Merz shortly after his arrival in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, called on both sides to work together to safeguard multilateralism and free trade, in a reference to US President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/1/in-the-wake-of-new-tariffs-how-are-us-china-trade-talks-going\">tariff policy</a> that has upended the global trading system.</p><p>“China and Germany, as two of the world’s largest economies and major countries with important ‌influence, should strengthen our confidence in cooperation, jointly safeguard multilateralism and free trade, and strive to build a more just and fair global governance system,” Li said.</p><p>During the meeting, representatives from both sides signed several agreements and memorandums, including on climate change and food security.</p><p>“We share responsibility in the world, and we should live up to that responsibility together,” Merz said, adding there was “great potential for further growth”.</p><p>He added that open channels of communication were essential, as he announced visits by several ministers in the months ahead.</p><h2 id=\"more-equal-playing-field-sought\">‘More equal playing field’ sought</h2><p>Reporting from Beijing, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said the visit, in which Merz was being accompanied by a large delegation of German business executives, was important for both Europe’s economic powerhouse and the world’s second-largest economy.</p><p>Alongside the signing of deals with Chinese companies, a key focus of Merz’s visit would be “looking for a more equal playing field when it comes to trade”, he said.</p><p>“There is a real concern in markets like the European Union about cheaper, sometimes subsidised Chinese products that are looking for markets other than the US, suddenly flooding other marketplaces such as Germany … undercutting many domestic manufacturers there,” he said.</p><p>Germany’s imports from China increased 8.8 percent to 170.6 billion euros ($201bn) last year, while its exports to China dropped 9.7 percent to 81.3 billion euros ($96bn).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>McBride noted Beijing was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/china-pitches-itself-as-a-reliable-partner-as-trump-alienates-us-allies\">seeking to pitch itself</a> as a “responsible advocate of free trade compared to the sometimes unpredictable and chaotic tariffing policy of the US”.</p><p>He said the visit would also see Merz attend a banquet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and visits to German companies with strongly established presences in China, such as Siemens and Mercedes-Benz.</p><p>Geopolitics and human rights would also be on the table, he said, with Germany particularly concerned about Beijing’s support, tacit or otherwise, for <a href=\"/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/\">Russia amid its war on Ukraine</a>.</p><h2 id=\"western-leaders-court-beijing\">Western leaders court Beijing</h2><p>Merz is the latest in a string of Western leaders to <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/18/calculated-hypocrisy-why-western-powers-court-beijing-but-rely-on-us\">visit Beijing</a> in recent months, including the UK’s Keir Starmer, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Canada’s Mark Carney, amid the fallout from Trump’s tariffs on long-established trade relationships.</p><p>The chancellor said on Friday he was going to Beijing in part because export-dependent Germany needs “economic relations all over the world”.</p><p>“But we should be under no illusions,” he said, adding that China, as a rival to the United States, now “claims the right to define a new multilateral order according to its own rules.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Earlier this month, SAF asserted that it had succeeded in breaking through the siege of the city.</p><p>In November, the UN formally declared a famine in Kadugli, pointing to “months without reliable access to food or medical care”.</p><p>The statement also pointed to the reported atrocities committed by the RSF in el-Fasher in North Darfur state, which include “systematic killing”, “mass displacement” and “summary executions”. The UN has previously described el-Fasher as a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/un-finds-sudans-el-fasher-a-crime-scene-first-access-since-rsf-takeover\">“crime scene.”</a></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>After the paramilitary group was pushed out of the capital, Khartoum, in March, the RSF shifted its campaign to the Kordofan region and to the city of el-Fasher in North Darfur, which had been the army’s last bastion in the vast Darfur region until it fell to the RSF in October.</p><p>Following the capture of el-Fasher, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/three-aid-workers-killed-4-wounded-in-rsf-drone-attack-in-sudans-kordofan\">accounts surfaced</a> accusing the group of mass killings, rape, abductions and widespread looting, prompting the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open a formal probe into alleged “war crimes” by both parties to the conflict.</p><p>On Tuesday, the UNSC imposed sanctions on four high-ranking RSF figures, including the brother of Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the current head of RSF. The sanctions include travel restrictions and asset freezes.</p><h2 id=\"attacks-against-aid-workers\">Attacks against aid workers</h2><p>The UNSC also expressed alarm over repeated drone attacks against civilians, civilian infrastructure and humanitarian workers, including strikes on WFP operations since early February 2026.</p><p>“Council members reiterated that deliberate attacks against humanitarian personnel, their premises and assets may constitute war crimes,” it said.</p><p>“They called on all parties to the conflict to respect and protect humanitarian personnel, as well as their premises and assets in accordance with their obligations under international law.”</p><p>It called for safe, unhindered humanitarian access and the free movement of civilians. “They (UNSC) stressed that starvation must not be used as a weapon of war,” it added.</p><p>According to the latest figures from the WFP, at least 21.2 million people, or 41 percent of the population, are facing high levels of acute food shortages, while 12 million people have been “forced from their homes by the conflict”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For example, January data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed food prices were still 2.9 percent higher than the same period last year.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The president then turned to the issue of “affordability”, which has proven a challenging subject for him. Polls have shown a decline in confidence in Trump’s leadership on the economy, with many US citizens still experiencing high living costs.</p><p>Trump largely blamed the affordability issues on Democrats, including former President Joe Biden, whose term ended over a year ago when Trump took office.</p><p>“Their policies created the high prices; our policies are rapidly ending them,” Trump said.</p><p>Trump also hailed his <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/trumprx-website-launches-in-us-with-promise-to-lower-price-of-medicine\">TrumpRx website</a>, which offers people without insurance potentially cheaper medications online.</p><p>He said he had struck a deal with tech companies to keep utility bills low, despite the demands of AI data centres. He also pointed to an executive order limiting Wall Street investment firms from buying single-family homes in bulk.</p><h2 id=\"president-remains-defiant-after-tariff-ruling\">President remains defiant after tariff ruling</h2><p>Trump has remained defiant after the <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/23/trumps-new-tariff-threats-trigger-economic-uncertainty-trade-deals-stall\">US Supreme Court</a> ruled last week that large portions of the reciprocal tariffs he announced last year were illegal.</p><p>The ruling was the most substantial setback from the Supreme Court for any of Trump’s policies.</p><p>“Just four days ago, an unfortunate ruling from the United States Supreme Court, it just came down; very unfortunate ruling,” said Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He greeted the four Supreme Court justices in attendance, including his appointees Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, as he entered the chamber.</p><p>On Tuesday, a new set of global tariffs of 10 percent went into effect under what Trump described as “fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes”. Trump has said he wants to increase these to 15 percent.</p><p>He added that “congressional action will not be necessary” to keep the tariffs in place.</p><h2 id=\"democrats-protest-trump-s-immigration-policies\">Democrats protest Trump’s immigration policies</h2><p>Trump focused heavily on his hardline immigration policies, particularly when it came to his closure of the US border.</p><p>He continually connected migration to higher crime rates, although studies have shown migrants commit crimes at a lower rate than US citizens.</p><p>Trump again alleged rampant fraud in the Somali-American community, referring to “the Somali pirates who ransacked Minnesota”.</p><p>Trump also asked those in attendance to stand if they agreed that “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>That prompted heckles from Democrats Ilhan Omar, who is Somali American, and Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian American.</p><p>“You have killed Americans,” Omar, who represents a district in the state of Minnesota where two US citizens were killed in January by immigration agents, yelled.</p><p>Earlier in the night, Representative Al Green was escorted from the chamber after he held up a protest sign referring to a racist video posted on Trump’s Truth Social account depicting former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, as apes.</p><p>Beyond the policy arguments on the economy and immigration, Trump leaned into a highly partisan appeal for Republican control of Congress.</p><p>He framed the upcoming midterms as a rescue mission; he labelled Democratic lawmakers “crazy” and accused them of “destroying this country,” claiming his administration had intervened “just in the nick of time”.</p><p>Throughout the address, he repeatedly cast his political opponents as anti-American actors working against the nation’s best interests.</p><h2 id=\"trump-says-iran-won-t-commit-to-no-nuclear-weapons\">Trump says Iran won’t commit to no nuclear weapons</h2><p>The president addressed <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/irans-fm-says-deal-with-us-within-reach-if-diplomacy-given-priority\">tensions with Iran</a> amid the largest US military build-up in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p><p>He again claimed that US strikes last year had “obliterated Iran’s nuclear weapons programme”, just days after US envoy Steve Witkoff said Iran could be a “week away” from developing nuclear weapons.</p><p>Trump has upped threats against Iran amid the latest crackdown on protesters in the country, although he said he preferred to find a diplomatic solution.</p><p>“We haven’t heard those secret words: ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon,’’’ Trump said.</p><p>Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, in a post on X hours before Trump’s speech, said that “Iran will under no circumstances develop a nuclear weapon”. Iranian officials have repeatedly denied seeking nuclear weapons.</p><p>Trump also claimed that Iran was “working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”.</p><h2 id=\"made-for-television-moments\">Made-for-television moments</h2><p>Trump built his career in reality television, and his eye for camera-ready moments was clear during the speech.</p><p>At one point, Trump referenced the US abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, which he hailed as a “colossal victory for the security of the United States”. He added the US had “received from our new friend and partner, Venezuela, more than 80 million barrels of oil”.</p><p>The US president then introduced Venezuelan opposition lawmaker Enrique Marquez, who had been released from prison by the government of Delcy Rodriguez shortly after Maduro’s abduction.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“Alejandra,” Trump said to a woman he identified as Marquez’s niece, “I’m pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he is here tonight. We brought him over to celebrate his freedom with you in person.”</p><p>Trump also awarded Chief Warrant Officer Eric Slover, who was wounded in the Maduro abduction raid, the Congressional Medal of Honor.</p><p>Earlier in the night, Trump awarded the goaltender of the US men’s hockey team, Connor Hellebuyck, with the country’s highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><p>Trump had invited the team, which won gold over Canada at the Olympics, to the speech as his guests.</p><h2 id=\"democrats-response\">Democrats’ response</h2><p>Dozens of Democrats boycotted Trump’s speech and attended counterprogramming instead.</p><p>The party’s official rebuttal was delivered by Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger.</p><p>Spanberger said US businesses suffer under Trump’s tariffs, communities live under his mass deportation drive and residents remain dogged by affordability issues.</p><p>“Americans, you at home, know you can demand more, and that we are working to lower costs,” she said. “We are working to keep our community and our country safe, and we are working for you.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Modi’s first trip to Israel was in 2017, when he was the first Indian leader to ever visit the country.</p><p>India was among the countries that opposed the creation of Israel in 1948, and for decades was one of the most forceful non-Arab critics of Israel’s policies towards Palestinians. It only established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992, but since 2014, when Modi came to power, relations between the two countries have flourished.</p><p>Here is more about what is on the agenda for Modi’s visit, and why it is significant.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-will-modi-meet-and-what-will-they-talk-about\">Who will Modi meet, and what will they talk about?</h2><p>Modi is expected to land at the Ben Gurion international airport outside Tel Aviv at 12:45pm local time (10:45 GMT).</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to welcome Modi at the airport, as he did during the Indian premier’s 2017 visit. The two leaders are scheduled to hold talks shortly after.</p><p>Then, at 4:30pm (14:30 GMT), Modi is scheduled to address the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in Jerusalem. He then returns to Tel Aviv for the night.</p><p>On the morning of February 26, Modi is scheduled to visit the Yad Vashem museum, a memorial to Holocaust victims, before meeting Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Modi and Netanyahu will then meet again and oversee the signing of agreements between the two countries, before Modi departs Israel in the afternoon.</p><p>Overall, Modi and Netanyahu aim to use this visit to bolster strategic economic and defence agreements between India and Israel, officials from both sides have said.</p><p>“We don’t compete, we rather complement each other,” JP Singh, India’s ambassador to Israel, told state broadcaster All India Radio on Monday, speaking <span>of relations with Israel. “Israel is really good at innovation, science and technology. Therefore, there will be a lot of discussion on AI, cybersecurity and quantum.”</span></p><p>The two countries signed a new Bilateral Investment Treaty in September last year, replacing the 1996 investment treaty, to provide “certainty and protection” to investors from both countries. They are also aiming to upgrade existing bilateral security agreements at this meeting.</p><p>In a video posted on the Israeli Embassy’s social media channels on Monday, Israel’s ambassador to India, Reuven Azar, said: “Our economic partnership is gaining real momentum. We signed a bilateral investment treaty, and we are moving forward to sign a free trade agreement, hopefully this year.”</p><p>Azar said that Israel wants to encourage Indian infrastructure companies to come to Israel to build and invest in the country.</p><p>He added: “We will deepen our defence relationship by updating our security agreements.”</p><p>In an X post of his own on Sunday, Netanyahu wrote that he is looking forward to greeting Modi in Jerusalem.</p><p>“We are partners in innovation, security, and a shared strategic vision. Together, we are building an axis of nations committed to stability and progress,” he wrote.</p><p>“From AI to regional cooperation, our partnership continues to reach new heights,” Netanyahu added.</p><h2 id=\"how-are-india-israel-relations\">How are India-Israel relations?</h2><p>Relations between India and Israel have <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/modis-israel-visit-timeline-of-indias-relations-with-israel-palestine\">improved exponentially</a> over the years. While still under British rule in the 1920s and 1930s, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.</p><p>In 1917, the United Kingdom signed the Balfour Declaration, promising Jews who had been displaced from Europe due to Adolf Hitler’s oppression a homeland in the British Mandate in Palestine. This was opposed by many nations, including India, which was fighting British colonialism at the time.</p><p>“Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English, or France to the French,” Mahatma Gandhi, India’s most prominent freedom fighter who is revered as the father of the nation, wrote in an article in his weekly newspaper Harijan on November 26, 1938.</p><p>India was among the nations opposed to the creation of Israel in 1948. In 1949, India also voted against Israel’s UN membership. While it recognised Israel as a state in 1950, it was not until 1992 that the two formalised diplomatic relations, and economic relations gradually grew over the following two decades.</p><p>Since Modi became India’s leader in 2014, there has been a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/modis-israel-visit-timeline-of-indias-relations-with-israel-palestine\">major shift</a> in the relationship between India and Israel. Nine years ago, Modi was the first Indian prime minister ever to visit Israel.</p><p>India is currently Israel’s second-largest trading partner in Asia, after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.</p><p>India’s main exports to Israel include pearls, precious stones, automotive diesel, chemicals, machinery, and electrical equipment; imports include petroleum, chemical machinery and transport equipment.</p><p>Azad Essa, a senior reporter at Middle East Eye and author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel, told Al Jazeera that Modi’s visit to Israel shows how far India’s relations with Israel have evolved over the past decade.</p><p>“Whereas a partnership existed, it was a lot more limited prior to Modi. [New] Delhi has now emerged as Israel’s strongest non-Western ally, so much so that it is now considered a ‘special relationship’, rooted in strategic cooperation and ideological convergence,” Essa said.</p><p>“This visit will be Netanyahu’s opportunity to offer appreciation to Modi, and will be used by him to show Israelis that he is a well-respected and popular leader in the Global South.”</p><p>Under Modi, India has become Israel’s top arms customer. And in 2024, during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, Indian arms firms supplied Israel with rockets and explosives, according to an <a href=\"/features/2024/6/26/india-exports-rockets-explosives-to-israel-amid-gaza-war-documents-reveal\">Al Jazeera investigation</a>.</p><p>Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) envisions India as a Hindu homeland, <a href=\"/features/2026/2/24/kashmir-spying-demolitions-how-modis-india-embraced-israel-model\">echoing Israel’s self-image</a> as a Jewish state. Both India and Israel frame “Islamic terrorism” as a key threat, a label critics say is used to justify wider anti-Muslim policies.</p><p>“The alliance between India and Israel is not just about weapon sales or trade. It is about India’s open embrace of authoritarianism and militarism in building a supremacist state in Israel’s image,” Essa said.</p><p>“It is also a story about how security, nationalism and democratic language can be used to justify and normalise increasingly illiberal policies, and this has implications for democracies everywhere.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-visit-significant\">Why is this visit significant?</h2><p>Modi’s visit comes at a time of rising and complex geopolitical tensions in and around the Middle East.</p><p>Despite the warm relations between the two countries in recent decades, Modi’s trip comes just a week after India joined more than 100 countries in condemning Israel’s de facto expansion in the occupied West Bank. New Delhi signed the statement on February 18 – a day later than most – after initially appearing hesitant.</p><p>This week, Netanyahu claimed that he plans to form a new regional bloc of countries, which he <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/whats-netanyahus-planned-hexagon-alliance-and-can-it-work\">termed a “hexagon” alliance</a>, to stand against “radical” Sunni and Shia-majority nations.</p><p>On Sunday, Netanyahu said this alliance would include Israel, India, Greece and Cyprus, along with other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states. None of these governments has officially endorsed this plan, including India.</p><p>Analysts said Modi’s visit will be viewed by many as an endorsement of Israeli policies, however.</p><p>“The timing of the visit is notable because it comes at a time when Netanyahu has lost immense credibility around the world, and to have the leader of the world’s so-called largest democracy visiting Israel and showing affection to Netanyahu, who has a warrant in his name from the International Criminal Court, is a ringing endorsement of him and Israel’s policies,” Essa said.</p><p>Modi’s visit also comes at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the United States.</p><p>India and Iran have long had a cooperative relationship. After Modi visited Iran in 2016, the two countries signed a major deal, allowing India to develop the strategically located port of Chabahar on Iran’s southeastern coast. However, after the US imposed additional sanctions on Iran last year and threatened to penalise all countries that do business with Tehran, India has reportedly started moving out of Chabahar.</p><p>In June 2025, India <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/why-india-refused-to-join-sco-condemnation-of-israels-attacks-on-iran\">did not join</a> the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO’s) condemnation of Israel’s attacks on Iran during the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a> between Iran and Israel. However, it did join a later condemnation by the BRICS grouping of major emerging economies of the Israeli and US attacks on Iran.</p><p>The US, which has been applying its own pressure on India over the past year in retaliation for its purchase of Russian oil, is <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">building up</a> a vast array of military assets in the Arabian Sea, close to Iran, as President Donald Trump increases pressure on Iran to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-us-tensions-soar-what-do-both-sides-want\">agree to a deal</a> over its nuclear programme and stock of ballistic missiles.</p><p>Trump said last Friday that he was <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/20/trump-considering-limited-strikes-on-iran\">considering a limited strike</a> on Iran if Tehran does not reach a deal with the US. “I guess I can say I am considering that,” he told reporters.</p><p>Iran has said it is seeking a diplomatic solution, but will defend itself if Washington resorts to military action.</p><p>Israel will likely be a front-line participant in any escalation that might follow from US strikes or Iranian retaliation, analysts say.</p></div></div></body></html>"

items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>In a joint statement on Tuesday, aid groups said they have appealed to the Supreme Court seeking an urgent suspension of the plan to ban them from working, and are seeking an urgent interim injunction from the court pending a full judicial review of the Israeli order.</p><p>Oxfam International said on Tuesday that the forced closure of aid operations in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory could begin as early as Saturday.</p><p>“The effect would be immediate, extending well beyond individual organisations to the wider humanitarian system,” Oxfam warned.</p><p>“In Gaza, families remain dependent on external assistance amid continuing restrictions on aid entry and renewed strikes in densely populated areas,” it said in a statement.</p><p>“In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, military incursions, demolitions, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/israeli-settlers-deface-set-fire-to-west-bank-mosque-during-ramadan\">displacement, settlement expansion and settler violence</a> are driving rising humanitarian needs,” it added.</p><p></p><p>The court action comes as aid organisations – including Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE – were notified by Israeli authorities on December 30, 2025, that their Israeli work registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them and provide lists containing personal details on their Palestinian staff.</p><p>If they fail to provide information on their Palestinian staff, the organisations will have to cease operations in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, from March 1.</p><p>The organisations say compliance with the Israeli orders would <a href=\"/features/2026/2/24/israeli-forces-fired-over-900-bullets-to-kill-gaza-medics-in-2025-report\">expose their Palestinian staff to potential retaliation</a>, undermine the principle of humanitarian neutrality and violate European data protection law.</p><p>“Turning humanitarian organisations into an information-gathering arm for a party to the conflict stands in total contradiction to the principle of neutrality,” the court petition states.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the United Nations, 133 NGO workers have been killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip since Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza began on October 7, 2023, including 15 MSF staff.</p><p>In their joint statement, the aid agencies said that stopping their activities will lead to a “humanitarian collapse and irreparable harm” for hundreds of thousands of people in need.</p><p>The vast majority of Gaza’s more than 2 million residents rely on aid groups for food, water, healthcare, shelter and other essentials after Israel’s more than two-year war destroyed much of the territory.</p><p>The petitioners say they have proposed practical alternatives to handing over staff lists to Israeli authorities, including “donor-audited vetting systems”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Diplomatic relations were likewise suspended.</p><p>In turn, MAS received strong support from rural parts of Bolivia, where the cultivation of coca, the raw ingredient in cocaine, is a key economic driver.</p><p>Bolivia, along with other Andean countries like Colombia and Peru, is a key producer of coca, which has traditional uses, including as a remedy for altitude sickness. Morales himself led a union of coca growers, or cocaleros, before taking office.</p><p>Advocates have accused the US’s militaristic “war on drugs” of harming impoverished rural farmers through the forced eradication of coca crops. Such campaigns, they argue, can leave farmers without a means of supporting themselves and their families.</p><p>MAS remained in power from the start of Morales’s term in 2006 until 2025, when its coalition fractured amid economic instability and internal fighting.</p><h2 id=\"new-political-direction\">New political direction</h2><p>In October 2025, two right-wing candidates proceeded to a run-off for the presidency: centrist Rodrigo Paz of the Christian Democratic Party and a former right-wing president, Jorge Quiroga.</p><p>It was the first presidential run-off in modern times for Bolivia, and it marked a sharp turn away from two decades of socialist government.</p><p>Both candidates made improving the relationship with the US a central pillar of their campaigns, viewing it as essential to solving Bolivia’s severe economic crisis.</p><p>Paz, who was educated in Washington, DC, argued that normalising ties would attract the international investment needed to modernise the energy and lithium sectors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Quiroga, a conservative who studied at Texas A&amp;M University, campaigned on a more aggressive platform, including fiscal austerity and security partnerships with the US.</p><p>His vice presidential candidate, Juan Pablo Velasco, is credited with popularising the tagline “Make Bolivia Sexy Again”, a twist on US President Donald Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again”.</p><p>Paz ultimately emerged as the victor in the race, with nearly 54.9 percent of the vote. After his inauguration in November, Paz moved quickly to fulfil his promises by restoring diplomatic ties with the US.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, called Paz’s presidency a “<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/secretary-rubios-call-with-bolivian-president-elect-paz\">transformative opportunity</a>” for the region.</p><p>Earlier this month, both Bolivia and the US agreed to appoint ambassadors to one another’s countries for the first time in nearly 18 years.</p><h2 id=\"uncertainty-remains\">Uncertainty remains</h2><p>But it is unclear to what extent the DEA will be operating in Bolivia. Left-wing leaders like Morales continue to have strong pockets of support, particularly in highland and rural areas.</p><p>Bolivian Foreign Minister Fernando Aramayo has said negotiations are still under way to finalise the specific areas of cooperation between his country and the DEA, as well as operational limits for the US agency.</p><p>A full agreement outlining the scope of the agency’s activities is expected in the coming months.</p><p>Since returning to office on January 20, 2025, Trump has intensified the US campaign against drug trafficking in Latin America, including by designating several major cartels as “foreign terrorist organizations”.</p><p>Trump has also pressured Latin American governments to take more aggressive actions against the illicit drug trade, using economic sanctions and military threats as leverage.</p><p>Already, in late December and early January, Trump has authorised two strikes on Venezuela on the premise of combating drug trafficking.</p><p>One, on December 29, targeted a port that the Trump administration said was used for drug smuggling. The second, on January 3, resulted in multiple explosions, dozens dead and the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. He remains in custody in the US, where he faces drug trafficking and weapons possession charges.</p><p>Critics have argued that Trump’s anti-drug campaign has blurred the line between law enforcement and military activities.</p><p>The increasing use of military force against criminal suspects has raised concerns that human rights are being violated and legal processes circumvented, including through the use of extrajudicial killings.</p><p>One example has come as part of a military campaign called Operation Southern Spear.</p><p>On September 2, the US announced the first of nearly 44 “lethal kinetic strikes” against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.</p><p>As many as 150 people have been killed in the attacks. Operation Southern Spear has continued, despite international organisations like the United Nations questioning its legality and calling for its end.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel launched its genocidal military campaign against Gaza in 2023, after a Hamas-led attack left nearly 1,200 people dead in southern Israel.</p><p>Amid reports of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and starvation, student protesters held demonstrations on <a href=\"/news/2024/4/26/with-eyes-on-us-college-campuses-students-stress-gaza-is-why-were-here\">college campuses</a> across the US in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>Trump campaigned for re-election in 2024, during the height of the movement to erect solidarity encampments on school grounds. His campaign platform called for dismantling the protests as one of 20 national goals.</p><p>“Deport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again,” one of the platform’s bullet points reads.</p><p>Trump has long accused the pro-Palestinian movement of creating an unsafe learning environment.</p><p>But many protest organisers, some of whom were Jewish, have refuted allegations of anti-Semitism. Instead, they said their mission was to highlight the grave human rights abuses perpetuated by the Israeli government in Gaza.</p><p>Still, the student encampments faced crackdowns from university authorities and law enforcement. Thousands of students were taken into custody in 2024, though many were ultimately released without charge.</p><p>One encampment at UCLA that year <a href=\"/news/2024/5/2/activists-say-ucla-palestine-encampment-assault-followed-days-of-harassment\">was attacked</a> by a group of right-wing supporters of Israel, wielding pipes and spraying mace at pro-Palestine protesters. Activists argued that the police allowed the violence to happen, before forcibly <a href=\"/news/2024/5/2/ucla-students-arrested-amid-gaza-protests-all-you-need-to-know\">clearing the encampment</a> the next day.</p><p>UCLA agreed to pay a $6m settlement to three Jewish students and a professor last year, after they alleged harms during the protest movement.</p><p>The school has maintained it has taken multiple measures to address anti-Semitism on campus.</p><h2 id=\"tensions-with-universities\">Tensions with universities</h2><p>Since taking office for a second term in January 2025, Trump has sought to punish certain schools where protests were prominent, including Columbia University in New York City.</p><p>In March, the Trump administration froze federal funding to Columbia, starting a wave of uncertainty in the education sector, as other schools also saw their contracts and grants suspended.</p><p>Trump also deployed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest Columbia student leader Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent US resident, on the basis that his protests threatened US foreign policy.</p><p>Khalil and other foreign-born student protesters continue to fight deportation in the US court system.</p><p>In July, the Trump administration arrived at a $220m settlement with Columbia, which saw the prestigious university accede to a list of demands in exchange for its federal funding being restored. Other schools, including Brown University and Cornell University, have likewise struck deals.</p><p>But schools, including Harvard, have so far refused to accept demands and costly settlements. They face ongoing investigations and penalties.</p><p>Last year, for instance, the Trump administration pressured UCLA, a public university, to pay more than $1bn in settlement fees in a <a href=\"https://ucop.edu/communications/_files/confidential-rule-408-communication-ucla-08-08-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a> that also demanded changes to its hiring and admissions processes.</p><p>At stake are more than $500m in frozen federal research grants to the school. The school has so far not agreed to pay the sum.</p><p>In July, the Justice Department also issued a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1409416/dl?inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notice of violation</a> against UCLA, saying that its investigation had found violations of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause as well as the Civil Rights Act.</p><p>Advocates of the protests argue that the Trump administration’s efforts are a threat to the First Amendment of the Constitution, which protects free speech, the right to protest and academic freedom.</p></div></div></body></html>"
