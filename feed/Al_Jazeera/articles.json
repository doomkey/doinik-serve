The countries have agreed on an ambitious trade target of $100bn.</p><p>And, in a major signal to the West, Putin said: “Russia is ready for uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India.” Importing Russian crude has put India in a geopolitical bind and soured relations with the US, which believes it is financing the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump hit India with an additional trade tariff of 25 percent – bringing the total to 50 percent on Indian goods exported to the US – because of its continuing purchase of Russian oil.</p><p>So, what were the main takeaways from this summit?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152028\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152028\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152028\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-05T093531Z_2096572935_RC29AIAUUWBJ_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-RUSSIA-1764932101.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands as they attend a presentation of a joint statement after talks at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, on December 5, 2025 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-and-russia-affirmed-their-deep-ties\">India and Russia affirmed their deep ties</h2><p>The summit provided a platform for the two countries to reach a slew of trade agreements spanning jobs, health, shipping and chemicals.</p><p>However, analysts said the summit was more important as a show of political messaging.</p><p>“The biggest takeaway from the summit is the signalling that neither side has any intention to dilute this relationship, and is ready to withstand any external pressure,” said Harsh Pant, a geopolitics analyst at New Delhi-based think tank, the Observer Research Foundation.</p><p>Moreover, Pant said: “The attempt is to build the economic partnership, beyond oil and defence.” And without that, he added, “the bilateral relationship is not responsive to today’s realities”.</p><p>Robinder Sachdev, president of the Imagindia Institute, a Delhi-based think tank, said that the summit holds “extreme importance for the greater willingness on the part of both Russia and India to turbocharge this relationship”.</p><p>“Both sides want to increase their engagement beyond just government-to-government deals, in oil and defence sectors, and boost people-to-people ties,” said Sachdev. “That can be the biggest string in this bilateral relationship.”</p><p>Neither leader took questions after their media statements, which Putin concluded by saying that the Russian delegation was pleased with agreements that will “deepen” the bilateral partnership.</p><p>Putin added that, along with other BRICS countries – a growing bloc of emerging economies – India and Russia are promoting a “more just” and “multipolar” world. Putin also underlined the close bond that he shared with Modi by referring to their “close working dialogue” and “regular” phone calls.</p><p>In his statement, Modi said the two countries’ “Economic Cooperation Programme” is designed to diversify, balance, and make trade and investment sustainable, and further expand export, co-production, and co-innovation opportunities.</p><p>“Both sides are working towards the early conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union,” Modi added.</p><p>Modi also said that increasing the “connectivity” between Moscow and New Delhi is a “major priority for us”, noting that energy security has been a “strong and important pillar” of bilateral relations.</p><p>Modi also mentioned the opening of two new Indian consulates in Russia last month, and introduced two new 30-day visa schemes that would be made available for Russian tourists in India soon.</p><p>Modi said he had discussed the war in Ukraine with Putin and conveyed that India has “stood for peace since the beginning”.</p><p>“India and Russia have long supported each other, and worked shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism,” said Modi, mentioning the April attack in Kashmir and the attack on Crocus City Hall in Moscow in 2024.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152034\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152034\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152034\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-05T092604Z_1467307034_RC25AIA9VJTQ_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-RUSSIA-1764932208.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin is received by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and India’s President Droupadi Murmu after he arrived to attend his ceremonial reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan presidential palace in New Delhi, India, on December 5, 2025 [Altaf Hussain/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-did-not-pressure-russia-over-ukraine\">India did not pressure Russia over Ukraine</h2><p>Russia and India have held an annual bilateral summit since 2000, for which the Indian prime minister visits Russia one year, and the Russian president returns the visit the following year.

Putin is saying: “Moscow is not alone, and the efforts to isolate the Kremlin have failed”, experts say.</p><p>Ukraine’s allies in Europe and the US had hoped New Delhi would persuade Putin to agree to a peace deal. However, India did not call on Russia to end the war, although PM Modi appeared to reiterate his earlier position that “this is not an era of war”.</p><p>“India is on the side of peace,” the Indian prime minister said during discussions between the two leaders at Hyderabad House in Delhi on Friday.</p><p>“The world should return to peace, and we support every effort towards peace,” said Modi, adding, “India-Russia relations should grow and touch new heights.”</p><p>Expressing his gratitude to Modi, Putin said, “The two nations also have relations in the military sphere, in space development, artificial intelligence, and other areas … and we intend to move forward in all these areas.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4152015\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4152015\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4152015\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251205__877G4BC__v1__MidRes__IndiaRussiaPolitics-1764931967.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"modi putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4152015\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Birds fly past a digital billboard displaying India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shaking hands with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, in Bengaluru on December 5, 2025 [(Idrees Mohammed/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-is-walking-a-tightrope-between-russia-and-the-west\">India is walking a tightrope between Russia and the West</h2><p>New Delhi is currently caught in a precarious geopolitical equation, a reality that has starkly tested the scope of India’s foreign policy.</p><p>On one side, India faces an increasingly coercive United States and its punitive trade tariffs. The Trump administration accuses India of effectively financing Putin’s war machine in Ukraine by buying crude oil.</p><p>The war in Ukraine, however, has tested the friendship between Moscow and New Delhi – a relationship that goes back decades.</p><p>Since its independence from Britain in 1947, India has avoided becoming locked into formal alliances with any superpower, leading the non-aligned movement during the Cold War.

The renovation project took place to make residents safer, to make the building structure safer, and instead, it led to this tragedy,” he said.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hong Konger Athena Tong, a visiting research fellow at the University of Tokyo, echoed a view held by many in the city – that the government was slow to respond.</p><p>“The fact that it was necessary for society, the everyday citizens, to mobilise at that scale to help with relief demonstrates that there is no trust that the government is competent,” Tong told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Online, Hong Kongers began to question the government’s early response, including an early suggestion from officials and experts that Wang Fuk Court’s bamboo scaffolding – a Hong Kong construction tradition – was responsible for the fire and should be replaced with metal.</p><p>Fire investigators later ruled that subpar mesh netting and Styrofoam blocks were the main culprits.</p><p>But some of the discontent comes from the way the 2019 protests – and the deep existential questions they raised about the future of Hong Kong – were never really resolved, according to observers.</p><p>The protests broke out in 2019 over plans to amend Hong Kong’s extradition agreement with China, but they erupted into a widespread antigovernment movement as a range of grievances began to surface – some dating back to the city’s 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty.</p><p>The pushback ranged from issues such as how Hong Kong’s local leader would be chosen to whether Beijing was backpedalling on promises that the former British colony would retain a “high degree of autonomy” until 2047 under the “one country, two systems” agreement with China. For others, the protests brought up questions about the future of Hong Kong’s unique identity and culture.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4151824\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4151824\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4151824\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-01T122247Z_760162216_RC2M7IAG0HAW_RTRMADP_3_HONGKONG-FIRE-1764925919.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C517&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People pray as they lay flowers at a makeshift memorial near the Wang Fuk Court housing complex residents after the deadly fire, in Tai Po, Hong Kong, China, December 1, 2025.

The Trump administration has justified the attacks as, it says, the inflow of drugs to the US threatens national security.

country would resist any such attempt.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"5\">Here is what we know:</p><h2 id=\"how-could-the-us-attack-venezuela\" data-path-to-node=\"5\">How could the US attack Venezuela?</h2><p data-start=\"273\" data-end=\"435\">Analysts say the US has several <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/is-venezuela-prepared-for-a-us-attack-as-washington-ramps-up-forces\">military options</a> for striking Venezuela, most of which employ air and maritime power rather than ground troops.</p><p data-start=\"273\" data-end=\"435\">In recent months, the US has deployed a considerable air and naval force to the Caribbean, close to the coast of Venezuela, including the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/us-deploys-aircraft-carrier-amid-hardening-stance-towards-venezuela\">USS Gerald Ford</a>.</p><p data-start=\"437\" data-end=\"528\">“The pieces are in place for an air and missile attack,” Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"437\" data-end=\"528\">“The first strike will likely be long-range missiles launched from air and sea because Venezuela has relatively strong air defences,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"878\" data-end=\"1105\">While the Trump administration’s rhetoric has increasingly focused on the Maduro government, which it claims has links to drug gangs in Venezuela, analysts note that targeting alleged cartel-linked infrastructure would be easier to justify internationally and easier to conclude quickly.</p><p data-start=\"1107\" data-end=\"1161\">What nearly all experts have ruled out is a ground invasion.</p><p data-start=\"336\" data-end=\"813\">“I don’t really see that an attack is likely at all at this stage,” Elias Ferrer, founder of Orinoco Research and the lead editor of the Venezuelan media organisation Guacamaya, said.</p><p data-start=\"1107\" data-end=\"1161\">“There will be no boots on the ground because US ground forces in the region are not strong enough for an invasion,” Cancian said.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129625 aligncenter\"

fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p data-start=\"1163\" data-end=\"1301\">Furthermore, a large-scale land operation would likely be deeply unpopular in the US and face major obstacles at home.</p><p data-start=\"1303\" data-end=\"1531\">“Any move toward overt ground operations would encounter significant legal barriers, congressional pushback, and the shadow of Iraq and Afghanistan – all of which make a full occupation extremely unlikely,” Salvador Santino Regilme, a political scientist who leads the international relations programme at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"1533\" data-end=\"1718\">“Analytically, we should think in terms of a spectrum of limited but potentially escalating uses of force, not a binary choice between ‘no attack’ and an Iraq-style invasion,” he added.</p><p data-start=\"1533\" data-end=\"1718\">An ‘<a href=\"/news/longform/2023/4/5/iraq-war-20-years-on-visualising-the-impact-of-the-invasion\">Iraq-style invasion’</a> refers to a large-scale ground campaign followed by a US-led occupation, the dismantling of state institutions and an open-ended nation-building effort – the kind of intervention that would require hundreds of thousands of troops, years of counterinsurgency operations, and massive political and financial investment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4151586\"

attack mean for Venezuela?</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"4\">While some policymakers in Washington hope a military strike would trigger a political transition in government, analysts warn it is far more likely to plunge the nation into instability.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"5\">Ferrer described the idea of an attack as opening a “Pandora’s box”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"5\">“Armed actors are empowered in a conflict, so either the military itself or paramilitary actors – whether they’re politically motivated or just organised crime – could try to take over certain parts of the country. That is not the only result. But you open up all of those possibilities.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"6\">In such an environment, Ferrer warned, the political opposition would be among the least likely to benefit.</p><p data-start=\"1348\" data-end=\"1542\">“One of the most likely losers out of such a situation is the Venezuelan opposition, only because they don’t have an armed wing or strong connections with the armed and security forces,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"336\" data-end=\"813\">Indeed, some analysts argue that even a limited US strike would likely strengthen the Maduro government in the short term.</p><p data-start=\"336\" data-end=\"813\">“External aggression tends to generate a rally-around-the-flag effect and gives incumbents a powerful pretext to criminalise dissent as treason,” Santino Regilme told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"336\" data-end=\"813\">“The opposition, which is already fragmented and socially uneven, would likely be further divided between those who welcome US pressure and those who fear being permanently discredited as foreign proxies,” he added.</p><p data-start=\"336\" data-end=\"813\">“Comparative experiences in Iraq, Libya, and other cases of externally driven regime change suggest that coercive intervention rarely produces stable democracy,” Santino Regilme explained.</p><p data-start=\"1348\" data-end=\"1542\">Despite rising tensions, senior Venezuelan officials have adopted an openly defiant posture. While publicly calling for peace, they frame any potential US action as an attack on national sovereignty.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">“They [the US] think that with a bombing they’ll end everything.

That was the 1991 Gulf War campaign in which a US-led coalition expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait.</p><p data-start=\"2028\" data-end=\"2352\">In that conflict, US officials quietly signalled to certain Iraqi units that if they stayed in their barracks and did not resist, they would not be targeted – an approach that helped limit resistance during the ground offensive.</p><p data-start=\"2028\" data-end=\"2352\">But, according to Cancian, the Venezuelan government has purged any opposition from the military.</p><p data-start=\"2028\" data-end=\"2352\">“Thus, there is a high likelihood that the military and security forces will fight,” he added</p><h2 id=\"so-how-could-venezuela-s-military-respond-to-an-attack\" data-start=\"2028\" data-end=\"2352\">So how could Venezuela’s military respond to an attack?</h2><p data-start=\"336\" data-end=\"813\">Ferrer said this all depends on what signals the US sends them before any attack. “What’s actually more interesting is what kind of deal the US is trying to make. How is it trying to involve or marginalise the armed forces and the security forces?”</p><p data-start=\"1571\" data-end=\"1615\">He outlined the dilemma facing Washington: “Is it telling them, ‘Hey guys, you can stay in control of these businesses, these ministries – the generals can keep their posts’? Or is it going to do something like de-Baathification in Iraq, where they remove all the officers and fire all the soldiers to purge the armed forces of pro-Maduro elements?”</p><p data-start=\"1928\" data-end=\"2024\">Marginalising the armed forces could trigger more, not less, violence, Ferrer warned.</p><p data-start=\"2028\" data-end=\"2352\">“Not necessarily a coup or a civil war involving the whole country, but you might have pockets of conflict arising all over the country.

He also directed Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities and Gaj Gamini, starring his muse, Bollywood star Madhuri Dixit.</p><p>For decades, Husain was a popular public figure loved by the press, attaining a celebrity-like status with his own idiosyncratic style – he walked barefoot.

He was accused of sacrilege and insulting Hindu sentiments.</p><p>Multiple criminal police complaints were filed against the artist after a magazine, Vichar Mimansa, published his painting depicting Hindu deity Saraswati in the nude in 1996. Eight years later, a painting of Bharat Mata (Mother India) as a naked woman brought a new barrage of lawsuits. He apologised, but that did not deter the torrent of hate and legal cases.</p><p>Hundreds of police complaints were filed across the country, arrest warrants were issued, and his Mumbai house was ransacked in 1998. His exhibitions were vandalised in India and abroad, forcing Husain, in his 80s, to leave India in 2006 for safety.</p><p>In 2008, India’s Supreme Court quashed the cases against Husain, saying the Bharat Mata painting was a work of art. India has a tradition of graphic sexual iconography in temples, the top court reminded petitioners.</p><p>Yet Husain did not feel safe returning to India, where anti-Muslim rhetoric was on the rise. He died in 2011 in London at the age of 95.</p><p>The attacks on Husain were not isolated. The right to freedom of speech and expression in India has been declining since the rise of the Hindu right in the 1990s.</p><p>Several filmmakers, authors and artists have faced growing attacks from Hindu nationalist groups.

But early in his life, he was drawn towards art while studying calligraphy at a madrasa in Vadodara, located in present-day Gujarat state.</p><p>After his mother’s death, he moved to the central Indian city of Indore, where his father landed a job in a textile mill.</p><p>In Indore, he was introduced to the images of Hindu deities and other figures from Indian mythology by an art teacher at the Indore School of Art, which he attended, said Akhilesh, his biographer.</p><p>Husain left Indore for Mumbai about 1933, when India was still under British colonial rule, Akhilesh said.</p><p>“He went to Bombay to pursue filmmaking. He thought that film was a broader medium to express himself. But he couldn’t find any entry. So, he started painting film banners,” said Akhilesh, who is an acclaimed painter himself, based in the Indian city of Bhopal.</p><p>Husain had to juggle jobs, also working in a toy factory, to earn additional income before he got a start in the art world. In 1934, he sold his first painting for 10 rupees (just 11 cents according to today’s exchange rates).</p><p>By the late 1940s, he had established himself as an avant garde artist known for his bold and bright colour on canvas.

The legendary artist was a friend of Akhilesh’s father. “He treated me like his son,” Akhilesh told Al Jazeera. “I remember him coming to our Indore house with a Jalebi (Indian sweet) early in the morning.”</p><p>Akhilesh recalled how, in the early 2000s, Husain once invited him to London. There, Husain made breakfast for Akhilesh and took him around London in his Rolls-Royce. “He enjoyed every moment of his life,” Akhilesh said of Husain.</p><p>Though he gave up his Indian passport, Husain’s love for his motherland did not cease. “This is just a piece of paper. India is my motherland, and I simply cannot leave that country,” he said after surrendering his Indian passport in 2010.</p><p>Akhilesh said that while in exile, Husain wanted to visit three Indian cities – Varanasi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad. “‘I will come anytime,’ he told me from exile,” Akhilesh said. “But he died before he could undertake his journey back to his homeland.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4151934\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4151934\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4151934\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-04-at-3.45.56-PM-1764929435.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Artist Akhilesh with MF Husain\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4151934\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Artist Akhilesh Singh with Husain [Photo courtesy Akhilesh Singh]</figcaption></figure><p>That Husain was forced to spend his final years in exile remains a blot on India, said Khullar, the art scholar.</p><p>“The loss of a figure like Husain is a loss to the secular ethos of the [Indian] art world that he founded in 1947, and one could say, for a certain section of society, more broadly, for India itself,” she said.</p><p>“It’s a dark time, and people are afraid,” she said.</p><p>But Husain himself never let the attacks stop him from pursuing his work: He used his time in exile to work on art projects in Qatar and Dubai.</p><p>“He laughed off the controversies.

A bail bondsman – also known as a bond agent – is an individual or company who provides a financial guarantee to a court that a defendant will appear at all required court hearings after being released from jail.</p><p>Cole lives in a single-family household in Woodbridge with his mother and “other family members”. He is described as being 5 feet 6 inches tall (168cm) and wearing corrective eyeglasses.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-cole-charged-with\">What is Cole charged with?</h2><p>Cole is charged with transporting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in interstate commerce – referring to transferring goods from one state to another – with the intent to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or unlawfully to damage or destroy any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property.</p><p>Additionally, Cole is charged with attempted malicious destruction by means of fire and explosive materials.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-pipe-bomb\">What is a pipe bomb?</h2><p>Pipe bombs are a type of IED – any homemade or non-standard bomb constructed and deployed outside of conventional military production.</p><p>Typically, a plastic, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, sealed at each end with a cap or plug, is packed with an explosive substance – usually a powder or chemical. Pipe bombs are generally equipped with a fuse, timer or remote trigger.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-cole-alleged-to-have-done\">What is Cole alleged to have done?</h2><p>At about 1pm (18:00 GMT) on January 6, 2021, US law enforcement agencies were alerted to a suspected IED having been placed in the vicinity of the Republican National Committee (RNC) headquarters in Washington, DC.</p><p>About 15 minutes later, a second IED was reported close to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in Washington, DC, a few blocks away from the RNC.</p><p>According to the affidavit, both IEDs were pipe bombs made from 1‑inch by 8‑inch (2.5-20cm) pipes with end caps, containing red and black 14‑gauge electrical wires connected by alligator clips to a nine‑volt battery and battery connector, a white kitchen timer, paper clips, steel wool and homemade black powder.</p><p>The RNC and DNC are nationwide party organisations that fundraise for their respective political parties across state lines.</p><p>Members of the Hazardous Devices Section of the United States Capitol Police (USCP) deactivated both bombs before they exploded.</p><h2 id=\"do-we-know-cole-s-motive\">Do we know Cole’s motive?</h2><p>No. Authorities have not yet revealed the motive behind Cole’s actions.</p><h2 id=\"how-was-cole-identified\">How was Cole identified?</h2><p>Surveillance footage from the streets in the area showed that both bombs were placed by the same individual who was wearing a mask to obscure his face. He has now been identified as Cole.</p><p>From the video footage, the FBI deduced in January 2021 that the suspect was about 5 feet, 7 inches (170cm) tall.</p><p>In March 2021, the FBI released the surveillance footage online and offered a $500,000 reward for information about the suspect. The agency received thousands of tips in the years that followed.</p><p>The FBI said it received thousands of tips about him in the years-long investigation.</p><p>The FBI then matched Cole’s cellphone records to cell towers in the Capitol Hill area at about the time the bombs were planted. Additionally, they linked him to purchases of bomb components through bank and credit card information from 2019 and 2020, showing where he had made these purchases.</p><p>“We do not forget, we do not give up, and we do not relent. Though it had been nearly five years, our team continued to churn through massive amounts of data and tips that we used to identify this suspect,” said Darren Cox, a deputy assistant director in the FBI.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-on-january-6-2021\">What happened on January 6, 2021?</h2><p>On January 6, 2021, thousands of people descended on the US Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. They were spurred on by false claims that the previous November’s presidential election, which was won by Democrat Joe Biden, had been “rigged” against Republican incumbent Donald Trump.</p><p>More than 2,000 rioters broke into the Capitol building, forced their way inside, invaded congressional offices, smashed windows, damaged furniture and equipment and stole items.</p><p>Several people, including police officers, were injured in the violence, and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/6/packing-up-our-things-january-6-prisoners-prepare-for-trump-pardons\">at least five people</a> died.</p><p>Thousands of people were arrested, and more than 950 people were charged with federal crimes relating to the riot, with some facing accusations of seditious conspiracy – a rare but serious offence.</p><p>Hundreds of people received prison sentences – most between three and seven years.</p><p>However, some who were affiliated with far-right extremist groups received longer sentences of between 15 and 22 years in federal prison.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In January 2025, shortly after he began his second term as president, Trump signed a presidential proclamation pardoning or commuting sentences for 1,500 defendants.</p><p>He said at the time: “These people have been destroyed. What they’ve done to these people is outrageous. There’s rarely been anything like it in the history of our country.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the investigation into Cole’s role in the January 6 riots is continuing and further charges may be filed.</p><p>Local media have reported that he will appear in federal court in Washington, DC, later this week for a hearing.</p><p>If convicted, the charges he faces could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison – the maximum sentence for IED offences.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two nuclear-armed neighbours fought a brief four-day air war in May, further straining relations.</p><p data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"568\">Meanwhile, ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have also deteriorated sharply following the ouster of former <a href=\"/features/2025/11/18/why-india-likely-wont-return-hasina-to-face-bangladesh-death-penalty\">Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> in August last year. Hasina fled to India after being deposed in a popular uprising, and New Delhi has so far refused to send the former PM back to Bangladesh, where she was convicted by a tribunal in November of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death.</p><p data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"568\">But will most other South Asian nations — SAARC consists of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, Bhutan and Afghanistan — agree to a new regional grouping that appears aimed at cutting India out, or at least limiting its influence?</p><p data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"568\">Here is what you need to know:</p><h2 id=\"what-is-pakistan-s-proposal\" data-start=\"134\" data-end=\"568\">What is Pakistan’s proposal?</h2><p data-start=\"68\" data-end=\"622\">Deputy Prime Minister Dar, who is also Pakistan’s foreign minister, said the trilateral initiative with Bangladesh and China aimed to “foster mutual collaboration” in areas of shared interest, and that the concept be “expanded and duplicated” to include more countries and regions.</p><p>“As I have said before, there could be groups with variable geometry on issues from economy to technology to connectivity,” he told the conclave in Islamabad.</p><p>“Our own national development needs and regional priorities cannot – and should not – be held hostage to anyone’s rigidity, and you know where I am referring to,” he said, in an apparent reference to India.</p><p>On tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi, Dar pointed out that a “structured dialogue” process between India and Pakistan has remained in limbo “for over 11 years”, adding that other regional states have had their share of a “seesaw relationship with our neighbour India”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The foreign minister said Pakistan envisions a South Asia where links and cooperation replace “divisions, economies grow in synergy, disputes are resolved peacefully in accordance with international legitimacy, and where peace is maintained with dignity and honour”.</p><p>According to academic Rabia Akhtar, the proposal at this stage is likely “more aspirational than operational”.</p><p>“But it signals Pakistan’s intent to diversify and reimagine regional cooperation mechanisms at a time when SAARC remains paralysed,” Akhtar, director at the Centre for Security, Strategy and Policy Research (CSSPR) at the University of Lahore, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-regional-organisation-saarc\">What is the regional organisation SAARC?</h2><p>SAARC was established in 1985 at a summit in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p><p>Its seven founding members were Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan joined to become the eighth member in 2007.</p><p>According to its website, the objectives of SAARC include improving the welfare and quality of life of South Asians, generating economic growth and cultural development.</p><p>Despite its lofty ambitions, the organisation has struggled to achieve its goals over the past 40 years, in large part due to the decades-long tensions between India and Pakistan, who have fought three full-scale wars since their independence from the British in 1947, which also coincided with the partition of the subcontinent.</p><p>The 19th SAARC summit in 2016, scheduled to be hosted by Islamabad, was indefinitely postponed after India pulled out, citing a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir and holding Pakistan responsible.</p><p>“The organisation requires consensus to function, and without political willingness from the two largest members to separate regional cooperation from bilateral disputes, SAARC cannot move forward,” CSSPR’s Akhtar said.</p><p>The last summit of the regional body <a href=\"/opinions/2014/11/28/a-disappointing-saarc-summit\">was held in 2014 in Kathmandu</a>, Nepal. However, analysts say while SAARC remains dormant, the organisation has potential to deliver for the region — if India and Pakistan allow it to.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-saarc-important\">Why is SAARC important?</h2><p>As of 2025, SAARC countries make up more than two billion of the world’s population, making South Asia the world’s most densely populated region.</p><p>Yet, trade within South Asia is minimal, representing only about 5 percent of the region’s overall commerce, around $23bn, <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/south-asia-regional-integration/trade?\">the World Bank has said</a>. By contrast, trade between member states of ASEAN, a bloc of 11 Southeast Asian nations home to about 700 million people, represents 25 percent of their international commerce, the Washington-based institution noted.</p><p>South Asian nations could exchange goods worth $67bn – three times their current trade – if they reduced barriers, the World Bank estimates.</p><p>Trade between India and Pakistan, in particular, remains dismal. In the financial year <a href=\"/news/2025/5/1/the-10bn-india-pakistan-trade-secret-hidden-by-official-data\">2017-2018</a>, official trade between the two neighbours stood at a mere $2.41bn. It fell further, halving to $1.2bn by 2024 – though unofficial trade between them, routed through other countries, is larger, at about $10bn, experts say.</p><p>Lack of <a href=\"http://sdgs.un.org/statements/south-asian-association-regional-cooperation-saarc-15574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regional connectivity</a> is cited as one major reason for the region’s weak trade links.</p><p>In 2014, the grouping was poised to sign a Motor Vehicles Agreement that would have allowed cars and trucks to travel across South Asia, as they can in Europe. But Pakistan blocked that agreement – and a separate one on regional railway collaboration – amid tensions with India.</p><p>Since then, the grouping’s ability to come together has been limited to a few occasions, like during the COVID-19 pandemic when member states set up an emergency fund and set aside $7.7bn to help tackle the public health crisis.</p><p>“If the two countries [India and Pakistan] were able to identify even limited avenues for cooperation in the service of broader regional interests, SAARC could, in principle, be revived,” analyst Farwa Aamer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“However, given current political dynamics, such a breakthrough appears to be a distant prospect,” Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI), added.</p><p>But Pakistan isn’t the first to attempt to sidestep SAARC to build its regional partnerships. After SAARC failed to approve a regional transport pact, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal  – in a grouping called the BBIN after the country initials – inked a similar agreement among themselves.</p><p>India is also part of other regional organisations like the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), Aamer pointed out. BIMSTEC includes India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand.</p><p>Still, on the whole, Aamer said, “bilateral and trilateral arrangements will continue to dominate” over “regional multilateralism” in the “near to medium term”. That’s because dealing with just one or two countries at a time tends “to offer more flexibility, clearer incentives and a greater likelihood of producing tangible outcomes,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"will-pakistan-s-proposal-work\">Will Pakistan’s proposal work?</h2><p>“This proposal, ambitious though, is critically needed,” said Professor Shahab Enam Khan, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs. “South Asia has repeatedly failed at pragmatic regionalism or even so-called minilateralism, trapped in security-dominated thinking, or perhaps political myopia.”</p><p>In theory, there is space for a new regional body, said Praveen Donthi, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.</p><p>“The quiet demise of SAARC, due to frozen relations between India and Pakistan, created a vacuum for another South Asian forum,” he told Al Jazeera. “Bangladesh’s deteriorating ties with India and improving relations with Pakistan paved the way for trilateral cooperation with China.”</p><p>But whether the proposal actually works will depend on two factors, academic Akhtar said.</p><p>“First, whether prospective states see functional value in smaller, issue-focused groupings at a moment when traditional architectures are stalled; and second, whether participation does not trigger political costs vis-a-vis India.”</p><p data-start=\"162\" data-end=\"354\">Akhtar said several South Asian countries may show tentative interest in Pakistan’s proposed regional initiative, though any move towards formal participation is expected to remain limited.</p><p data-start=\"356\" data-end=\"683\">“I think countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Maldives, and perhaps Bhutan may be open to exploratory engagement, particularly on connectivity, climate adaptation and economic resilience,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"356\" data-end=\"683\">To make it work, countries will be required to show they can pull together and consider the needs of smaller states, said Khan. “Countries must move beyond traditional geopolitical rivalries. Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Maldives are increasingly recognising they need deeper regional cooperation that serves their economic interests, not just the concerns of larger powers. I find enough grounds for the countries in the region and beyond to join alternative initiative such as this one.”</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">However, Akhtar noted that India’s regional sensitivities and wider geopolitical rivalry with Pakistan and China “mean that actual membership uptake will be cautious”.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">Donthi of the International Crisis Group said that if the Pakistani proposal does move forward, it “could further widen the gap between India and Bangladesh and also add to India’s regional competition with China”.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">Nevertheless, ASPI’s Aamer believes Pakistan’s proposition was a “strategically coherent” one.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">“The country is in a moment of diplomatic agility,” she said, adding that “it has maintained strong relations with China while simultaneously cultivating renewed and improved ties with the United States and the Gulf”.</p><p data-start=\"890\" data-end=\"1033\">“This dual-track engagement has given Islamabad a sense of confidence and the ambition to reassert itself as a significant regional actor, essentially, to reclaim a seat at the centre of regional diplomacy.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
