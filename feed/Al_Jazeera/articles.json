community of Ukraine’s Sumy region, Governor Oleh Hryhorov said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.</li>\n<li>Russian forces launched 850 attacks on Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region in a single day, injuring 14 people and damaging houses, cars and infrastructure, Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Russian forces injured five people in attacks on Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, and six people in the Kherson region in the past day, local officials said, according to the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform.</li>\n<li>In Dnipropetrovsk, those injured included a firefighter and factory worker, hurt after Russian forces launched a second attack on a factory in the Synelnykivskyi district, as rescuers tried to respond to a fire caused by an earlier Russian attack, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported on its website.</li>\n<li>Russian attacks caused power outages in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, as well as the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, the Ukrainian energy company NPC Ukrenergo said on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Ukraine claimed that underwater drones had, for the first time in the war, <a

Russia’s Black Sea Fleet press service, Aleksei Rulyov, denied that the underwater drone attack was successful. “Not a single ship or submarine of the Black Sea Fleet located at the base in

territorial concessions to Russia can only be made by the people of Ukraine, and once robust security guarantees are in place for Kyiv.</li>\n<li>They also said that US and European leaders had agreed to “work together to provide robust security guarantees”, including a European-led “multinational force” made up of nations willing to assist “in securing Ukraine’s skies, and in supporting safer

They want to get it [the war] ended also,” he said.</p><p>“We had numerous conversations with President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia, and I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever, and we’ll see what we can do.”</p><p>Zelenskyy had earlier said that negotiations with US and European leaders were difficult but productive.</p><p>The high-level discussions, involving Zelenskyy, a US delegation led by envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and European leaders, took place in Berlin over two days amid mounting pressure from Washington for Kyiv to make concessions to Moscow to end one of Europe’s deadliest conflicts since World War II.</p><p>In a statement following the talks, European leaders said they and the US were committed to working together to provide “robust security guarantees” to Ukraine, including a European-led “multinational force Ukraine” supported by the US.</p><p>They said the force’s work would include “operating inside Ukraine” as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine’s forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said that Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.</p><p>Two US officials, speaking to the Reuters news agency, described the proposed protections as “Article 5-like”, a reference to NATO’s Article 5 mutual defence pledge.</p><p>Ukraine had earlier signalled it may be willing to abandon its ambition to join the NATO military alliance in exchange for firm Western security guarantees.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Berlin, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv needed a clear understanding of the security guarantees on offer before making any decisions on territorial control under a potential peace settlement. He added that any guarantees must include effective ceasefire monitoring.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have been cautious about what form such guarantees could take. Ukraine received security assurances backed by the US and Europe after gaining independence in 1991, but those did not prevent Russia’s invasions in 2014 and 2022.</p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Washington had offered “considerable” security guarantees during the Berlin talks.</p><p>“What the US has placed on the table here in Berlin, in terms of legal and material guarantees, is really considerable,” Merz said at a joint news conference with Zelenskyy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“We now have the chance for a real peace process,” he said, adding that territorial arrangements remain a central issue. “Only Ukraine can decide about territorial concessions. No ifs or buts.”</p><p>Merz also said it was essential for the European Union to reach an agreement on using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine to demonstrate to Moscow that continuing the war is futile.

Most existing shelters are worn out or made of thin plastic and cloth sheeting.</p><p>Gaza authorities, meanwhile, were still digging to recover about 9,000 bodies they estimated remain buried in rubble from Israeli bombing during the war, but the lack of machinery is slowing down the process, spokesman Ismail al-Thawabta said.</p><p>Azzoum reported that Civil Defence teams said they require a surge in heavy machinery to expedite the work.</p><p>“They are saying that they are still in need, initially, for 40 excavators and bulldozers in order to achieve some slight progress in the whole process on the ground,” Azzoum said, reporting from Gaza City.</p><p>Israel’s continuing ban on the entry of heavy machinery into the Gaza Strip is a violation of the ceasefire, he added.</p><p>Earlier on Sunday, Hamas said Israel’s continuing violations of the ceasefire risk jeopardising the agreement and progress towards the next stage of United States President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war.</p><p>Since the ceasefire began, Israel has continued to strike Gaza on a daily basis, carrying out nearly 800 attacks and killing nearly 400 people, according to authorities in Gaza, while blocking the free flow of humanitarian aid.</p><p>“There is no real sense of safety nor protection for families,” Azzoum said of the ongoing violations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>This week is shaping up to be crucial for the European Union’s policy on Ukraine. EU foreign ministers met in Brussels on Monday; EU heads of state will gather on Thursday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting United States envoy Steve Witkoff. At the top of the agenda is the peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump and continuing funding for Ukraine’s war effort.</p><p>The European strategy so far has been to alter the US-proposed peace plan in such a way that it becomes completely unacceptable to Russia. This, as European leaders hope, will reinforce the core narrative emanating from their capitals over the past two months – that Russian President Vladimir Putin is just playing games and doesn’t really want peace.</p><p>The idea behind it is to try to sway Trump to their side and have him apply additional military and economic pressure on the Kremlin rather than pressing Ukraine into signing an unsavoury peace deal right away. But this effort could easily backfire.</p><p>The main practical issue with regards to Ukraine’s capacity to withstand Russian aggression during 2026 is who is going to fund its army as well as its state and social welfare system. Trump proudly states that the US is no longer financing Ukraine’s war effort because, in his parlance, it is “Biden’s war” – ie, his predecessor Joe Biden is to blame.</p><p>The burden of funding is now squarely on Europe – the EU and rich non-EU countries, such as the United Kingdom and Norway. The US keeps providing weapons to Ukraine, but these are being paid for with money from European coffers. US intelligence support, crucial in Ukraine’s war planning, is currently available to Kyiv for free.</p><p>European leaders have been vocal and aggressive throughout the year in rejecting any realistic compromise that could end the war. But even as 2025 is ending, there is no clarity as to how they are going to back up their jingoistic rhetoric with sufficient funding that would allow Ukraine not just to stay afloat but tip the balance in the conflict in its favour.</p><p>Their plan A is what they call the reparations loan. It envisages using the assets of the Russian Central Bank frozen by European banks to fund the Ukrainian defence. This means that rather than spending the money on actual reparations – as in Ukraine’s post-war restoration – it would be spent on the war itself.</p><p>The thinking behind this plan is that once Russia suffers a strategic defeat, it would retroactively agree to the confiscation rather than demand its money back, so European governments would not have to reach into their coffers to return the money to the Russians.</p><p>The obvious problem here is that exactly nobody – except war cheerleaders who have been promising Russia’s defeat for the past four years – believes this outcome is even remotely realistic. Belgium, which holds the bulk of these assets, is equally sceptical, which is why it opposes this plan. It has been joined by a growing number of EU states, including the Czech Republic and Italy.</p><p>The other big problem is that Trump’s peace plan has radically different designs for the assets in question. It envisages using them as actual reparations, as in spending them on restoring Ukraine’s economy. Most crucially, Moscow has on numerous occasions signalled that it agrees with this part of the plan. It considers the money lost and wants to make sure neighbouring Ukraine does not turn into a failed state.</p><p>This means that if the reparations loan plan goes ahead, it would undermine the most attractive provision of Trump’s plan. If this happens, the US and the EU may find themselves more at odds with each other than they already are, and that would hardly sway Trump.</p><p>His administration has indicated on a number of occasions that it could walk out of the peace process if it is derailed, which means ending any help to Ukraine, be it with weapons or intelligence.</p><p>The reparations loan plan also comes with an enormous risk for the European economy. The confiscation of Russian assets would discourage any central bank in the world from keeping its money in Europe, meaning the European banking system stands to lose.</p><p>More importantly, this move cannot guarantee that Ukraine would be able to stop Russia’s slow but steady advancement. Securing funding for another year under the current circumstances basically means that more Ukrainian lives and territory will be lost in 2026.</p><p>This money cannot in effect counter the biggest threat to Ukraine and its neighbours right now: that of Russia precipitating a humanitarian catastrophe that could spill over into the region by devastating Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this winter. The latest blackout in Odesa when the whole city was left without water and heating in the middle of winter is a dark prelude of things to come.</p><p>All this warrants the question of why European leaders are acting the way they are now. Could their irrational radicalism be explained by their extensive political investment in delusional outcomes of this war that they have been selling to voters for the past four years? Or are they engaging in incessant moral posturing so as to avoid being scapegoated for the real outcome of the war?</p><p>There is probably a bit of both. But there is perhaps also an even more sinister motive, recently <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/dw-interview-with-munich-security-conference-chair-wolfgang-ischinger-about-ukraine-peace-plan/video-75123096\">expressed</a> by Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference: the idea that “as long as this war is being fought, … Europe is safe because the Ukrainians have successfully tied down this mighty Russian army.” In other words, there are some within the European political elite who perceive ending the war as being against European interests.</p><p>But regardless of what those on top think or are motivated by, the war fatigue in Europe is real. The rise of pro-Russia far-right groups in Germany and elsewhere, capitalising on the ruling elites’ shining ineptitude in handling the conflict with Russia, is a clear sign of that.</p><p>If the reparations loan scheme does not pass this week, the EU would have to go to plan B, which envisages loaning money from the EU budget. That, of course, would be met with fierce opposition from the European public.</p><p>The failure to secure funding for Ukraine may be seen as an embarrassing failure in Europe, but it would make things easier for Zelenskyy. With his administration losing popularity amid continuing military upsets and a major corruption scandal, Ukraine’s president is well on his way to becoming the chief scapegoat in this debacle.</p><p>But no more funding from Europe would allow him to declare that the West has betrayed Ukraine and proceed with the inevitable: accepting an unsavoury peace largely on Russia’s terms.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Water seeps into cracks, weakening foundations and columns while saturated soil erodes beneath buildings, increasing the risk of sudden collapses.</p><p>Overcrowding inside damaged homes further stresses weakened structures as multiple families are often forced to live together in a single house or floor.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In many cases, displaced residents pitch tents next to or even on top of the ruins of damaged buildings, exposing themselves to falling walls and concrete blocks during storms.</p><p>Displaced people often cannot leave, even when they know the risks.

He lost to incumbent President Gabriel Boric in 2021 elections, receiving 44 percent of the vote. In the 2017 elections, he contested as an independent candidate, winning some eight percent of the votes.</p><p>After serving for more than 10 years as a congressman from the centre-right Independent Democratic Union (UDI), he stepped down in 2016.  Then, in 2019, the 59-year-old leader founded the Republican Party, a more hard-line political entity, appealing to voters disillusioned with mounting insecurity and economic stagnation.</p><p>He trained as a lawyer but later entered politics, becoming a councilman for the city of Buin in 1996.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Kast was born in 1966 in Santiago, the capital city, to German immigrants with links to Nazis.</p><p>His father was a member of the Nazi Party in Bavaria before emigrating to Chile after World War II. However, the president-elect has claimed his father was a forced Nazi conscript.</p><p>Kast’s older brother Miguel was a central bank president and a government minister in the early 1980s during the rule of General Augusto Pinochet. Under his 17-year dictatorship, thousands of people were killed, forcibly disappeared and tortured.</p><p>The president-elect is an admirer of Pinochet.</p><p>Kast is married to Maria Pia Adriasola, a lawyer, with whom he has nine children.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-he-stand-for\">What does he stand for?</h2><p>A staunch Catholic, Kast opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. He has stated in the past that he would revoke the country’s limited abortion rights and prohibit the sale of the morning-after pill.</p><p>Consuelo Thiers, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, said Kast will be the most right-wing president since Pinochet.</p><p>“Kast is the first president since the end of the dictatorship to have openly supported Pinochet,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“[Former President Sebastian] Pinera, the last right-wing president, voted against Pinochet in the 1988 referendum and also embraced some progressive policies, such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage,” she added.</p><p>By contrast, Kast supports extremely conservative positions, Thiers said, adding that he was also in favour of granting freedom to individuals convicted of human rights violations committed during Pinochet’s rule.</p><p>Jenny Pribble, professor of political science and global studies at the University of Richmond, said Kast has frequently pointed to El Salvador as a model for his tougher laws on crime policies.</p><p>“He regularly voiced support for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s ‘mano dura’ [Iron-fist] crackdown on gang violence, arguing that Chile needs ‘more Bukele’,” Pribble told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It remains to be seen if Kast could or would pursue such an approach, but if Chile follows the Salvadoran model, it would constitute significant democratic backsliding.”</p><h2 id=\"what-are-his-key-policies\">What are his key policies?</h2><p>Kast campaigned on public safety, promising to take an iron-fisted approach to crime in Chile – despite the country being one of the safer nations in Latin America.</p><p>He has pledged to send the military to high-crime areas, and has promised to build more prisons. An IPSOS poll of Chilean voters in October showed 63 percent of respondents said security was a top issue for them.</p><p>The president-elect also takes a tough approach to migration. He has proposed building a police force inspired by the United States’ agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has carried out a number of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/7/ice-launches-military-style-raids-in-los-angeles-what-we-know\">“military-style” raids</a> on migrant communities and workplaces in the US this year in search of undocumented people, many of whom have been detained for deportation.</p><p>ICE is responsible for managing the US federal immigration system and has <a href=\"/podcasts/2025/11/19/the-take-is-ice-in-the-us-operating-as-secret-police\">come under increased criticism</a> for its conduct towards immigrants across the country, including those residing there legally.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4175915\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4175915\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4175915\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty_69400e1912-1765805593.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"SANTIAGO, CHILE - DECEMBER 14: Supporters of Presidential candidate Jose Antonio Kast of the &quot;Partido Republicano&quot; celebrate following the presidential runoff election on December 14, 2025 in Santiago, Chile.

The measure he is proposing would give the military sweeping powers, including warrantless searches and arrests, and would suspend key civil rights.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-other-countries-responded-to-kast-s-win\">How have other countries responded to Kast’s win?</h2><p>Right-wing allies in the region are celebrating Kast’s victory as part of a broader conservative resurgence across Latin America.</p><p>Argentina’s libertarian President Javier Milei was among the first to congratulate him. “Enormous joy at the overwhelming victory of my friend José Antonio Kast,” he posted on X.</p><p>Ecuador’s right-wing President Daniel Noboa, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://x.com/DanielNoboaOk/status/2000356612356333636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that “a new era is beginning for Chile and for the region”.</p><p></p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said his country “looks forward to partnering with his administration to strengthen regional security and revitalise our trade relationship”.</p><p>The Foreign Ministry of Spain’s leftist government said it will look to “continue strengthening the friendship between our peoples and the strategic relationship between our two countries”.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-kast-s-win-mean-for-regional-politics\">What does Kast’s win mean for regional politics?</h2><p>Chile’s election result is part of a wider regional shift towards conservative and, in some cases, far-right leadership, according to Edinburgh University’s Thiers.</p><p>“These leaders have largely come to power on similar promises, particularly the pledge to repair economies in severe distress, as in Argentina, and to improve security in a region where organised crime is rapidly expanding,” she said.</p><p>“Many people see in these candidates the promise of a drastic change that could significantly improve their lives,” Thiers added, noting it also reflects a global trend in which incumbents find it “increasingly difficult” to win re-election, “as voters punish them by choosing opposition figures who promise something radically different”.</p><p>Meanwhile, academic Navia described recent right-wing victories as “just alternation in power”.</p><p>“I would not suggest that the countries are becoming more conservative or illiberal,” he said.</p><p>“They were fed up with 20 years of left-wing rule in Bolivia and voted for a moderate right-wing candidate. In Chile, there has been alternation in power every four years since 2009. So, I would not suggest that we are seeing a tectonic shift in preferences.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
