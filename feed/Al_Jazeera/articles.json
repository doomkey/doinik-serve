They do not know who will govern this territory,” said the Ukrainian president.</p><p>He said that Russia had referred to the proposed buffer area as a “demilitarised zone” and that the US team was describing it as an “economic free zone”.</p><p>“I believe that the people of Ukraine will answer this question. Whether through elections or a referendum, there must be a position from the people of Ukraine,” he said.</p><p>Zelenskyy is under mounting US pressure to secure a deal with Russia, with reports that US President Donald Trump wants an agreement by Christmas. The general peace plan includes the 20-point framework and separate documents on security guarantees and on rebuilding Ukraine.</p><p>The full details of the framework, which revises a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">US draft</a> seen as heavily weighted in Russia’s favour, have not been released. Zelenskyy said the main issues of contention were control of the Donetsk region in the Donbas, and future governance of the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/30/ukraines-zelenskyy-says-situation-critical-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant\">Zaporizhzhia</a> nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control.</p><p>Zelenskyy pushed back against the idea of a unilateral withdrawal of troops from the Donetsk, where Ukraine controls one-fifth of the territory. “Why doesn’t the other side of the war pull back the same distance in the other direction?” he said, adding there were “a great many questions” still unresolved.</p><p>After talks on Thursday with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Ukrainian president said that security guarantees were “among the most critical elements for all subsequent steps.</p><p>The document on security guarantees would, he said, have to provide “concrete answers” on actions that would be taken if “Russia decides to launch its aggression again”.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"conflict-is-at-our-door\">‘Conflict is at our door’</h2><p>On Thursday, NATO chief Mark Rutte warned that Russia could be ready to use military force against the alliance within five years, urging members to “rapidly increase defence spending and production”.</p><p>“Conflict is at our door,” he said in a speech in Berlin. “We are Russia’s next target. I fear that too many are quietly complacent. Too many don’t feel the urgency. And too many believe that time is on our side. It is not. The time for action is now.”</p><p>In other developments, Ukraine’s allies in the so-called <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/zelenskyy-rallies-key-allies-as-ukraine-faces-russian-and-us-pressure\">Coalition of the Willing</a> discussed progress on mobilising <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/eu-proposes-using-russian-assets-loans-to-fund-105bn-package-to-ukraine\">frozen Russian sovereign assets</a> during a virtual meeting on Thursday, according to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office.</p><p>The European Commission is pushing to tap some 200 billion euros ($232bn) of Russian central bank assets immobilised in the bloc after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine to provide Kyiv with much-needed funding.</p><p>The sanctions freezing the Russian funds currently require unanimous renewal twice a year, leaving them vulnerable to a veto from Hungary, the EU country closest to Russia.</p><p>But a majority of ambassadors from the European Union’s 27 nations agreed on Thursday on a way of keeping Russian funds frozen as long as required without the need for renewal every six months.</p><p>The idea, which still needs formal approval by the finance ministers meeting on Friday, is not a done deal. Belgium, which, as the home of Euroclear – the organisation holding most of the funds, fears legal or financial retribution from Moscow.</p><p>Trump has largely sought to sideline <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/ukraines-allies-say-efforts-to-end-russias-war-at-critical-moment\">European nations</a> from the peace process, preferring to deal directly with Moscow and Kyiv in shuttle diplomacy led by special envoy Witkoff and, lately, his son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p>On Thursday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who met Rutte in Berlin, said further talks with the Americans were planned this weekend, and an international meeting on Ukraine could happen at the start of next week.</p><p class=\"p2\">Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Audrey MacAlpine said Merz and Rutte “agreed that Ukraine was closer to a ceasefire than has ever been”.</p><p class=\"p2\">“They also agreed that any territorial concessions to be made by Ukraine must be approved by Kyiv, and that in any peace negotiations moving forward, that European leaders must be involved,” she said.</p><p>The White House said Trump would send a representative to talks in Europe this weekend if there was a real chance of signing a peace agreement.</p><p>Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US president was “extremely frustrated with both sides” and “sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"russia-claims-to-hold-strategic-initiative\">Russia claims to hold ‘strategic initiative’</h2><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants to portray himself as negotiating from a position of strength, claimed on Thursday in a call with military leaders that Russian armed forces were “fully holding the strategic initiative” on the battlefield.</p><p>In 2022, Russia claimed to formally annex the Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, despite not having full control over them. Putin has said that Moscow is ready to fight on to seize the land it claims if Kyiv does not give it up.</p><p>Lieutenant General Sergei Medvedev told Putin on Thursday that troops had taken the city of Siversk in the Donetsk region, where fighting has been fierce in recent months.</p><p>The claim was denied by the Ukrainian military’s Operation Task Force East unit, which said Russia was “trying to infiltrate Siversk in small groups, taking advantage of unfavourable weather conditions, but most of these units are being destroyed on the approaches”.</p><p>The task force also said Ukrainian forces were holding the northern districts of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/ukraine-reports-large-russian-mechanised-assault-in-battle-for-pokrovsk\">Pokrovsk</a>, a key former logistics hub in Donetsk that Russian commanders said came under Moscow’s control last month.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian long-range drones hit a Russian oil rig in the Caspian Sea belonging to Russian oil company Lukoil, according to a report by The Associated Press, citing an anonymous official in the Security Service of Ukraine.</p><p>The rig reportedly took four hits, halting the extraction of oil and gas from more than 20 wells, according to the official. Russian officials and Lukoil made no immediate comment.</p><p>Ukraine also launched one of its biggest drone attacks of the war overnight, halting flights in and out of all four Moscow airports for seven hours.</p><p>Zelenskyy told the Coalition of the Willing meeting that a ceasefire was needed for elections to be held in Ukraine. The leader, whose term expired last year, is facing renewed pressure from Trump to hold a vote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Netflix’s move came with widespread antitrust concern, with progressives like Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren saying it would limit access for consumers and filmmakers in Hollywood. The White House also said it would watch the deal with heavy scrutiny.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros Discovery, however, was undercut by a slew of conflicts of interest and connections to the administration of United States President Donald Trump, and accompanying concerns about freedom of expression.</p><p>Those come in addition to recent changes at CBS News, where a conservative opinion writer has been brought in as the top boss, and there is pressure on coverage critical of Trump, including by late-night show hosts.</p><h2 id=\"kushner-conflict\">Kushner conflict</h2><p>One of the sources of funds for Paramount’s bid is Jared Kushner’s investment firm Affinity Partners, alongside financing from both Saudi and Qatari sovereign wealth funds. Kushner is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and served in an advisory role during the first Trump administration.</p><p>“If you were teaching a class at business school on conflicts of interest, this would be Exhibit A,” Nell Minow, chair of Portland, Maine-based ValueEdge Advisors, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Trump on Monday told reporters that neither Paramount nor Netflix “are friends of mine” and that he had not spoken to Kushner about the deal.</p><p>However, just last week, Trump told reporters that he would be involved in the decision about whether the Warner Bros-Netflix merger was to go through.</p><p>“I’ll be involved in that decision,” Trump told reporters as he arrived at the Kennedy Center for its annual awards show.</p><p>The Kushner connection is far from the only conflict looming over the hostile takeover. Paramount is now owned and led by David Ellison, son of billionaire Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder and a close ally of the president.</p><h2 id=\"pressing-the-press\">Pressing the press</h2><p>In the weeks before Paramount’s merger with Skydance, its CBS News network settled a lawsuit brought by Trump over an interview with then Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, which he claimed had been doctored.</p><p>The network described the allegations as baseless, but settled anyway for $16m. On the heels of that decision, Bill Owens, the executive producer of the show 60 Minutes that had been at the heart of Trump’s attacks, resigned. National Public Radio, citing two CBS staffers, said that Owens had “lost independence from corporate”.</p><p>Days later, late-night host Stephen Colbert, also on CBS, called the settlement a “<a href=\"/economy/2025/7/18/cbs-cancels-colberts-late-show-amid-pending-paramount-skydance-merger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bribe</a>”, and soon after the company announced that The Late Show, which he has hosted since 2015, would be cancelled in 2026.</p><p>Although the show was losing money, the timing of the decision to cut it was widely viewed as political.</p><p>Paramount’s merger with Skydance was approved a few weeks later. Since then, CBS News – which the president has long accused of being unfair to him – has made decisions that, critics say, are increasingly aligned with Trump’s preferences.</p><p>Among them was the appointment of ombudsman Ken Weinstein, tasked with overseeing fairness and adjudicating bias allegations. His appointment itself has been viewed as partisan. Weinstein was once a nominee to be the ambassador to Japan during Trump’s first term and has no media background.</p><p>In October, Paramount purchased The Free Press, a right-leaning publication, for $150m and installed its founder, Bari Weiss, as CBS’s editor-in-chief even though she had no prior TV experience.</p><p>“They hired an opinion columnist, Bari Weiss, to run a news network, paying enough for her services, [money they could have used] to retain plenty of the journalists they laid off. Not because running a successful Substack somehow qualifies her to manage a broadcast news giant, but because her politics are aligned with their own and, to a large degree, Trump’s,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Since her appointment, prominent anchors and producers have resigned. Claudia Milne, who oversaw standards and practices, and John Dickerson, co-anchor of the CBS Evening News, who has been with the network since 2009, both said they were leaving, as did the show’s other anchor, Maurice DuBois.</p><p>On Wednesday, CBS News announced that Tony Dokoupil would anchor the flagship evening news programme. Dokoupil has been serving as a co-anchor for CBS Mornings and joined the network in 2016.</p><p>In August, Margaret Brennan, moderator for another prominent CBS show, Face the Nation, a Sunday public affairs programme, interviewed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The interview was edited, a standard practice given time constraints. The administration complained, and the network changed its policy.</p><p>But that directive wasn’t the case for 60 Minutes. In October, longtime CBS News talent Norah O’Donnell asked the president about his pardoning of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. In 2023, Zhao had pleaded guilty to money laundering but now had business dealings connected with the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial.</p><p>The network opted not to run that part of the segment, which Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer <a href=\"https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1985230247093047608\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pointed out</a> was comparable to the very same allegation Trump made against the Harris interview of being “doctored”.</p><p>The network also cut the president’s remarks about the settlement.</p><p>“Actually, 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not,” Trump said as <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/read-full-transcript-norah-odonnell-60-minutes-interview-with-president-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seen in a transcript</a> of the full 73-minute interview that was published online.</p><p>The network complied with the president’s request. It did not air that part of the interview.</p><p>The president continues pressuring the network, while simultaneously praising the new management’s apparent friendliness.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>After 60 Minutes aired an interview with outgoing Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – who has recently become more critical of the president – Trump erupted on social media.</p><p>“My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor; it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME!” he wrote on Truth Social.</p><h2 id=\"political-manoeuvring\">‘Political manoeuvring’</h2><p>Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros Discovery includes CNN, another major news network.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that David Ellison, on a trip to the White House, told the president that Paramount would make “sweeping changes” to CNN, a frequent focus of Trump’s anger, if the merger were to go through.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump weighed in on the possible sale, saying, “I think CNN should be sold.”</p><p>On CNBC, David Ellison floated the idea of merging the networks and their respective newsgathering operations.</p><p>“We want to build a scaled news service that is basically, fundamentally, in the trust business, that is in the truth business, and that speaks to the 70 percent of Americans that are in the middle,” Ellison told the network’s David Faber.</p><p>But media experts are wary of such a move.</p><p>“It’s fair to say that a Netflix purchase of Warner Brothers would raise legitimate antitrust questions. However, the alleged political manoeuvring by Paramount to bring CNN and CBS under the same corporate roof – with implicit pledges to make both outlets’ news coverage more friendly to this administration – is even more concerning,” Rodney Benson, professor of media, culture and communication at New York University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This would constitute a dramatic increase in the concentration of news media under the control of a single owner with close ties to the party in power. It’s a choice between two bad options, but as currently structured, a Paramount purchase would be objectively worse for American democracy and freedom of the press.”</p><p>The Guardian also reported that Larry Ellison even floated cutting anchors critical of the president, including Erin Burnett, who hosts a primetime show on the cable network. The elder Ellison is not directly involved with Paramount-Skydance.</p><p>“Throwing out the credibility of CNN and other WBD [Warner Bros Discovery] holdings might benefit the Ellisons in their efforts to curry favour with Trump, but it’s not going to benefit anyone else, including shareholders, in the long run,” Stern added.</p><p>Neither Paramount-Skydance nor Warner Bros responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><p>If Netflix ends up as the buyer instead, CNN would not face similar concerns. The focus would shift to the merger’s potential impact on the film and TV production industry, particularly fears that it could limit competition.</p><p>Netflix has shown no interest in acquiring CNN or other legacy cable properties such as TNT and TBS. Those would instead be spun off into a standalone company called Discovery Global.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Currently, in Latin America, only Nicaragua and Cuba remain closely aligned with Venezuela.</p><p>Elsewhere, Caracas maintains close ties with Russia and China, and ties with Iran have strengthened in recent years amid shared opposition to US policy.</p><p>Critics have accused the Trump administration of using military pressure in an effort to open Venezuela’s vast oil reserves to US and Western companies, a charge US officials have denied.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the legislation failed to attract enough Republicans and fell short of the chamber’s 60-vote threshold to advance.</p><p>All Democrats voted for the bill alongside four Republicans: Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, as well as Susan Collins of Maine and Josh Hawley of Missouri.</p><p>Without the subsidies, premiums could more than double in cost on average, according to KFF, a health policy organisation.</p><p>For some, like Nicole Sheaff, a mother of four in New Hampshire, her prices would quintuple.</p><p>“I’m terrified we won’t be able to keep up with our mortgage. At the same time, going without health insurance is not an option. My husband has a chronic condition that he needs medication to manage, and he wouldn’t be able to afford it without health coverage. He’s lost family members to the same condition, and we simply can’t take that risk,” Sheaff said in testimony in front of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee earlier this month.</p><h2 id=\"republican-bill-fails-as-well\">Republican bill fails as well</h2><p>A Republican-led proposal earlier in the day also failed to pass. The measure would have sent up to $1,500 to those making less than 700 percent of the federal poverty line, which would be $110,000 for a single person and $225,000 for a family of four.</p><p>The payments are intended to help cover out-of-pocket costs for “Bronze” or “Catastrophic” plans on the healthcare marketplace to help meet the threshold they need to pay before their insurance kicks in.</p><p>The funds come with limitations that Democrats have long objected to, including verification of citizenship status and that the funds could not be used for abortion or gender transition treatment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>All Democrats voted against the measure and were joined by Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.</p><p>The proposed funds are far below the plans’ deductibles, meaning that even after that payment, a patient would be on the hook for up to $7,500 in out-of-pocket medical expenses before their insurance would start to pay for part of their care.</p><p>Those costs can rack up quickly for people with lower-cost plans, with a visit to a US emergency room costing between $1,000 and $3,000, while an ambulance ride can cost anywhere from $500 to more than $3,500.</p><p>Underscored by higher costs in food and housing, Felicia Burnett, national director for health care for MomsRising, a family advocacy organisation, said the families around the country are running out of ways to cut costs and higher healthcare bills only further the strain.</p><p>“The thing that I’m hearing, honestly, is fear. Families have reached the end of what they’re able to cut, and they’re fearful about their future. They don’t know what to expect when they’re not able to afford to go to the doctor or get the care that they need,” Burnett told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Families are going to be having to make really difficult choices between receiving treatment for their ongoing health issues or buying prescriptions and affording their other basic needs like food and housing.”</p><h2 id=\"americans-back-subsidy-continuation\">Americans back subsidy continuation</h2><p>Approximately 2.2 million Americans could lose their health insurance premium subsidies if they are not extended, according to the Congressional Budget Office, leaving low- and middle-income families struggling to maintain coverage.</p><p>A new Reuters/Ipsos poll found Americans back a healthcare subsidy continuation. Some 51 percent of respondents — including three-quarters of Democrats and a third of Republicans — said they support extending the subsidies. Only 21 percent said they were opposed.</p><p>Insurance companies have warned customers of the rising premiums in the new year, and Democrats argue there is not enough time to do anything but a clean extension of the tax credits. Congress is set to leave Washington at the end of this week and will not return until January 5.</p><p>With more people forgoing insurance altogether because of the cost, experts like Dr Bruce Y Lee, professor of public health at CUNY Graduate School of Public Health, says there will be additional strains on emergency rooms, which have an obligation to treat people with or without a way to pay for care.</p><p>“Flooding the emergency room with patients at different stages of conditions delays care for those who truly need it. Emergency rooms already have long waits, and this only clogs them further, affecting everyone, even those with insurance, because instead of seeing 10 people, the staff might be handling 50.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the country has a long history of killing journalists without accountability.</p><p>The October 13, 2023, strike, which wounded Al Jazeera’s Carmen Joukhadar and Elie Brakhia and left <a href=\"/news/2024/7/21/lebanese-journalist-wounded-in-israeli-strike-carries-olympic-torch\">AFP’s Christina Assi</a> with life-altering injuries, was well-documented in part because the journalists were livestreaming their reporting.</p><p>The correspondents, who had set up their equipment on a hilltop near the Lebanese-Israeli border to cover the escalation on the front, were in clearly marked press gear and vehicles.</p><p>Israeli drones had also circled above the journalists before the attack.</p><p>“We thought the fact that we could be seen was a good thing, that it would protect us. But after a little less than an hour at the site, we were hit twice by tank fire, two shells on the same target, 37 seconds apart,” Collins said at a news conference on Thursday.</p><p>“The first strike killed Issam instantly and nearly blew Christina’s legs off her body. As I rushed to put a tourniquet on her, we were hit the second time, and I sustained multiple shrapnel wounds.”</p><p>The AFP journalist added that the attack seemed “unfathomable in its brutality” at that time, but “we have since seen the same type of attack repeated dozens of times.”</p><p>Israel has been regularly employing such <a href=\"/news/2025/8/25/israel-bombs-hospital-kills-journalists-medics-dozens-more-across-gaza\">double-tap attacks</a>, including in other strikes on journalists in Gaza.</p><p>“This is not an incident in the fog of war. It was a war crime carried out in broad daylight and broadcast on live television,” Collins said.</p><p>Earlier this year, UN rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz called the 2023 strike “a premeditated, targeted and double-tapped attack from the Israeli forces, a clear violation, in my opinion, of IHL (international humanitarian law), a war crime”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"us-response\">US response</h2><p>Despite the wounding of a US citizen in the strike, the administration of then-President Joe Biden – which claimed to champion freedom of the press and the “rules-based order” – did next to nothing to hold Israel to account.</p><p>Biden’s successor, Donald Trump, also pushed on with unconditional US support for Israel.</p><p>On Thursday, Collins decried the lack of action from the US government, saying that he reached out to officials in Washington, DC, and showed them footage of the strike.</p><p>“I thought that when an American citizen is wounded in an attack carried out by the US’s greatest ally in the Middle East that we would be able to get some answers. But for two years, I’ve been met by deafening silence,” he told reporters.</p><p>“In fact, neither the Biden nor the Trump administrations have ever publicly acknowledged that a US citizen was wounded in this attack.”</p><p>Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed at least <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/another-us-citizen-killed-by-israeli-settler-attack-in-west-bank-family\">10 US citizens</a>, including Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh, over the past decade.</p><p>Senator Van Hollen said accountability in the October 13, 2023, attack is important for journalists and US citizens across the world.</p><p>“We have not seen accountability or justice in this case, and the State Department – our own government – has not done much of anything really to pursue justice in this case,” Van Hollen told reporters.</p><p>“It is part of a broader pattern of impunity for attacks on Americans and on journalists by the government of Israel.”</p><p>He called the US approach a “dereliction of duty” by the Trump and Biden administrations.</p><h2 id=\"israeli-investigation\">Israeli ‘investigation’</h2><p>Amelia Evans, advocacy director at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said Senator Welch’s description of the Israeli probe shows that the country’s “purported investigative bodies are not functioning to deliver justice but to shield Israeli forces from accountability”.</p><p>Evans urged the Trump administration to “take action” and demand the completion of probes into the killing of Abu Akleh in 2022 and the 2023 attack on journalists in Lebanon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It must demand Israel name all the military officials throughout the command chain who were involved in both cases,” she said.</p><p>“But as Israel’s key strategic ally, the United States must do much more than that. It must publicly recognise Israel’s failure to properly investigate the war crimes committed by its military.”</p><p>Israel often uses claims of investigation in response to abuses.</p><p>Former State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, who spent almost two years defending Israeli war crimes and justifying Washington’s unflinching support for its Middle East ally, acknowledged that tactic recently.</p><p>“We do know that Israel has opened investigations,” Miller, who incessantly invoked alleged Israeli probes from the State Department podium, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/3/former-us-official-without-a-doubt-over-israels-gaza-war-crimes\">said in June</a>.</p><p>“But, look, we are many months into those investigations. And we’re not seeing Israeli soldiers held accountable.”</p><h2 id=\"chilling-effect\">‘Chilling effect’</h2><p>Amid the push for justice, Collins paid tribute to his colleague Abdallah, who was killed in the 2023 Israeli attack.</p><p>“Losing Issam was tough on everyone,” he told Al Jazeera. “He was like the dynamo of the press scene in Lebanon. He knew everyone. He was always the first person to help you out if you’re in a jam. He had a larger-than-life personality.”</p><p>The killing of Abdullah, Collins added, had a “chilling effect” on the coverage of that conflict, which escalated into a full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah in September 2024.</p><p>The violence saw Israel all but wipe out nearly all <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/few-lebanese-families-return-to-villages-in-south-destroyed-by-israel-war\">the border towns</a> in Lebanon.</p><p>Even after a ceasefire was reached in November of last year, the Israeli military continues to prevent reconstruction in the devastated villages as it carries out <span><a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/israel-hits-multiple-towns-in-southern-lebanon-as-strikes-intensify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">near-daily</a></span><a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/israel-hits-multiple-towns-in-southern-lebanon-as-strikes-intensify\"> attacks</a> across the country.</p><p>“If the intention was to stop people from covering the war, then it has worked to some degree,” said Collins.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On October 14, the Swedish government announced it was nominating the CEO of IKEA, Jesper Brodin, as its candidate for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Less than a month later, as the current high commissioner, Filippo Grandi, approached the end of his mandate, Brodin resigned from his position at the Swedish furniture giant, which he had led for eight years. In January 2026, the office of the UN secretary-general is expected to present a preferred candidate to the General Assembly for what former UNHCR head of research Jeff Crisp has called a “pro forma election”. Can the former chief of an iconic multinational company become the world’s highest authority on refugees — and what will it mean if he does?</p><p>In interviews, Jesper Brodin often refers to a small pamphlet by IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, titled The Testament of a Furniture Dealer, as outlining the values that inspire his way of doing business: innovation, sustainability and collective effort over individualism. Does the UNHCR need to learn lessons from a “furniture dealer”? The question matters because Brodin’s appeal is often framed in terms of corporate values, yet it remains unclear how — or whether — these translate into the protection of refugees. Whether Brodin has any chance of making it to the Geneva post or not, the question is worth asking, for the role of IKEA as a donor and operational partner of the UNHCR is significant and is likely to grow.</p><p>While humanitarianism and business have historically been companions, particularly since the end of the Cold War, this is the first time a business leader has been proposed to head the UN refugee agency. The nomination comes at a time when the UNHCR faces a dramatic cash crunch, and when political pressures and anti-refugee sentiment are increasing globally. Many scholars and practitioners believe the future of the global refugee regime itself may be at stake. Understanding the implications of Sweden’s choice, then, requires examining how corporate humanitarianism now shapes refugee protection.</p><p>Many were taken aback by the nomination. Yet the move by Sweden is anything but surprising. Over the past three decades, corporations have taken on increased responsibility for responding to humanitarian crises, while traditional organisations compete for a rapidly diminishing pool of resources. Research on the <a href=\"https://www.commodifyingcompassion.com/publications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commodification of compassion</a> has shown how, increasingly, “doing good” and “doing well” have become one and the same. This kind of “brand aid” involved both promoting commercial brands (from Toms shoes to Starbucks) through their involvement in humanitarian causes, and turning aid itself into a branded activity — something most effectively done through corporate partnerships. It began around two decades ago but has now become the dominant model of humanitarian engagement. As one major humanitarian donor in Kinshasa told us, “It’s now all about collaborations between the private sector, businesses and philanthropists.” Indeed, when the desire to help becomes something you can sell, corporations such as IKEA can profit from involvement in global helping that builds their ethical branding. But can the UNHCR profit from being led by IKEA’s CEO? The question goes to the heart of a growing unease about the direction of the refugee regime.</p><p>We see three main problems here. First, UNHCR is caught between contradictory demands from donor states in the Global North and hosting states in the South. Brodin and IKEA’s brand of feel-good capitalism cannot reconcile these fundamental tensions over sovereignty. Jesper Brodin has been lauded as a businessman and touts his credibility as a leader and negotiator. “Trump likes people in the business world,” we are told. However, the challenges to the agency’s protection mandate require a vision that goes well beyond the smiling face of compassionate capitalism. While formally remaining the guardian of the 1951 Refugee Convention, UNHCR has been operating in what scholars such as Bhupinder Chimni have described as an “erosion” of the international refugee regime — a long-term weakening of asylum norms and burden-sharing commitments. Donor governments in the Global North have used their limited support for UNHCR’s humanitarian activities in the Global South as a way to deflect attention from the disregard for refugee rights within their own borders. How will Brodin fare in navigating these competing pressures — from containment agendas in the Global North to protection obligations that lie at the heart of UNHCR’s mandate?</p><p>Second, Brodin often mentions his experience as a supply chain manager in a company that has put logistical innovation at the core of its business strategy as an important asset for the job. Indeed, this aligns with UNHCR’s current focus on renewing its own supply chain strategy. He also talks about “bringing the values and the assets of refugees to the business community,” a phrase he uses to refer to refugees’ skills and labour potential. However, this endeavour has proved far more complex than he makes it sound. Almost 10 years after IKEA’s first attempt to integrate refugees into its own supply chains in Jordan, the number of people the programme involves remains small, and refugees in the country still face significant barriers to work and social security.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2100036X\">A study we published in 2021</a> highlighted that a focus on refugee logistics actually meant working towards integrating displaced people into global supply chains rather than providing them with material support or infrastructure. Whether for business or for disaster relief, logistics depend on networks of infrastructure and rules that only function through ongoing negotiation with governments.</p><p>Finally, the contradictions of IKEA’s corporate and foundation ownership structure — what makes it work well as a business — embody the paradox of mixing public needs for refugee protection with private objectives for profit. The IKEA Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm, has been working with UNHCR since 2010, supporting its operations in 16 countries. The UN agency defines the collaboration as “transformative”, highlighting how it has become a model for all its partnerships with the private sector. Moreover, the nomination comes at a time when major donor states, including the US, the United Kingdom and Germany, are slashing their budgets. In this geopolitical context, Sweden, while facing its own economic challenges, may well be seeking to stake its position as one of the last remaining humanitarian powers in the Western world. Brodin’s bid draws on Sweden’s perceived reputation for frugality and sustainability.</p><p>However, there is an unspoken yet fundamental contradiction between Brodin’s promise to address UNHCR’s crisis by “holding the purse strings” and the position of IKEA within global economic structures that have contributed to the humanitarian funding crisis in the first place. In 2017, following calls from EU parliamentary groups, the European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the Netherlands — where the company is headquartered — for its tax treatment of Inter IKEA, one of the two groups operating the IKEA business. The company’s ownership structure, which benefits its commercial operations, may also reduce its tax burden, thereby reducing contributions to public finances. Here, as in many other cases, big business promises to fix global inequality it has helped create.</p><p>In the present global climate of hostility to migrants and refugees, Brodin and IKEA’s brand of feel-good capitalism risks further hollowing out UNHCR’s protection mandate, reducing humanitarianism to a matter of well-managed supply chains. The stakes are high: when humanitarian priorities are shaped by corporate logic, core protections — from asylum access to basic assistance — risk being eroded. What benefits a business organisation does not necessarily serve the rights or needs of refugees.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
