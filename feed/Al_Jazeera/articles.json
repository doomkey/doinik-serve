            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The United Kingdom’s new left-wing political party, Your Party, cofounded by former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, has become mired in a bitter divide between its leaders.</p><p>On Saturday, Your Party cofounder Zarah Sultana said she would <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/corbyns-new-party-faces-crisis-as-cofounder-skips-first-day-of-conference\">skip the first day</a> of the newly formed group’s inaugural two-day conference following a serious disagreement over who could attend.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-your-party\">What is Your Party?</h2><p>After the UK’s last general election in 2024, which the Labour Party won in a landslide following 14 years of Conservative Party rule, Corbyn and four other left-leaning independents – Shockat Adam, Adnan Hussain, Ayoub Khan and Iqbal Mohamed – formed the Independent Alliance, which focused heavily on taking a pro-Palestine position over Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Corbyn, 76, stepped down as leader of the Labour Party following yet another election defeat to the Conservatives in 2019.</p><p>Among other issues, Corbyn had long weathered <a href=\"/news/2022/9/25/what-really-happened-during-labours-anti-semitism-crisis\">accusations of anti-Semitism</a> during his leadership of Labour, something many described as a “witch-hunt” against him and his supporters.</p><p>In 2020, the Equality and Human Rights Commission published its findings that Labour had broken the law on anti-Jewish racism. It partially blamed “serious failings” under Corbyn’s leadership of the party.</p><p>In response, Corbyn stated that anti-Semitism was “absolutely abhorrent”, but added: “The scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.”</p><p>As a result, he was immediately suspended from the party. He was readmitted in 2020, but ultimately left the Labour Party altogether in 2024 – after nearly 60 years of membership – to become an independent MP.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In late July this year, he announced that he would cofound a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/15/corbyn-sultana-to-form-uk-party-flash-in-the-pan-or-real-alternative\">new socialist party</a> with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, 32, who also became an independent after leaving Labour on July 3. Other members of the Independent Alliance also joined. The aim was to present the new party as a credible left‑wing alternative to the governing Labour Party.</p><p>In a statement at the time, Corbyn and Sultana said: “The system is rigged when the government says there is no money for the poor, but billions for war.”</p><p>The statement added that they envisioned a party “rooted in our communities, trade unions and social movements”.</p><p>“As a party, we’ve got to come together and be united because division and disunity will not serve the interests of the people that we want to represent,” Corbyn said during the inaugural conference, which took place in the northwestern English city of Liverpool and finished with a rousing rendition of Bella Ciao – an Italian antifascist folk song – by attendees.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-did-sultana-refuse-to-attend-the-first-day\">Why did Sultana refuse to attend the first day?</h2><p>Sultana announced on Saturday that she would not attend in protest against one of her supporters being denied entry to the event and several others being expelled from the party for also allegedly being members of the far-left Socialist Workers Party.</p><p>Sultana told the Press Association news agency: “I’m disappointed to see on the morning of our founding conference, people who have travelled from all over the country, spent a lot of money on their train fare, on hotels, on being able to participate in this conference, being told that they have been expelled.”</p><p>She added: “That is a culture that is reminiscent of the Labour Party, how there were witch-hunts on the eve of conference, how members were treated with contempt.”</p><p>However, an unnamed spokesperson for Your Party defended the decision to bar members of the Socialist Workers Party. The spokesperson told UK media: “Members of another national political party signed up to Your Party in contravention of clearly stated membership rules – and these rules were enforced.”</p><p>Sultana attended the second day of the conference on Sunday, when she apologised for what she described as “hiccups” during the launch of the party.</p><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">However, she added, “The expulsions, bans and censorship on conference floor are unacceptable. It’s undemocratic. It’s an attack on members and on this movement.”</p><h2 id=\"what-else-have-the-leaders-disagreed-about\">What else have the leaders disagreed about?</h2><p>The fledgling party has been beset by disagreements over several issues.</p><h3 id=\"funding-issues\">Funding</h3><p>In November, senior figures including Corbyn, Iqbal Mohamed, and Adnan Hussain accused Sultana of withholding more than 800,000 pounds ($1.06m) in donations made to the party when it was first announced in July.</p><p>Since the party was still in the process of being formally registered as a legal entity, the funds were temporarily collected by a private company called MoU Operations Ltd, which is controlled by Sultana.</p><p>The BBC reported on November 8 that an unnamed spokesperson for Sultana said she “is in the process of transferring all funds and data” but was conducting “essential due diligence as part of this process”.</p><p>As of mid-November, the party had received a “small portion” of the funds, according to a statement by Your Party leaders. There has not been a more recent update on the status of the remaining funds.</p><h3>Leadership model</h3><p>There was a disagreement over how the newly formed party should be led.</p><p>While Sultana was pushing for a collective of leaders to reflect grassroots representation – what she terms “maximum member democracy” – Corbyn said a single, traditional leader would be more effective.</p><p>In the end, the party voted for a collective of leaders by a narrow margin of 51.6 percent to 48.4 percent.</p><p>This means that the party will now be headed by a collective of leaders, which will be overseen by a party member who is not a member of parliament.</p><p>Ultimately, many see the problems which have beset the party as being down to a fight for control between Corbyn and Sultana.</p><p>The UK media have reported that Corbyn supporters were irritated by Sultana’s decision to hold a pre-conference rally on the night before the conference began. While she called it a Your Party event, they claimed it was organised solely by her.</p><h3 id=\"desertions-several-members-including-mps-have-quit-the-party\">Party desertions</h3><p>Several members of the new party, including some working MPs, have already quit as supporters of Corbyn accuse Sultana of trying to undermine him and vice versa. On November 14, Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain announced in an X post that he had decided to leave.</p><p>“The culture surrounding the party has become dominated by persistent infighting, factional competition and a struggle for power, position and influence rather than a shared commitment to the common good,” Hussain wrote in a statement.</p><p>“Instead of openness, cooperation and outward focus, the environment has too often felt toxic, exclusionary and deeply disheartening,” he added.</p><p></p><p>A week later, Dewsbury and Batley MP Iqbal Mohamed also announced his departure.</p><p>In a statement posted on X on November 21, Mohamed said: “The many false allegations and smears made against me and others, and reported as fact without evidence, have been surprising and disappointing. However, I am confident that my colleagues and I have acted professionally, patiently, and in good faith throughout.”</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

Cheung was arrested on suspicion of “attempting to incite discord”, The Standard newspaper reported.</p><p>On Saturday, authorities arrested Miles Kwan, a 24-year-old student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, after he created an online petition calling for greater transparency and accountability from the government, multiple reports said.</p><p>The petition included four demands, including the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry to probe the circumstances of the fire, including whether potential conflicts of interest may have contributed to the disaster.</p><p>Before it was removed from the internet on Saturday, the petition had garnered more than 10,000 supporters.</p><p>China’s national security office in Hong Kong appeared to condemn the petition before its removal, accusing activists of using “the banner of ‘petitioning the people’ to incite confrontation and tear society apart.”</p><p>Hong Kong’s Office for Safeguarding National Security also accused figures with “sinister intentions” of exploiting the fire to return the city to the “black-clad violence” that erupted during mass antigovernment protests in 2019.</p><p>On Monday, a commentary in the Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po newspaper called on the public to be vigilant against “anti-government elements” with “malicious intentions”.</p><p>“They have even gone so far as to ‘act as representatives’ to establish a so-called ‘concern group,’ put forward so-called ‘four demands,’ distribute leaflets, and launch a petition, all in an attempt to incite public unrest,” the commentary said.</p><p>“Their actions are utterly devoid of conscience and humanity.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"outrageous\">‘Outrageous’</h2><p>The crackdown is the latest sign of the narrowing space for dissent in Hong Kong following Beijing’s sweeping overhaul of the semi-autonomous territory’s political and legal landscape in response to the 2019 demonstrations.</p><p>China has repeatedly denied that Hong Kong’s civil liberties have deteriorated, insisting that the passage of two far-reaching national security laws have ensured that residents’ rights and freedoms are “even better protected” than before.</p><p>Beijing has also argued that the legislation ensures the continuation of Hong Kong’s partial autonomy under “One Country, Two Systems,” the arrangement under which UK returned the territory to China in 1997.</p><p>Nathan Law, an activist and critic of Beijing who served in Hong Kong’s legislature, called the authorities’ actions “outrageous” and the latest example of a “highly authoritarian trend” in the former British colony.</p><p>“The goal of the government is to create a chilling effect by arresting these individuals. Any civil actions without the government’s permission are now illegal,” Law, who lives in self-exile in the UK and is wanted by Hong Kong authorities on national security charges, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The government worries about people congregating and initiating collective action, whether it is political or not.”</p><p>The Hong Kong Police Force did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Ronny Tong, a non-official member of Hong Kong’s de facto cabinet, disputed the suggestion that authorities were stifling criticism of the government’s handling of the disaster.</p><p>“If you look at the major newspapers in Hong Kong, there are very many various suggestions and… criticisms of the handling of the incident in Hong Kong, so by no means is there a general suppression of different views or criticisms of the government,” Tong told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Tong said that that while it would be inappropriate to comment on the cases of people who had yet to face the judicial process, the law allowed for “constructive” criticism of the authorities.</p><p>“One must not simply make the case of a few arrests – the circumstances of which are still unclear – to come to the conclusion that the Hong Kong government are trying to stifle views which they don’t like,” he said.</p><p>At least 151 people were killed in Wednesday’s blaze at a high-rise apartment complex in Hong Kong’s northern district of Tai Po, the worst fire in the city since at least 1948.</p><p>The scale of the disaster has prompted scrutiny of safety standards in Hong Kong’s construction industry, with authorities honing in on how the use of substandard materials in renovation works on the block may have aided the fire’s rapid spread.</p><p>Hong Kong authorities have arrested 13 people as part of their investigations into the fire, including the directors of an engineering consultant company involved in the renovations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"commission-of-inquiry\">Commission of Inquiry</h2><p>While the Hong Kong police and the city’s Independent Commission Against Corruption have launched separate investigations, the government has so far not indicated that it will establish an independent commission of inquiry.</p><p>Hong Kong authorities launched commissions of inquiry, a legacy of British rule in the territory, in response to many past disasters.</p><p>Past inquiries, which have been typically led by a judge, looked into tragedies including a 2012 ferry accident that left 39 people dead and a 1996 fire that cost 41 lives.</p><p>Kevin Yam, a former lawyer in Hong Kong, said that Beijing could not tolerate public criticism of the official response to the fire as it was concerned that “the smallest spark of dissent can snowball into something bigger”.</p><p>“Those who read George Orwell will know that phrase, ‘They who control the past control the present future, and they who control the present control the future.’ And the Communist Party of China has always been very good at that,” Yam, who is wanted by the Hong Kong authorities for alleged national security offences, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They see that once they silence the dissent and the criticism, and then they flood the zone with favourable stories about how they handled things, then that becomes the official record of history.”</p><p>Once known for its raucous media, vibrant civil society and political diversity, Hong Kong has dramatically curtailed the space for dissent since the 2019 protests.</p><p>Under the laws, which have been widely condemned by foreign governments and rights groups, authorities have forced the closure of critical media outlets, effectively eliminated opposition parties from the city’s legislature, and banned politically sensitive protests.</p><p>The mainland Chinese and Hong Kong governments have defended the laws as a proportionate response to the antigovernment protests, which began peacefully before descending into street battles between demonstrators and police, and other national security threats facing the territory.</p><p>In a speech marking the fifth anniversary of the 2020 law in June, Xia Baolong, Beijing’s top official for Hong Kong affairs, called the legislation a “guardian” of the city’s semi-autonomous status and stability.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Legally, there are no conditions for a pardon.</p><p>The pardon request will first be reviewed by the Ministry of Justice’s pardons department, which will send its opinion to Herzog’s office.</p><p>While the president usually follows the ministry’s recommendation, he is not required to do so.</p><p>Herzog has previously said he sees a negotiated settlement between prosecutors and Netanyahu’s legal team as the most effective way to conclude this legal matter.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3360783\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3360783\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3360783\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Interactive_Netanhyahu_prosecution_charges_trial_Israel_court_Dec2_2024-1733138488.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Netanhyahu_prosecution_charges_trial_Israel_court_Dec2_2024-1733138488\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3360783\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-have-israeli-leaders-and-people-reacted\">How have Israeli leaders and people reacted?</h2><p>Israelis <a href=\"/news/2025/12/1/israelis-protest-in-tel-aviv-after-netanyahu-seeks-pardon-on-fraud-cases\">protested</a> outside Herzog’s home in Tel Aviv on Sunday night against Netanyahu’s pardon petition, joined by opposition politicians, including Naama Lazimi.</p><p>Herzog and Netanyahu are former political rivals, but they have a good working relationship.</p><p>“After receiving all of the relevant opinions, the president will responsibly and sincerely consider the request,” a statement from Herzog’s office said in response to the pardon request.</p><p>“He basically says, ‘I’m completely innocent,’” Yohanan Plesner, president of The Israel Democracy Institute, told The Associated Press news agency.</p><p>“So there is no assumption of responsibility … this might project a problematic message to all public figures and to what our public norms might look like.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-netanyahu-accused-of\">What is Netanyahu accused of?</h2><p>Here’s a breakdown:</p><h3>Case 1000, the ‘Gifts Affair’</h3><p>Netanyahu was charged in 2019, while he was prime minister, with fraud and breach of trust during his tenure as minister of communications from 2014 to 2017.</p><p>The charges say Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, received lavish gifts worth nearly $200,000, including champagne and cigars, from two wealthy businessmen in exchange for political favours.</p><p>The businessmen are Israeli Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer.</p><p>Milchan testified that he provided gifts to Netanyahu in June 2020. Packer was also implicated as having shared the costs of these expensive gifts with Milchan.</p><p>Netanyahu is accused of advancing Milchan’s interests by helping him secure a US visa renewal by lobbying US officials on his behalf. He is also accused of advancing a tax exemption law that could have benefitted Israelis abroad, like Milchan.</p><p>As for Packer, media reports claimed that he was making big investments in Israel, and his lawyers had inquired about Israeli citizenship or residency for the billionaire, which would have benefitted him tax-wise.</p><p>Fraud and breach of trust can carry prison sentences of up to three years, while bribery can carry up to 10 years and/or a fine.</p><p>The goods were valued at approximately 700,000 shekels ($186,000), according to a statement made by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit following the indictment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Case 2000, the ‘Netanyahu-Mozes affair’</h3><p>This case also charges him with fraud and breach of trust, saying Netanyahu made a deal with businessman Aron Mozes, a controlling shareholder of the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, which was critical of Netanyahu.</p><p>The alleged deal was for favourable coverage of Netanyahu in exchange for legislation to slow the growth of the rival Israel Hayom newspaper, which had overtaken Yedioth Ahronoth. A legislative bill was being considered that would have limited Israel Hayom’s circulation.</p><p>The indictment summary said, despite “a profound rivalry” between the two men, they conducted three series of meetings between 2008 and 2014.</p><p>During these meetings, Netanyahu and Mozes “engaged in discussions regarding the promotion of their common interests: improving the coverage that Mr. Netanyahu received in the ‘Yedioth Ahronoth’ media group; and the imposition of restrictions on the ‘Israel Hayom’ newspaper”, the indictment said.</p><h3>Case 4000, the ‘Bezeq affair’</h3><p>This case indicts Netanyahu for granting regulatory favours to Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq in return for positive coverage on Walla, a news website controlled by its former chairman.</p><p>Netanyahu, communications minister at the time, allegedly provided regulatory benefits to Shaul Elovitch, the owner of Bezeq, who also controlled the news website Walla.</p><p>The benefits reportedly included mergers and financial gains. In exchange, Elovitch provided favourable coverage of Netanyahu and his wife.</p><p>Netanyahu “dealt on several occasions with regulatory matters pertaining to Mr Elovitch, and took specific actions that promoted significant business interests of Mr Elovitch of substantial financial value”, the indictment summary said.</p><p>Besides fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu has been charged with bribery in this case.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-israeli-politicians-were-charged-with-corruption\">What other Israeli politicians were charged with corruption?</h2><p>Since 1996, <a href=\"/news/2018/2/14/israels-leaders-and-corruption-allegations\">every Israeli prime minister</a> has been the subject of a corruption investigation.</p><h3>1996-99</h3><p>Netanyahu, in his first term as prime minister, was investigated for reasons including a kickback scheme and influence peddling.</p><h3>1999-2001</h3><p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak was investigated on allegations of illegal campaign financing, bribery and money laundering.</p><h3>2001-06</h3><p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in the late 1990s in what came to be known as the Greek Island affair.</p><h3>2006-09</h3><p>Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was convicted of taking $430,000 in bribes while he was mayor of Jerusalem. He was imprisoned in February 2016 for fraud, breach of trust, falsifying corporate records, and tax evasion.</p><h3>2009-21</h3><p>Netanyahu returned to the premiership. During this period, he was charged with the cases above, while two other cases against him were dropped.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It read: “Do not go gentle into that good night… Rage, rage against the dying of the light.”</p><p>I liked the rhythm and the urgency of it. But I didn’t yet know what it meant to rage from within the belly of the beast.</p><p>I would learn soon enough.</p><h2 id=\"when-education-isn-t-enough\">When education isn’t enough</h2><p>I began studying law while in solitary confinement at the Hudson County Correctional Center in Kearny, New Jersey. At 25, I was educated, street-smart, well-travelled, well-read, and owned and ran a successful business selling phones and laptops. And still, I couldn’t follow the jargon in court. It sounded like a strange language that everyone else spoke fluently. I asked my lawyers some questions, but I didn’t press. I was new. I trusted them.</p><p>It’s a mistake that still haunts me. If I’d known what I now know, I would have insisted on different strategies in court to fight my case. Had I done so, I don’t believe I would have been handed two consecutive life sentences – 150 years in prison.</p><p>You see, the system wants you to sit down, shut up, and comply. But every misstep is hung around your neck like a noose. And when your lawyer fails you, if you try to appeal, the court’s starting point is “sound trial strategy”, meaning they believe the defence lawyer did their job well to begin with.</p><h2 id=\"into-the-law-library-no-saviours-just-strategy\">Into the law library: No saviours, just strategy</h2><p>When I got to New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) in Trenton in 2005, an older prisoner told me, “Your job is to stay out of trouble, live, and fight for your life. There are no saviours. Get to the law library and learn.”</p><p>So I joined the Inmate Legal Association (ILA), a prisoner-run paralegal group. They trained me, and I became an uncertified paralegal.</p><p>Soon after joining the ILA, I started my own legal fight and began helping others. My first victory was a procedural motion that helped a fellow inmate get back to court. That memory still sits like a trophy in my mind. Helping someone else made the struggle worth it.</p><p>Another win came in the federal habeas court, where I wanted to challenge my conviction. My petition was dismissed. But I appealed. I trusted my research. I filed. And I won. The result didn’t stick, and the petition was later denied. But the short-lived victory meant something: we can push back.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4098860\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4098860\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4098860\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Scanned_20251002_212050-1-1759830913-1-1762852879.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C591&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Prison series\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4098860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Illustration by Martin Robles]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hidden-resistance-behind-bars\">Hidden resistance behind bars</h2><p>This is the life of a pro se litigant — pro se means “for oneself” in Latin — someone who represents themselves in court. Serving as your own legal counsel is rarely a choice; more often, it’s a necessity. I hired my own attorney, and the state assigned a second lawyer for my trial and initial appeals. After that, I was on my own. I couldn’t afford further legal representation. And I’m far from alone.</p><p>Imprisoned people file tens of thousands of pro se motions every year. US court data from 2000-2019 shows that 91 percent of legal challenges by prisoners were filed pro se.</p><p>This is not new. A Bureau of Justice Statistics report from the mid-1990s showed that 93 percent of federal habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners then were also pro se.</p><p>These numbers confirm what we see inside: legal representation ends after pretty much the first appeal, and beyond that, we’re on our own, with no training, limited resources, and overwhelming barriers.</p><h2 id=\"voices-from-the-legal-underground\">Voices from the legal underground</h2><p>Take Martin Robles, a 52-year-old Puerto Rican who’s spent nearly 30 years behind bars. Once he no longer had appointed counsel, Martin took charge of his appeals. “The courts don’t follow their own rules,” he told me. “They don’t hold prosecutors accountable like they do us. We’re time-barred (and appeals are denied) — for being an hour late. But prosecutors? They get unlimited leeway.”</p><p>The courts don’t care about the difficulties prisoners endure to communicate with paralegals or to research case law to prepare legal briefs. Access to the law library to do all this is curtailed. We have to request a pass to visit during our housing unit’s weekly rotation, but the passes are limited, and sometimes we wait weeks to enter the library. Courts routinely impose deadlines on prisoners that are also impossible to meet, yet fail to give any latitude for prison constraints. One friend, for example, was given a month to file a legal brief but wasn’t allowed in the prison library during this time as he had a cast on his arm, and this was considered a possible weapon. But without access to the library, he could not get help from paralegals, consult legal reference books, or use the computers to type his brief. The deadline passed, and he wrote to the judge about his plight, but was not given an extension.</p><p>Martin has turned his outrage into something productive. “I’m starting the first Spanish-language law class at NJSP,” he said.</p><p>“It’s voluntary. I’m doing it for the people. I’m tired of them being taken advantage of.”</p><h2 id=\"when-money-can-t-buy-protection\">When money can’t buy protection</h2><p>Kashif Hassan, 39, entered the system with a master’s degree and hired private attorneys. “I threw money at lawyers, and thought I was good,” he said. “But I got manipulated and railroaded. I didn’t fight early enough.”</p><p>Eventually, Kashif picked up legal texts and took charge of his future. “My first win was a bail motion in the county [jail],” he said.</p><p>“If you don’t fight, no one else will. Pro se litigation works if you know what you’re doing. But courts treat us like amateurs. Like we don’t count.”</p><h2 id=\"a-lawyer-who-didn-t-prepare-a-defence\">A lawyer who didn’t prepare a defence</h2><p>Tommy Koskovich, 47, was arrested while in high school. “My attorney mocked me,” he recalled. “Said he wasn’t getting paid enough by the Public Defender’s Office, so he didn’t prepare a defence. When I refused the plea deal, he said, ‘I didn’t prepare a defence for you.’”</p><p>Tommy has subsequently lost all his appeals, but he is now pursuing his only remaining options: a motion to overturn his sentence and clemency. He has also applied for the latter through New Jersey’s new Clemency Initiative.</p><p>Throughout the process, Tommy has learned to identify legal issues. “Sometimes courts only take your issue seriously after you file pro se,” he said. “That’s how State v Comer happened, where an inmate raised the issue himself.”</p><p>James Comer was 17 when he was convicted of a felony murder and other offences after carrying out several armed robberies with two others in the year 2000. He was sentenced to prison until the age of 85. He likely would have died in jail, but he took his fight with his lawyers to the New Jersey Supreme Court and was resentenced. He was freed in October after serving 25 years.</p><p>Martin, Kashif and Tommy reflect what many of us behind the wall already know: the system isn’t built for justice – it’s built for conviction. The moment your initial appeals end, you’re on your own.</p><p>Every mistake you make is punished. Every misstep is used to shut the door tighter.</p><h2 id=\"the-legal-fight-is-also-a-moral-one\">The legal fight is also a moral one</h2><p>Still, we fight. We write in broken chairs under flickering lights. We teach others how to file motions, navigate case law, and decode legal jargon.</p><p>As for me, I’m working on a motion for DNA testing to prove my innocence and an alternative motion to vacate my sentence. But a few cases are pending in the New Jersey Supreme Court that could help my case, so I’m waiting on their outcomes.</p><p>Because we do not go silent.<br>\nWe do not go gentle into that good night.<br>\nWe rage – against wrongful convictions, indifferent courts, and a system that hopes we’ll give up.<br>\nWe rage, even when no one is watching.<br>\nEven when no one believes.<br>\nEven when the victories are small.</p><p>Rage, after all, is hope in motion.</p><p><em><strong>This is the first story in a three-part series on how prisoners are taking on the US justice system through law, prison hustles and hard-won education.</strong></em></p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

Abdullah has the same calm look, but his hair is now longer and his skin has a tinge of yellow. Standing beside him in the picture is Mohammad, who is now 11, and Mahmoud, who is eight. Towering above them and proudly placing his arms on their shoulders is their father, Ahmad.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4132663\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4132663\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132663\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PHOTO-2025-11-12-18-12-53-1-1-1764165627.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"[Federica Marsi/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4132663\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abdullah, right, his brothers Mahmoud and Mohammad, left, and father Ahmad [Courtesy of Iman Ismail Mohammad Abu Mazid]</figcaption></figure><p>The cancer that consumes Abdullah also tore their family apart.</p><p>While Abdullah, his mother Iman and one-year-old Qamar were granted seats on a medical evacuation flight that took them to Italy, the rest of the family – Ahmad and the other two children, Mohammad and Mahmoud – stayed behind in Gaza, which Israel continues to bomb despite a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">ceasefire agreement</a> being in place.</p><p>Now the disease could be what brings them back together. In early November, a team of doctors in Gaza took blood samples from Abdullah’s siblings and sent them to Italy to determine their compatibility as donors for the boy’s marrow transplant.</p><p>If one is a match, they will all be allowed onto a medical flight to Padova. If the results are negative, they will need to apply to the Italian government for family reunion – a much longer process fraught with logistical challenges.</p><p>Iman said the fate of his family hangs on those results. They could save Abdullah from the disease, and the rest of their family from Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>“I fear for their safety every day,” she said. “Abdullah misses his siblings, and I miss my children, too.”</p><p>Abdullah shyly nodded in confirmation, adding that he misses a nicely done kebab, too. He has no penchant for Italian food and reminisces about the seasoned meat the family’s go-to restaurant in Deir el-Balah served.</p><p>Asked whether he would like to bring Gaza to Padova, he said, “Not all of it, just my neighbourhood.”</p><h2 id=\"escaping-war-in-gaza\">Escaping war in Gaza</h2><p>Iman found out she was pregnant with Qamar in March 2024, as the war was raging around her. At first, she thought her period had skipped because she had been barely surviving on water and bread. When it became apparent that a fourth child was on the way, she recalls feeling “terrified”.</p><p>“I was constantly worried and anxious that they’d tell me the baby was deformed, abnormal, sick,” because of the lack of food and sanitation, she said. “My body was exhausted, and I couldn’t stand. I spent my entire pregnancy lying on the floor,” she says rapidly in Arabic, before picking up the toddler tugging insistently at her leg and placing her on her lap to feed her.</p><p>Her baby girl was delivered in a tented field hospital in Deir el-Balah that lacked basic sanitation and medicines, as victims of Israeli bombardment were rushed in.</p><p>“You could see someone injured at any moment – an amputated limb, an amputated hand … The scenes were horrific,” she said. “And the doctors were nervous because the area was being targeted.”</p><p>Months later, in April this year, Abdullah started feeling sick.</p><p>“He was yellow, had abdominal cramps, a headache,” she said.</p><p>At the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah, Abdullah was strapped to an IV and given painkillers and antibiotics. The fluids kept the fever from spiking, but nothing could stop the cancer from spreading.</p><p>The family was advised to take him to the European Hospital in Khan Younis, despite the Israeli army having announced a major expansion of military operations in the area.</p><p>The 10-kilometre (six-mile) ride southward was “terrifying”.</p><p>“There wasn’t a soul on the street,” Iman remembered. Doctors could only offer diluted chemotherapy treatment. Abdullah was flagged to the World Health Organization (WHO) for medical evacuation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, medical evacuation was granted shortly afterwards. Iman and her husband, Ahmad, did not need words to take the decision to split the family.</p><p>“There was more silence than dialogue,” she said.</p><p>Ahmad arrived at the European Hospital on May 13 to bid Iman, Abdullah and Qamar an emotional farewell. As he was leaving the compound, the earth shook and a slab of concrete flew right past his head.</p><p>That day, the Israeli military announced they had dropped nine bunker-busting bombs and dozens of other munitions on the hospital’s courtyard and surrounding area. They claimed to have killed Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar and more than 20 other members of the group. International law prohibits attacks on hospitals, which constitute a war crime. Hamas confirmed Sinwar’s death in August, but did not provide details on how he died.</p><p>“I was convinced that [my husband] had been killed,” Iman recalled.</p><p>“I kept calling him and screaming, saying, ‘I swear, he’s gone’,” she said. “I called 10 times or more, but he didn’t answer. I was certain he had been martyred. But I didn’t give up, I didn’t give up! After so many attempts, finally, he answered.”</p><h2 id=\"a-new-life-away-from-home\">A new life away from home</h2><p>Abdullah is among more than 5,500 children who have been evacuated from Gaza through medical evacuations coordinated by the WHO.</p><p>A total of 8,000 people have so far been able to leave for life-saving treatment, but 16,500 people are still waiting, according to United Nations figures. Of those, 3,800 are children.</p><p>Since July 2024, more than 900 patients have died while awaiting medical evacuations, according to the WHO.</p><p>Abdullah was taken to Padova thanks to the doggedness of lawyer Rebecca Fedetto, who in February founded an organisation to facilitate and support medical evacuations.</p><p>“I knew I wanted to do something and be active,” she told Al Jazeera. “I couldn’t live normally, my conscience didn’t allow it.”</p><p>Fedetto worked the phone in search of anyone who could help her navigate the process of paperwork, approvals, and coordination required to provide a referral for a patient to be moved to a medical facility abroad.</p><p>“At one point, I thought I wouldn’t make it, it was all so complex,” she said. “When it started to work out, I couldn’t believe it.”</p><p>Her self-made NGO, Padova Abbraccia i Bambini (Padova Hugs Children), has facilitated six medical evacuations, welcoming 25 people. Among them are six-year-old Ahmad, who is recovering from third-degree burns on nearly half of his body, and eight-year-old Seela, who lost both legs.</p><p>A team of volunteers caters to the families’ every need, offering transport, babysitting, homeschooling and emotional support.</p><p>Fedetto said the city’s response has been overwhelmingly welcoming.</p><p>“Many people have emailed us asking if they could help, because this war is something that touches our conscience” she said. “Often people want to help, they just don’t know how.”</p><p>WHO has appealed for countries to offer more medical evacuations, as Gaza’s healthcare remains limited. Only 18 hospitals out of 36 are partially functional.</p><p>More than 30 countries have so far heeded the call, including European Union member states, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>“We are thankful for their solidarity,” Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the occupied Palestinian territory, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Peeperkorn said that under the terms of the ceasefire, WHO should be able to evacuate 50 patients per day, in addition to their caregivers.</p><p>“To make this possible, more countries must step forward with generosity and accept patients in need,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
