The shutdown is likely ‍to be brief.</p><p>⁠Lawmakers from both parties have been working to ensure a debate over immigration enforcement does not disrupt other government operations, despite mounting Democratic anger over <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/us-protesters-begin-nationwide-strike-as-doj-launches-pretti-killing-probe\">the killing of two people</a> by immigration agents in Minnesota.</p><p>This is a marked contrast from last fall, when Republicans and Democrats dug into their positions in a dispute over healthcare, prompting a shutdown that lasted a record 43 days and cost the US economy an estimated $11bn.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><span>“Technically, there will be a partial government shutdown come midnight on Saturday,” Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan said earlier on Friday, reporting from Washington, DC.</span></p><p>“The earliest that the House of Representatives can take a look at the changes, which the US Senate approved late on Friday, is not before Monday. That’s because they’ve been in recess all this week. They should be coming back to Washington this weekend,” Jordan said.</p><p><span>But there is also a concern the shutdown could drag out longer, given political polarisation around Trump’s administration’s harsh immigration raids and the killing of US citizens at those operations.</span></p><p>“So there is the expectation that this could be resolved early next week. But there is the possibility that it may not be,” Jordan added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The funding impasse has been driven by Democratic anger over aggressive immigration enforcement following the fatal shootings of two US citizens – Alex Pretti and Renee Good – by federal agents in separate incidents this month in the northern city of <a href=\"/podcasts/2026/1/29/the-take-they-picked-the-wrong-state-how-minneapolis-is-fighting-back\">Minneapolis amid a violent operation</a> against undocumented migrants.</p><p>The killings in Minneapolis have become a flashpoint that has hardened opposition to approving new money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) without changes to how immigration agencies operate.</p><p>“The nation is reaching a breaking point,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote. “The American people are demanding that Congress step up and force change.”</p><p>“Instead of going after drug smugglers, child predators, and human traffickers, the Trump Administration is wasting valuable resources targeting peaceful protestors in Chicago and Minneapolis,” Senate Democratic Minority Whip Dick Durbin posted on social media.</p><p>“This Administration continues to make Americans less safe.”</p><p>As lawmakers in both parties called for investigations into the fatal shootings, Trump said he didn’t want a shutdown and negotiated the rare deal with Schumer, his frequent adversary. Trump then encouraged members of both parties to cast a “much needed Bipartisan ‘YES’ vote.”</p><p>Under the deal negotiated between the White House and Senate Democratic leaders, lawmakers approved five outstanding funding bills to finance most of the federal government through the end of the fiscal year in September.</p><p>The deal approved by the Senate separates funding for the DHS – which oversees immigration agencies – from the broader government funding package, allowing lawmakers to approve spending for agencies such as the Pentagon and the Department of Labor while they consider new restrictions on how federal immigration agents operate.</p><p>Funding for the DHS has now been split off and extended for just two weeks under a stopgap measure intended to give lawmakers time to negotiate changes to the department’s operations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A chameleon.</p><p>Those are just some of the terms being used to describe Kevin Warsh, President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>If confirmed by the US Senate, Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor, will replace Jerome Powell after his term ends in May. <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/30/trump-nominates-kevin-warsh-to-replace-powell-as-fed-chair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump announced Warsh</a> as his nominee on Friday.</p><p>“I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” Trump posted on his Truth Social site. “On top of everything else, he is ‘central casting,’ and he will never let you down.”</p><p>Over the past year, Trump has repeatedly lambasted Powell for not lowering interest rates at a pace and to a level of his liking. Warsh is expected to have a smoother experience – at least initially.</p><p>That’s partly because he comes from a Republican milieu. His father-in-law is Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune and a longtime Trump donor and ally.</p><p>Warsh is also currently serving as a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution, a think tank at Stanford University, where he also lectures as a visiting scholar.</p><p>But more importantly, critics say, Warsh has shown a willingness to align with Trump’s policies. After years of supporting high interest rates to control inflation, Warsh has made recent statements arguing for lower rates, in line with the president’s views.</p><h2 id=\"a-history-of-shape-shifting\">A history of ‘shape-shifting’</h2><p>It is this flexibility that has prompted a mixed bag of reactions to Warsh’s nomination.</p><p>“He’s a very good chameleon,” said Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a policy research organisation. “He comes across as informed and intellectual, but when you unpack what he says, there’s not a lot there.”</p><p>Amarnath’s criticism was based on years of observing Warsh’s policy stance.</p><p>Warsh, 55, joined the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors in 2006 at age 35, after serving on former President George W Bush’s National Economic Council. He remained at the Fed until 2011, during which time he worked with then-Chair Ben Bernanke to address the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.</p><p>That crisis saw the collapse of financial services firms like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. Warsh notably objected to some of the low-interest policies that the Fed was pursuing at the time to stave off the impact of the crash.</p><p>During that period, he “spent most of his time worrying about inflation”, according to Amarnath. “Even in August 2008, he was talking about inflation as Lehman Brothers failed. He missed the whole boat on that.”</p><p>Amarnath said Warsh appeared to downplay the unemployment at the time as well, even though the jobless rate was headed towards 10 percent. Today, unemployment in the US is at a healthy 4.4 percent.</p><p>Warsh started softening his stance on inflation in 2017, when Trump began his first term as president. Amarnath told Al Jazeera that Warsh’s seeming partisanship gives him “some concern” about what might happen in case of another financial crisis.</p><p>“His track record speaks to someone who is pretty partisan and political in his views and mocks data dependence,” he said. “The shape-shifting depends on who is in office.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-political-record\">A ‘political’ record</h2><p>Some experts, however, were more optimistic about Warsh as a candidate for the top seat at the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Economist Robert Rogowsky, a professor of trade and economic diplomacy at Georgetown University, is among those who think that Warsh is a “solid pick, albeit not a stellar one”.</p><p>“He is obviously extremely bright and has a solid record of accomplishment in the area,” he said.</p><p>That said, Rogowsky acknowledged that Warsh could be seen as a political opportunist. “His record does seem a bit political – a monetary hawk under a Democratic administration and being promoted by Trump to be Trump’s monetary dove.”</p><p>Still, Rogowsky said he is not too worried about Warsh falling in line with Trump’s aggressive push to lower interest rates.</p><p>While the Fed chair is a very powerful role, it only represents one vote on a board of seven, and it cannot override the majority vote. And though Warsh “may sound Trumpy”, Rogowsky believes he will ultimately refuse to implement Trump’s “extreme and extremely harmful” interest rate cuts.</p><p>“He is smart enough – and, I pray, honorable enough – to be driven by his economic training,” Rogowsky said.</p><p>Trump has called on the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates from their current level – about 3.75 percent – to 1 percent, a major drop.</p><p>Rogowsky said Warsh is aware that such a policy move would result in “a medium-term inflationary disaster”, which, in turn, could lead to “an immediately disastrous decline in the dollar and a five-alarm fire in the global trading system”.</p><p>Trump’s trade policies will already pose a big challenge for any incoming Federal Reserve chair, according to Rachel Ziemba, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.</p><p>Ziemba pointed out that Trump has pursued an aggressive international trade policy and immigration crackdown that could send shudders through the US economy. Currently, while economic growth is “OK”, there is little job growth, she added.</p><p>“Rate cuts are unlikely to solve those issues,” Ziemba told Al Jazeera.</p><p>For now, it remains unclear whether Warsh will ultimately take up the post. He faces a Senate confirmation hearing in the coming months, where Trump’s policies could also be a hurdle.</p><p>Already, at least one Republican senator, Thom Tillis, said he would not back any Trump nominees to the Federal Reserve until the president drops his criminal investigation of Powell.</p><p>That probe, announced this month, was widely seen as Trump’s latest attempt to browbeat the Federal Reserve into compliance with his demands.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld,” said Ro Khanna, a Democrat who co-sponsored the law requiring the release.</p><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in Senate, called on officials to clearly say whether all documents related to Trump had been released.</p><p>“Yes or no? We need answers,” he said.</p><p>In December, the Justice Department released an initial batch of Epstein-related documents, though it fell short of the full publication mandated by November’s law.</p><p>That release, however, included previously unreleased <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/newly-released-epstein-files-spotlight-trumps-past-jet-trips-with-maxwell\">flight logs</a> showing that Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet in the 1990s. Those trips appeared to happen before Trump has said the pair had a falling out.</p><p>Earlier releases also contained images showing prominent individuals like tech billionaire Bill Gates, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, director Woody Allen and former US President Bill Clinton socialising with Epstein, sometimes on his private island.</p><p>Details were still emerging from the latest release. Early revelations include email exchanges with billionaire Elon Musk over a possible visit to Epstein’s island; a string of texts between Epstein and Bannon, at times referencing Trump in the lead-up to Epstein’s death; and investigative documents surrounding Epstein’s incarceration and death.</p><p>To date, none of the individuals depicted or referenced in the releases have been charged with any crimes, outside of Maxwell.</p><p>Following her conviction in 2021, she is serving a 20-year prison sentence, though she has continued to deny any wrongdoing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Epstein died from apparent suicide in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.</p><p>He had previously been convicted of state sex-offender charges in Florida in 2008 as part of a plea deal that was widely slammed for its leniency. He spent a total of 13 months in custody.</p><p>One of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, also filed lawsuits against him, accusing him of arranging sexual encounters with politicians, business titans, academics and other influential figures while she was underage.</p><p>All of the men identified by Giuffre, who died in April 2025 in Australia, have denied the allegations.</p><p>Among the people she accused was Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, who <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/the-uks-prince-andrew-gives-up-royal-title-amid-epstein-allegations\">denied the claims</a> but settled a lawsuit filed by Giuffre for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>In October, his brother, King Charles III of the United Kingdom, stripped Mountbatten-Windsor of his royal titles as a result of the controversy.</p></div></div></body></html>"
