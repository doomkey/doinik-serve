Fires have consumed forests, ravaged villages and damaged or destroyed at least 25 homes, with emergency officials warning that the blaze remains out of control.</p><p>“All of the nation’s resources are mobilised,” President Emmanuel Macron said in a post on X, urging people to act with “the utmost caution”.</p><p>More than 1,800 firefighters have been sent to battle the flames, backed by 600 vehicles and water-dropping aircraft.</p><p>“We have at our disposal in the Aude department the maximum number of personnel and resources that we can have in the south of France in its entirety,” said Remi Recio, deputy prefect of Narbonne.</p><p>An elderly woman who refused to evacuate was killed, while another person is missing.

It’s a long-term operation.”</p><p>An investigation into the cause is under way.

The fire, believed to have started in a camper van, was rapidly spread by strong winds.</p><p>“What concerns us most right now is the wind, whether it shifts between the west and east,” said Antonio Sanz, Andalusia’s interior minister.</p><p>Fire crews worked through the night to keep flames away from hotels and tourist accommodation, but the blaze remains active, and residents have not been allowed to return.</p><p>Elsewhere, a fire near Ponteceso in the Galicia region forced the evacuation of Corme Aldea village. In Cadiz, a blaze that erupted Tuesday led to mass evacuations, according to state broadcaster RTVE.</p><p>The Spanish meteorological agency AEMET has issued orange alerts across several regions through Friday. Civil protection authorities warn of “high” or “extreme” fire risk in much of the country.</p><p>Spain’s Ministry of Health reported 1,060 excess deaths linked to extreme heat in July, a 57 percent increase over the same month last year, based on data from the national mortality monitoring system.

Russian officials are also expected to attend.</p><p>Up until recently, the relationship between Trump and Modi was considered exceptionally tight.</p><p>Modi was one of the first foreign leaders to visit Trump after the Republican leader took office for a second term in January. During Trump’s first term in 2019, the president went so far as to host a dedicated Texas rally for the Indian prime minister, calling the event “Howdy Modi”.</p><p>Modi, for his part, has embraced Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement, offering his own spin on the slogan: “Make India Great Again”.</p><p>But Trump has been outspoken in his belief that India’s economic practices are unfair to the US, and he has pledged to reduce trade deficits with foreign trading partners overall.</p><p>According to US government trade <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/south-central-asia/india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statistics</a>, India exported nearly $87.3bn in goods and services to the US in 2024, dwarfing the amount of US exports to India, which totalled $41.5bn.</p><p>Relations have further been strained by Trump’s claim that he brokered a peace between India and Pakistan after an armed standoff in May.

He had previously pledged to end the war between Russia and Ukraine within 24 hours if re-elected, a pledge he has since walked back, saying it was meant to be “sarcastic”.</p><p>But Trump has pressed forward with peace negotiations between the two countries. But with no ceasefire in sight, Trump announced in July a deadline for Russia to wind down its military campaign — a deadline that expires on Wednesday.</p><p>Russia first launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the war has since become a costly, slow-grinding conflict.</p><p>In his executive order on Wednesday, Trump left open the possibility that other importers of Russian oil products could be subject to higher tariffs, just as India had.</p><p>He also reserved the right to “modify” the executive order if any retaliatory action were taken, or if countries like India “take significant steps” to align with US policy goals.</p><p>The tariff announcement followed meetings taken by Trump’s top diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow aimed at pushing Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine.</p><p>Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval was likewise in Russia this week, with Reuters reporting that he was discussing the pressure to end Indian purchases of Russian petrol.</p><p>Reporting from outside the White House, Al Jazeera correspondent Kimberly Halkett pointed out that other countries besides India have continued to import Russian oil products, but they were absent from Trump’s executive order.</p><p>China, for instance, remains the top buyer of Russian oil, and Turkiye is its third largest consumer.</p><p>“There is a list of countries that buy Russian oil. India’s number two, and China number one,” Halkett explained.</p><p>“ The United States, even the European Union, buy from Russia themselves. They buy fertilisers. So what is it about India?  Well, India’s buying it at a very steep discount from Russia, this oil and gas. They say it’s to meet their commercial needs for the more than 1.4 billion living in the country.”</p><p>But Halkett explained that Trump officials perceive that specific trade to be a threat to US national security.</p><p>“ They see this as a threat to US interests because this is funding directly the Russian war machine, just as the United States is trying to wind down Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Halkett said.</p><p>“ So this, in the eyes of the United States, is counter to US interests, and India is the biggest offender in their eyes at this moment.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"396\">In September 2025, I am supposed to start a new life, not in war-torn Gaza, but in a lecture hall in the United Kingdom. After nearly a year of endless efforts, applications, exams, and navigating bombings, displacement and blackout zones just to apply, I was accepted. Not once, but five times, by the Universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Exeter, and Ulster. I even secured funding.</p><p data-start=\"398\" data-end=\"1081\">But instead of boarding a plane, I remain trapped in Gaza, a place where war has flattened homes, stolen futures and caged dreams. The bombs have not stopped. Neither has our will. Unlike students in other war-torn areas, we, Gaza Palestinian students, are not being offered any path out. Many countries, such as France, Ireland and Italy, have successfully evacuated their students through government-coordinated efforts and humanitarian corridors, like via the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). These governments made it clear that their students matter. The UK has not. Despite its global standing and historic reputation for championing justice and education, it remains silent.</p><p data-start=\"1083\" data-end=\"1395\">This is not just my story. It is a collective cry from dozens of us, admitted to top British universities, with scholarships or personal savings, who survived bombs and sieges only to be abandoned at the final border: there is no visa centre in Gaza to submit fingerprints, and no route out without evacuation.</p><p data-start=\"1397\" data-end=\"2120\">After the war broke out in late 2023, I was forced to pause my online university studies, as both the classes and the fees became impossible to maintain under the siege. But I did not give up on education. Instead, I began applying to UK universities through UCAS, a process that demanded a carefully written personal statement, recommendation letters, detailed documentation and weeks of waiting. I submitted everything using borrowed internet in relatives’ homes or from paid co-working spaces that I reached on foot, under the midday sun or pouring rain, with no transportation. There were days when I sat on a plastic chair in the street, emailing colleges and researching entry requirements while missiles flew overhead.</p><p data-start=\"2122\" data-end=\"2568\">When universities asked for English qualification submissions, I had no centre in Gaza to support me, not for training, not even to register. Most UK universities would not accept Duolingo, the only test I could afford and access online. So I stretched every resource and applied for each institution’s approved test, juggling freelance mobile programming by day to support myself and studying English by night, often under a mobile flashlight.</p><p data-start=\"2570\" data-end=\"2861\">Some tests required constant camera and microphone monitoring, difficult in a war zone where displacement, noise and unstable internet made focus nearly impossible. One infraction and the test would be void. My laptop battery often died before the test ended. But I endured and succeeded.</p><p data-start=\"2863\" data-end=\"3345\">My family shares this hunger for education. My brother is a mechanical engineer who won the competitive Qaddumi scholarship last year to begin a master’s programme at the University of Liverpool in January 2025, but it has been deferred. My sister was accepted into a Turkish government-funded medical programme at Samsun University, which was also postponed because of the war. Three of us, all with dreams and drive, are stuck in Gaza. We did everything right. So why are we left behind?</p><p data-start=\"3347\" data-end=\"3658\">After much struggle, I finally passed the tests and converted my conditional offers into unconditional ones. I even secured funding, enough for at least the first year’s tuition fees and living expenses. I was also promised support from private foundations, conditional only on submitting my visa application.</p><p data-start=\"3660\" data-end=\"4192\">But when I tried to apply for a visa, I hit a dead end: biometric fingerprints. The UK has no visa centre in Gaza. To complete the process, I would need to cross a border that is shut unless I am listed for evacuation. There are more than 100 Gazan students accepted to UK universities, 48 with full scholarships, who face the same deadlock. Many, like me, are running out of time. Inside the UK, institutions like the Gaza Scholarship Initiative (GSI) have stepped in to amplify our voice to the government because they believe in us.</p><p data-start=\"4194\" data-end=\"4400\">Some have carried their offers from 2024, after universities generously deferred their admission. Most universities, however, will not offer such flexibility again. For all of us, 2025 is our last chance.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"4402\" data-end=\"4837\">Other countries acted.</p><p data-start=\"4402\" data-end=\"4837\">Ireland coordinated directly with Israel to evacuate its students via the Karem Abu Salem (known to Israelis as Kerem Shalom) crossing. France and Italy did the same. Students were transported to nearby countries to finish visa processing and begin their studies. They understood the stakes, not just academic, but human. These governments coordinated with humanitarian agencies to get their students out, then facilitated visas and asylum claims.</p><p data-start=\"4839\" data-end=\"5152\">The UK has done nothing similar, despite numerous appeals from students, universities, advocacy groups like GSI, and members of parliament. We have written letters to MPs, university heads and the British Council. Even university leaders who support our admission cannot help unless the UK government steps in.</p><p data-start=\"5154\" data-end=\"5469\">This silence hurts most because it is not due to incapability. The UK can act but it simply chooses not to. If the government coordinated with Israeli authorities and humanitarian groups like the ICRC, students could be evacuated through Kerem Shalom into Egypt or Jordan, where they could finalise visas and travel.</p><p data-start=\"5471\" data-end=\"5594\">This is not speculative. It is exactly what other democratic nations have done. The difference? They cared enough to try.</p><p data-start=\"5596\" data-end=\"5644\">What does this say about whose futures matter?</p><p data-start=\"5646\" data-end=\"6091\">The UK has invested for decades in international education, offering prestigious scholarships like Chevening and the Commonwealth. It champions learning and opportunity and leads countless international partnerships. But when it comes to Gaza students, who embody that very ethos, we are being forgotten. What message does that send? Does our survival, our future, matter less? Are we invisible to the very system that welcomed us in writing?</p><p data-start=\"6093\" data-end=\"6365\">I still believe in British education. I am inspired by its professors, challenged by its rigour, and drawn to its diversity and values. I fought for my place there. I hope, not just for me but for my peers, that the UK government remembers its legacy and chooses to act.</p><p data-start=\"6367\" data-end=\"6392\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Because if not now, when?</p><p data-start=\"6367\" data-end=\"6392\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A few days later, on July 12, Acosta announced he had <a href=\"/video/2019/7/12/epstein-scandal-us-labor-secretary-acosta-to-resign\">resigned</a> as labour secretary, after Democratic leaders and presidential candidates called for him to do so.</p><p>On the day Acosta resigned, Khanna said Acosta should testify before the House oversight committee, and later that month Senator Chuck Schumer was among the Democrats who called on the Justice Department to make public the results of its review of Acosta’s handling of the Epstein case.</p><p>Also in July, the congressional Democratic Women’s Caucus requested that the House Oversight and Reform Committee open an investigation into how the Palm Beach, Florida Sheriff’s Office handled the Epstein investigation.</p><p>Days after Epstein’s August 2019 <a href=\"/news/2019/8/10/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide-in-prison-say-us-media\">death</a> in a Manhattan jail cell, Khanna posted his support for an investigation into the death, writing: “There are too many unanswered questions, and far too many who deserve closure, to leave this case unexamined.” Khanna attached to his post a link to a Daily Beast article that said bipartisan lawmakers sent a letter to the FBI demanding answers about Epstein’s suicide.</p><p>Democrats continued their push for a plea deal investigation, writing multiple letters, including one to Trump’s then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another to the House judiciary and oversight committees.</p><p>Democrats, along with some Republicans, proposed legislation to prevent prosecutors from striking secret plea deals, and Democrats also sought records about the Epstein case from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.</p><h2 id=\"2020-to-2024-focus-on-records\">2020 to 2024: Focus on records</h2><p>Democrats tried other tactics to obtain records, such as requesting them from a Palm Beach judge – a strategy spearheaded by the Palm Beach Post that can take years to succeed.</p><p>Some records emerged from civil lawsuits and the federal prosecution of <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/why-is-ghislaine-maxwell-so-central-to-trump-epstein-conspiracy-theories\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, who was convicted for her role in a scheme with Epstein to sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>When Maxwell was <a href=\"/news/2020/12/29/epstein-associate-ghislaine-maxwell-denied-bail-in-abuse-case\">charged</a> in 2020, Democrats continued to push for transparency.</p><p>Frankel told PolitiFact in an August 1 interview that the House oversight committee wanted to hold a hearing at which they would hear from Epstein victims, their lawyers and prosecutors. They wanted to subpoena the prosecutors to ask them under oath “why they gave this guy a slap on the wrist, who pressured them?” Frankel said.</p><p>However, “We were told by the Justice Department to cut it off” because it could compromise the Maxwell investigation, Frankel told PolitiFact.</p><p>After Biden <a href=\"/news/2021/1/20/joe-biden-sworn-in-as-president-of-the-united-states\">took office</a> in 2021, Democrats appeared to dial back their public calls for Epstein records’ release.</p><p>“Pushes for oversight and record releases were at times tempered by a need to respect both the victims’ pursuit of justice in courts and their fears of reprisals,” Wasserman Schultz told PolitiFact. “As disclosures were denied or delayed, we did what lawmakers do and legislated to protect future victims.”</p><p>In February 2024, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signed a bill to allow the release of Epstein 2006 grand jury testimony after a similar effort failed in previous state legislative sessions. Frankel praised the legislation.</p><p>A Palm Beach judge released records in July 2024, which showed prosecutors had heard testimony about how Epstein sexually assaulted two teenage girls before they gave Epstein a plea deal. Frankel again repeated her push for an explanation.</p><p>In September 2024, Wasserman Schultz along with Representative Burgess Owens, introduced a bill, similar to earlier proposals, to require prosecutors to inform victims of such plea deals. The bill did not receive a vote.</p><p><em>*Caryn Baird and Louis Jacobson contributed to this report*</em></p></div></div></body></html>"
