            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In a couple of weeks, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), the biggest hydroelectric dam on the African continent, will be inaugurated. The construction of this dam has taken more than a decade and has cost nearly $5bn. The government and people of Ethiopia mobilised the funds for this national project from their meagre internal resources. No international financing was made available for this project.</p><p>While the construction of the dam has received some international media attention, the media coverage has not made clear the Ethiopian perspective. This is a modest attempt to rectify that problem.</p><p>The GERD is constructed on the Blue Nile, which Ethiopians call Abay. Abay means “big” or “major” in several Ethiopian languages. Abay is one of the main tributaries of the Nile River. Although many associate the Nile almost exclusively with Egypt, the river traverses 10 other African countries. Among these countries, Ethiopia holds a unique position because 86 percent of the Nile water that reaches Egypt originates from the Ethiopian highlands.</p><p>Abay is the biggest river in Ethiopia with a huge potential to boost overall socioeconomic transformation and development. It has been a long-held aspiration of Ethiopians to utilise this resource. The GERD is a national development project that fulfils this dream.</p><p>Despite its huge labour force and economic potential, Ethiopia has yet to make headway in its endeavour to industrialise. One critical factor that has held back this effort has been Ethiopia’s lack of energy. According to the latest figures, barely 55 percent of Ethiopians have access to electricity.</p><p>There is a huge demand and need for electricity in Ethiopia. Hence, the GERD is seen as our national ticket out of darkness and poverty. Necessity dictates that Ethiopia use this major resource as an instrument to spur growth and prosperity for the benefit of its 130-million-strong population, which is expected to reach 200 million by 2050.</p><p>The GERD is expected to generate about 5,150 megawatts of electricity and produce an annual energy output of 15,760 gigawatt hours. This will double Ethiopia’s energy output, which will not only light our homes but also power industries and cities and transform our economy. The GERD would also make it possible to increase our energy exports to neighbouring countries, thereby strengthening regional integration and interconnectedness.</p><p>The lower riparian states of the Nile would also derive immense benefit from the GERD because it would prevent flooding, sedimentation and water loss through evaporation. The very purpose of the GERD, which is generating electricity, requires that the water flows to lower riparian countries after hitting the enormous turbines that generate the electricity. The dam does not block or stop the river from flowing. Doing so would make electricity generation impossible and defeat the very purpose for which the dam was built.</p><p>So, you might ask, why are some lower riparian countries complaining about the construction of the dam? The reason for their objections emanates not from rational fear or legitimate concern. The objections are the result of an attitude shaped by a colonial-era water-sharing agreement concluded between Britain and Egypt in 1929 and its derivative agreement sealed in 1959 between Egypt and Sudan.</p><p>Ethiopia was not a party to any of these treaties. However, some Egyptians contend that the water-sharing formula enshrined in the colonial-era agreement, which excludes the remaining nine African nations from having any share of the Nile, is still valid and should be adhered to by all Nile riparian countries.</p><p>From an Ethiopian point of view, this anachronistic argument, often presented as “historic rights over the Nile” is unacceptable. While Britain is entitled to enter into any agreements regarding the River Thames, it does not have the right to dispose of the waters of the Nile or the Abay River. As we all recall, the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser rejected Britain’s claims over the Suez Canal. For much stronger reasons, Ethiopian leaders have consistently rejected arguments based on colonial arrangements in which Ethiopia did not have a say.</p><p>The Ethiopian view is that the Nile is a shared natural resource. It should be used in a cooperative framework that would be beneficial for all riparian countries. The developmental aspirations and dreams of all nations are equally legitimate. The needs of some should not be prioritised over the needs of others.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>A fair, just and inclusive arrangement that takes into account the realities of the 21st century is needed. Such an arrangement is already in place in the form of the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement, which is a contemporary, African-initiated treaty designed to promote sustainable management and equitable use of the Nile. This treaty has already been signed and ratified by Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and South Sudan.</p><p>Egypt should stop yearning for a bygone colonial era and join these Nile riparian countries in their joint effort to promote fair and equitable use of the Nile in a sustainable manner.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Here are some reactions:</p><h3 id=\"denmark\">Denmark</h3><p>“The trade conditions will not be as good as before, and it is not our choice, but a balance must be found that stabilises the situation and that both sides can live with,” said Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen.</p><h3 id=\"finland\">Finland</h3><p>Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said the agreement brings “much-needed predictability to the global economy and Finnish companies”. “Work must continue to dismantle trade barriers. Only free transatlantic trade benefits both sides the most,” he said.</p><h3 id=\"france\">France</h3><p>“It is a sombre day when an alliance of free peoples, brought together to affirm their common values and to defend their common interests, resigns itself to submission,” said French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 id=\"germany\">Germany</h3><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the agreement has “succeeded in averting a trade conflict that would have hit the export-orientated German economy hard”. “This applies in particular to the automotive industry, where the current tariffs of 27.5 percent will be almost halved to 15 percent.”</p><p>A government spokesperson told the Reuters news agency that Berlin sees the need for further negotiations. “It is certainly no secret that in the steel and aluminium sector … We see a need for further negotiations,” the spokesperson said during a news conference in Berlin. He added that details of the deal remained to be worked out, and that “the EU Commission and the German government are now fully committed to this.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><h3 id=\"hungary\">Hungary</h3><p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban slammed the deal. “This is not an agreement … Donald Trump ate von der Leyen for breakfast, this is what happened, and we suspected this would happen as the US president is a heavyweight when it comes to negotiations, while Madame President is featherweight,” he said.</p><h3 id=\"ireland\">Ireland</h3><p>Irish Trade Minister Simon Harris said the deal provides a “measure of much-needed certainty for Irish, European and American businesses who together represent the most integrated trading relationship in the world”.</p><p>“While Ireland regrets that the baseline tariff of 15 percent is included in the agreement, it is important that we now have more certainty on the foundations for the EU-US trade relationship, which is essential for jobs, growth and investment,” he said.</p><h3 id=\"italy\">Italy</h3><p>“I consider it positive that there is an agreement, but if I don’t see the details, I am not able to judge it in the best way,” said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Speaking at a summit in Ethiopia, she said a “trade escalation between Europe and the United States would have had unpredictable and potentially devastating consequences”.</p><p>Meloni – a Trump ally on many issues – had warned earlier this month against a “trade war within the West”.</p><h3 id=\"romania\">Romania</h3><p>In a statement, the Romanian government’s press office said Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan “salutes that a trade agreement was reached and … feels it is a good omen”. “It eliminates present unclearness which caused disruptions and uncertainties in transatlantic trade relations,” it said.</p><h3 id=\"spain\">Spain</h3><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he backed the deal but “without any enthusiasm”.</p><p>“I value the constructive and negotiating attitude of the president of the European Commission. In any case, I support this trade agreement, but I do so without any enthusiasm,” he told a news conference.</p><h3 id=\"sweden\">Sweden</h3><p>“This agreement does not make anyone richer, but it may be the least bad alternative. What appears to be positive for Sweden, based on an initial assessment, is that the agreement creates some predictability,” said Swedish Trade Minister Benjamin Dousa.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Elsewhere, aerospace tariffs will remain at zero for now.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>In exchange for the 15 percent tariff rate on EU goods, Trump said the bloc would be “opening up their countries at zero tariff” for American exports.</p><p>In addition, he said the EU would spend an extra $750bn on US energy products, invest $600bn in the US and buy military equipment worth “hundreds of billions of dollars”.</p><p>Von der Leyen confirmed that the EU would seek to buy an extra $250bn of US energy products each year from now until 2027.</p><p>“With this deal, we are securing access to our largest export market,” she said.</p><p>At the same time, she acknowledged that the 15 percent tariffs would be “a challenge for some” European industries.</p><p>The EU is the US’s largest trading partner with two-way trade in goods and services last year reaching nearly $2 trillion.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-european-leaders-responded\">How have European leaders responded?</h2><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the agreement, saying it avoids “an unnecessary escalation in transatlantic trade relations”.</p><p>He said a trade war “would have hit Germany’s export-oriented economy hard”, pointing out that the German car industry would see US tariffs lowered from 27.5 percent to 15 percent.</p><p>But French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called the deal a “dark day” for Europe, saying the bloc had caved in to the US president with an unbalanced deal that spares US imports from any immediate European retaliation.</p><p>“It is a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, brought together to affirm their common values and to defend their common interests, resigns itself to submission,” Bayrou wrote on X of what he called the “von der Leyen-Trump deal”.</p><p>Wolfgang Niedermark, a board member of the Federation of German Industries trade body, called the deal “an inadequate compromise” with the EU “accepting painful tariffs”.</p><p>A 15 percent tariff rate “will have a huge negative impact on Germany’s export-oriented industry”, he said.</p><p>Earlier, Benjamin Haddad, France’s European affairs minister, said: “The trade agreement … will bring temporary stability to economic actors threatened by the escalation of American tariffs, but it is unbalanced.”</p><p>Echoing that sentiment, Dutch Foreign Trade Minister Hanneke Boerma said the deal was “not ideal” and called on the commission to continue negotiations with Washington.</p><p>The European Commission is responsible for negotiating trade deals for the entire bloc.</p><p>EU ambassadors will be discussing the agreement with the commission this week.</p><h2 id=\"how-was-trade-conducted-before-the-deal\">How was trade conducted before the deal?</h2><p>On July 12, Trump threatened to impose <a href=\"/news/2025/7/12/trump-says-30-percent-tariffs-against-eu-and-mexico-to-begin-on-august-1\">30 percent</a> tariffs on EU goods if the two sides couldn’t reach a deal before this Friday, the day a suspension expires on the implementation of what Trump calls his “reciprocal tariffs”, which he placed on nearly all countries in the world.</p><p>Those “reciprocal tariffs” are due to come into effect in addition to the <a href=\"/economy/2025/3/27/trump-announces-25-percent-tariffs-on-cars-ramping-up-trade-war\">25 percent</a> tariffs on cars and car parts and the <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/4/donald-trumps-50-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs-take-effect\">50 percent</a> levy on steel and aluminium products Trump already put in place.</p><p>On the European side, it is understood that Brussels would have pushed ahead with a retaliatory tariffs package on <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/16/what-retaliatory-action-is-the-eu-planning-over-trumps-tariffs\">90 billion euros</a> ($109bn) of US goods, including car parts and bourbon, if talks had broken down.</p><p>The EU had been a frequent target of escalating trade rhetoric by Trump, who accused the bloc of “ripping off” the US.</p><p>In 2024, the US ran a $235.6bn goods deficit with the EU. Pharmaceuticals, car parts and industrial chemicals were among Europe’s largest exports to the US, according to EU data.</p><h2 id=\"how-will-the-deal-impact-the-us-and-eu\">How will the deal impact the US and EU?</h2><p>Bloomberg Economics estimated that a no-deal outcome would have raised the effective US tariff rate on European goods to nearly 18 percent on Friday.</p><p>The new deal brings that number down to 16 percent, offering a small reprieve to European exporting firms. Still, current trade barriers are much higher than before Trump took office in 2025.</p><p>According to Bruegel, a research group, the average US tariff rate on EU exports was just 1.5 percent at the end of 2024.</p><p>William Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute, told Al Jazeera: “I think the [Trump] strategy has been clear from the very beginning. … It’s brinkmanship. … Either partner with the US or face high tariffs.”</p><p>Meanwhile, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said: “President Trump just unlocked one of the biggest economies in the world. The European Union is going to open its $20 trillion market and completely accept our auto and industrial standards for the first time ever.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
