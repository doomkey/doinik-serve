Eight years later, has the movement done enough for survivors? And what will it take for some of the world’s most powerful men accused of sexual misconduct to face consequences?</p><p>This week on <em>UpFront</em> Marc Lamont Hill speaks to founder of the Me Too movement, Tarana Burke.</p><p>The Department of Justice has released files related to the late convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein after mounting pressure led President Donald Trump to sign the Epstein Files Transparency Act last month. Trump, who himself has been accused dozens of times of sexual assault and misconduct, has already appeared in photos, emails and other documents in connection with Epstein, causing a rift in his base. Other business elites, academics, politicians and world leaders have also been named in connection to Epstein. While some have faced minor consequences, only Ghislaine Maxwell has been criminally convicted as part of Epstein’s sex trafficking of minors. Will newly released documents lead to new convictions and genuine accountability for survivors?</p><p><br><br></p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 20 Dec 2025</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">20 Dec 2025</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

as the Liverpool striker scored before limping off injured in a chaotic 2-1 win over nine-man Tottenham.</p><p>Isak put Liverpool ahead in the second half in north London on Saturday after Tottenham’s Xavi Simons was sent off before the interval for a nasty lunge on Virgil van Dijk.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>It was only Isak’s third goal in 16 games in all competitions since his British record 125-million-pound ($166m) move from Newcastle on transfer deadline day.</p><p>Yet in keeping with Isak’s troubled start to life with the Premier League champions, the 26-year-old was unable to fully enjoy his goal as he was forced to come off after being injured by Micky van de Ven’s failed attempt to stop him scoring.</p><p>Hugo Ekitike’s fifth goal in his last four appearances put Liverpool in command before Richarlison’s reply set up a tense finale that came to a head with Tottenham defender Romero’s dismissal in stoppage time.</p><p>Arne Slot’s side are up to fifth place in the Premier League after extending their unbeaten run to six games in all competitions, further distancing them from the miserable run of nine defeats in 12 that plunged them into crisis.</p><p>While Liverpool steadied the ship with a third successive win, Isak’s injury could not have come at a worse time following Mohamed Salah’s departure for the Africa Cup of Nations.</p><p>Slot claimed on Friday that Liverpool had “moved on” from the Salah controversy after his explosive interview two weeks ago in which he said he had been thrown under the bus by the club and no longer had a relationship with the Reds boss.</p><p>He was dropped from the squad for a Champions League game at Inter Milan but returned as a substitute in last week’s victory over Brighton.</p><p>The 33-year-old is now on international duty with Egypt for several weeks, making Isak’s injury an especially painful blow if he is ruled out for a prolonged period.</p><p>Slot will spend Christmas sweating on Isak’s fitness, and Tottenham manager Thomas Frank’s festive period will be even more fraught.</p><p>Last weekend’s limp 3-0 loss at Nottingham Forest sparked debate over the Dane’s future in his rocky first season in charge.</p><p>Tottenham are languishing in 13th place after winning just one of their last eight league games.</p><p>Ange Postecoglou was sacked despite winning the Europa League last season to end Tottenham’s 17-year trophy drought, and Frank is in danger of suffering the same fate as the Australian if results do not improve soon.</p><p>Simons left Tottenham with a mountain to climb in the 33rd minute when he raked his studs down Van Dijk’s calf with an ugly challenge from behind.</p><p>Initially booked for the foul, Simons was shown the red card after a VAR review.</p><p>Slot sent on Isak for the injured Conor Bradley at half-time and it took the Sweden striker just 11 minutes to make an impact as Liverpool broke the deadlock with a goal 300 million pounds ($399m) in the making.</p><p>All three of Liverpool’s costly close-season signings combined as Ekitike picked out Florian Wirtz, and he slipped a perfectly weighted pass to Isak, who timed his run to drill a clinical finish past Guglielmo Vicario from 10 yards.</p><p>Ekitike doubled Liverpool’s lead in the 66th minute.</p><p>Jeremie Frimpong’s deflected cross looped into the six-yard box, where Ekitike out-jumped Romero to thump his header into the top corner.</p><p>Richarlison reduced the deficit with a close-range blast after Reds captain van Dijk miscued a clearance in the 83rd minute.</p><p>But, with the visitors wobbling, Romero’s second booking for kicking Ibrahima Konate let Liverpool off the hook.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"537\" data-end=\"990\">On a splendid November afternoon in Goa, I watched something familiar unfold on a chessboard. The Indian grandmaster Arjun Erigaisi, world number six, was destroyed by his Chinese counterpart Wei Yi. Erigaisi was playing on home soil and was a favourite of the schoolchildren who had crowded around his board in pin-drop silence. He moved his pawn to the centre of the board, pressed the button on the dual-timer chess clock, and the game had begun.</p><p data-start=\"992\" data-end=\"1599\">In this country where chess was born, grandmasters rise as effortlessly as the coastline grows coconut trees. The game enters a child’s life early, slipping through the cracks of classrooms, kitchens, and cramped, overworked working-class homes, teaching them to strategise or, more likely, to endure. That, at least, was how chess entered mine. My brilliant Periappa (uncle), without money to pursue higher education and with a temper that kept him between jobs, often ended up babysitting me. I must have been six when, during one of those days, he gave me my favourite inheritance: the game of chess.</p><p data-start=\"1601\" data-end=\"1952\">All these years later, I still remember Periappa holding a chipped, toy-sized plastic knight in front of my face and declaring, “These are my favourite. They are deadly if you master them.” I knew I’d tasted something I would always want. Chess entered my life not as a pastime, but as a sensation. My relationship with chess was a pheromonal one.</p><p data-start=\"1954\" data-end=\"2361\">I was a difficult, friendless child, prone to sulking when Periappa sat me down for a game. I expected to win it. Because what kind of adult takes pleasure in beating a six-year-old? Everything I knew about life insisted on that point, that Periappa would throw the game because he loved me. But his was not that kind of love. And chess is not that kind of game. There was no mercy in either, only strategy.</p><p data-start=\"2363\" data-end=\"2788\">He taught me my first chess lesson: no one loses at this game. You either learn a lesson or you teach one. I, of course, was ready for no lessons. I threw a fit, then threw the pieces, cried for a bit and never got into chess. If I had a chess career, it was short. I recall winning a local tournament in my neighbourhood, and then getting distracted by school, boys and life, drifting away from both my uncle and chess.</p><p data-start=\"2790\" data-end=\"2835\">By the time I returned to chess, he had died.</p><p data-start=\"2837\" data-end=\"3157\">Perhaps it was his death that brought me back. A chessboard became the only place where I could still be near him. This time I stayed. In fact, when the pandemic washed ashore, the chessboard was my only refuge between reporting and the uncertainty of life. It meant grappling with myself, with his voice in my head.</p><p data-start=\"3159\" data-end=\"3723\">When you start feeling strongly about chess, sooner or later, you develop a style, the same way writers develop a voice. Bobby Fischer was famous for his love of bishops. Garry Kasparov’s rook activity in the middlegame was deadly. Magnus Carlsen, one of the current greats, is known for his extremely active king in endgames. Erigaisi is known as the “madman on the board” because he is one of the few players who play without caring too much about results. It makes him reckless and dangerous, precise as a German sniper. But that is only when things go to plan.</p><p data-start=\"3725\" data-end=\"4098\">They did not. In the Erigaisi–Yi match, with one minute on the clock, Erigaisi blundered his rook. From that moment on, he made moves that steadily weakened his position. Sitting in the playing hall, between two rows of spectators, notebook on my knee, I watched him lose piece after piece, the way an animal is stripped to the bone, layer by layer, with no escape.</p><p data-start=\"4100\" data-end=\"4166\">It was a theatrical affair of the kind that keeps devotees hooked.</p><p data-start=\"4168\" data-end=\"4802\">My decades as an amateur chess addict have taught me that the addiction rarely comes from the game in its entirety, but from a fragment, like the exacting, disciplined violence of the Erigaisi–Yi match or an obsession with a single piece. For Periappa, it was the knight. For me, zugzwang is the spell that binds. It is a kind of endgame in which a player must make a move, but every move they make weakens their position. They cannot pass; they cannot skip a turn. The board offers choice, but no relief. I have spent years trying to understand zugzwang, hoping it could make sense of the ending of my relationship with Periappa.</p><p data-start=\"4804\" data-end=\"5534\">When I was a child, we spoke easily, the way people do before life complicates the board. But growing up changes the geometry of closeness, and I started seeing his flaws. He was quick to temper, a difficult husband and father, and his opinions about my education, boyfriends, and even chess became unwelcome. There was no single moment of rupture, just a slow accumulation of unreturned calls and postponed visits, until we had fewer and fewer things to talk about. Our relationship ended with me watching him in incredible pain in a Bombay hospital, with nothing left to say or do. By the time he died, we had slid into separate corners, like pieces drifting into an endgame, locked into an emotional zugzwang of our own making.</p><p data-start=\"5536\" data-end=\"6203\">After he died, I studied zugzwang obsessively, in the hope that I could tie a neat bow of chess wisdom over the ugly turn of events. I can spend hours watching and reading about the 1923 game between Aron Nimzowitsch and Friedrich Saemisch, known as the “immortal zugzwang”. It is one of the most celebrated games in chess history because, in the final position, white is completely tied up: every single legal move makes his position collapse. It is total, board-wide paralysis, as if Nimzowitsch wrapped Saemisch’s pieces in invisible wire. There is no checkmate, no need for the obvious humiliation of defeat. The game ends without spectacle, only inevitability.</p><p data-start=\"6205\" data-end=\"6917\">After Periappa died, the grief did not sweep in; it percolated. I regretted never telling him that mastering the knight had become my personal Mount Everest. I regretted that he died without knowing that I loved knights for no reason other than the fact that he loved them. That the knights had curled up in my brain and nestled in some deep, reptilian part of it, where my childhood lives. That this one small preference, passed down casually, had endured longer than our conversations ever did. It has no secret meaning. In fact, I suspect it has no meaning at all. Perhaps that is what remains of relationships: useless details that lodge inside you, like unused charging cables or expired email accounts.</p><p data-start=\"6919\" data-end=\"7201\">Every time I return to zugzwang, it teaches me new lessons. These days, the lesson that haunts me is about deep endgames, when every choice hurts. Zugzwang becomes a mirror, and in it, I still see the outline of a chipped plastic knight, held up to my face, asking me to choose.</p><p data-start=\"6919\" data-end=\"7201\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
