Foreign Minister Youssef Rajji – who is from the anti-Hezbollah, right-wing Lebanese Forces party – said Araghchi’s statement is “firmly rejected and condemned”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Such statements undermine Lebanon’s sovereignty, unity and stability and constitute an unacceptable interference in its internal matters and sovereign decisions,” Rajji said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Hezbollah and Iran have emerged bruised from separate conflicts with Israel in November and June, respectively. Now, Beirut’s <a href=\"/news/2025/8/10/will-lebanon-succeed-in-disarming-hezbollah\">instruction for Hezbollah to disarm</a> risks further undermining the relevance of the group at a critical time, analysts said.</p><h2 id=\"who-decides\">Who decides?</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Many analysts believe the decision on whether to retain or relinquish its arms may not be Hezbollah’s alone.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">”Hezbollah does not have complete freedom of action in this regard,” HA Hellyer of the Royal United Services Institute told Al Jazeera, referencing the group’s close ties with Iran.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“But it doesn’t act simply as a proxy for Tehran and is in the midst of a rather challenging period of its existence, especially given the surrounding geopolitics of the region,” he said of the regional upheavals since Israel began its war on Gaza in October 2023 and launched subsequent assaults on Lebanon and Syria.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Those assaults inflicted significant damage on Lebanon, principally in the southern Beirut suburbs and southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah’s support base is located.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Lebanon was already locked into an economic crisis before Israel’s war, and the World Bank estimated in May that it would now <a href=\"/news/2025/5/6/lebanon-government-works-to-regain-donor-trust-secure-reconstruction-funds\">need $11bn</a> to rebuild. The central government would be responsible for distributing that money, giving it some influence over Hezbollah.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3729439\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3729439\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3729439\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/000_47YB2KF-1748088661.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A woman holds a flyer with portraits of slain Hezbollah leaders Hassan Nasrallah (R) and successor Hashem Safieddine (L) at a polling station in the municipal elections in Nabatieh in southern Lebanon on May 24, 2025.

Even relatively moderate figures within the group are comparing doing so to suicide.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In his speech on Friday, Qassem’s rejection was unequivocal: “The resistance will not disarm so long as the aggression continues and the occupation persists.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“If necessary, we will fight a Karbala’i battle to confront this Israeli-American project, no matter the costs, and we are certain we will win,” he said, referencing the Battle of Karbala, venerated by Shia Muslims as a foundational battle against tyranny and oppression.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Qassem seemed to exclude the Lebanese military from his ire, warning the government: “Do not embroil the national army in this conflict. … It has a spotless record and does not want [this].”</p><h2 id=\"inside-the-tent\">Inside the tent</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Larijani’s visit on Wednesday was seen as a potential opportunity for Beirut to open up new lines of communication with one of the region’s most significant actors, Tehran, and potentially determine what Iran might be willing to consider in return for Hezbollah’s future disarmament.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3353282\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3353282\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3353282\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AA-20241127-36313262-36313258-DESTRUCTION_IN_LEBANONS_NABATIEH_AS_RESIDENTS_RETURN_FOLLOWING_CEASEFIRE-1732747630.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"a woman wipes away tears as she stands in between destroyed buildings\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3353282\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">During the war on Lebanon, Israel inflicted the most damage in areas where Hezbollah’s supporters live, in the south of the country and the capital, like the southern town of Shebaa, shown on November 27, 2024 [Ramiz Dallah/Anadolu]</figcaption></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">“It’s not possible for Lebanon to break relations between the Shia community and Iran, any more than it could the Sunni community and Saudi Arabia,” Michael Young of the Carnegie Middle East Center said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Iran is a major regional actor. It has a strong relationship with one of [the two] largest communities in the country,” he said of Lebanon’s large Shia community.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“You can’t cut ties. It doesn’t make sense. You want Iranians inside the tent, not outside.”</p><p>Given the precarity of Lebanon’s position, balanced between the US support it relies upon and the regional alliances it needs, Young suggested that Lebanese lawmakers nevertheless seek an opportunity to secure some sort of middle ground while accepting that some in Beirut may not be willing to countenance any negotiations with Iran.</p><p>“It’s important for the Lebanese to see if there are openings in the Iranian position,” Young continued, casting Larijani’s visit as a potential opportunity for the Lebanese government to influence Iran’s position on Hezbollah’s future.</p><p>“And this is something Larijani’s visit, if well exploited, could provide,” he said, “It’s important for the Lebanese to see if the Iranians propose anything in the future or if they show a willingness to compromise on behalf of Hezbollah.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For all the West’s lofty claims about spreading freedom, prosperity and progress, the world remains scarred by chronic instability and mass hunger. Last month, as part of its wind-down of international food and medical aid, the United States destroyed 500 metric tonnes of emergency food aid in the United Arab Emirates. Over 60,000 tonnes of emergency food aid have remained stockpiled in warehouses around the world due to the shutdown of USAID. Meanwhile, Israel – with US and European Union support – has been systematically starving the nearly two million remaining Palestinians in besieged Gaza, part of the almost 320 million people globally who are malnourished or at risk of starving to death in 2025.</p><p>It’s part of a much larger pattern of hoarding and starvation that has its roots in Western norms around capitalism and settler-colonialism, a crime against humanity that rarely faces meaningful international repercussions. This is not an isolated atrocity: The rise of the West and the US was built on the massive hoarding of food resources for profit and the deliberate use of starvation to cow those already living under oppression.</p><p>It is difficult to miss, in both the international news reports and the desperate social media posts of starved Palestinians begging for money, food and clean water, with many showing themselves and their children reduced to emaciated bodies. It should shame us all, yet Westerners and their allies have all committed themselves to genocide, with ample food mere kilometres away. A recent poll by the Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research at the Israeli Democracy Institute shows that 79 percent of Israeli Jews are “not so troubled” or “not troubled at all” by the reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza.</p><p>Gaza, though, is hardly alone in facing mass starvation as part of a genocidal campaign, whether in 2025 or in recent world history. What has been all too easy for the West to miss are famine-level crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and in Sudan. As of March, “a record 27.7 million people are in the grip of acute hunger … amid ongoing conflict linked to massive displacement and rising food prices” in the DRC, according to the United Nations. The two-year-long conflict in Sudan, which has killed an estimated 150,000 people, many of whose deaths were linked to famine, disease and starvation, has also left nearly 25 million in need of food assistance, including nearly 740,000 in North Darfur’s capital, el-Fasher, where the population faces starvation while under siege.</p><p>To be sure, nearly every major power in human history has attacked or withheld food and water supplies in the process of conquering other nation-states and plundering their resources at one time or another. But the West, as the world knows it today, began its quest for global dominance with the First Crusade in the 1090s, and with it, perfected its tactics for siege warfare and the deliberate starvation of Muslim and Jewish populations in the Holy Land (present-day Syria, Lebanon and Palestine), all in the name of Catholicism. Those first Crusaders, short on food supplies themselves, also died in their thousands from hunger or committed acts of mass cannibalism to survive.</p><p>Denying food and water in this Western-dominated world has always been a political and capitalistic weapon of imperialism, colonialism and nationalism. Western Europe’s plundering of the Western Hemisphere not only formed the foundation of capitalism and the never-ending pursuit of profit worldwide, it also entrenched the use of famine, malnutrition and deprivation as tools to control and exploit subject peoples. From the 16th through the 19th century, the transatlantic slave trade, African chattel enslavement and forced labour of Indigenous peoples helped fill royal coffers in Europe and build great wealth for landowners across the Western Hemisphere. Enslaved and coerced labourers, denied adequate food and water, toiled in the fields to grow cash crops such as sugar, coffee and tobacco, or mined gold and silver, and frequently died from starvation, disease and abuse. One recent study estimated that as many as 56 million Indigenous people died between 1492 and 1600 alone. Outside the eventual United States, seven years was the average lifespan for most of the 12 million Africans who survived the horrors of the Atlantic crossing and arrived in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Beyond the Americas, around 10 million people starved to death during the Great Bengal Famine of the 1770s because the East India Company prioritised collecting food for Europe’s ports and imposing punitive taxes on South Asian peasants over saving lives. This famine, like so many others under colonial rule, was not an accident of nature but the outcome of deliberate economic policies that treated human life as expendable. Between 1904 and 1908, in what is now Namibia and Tanzania, the ruling Germans “directly killed or starved to death” approximately “60,000 Herero” and “10,000 Nama” in Namibia, as well as “up to 250,000 Ngoni, Ngindo, Matumbi and members of other ethnic groups” in crushing colonial uprisings.</p><p>Perhaps the political and psychological impact of famine and bubonic plague in 14th and 15th-century Europe helps to explain both the West’s penchant for colonisation and its weaponisation of food, and the denial of access to it, as punishment. As noted in the results of the 1944–45 Minnesota Starvation Experiment with 36 white men, the participants “would dream and fantasise about food” and “reported fatigue, irritability … and apathy,” including “significant increases in depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis”. Imagine the psychological impact of generations of food insecurity and starvation across an entire civilisation, especially one that believed itself to be religiously and morally superior because of its Christianity. The West has been consistent in denying populations everywhere the fundamental human right to eat.</p><p>As for the United States, the nation that began as the Jamestown colony in 1607 has operated under John Smith’s words for the past 400 years: “The greater part must be more industrious or starve. He that will not work, shall not eat.” America’s own colonial history and post-independence expansion also involved stealing land from Indigenous groups, burning crops and ensuring famine and massive Indigenous population decline. Growing heaps of cash crops such as tobacco, indigo, rice, sugar and cotton left little land for enslaved Black folk to cultivate food for themselves. Enslavers often provided the enslaved with meagre rations such as corn mush and salted pork fatback, hardly enough to sustain life.</p><p>Even when the United States became an agricultural juggernaut, the “work or starve” song remained the same, its classist and racist message only evolving with the times. For the past 40 years, US presidents and Congress have enacted multiple bills requiring the nation’s poor to work for minimal food benefits or go without, including new work requirements for SNAP (food stamps) benefits enacted under the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this year. In 2015, then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell summed up the thinking of US business leaders and the Western world towards those living with food precarity: “They’re doing too good with food stamps, Social Security and all the rest.”</p><p>I can attest to the impact of malnourishment and working just to eat. From the end of 1981 until I went off to college in 1987, one-third of every month at home in Mount Vernon, New York, was spent with little or no food in my belly, often with massive intestinal gas pains bloating my abdomen. It did not matter whether my mother worked full-time for Mount Vernon Hospital or relied on the US welfare system for food aid. Once, I dropped from 83 to 76 kilogrammes on my 188-centimetre frame in the 18 days after finishing my undergraduate degree, while working for Pitt’s Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in 1991. I walked the five kilometres each way to and from work for those three weeks because I only had $30 to get me through. Fantasies of hoarding food and controlling access to resources were definitely part of my experiences with moderate hunger and malnutrition.</p><p>Today, the United States produces enough food to feed more than two billion people, and the world produces enough to feed more than 10 billion every year. Yet the quest for profit and markets for agribusinesses, and the continued deliberate denial of access to food for vulnerable and marginalised populations, all to subjugate them for their land, their resources and even the very food they grow, continues largely unabated. Hunger remains one of the West’s most enduring weapons of control and domination. Geopolitically, there can be no peace in a world full of people whom the West has deliberately helped starve.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The US state is closer to Russia than it is to the US mainland. On the Russian side, it is closest to the autonomous Chukotka district.</p><p>Originally inhabited by Indigenous Americans, the region was first colonised by the old Russian empire in the 18th century. Due to the high costs of maintaining the faraway location, Moscow <a href=\"/news/2025/8/15/why-did-russia-sell-alaska-to-the-united-states\">sold Alaska to the US</a> in 1867 for $7.2m, the equivalent of $162m today. Russian influence still abounds in the region, visible in the Russian Orthodox churches still present, and even in the Russian surnames of some Alaskans.</p><p>The Elmendorf-Richardson base, where the meeting will be held, is also significant: It was originally an air force base built in 1940, during World War II. But its role expanded significantly during the Cold War that followed. The US was worried about possible Soviet attacks on Alaska, and thus built monitors and anti-aircraft systems to counter any threats. The airbase was an important part of that mission. The air squadrons based there are still positioned to intercept any Russian aircraft that might seek to enter US airspace.</p><p>Still, the US has not clarified why it chose Alaska as the venue for the summit.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-agenda\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3888040\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-ukraine-Conflict-at-a-glance-AUG-12-2025-1755156371.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-ukraine-Conflict at a glance-AUG 12, 2025-1755156371\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\">What’s on the agenda?</h2><p>The two leaders will discuss the terms for a possible ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>On the agenda is how such a deal could look, including possible territorial concessions on either side.</p><p>Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Its military currently controls about 19 percent of Ukrainian land across Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson and small parts of Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk provinces.</p><p>Ukraine controlled parts of Russia’s Kursk region from August 2024 but has since lost most of the territory.</p><h2 id=\"what-land-swaps-could-trump-and-putin-discuss\">What land swaps could Trump and Putin discuss?</h2><p>Trump, on Monday, suggested in a news briefing that Ukraine and Russia could swap territory in order to reach a land deal.</p><p>However, he walked back that suggestion on Tuesday at another briefing as his suggestion proved controversial across Europe. Trump promised to get back some Ukrainian territory.</p><p>“Russia occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They occupied prime territory. We’re going to try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine,” he said.</p><p>As part of any swap deal, analysts believe that Putin will press for Ukraine to withdraw from the parts of Donetsk that its troops still control. That would give Russia complete control of the Donbas region, which includes Luhansk and Donetsk – Russia already controls almost all of Luhansk – in addition to Crimea and chunks of Kherson, Zaporizhia and other southern regions. It will also want Ukraine to relinquish the tiny part of Kursk in Russia that Kyiv’s forces occupy.</p><p>In exchange, Russia might be willing to give up the small areas in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions under its control.</p><p>Moscow invaded and illegally occupied Crimea in March 2014. Pro-Russian militias seized parts of the Donbas starting from April 2014, triggering conflict with resisting Ukrainian troops. Much of the region was then taken over by invading Russian forces following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-trump-s-expectations-for-the-summit\">What are Trump’s expectations for the summit?</h2><p>President Trump said on Monday that he expects this meeting to be a “feel-type” conversation between him and Putin, one where he understands what the Russian leader wants.</p><p>A second meeting, he has said, is likely going to come from it soon and will include Zelenskyy and Putin, with Trump likely hosting it.</p><p>However, Trump sounded a more severe tone on Wednesday. He warned that if the Friday meeting ended without Russia agreeing to peace in Ukraine, there would be “very severe consequences” for Russia.</p><p>Trump did not specify what US actions might be. He’d earlier threatened economic sanctions on Russia “within 50 days” if Moscow did not end the war. However, the Alaska meeting was announced as the deadline of August 8 arrived, with no significant action from Washington.</p><p>Presently, Russia is under significant Western sanctions, including bans on its banks and its crude oil. In late July, the US <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trump-hits-india-with-25-tariff-extra-penalty-for-russian-oil-purchases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slammed</a> India with tariffs for buying Russian oil, and this week, US officials have warned of secondary sanctions on that country if Friday’s talks fail.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-russia-said-it-wants-from-the-meeting\">What has Russia said it wants from the meeting?</h2><p>Moscow presented a proposal to the US on August 6, last week, stating its requests, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Russia’s asks remain similar to its stated goals in June 2024. Moscow says it will stop the war if:</p><ul>\n<li>Kyiv drops its ambitions to join NATO, and if the country disarms significantly.</li>\n<li>If Kyiv pulls back and cedes all of the Donbas in return for Russia halting advances on Kherson and Zaporizhia, and handing back small occupied parts of Sumy and Kharkiv.</li>\n<li>If Western sanctions are relaxed as part of a peace deal.</li>\n</ul><p>But Russian officials have since also indicated that they want any movement towards peace to also serve as a launchpad for improved ties with the US. Putin’s delegation for the Alaska summit suggests that Russia might make economic offers – including the promise of investments in the US – to Trump.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3885918\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3885918\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3885918\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/13254939-1755080979.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukrainian recruits undergo training in Zaporizhzhia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3885918\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukrainian recruits undergoing military training at an undisclosed location in the Zaporizhia region, southeastern Ukraine, August 11, 2025, amid the Russian invasion [Handout/Ukraine’s 65th Mechanised Brigade via EPA]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-are-ukraine-and-europe-seeking-from-the-talks\">What are Ukraine and Europe seeking from the talks?</h2><p>Zelenkyy has in the past said that Ukraine will not cede territory.</p><p>He reiterated that on August 9, in light of Putin’s proposal to Trump, and stated that Ukraine would not “gift land to the occupier” and that it was impossible to do so under Ukrainian law.</p><p>Europe, meanwhile, has been nervous about what Trump might agree to. Following the three-way call between Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders on Wednesday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the UK’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined what the European coalition wanted:</p><ul>\n<li>That the US not agree to any territorial deals without Ukraine being present</li>\n<li>Ukraine needs credible security guarantees as part of any peace deal, that is, a guarantee of non-invasion by Russia.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy reiterated those calls and added that Ukraine should still be allowed to join NATO if a ceasefire is reached. He also said sanctions should be strengthened if Russia fails to agree to a peace deal on Friday.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-could-the-outcome-be\">What could the outcome be?</h2><p>Some analysts are hopeful about the prospects of the beginnings of a peace deal emerging from the summit. The big question, they say, is whether Ukraine will agree to a possible deal between the two leaders in Alaska, if its terms are unplatable to Kyiv.</p><p>However, others, like Melvin of RUSI, think this meeting is <a href=\"/news/2025/8/11/putin-will-fool-trump-why-ukrainians-are-wary-about-trump-putin-talks\">ultimately a play</a> by Russia to stall the US from making good on its sanctions threat, while allowing Moscow to keep advancing militarily in Ukraine.</p><p>“Putin believes that he can win [and] is anxious to stall the United States and any further pressure it may seek to put on Russia,” he said. “The most likely outcome of the summit is then that there may be some announcements of steps forward, but the war will continue.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two had just finished yet another doctor’s appointment in hopes of curing the child.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 3</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 3</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>Although cranky as any other sick two-year-old, it is Amina’s hair – brownish and seemingly bald in several spots – that’s a visible sign of the malnourishment doctors had previously diagnosed. Yet, despite months of treatment with a protein-heavy, ready-to-eat paste, Ali says progress has been slow, and her daughter might require more hospital visits.</p><p>“She gets sick, gets a little better, and then falls ill again,” she said, frustrated. Already, Ali and her family have had to move homes several times because of the Boko Haram conflict. They were displaced from Damboa town, about 89km (55 miles) away, and now live in Maiduguri as displaced persons.</p><p>Adding to her woes is the reduced access to care in recent months as several aid clinics she visits for free treatment have begun to scale back operations, or in some cases, completely shut their services. “Honestly, their interventions were really helpful, and we need them to come back and help our children,” Ali said.</p><p>Amina is only one of some five million children across northeast and northwest Nigeria suffering from <a href=\"https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1159140/?iso3=NGA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malnourishment</a> in what experts have called the region’s <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/malnutrition-in-nigeria-killed-652-children-in-past-six-months-msf-says\">most severe food crisis</a> in years. The troubled northeast region has, for a decade and a half, been in the throes of a conflict waged by the armed group Boko Haram, and prolonged insecurity has disrupted food supplies. In the northwest, bandit groups are causing similar upheavals, resulting in a hunger crisis that state governments are struggling to contain.</p><p>Compounding the problem this year are the massive, brutal funding cuts roiling aid organisations, which have often stepped in to help by providing food assistance to the 2.3 million displaced northeast Nigerians. Many of those organisations were dependent on funds from the United States, which, since February, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/us-senate-approves-cutting-billions-in-foreign-aid-as-trump-demands\">has reduced contributions</a> to aid programmes globally by about 75 percent.</p><p>The World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations food aid agency and the world’s largest provider of food assistance, was forced to shut down more than half of all its nutrition clinics across the northeast in August, Emmanuel Bigenimana, who leads northeast Nigeria operations, told Al Jazeera from the agency’s site in Maiduguri. Some 300,000 children are cut off from needed nutrition supplements, he said.</p><p>Already, in July, WFP doled out its last reserves of grains for displaced adults and families, Bigenimana added, standing by a row of half-empty tent warehouses. A few men removed grain sacks from the tents and loaded them onto trucks bound for neighbouring Chad, a country also caught in complex crises. For Nigeria, he said, which is in the lean season before harvest, there was no more food.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3886854\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3886854\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886854\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-06-at-20.22.34-1755107224.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Men load WFP food truck in Maiduguri, Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3886854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Men load a WFP food truck in Maiduguri, Nigeria [Sani Adamu/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"insecurity-fuels-food-crisis\">Insecurity fuels food crisis</h2><p>Northeast Nigeria should be a food basket for the country, due to its fertile, savannah vegetation suitable for cultivating nuts and grains. However, since the Boko Haram conflict broke out, the food supply has dwindled. Climate shocks in the increasingly arid region have added to the problems.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Boko Haram aims to control the territory and has been active since 2011. The group’s operations are mainly in Borno, neighbouring states in the northeast, and across the border in Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. It gained global notoriety in 2014 for the kidnapping of female students in <a href=\"/features/2024/4/14/nigerias-chibok-girls-kidnapping-10-years-later-a-struggle-to-move-on\">Chibok</a>. Internal fractures and Nigeria’s military response have <a href=\"/news/2016/6/26/nigeria-5000-rescued-from-boko-haram-in-borno\">reduced</a> the group’s capacity in recent years, but it still controls some territory, and a breakaway faction is affiliated with ISIL (ISIS). More than 35,000 people have been killed in attacks by the group, and more than 2 million are displaced.</p><p>Before the insecurity, families in the region, particularly outside the urban metropolis of Maiduguri, survived on subsistence farming, tilling plots of land, and selling surplus harvest. These days, that is hardly an option. The military has hunkered down in garrisoned towns since 2019 to avoid troop losses. It is hard to find cultivating space amid the trenches and security barriers constructed in such places, security analyst Kabir<strong> </strong>Adamu of intelligence firm Beacon Consulting, told Al Jazeera. Those who venture outside the towns risk being targeted by armed fighters.</p><p>In rural areas not under army control, Boko Haram operates as a sort of government, exploiting villagers to generate money.</p><p>“The armed actors collect taxes from them to use land for farming,” Adamu said, adding that for rural farmers, those taxes often prove heavy on the pockets. In more unlucky scenarios, farmers have been killed if they were believed to be military informants. In January, 40 farmers were <a href=\"/news/2025/1/13/armed-groups-kill-at-least-40-farmers-in-nigerias-borno-state\">executed</a> in the town of Baga. Fishermen have similarly been targeted.</p><p>The vicious cycle has repeated itself for years, and the compounding effect is the current food crisis, experts say.</p><p>Just 45 minutes from Maiduguri, in Konduga town, farmer Mustapha Modu, 55, tilled the earth in anticipation of rainfall on a cool weekday. He had just returned from a short journey to Maiduguri, braving the risky highways to buy seedlings in hopes of a good season.</p><p>Even as Modu planted, he worried that harvest might be impossible. There are widespread fears that Boko Haram fighters often lie in wait and then pounce on farmers to seize harvests. At one time, he said, his family of three wives and 17 children depended on handouts, but those hardly reached Konduga any more, so he had to do something.</p><p>“It’s been a long time since we saw them in our village,” Modu said of food aid distributors. “That’s why I managed to go and get some seedlings, even though the insurgents are still on our neck.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3886856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3886856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-08-at-09.47.28-2-1755107230.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modu Muhammad, a farmer, works on a piece of farm in Konduga, outside Maiduguri [Sani Adamu/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3886856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Modu Muhammad, a farmer, works on a farm in Konduga, outside Maiduguri [Sani Adamu/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"aid-cuts-risk-more-violence\">Aid cuts risk more ‘violence’</h2><p>The UN and its agencies were the focus of aid cuts from Washington in April, leading to the WFP receiving zero aid from the US this year, Bigenimana said. Like the US, other donors such as the European Union and the United Kingdom have also cut back on aid, instead diverting money to security as tensions remain high over Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p><p>The agency catered to some 1.3 million displaced people and others in hard-to-reach areas, fringe locations accessible only by helicopter. For children, the agency ran several nutrition clinics and supported government hospitals with ready-to-use food, a protein mixture made mostly of groundnut, which can rapidly stabilise a malnourished child.</p><p>Funding cuts caused the WFP to begin rationing supplies in recent months. In July, resources in Nigeria were completely emptied. At least $130m is required for the agency to speedily get back on track with its operations here, Bigenimana said. Extended lack of support, he said, could push more people into danger.</p><p>“People are attempting to go and get firewood to sell outside the secure points,” the official said. “Even when we delay distribution on normal days, people protest. So we are expecting that, and it could get violent.”</p><p>Multiple other NGOs across the region were also hit by the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/3/13/trumps-usaid-freeze-must-serve-as-a-wake-up-call-for-africa\">Trump aid cuts</a>. They not only provided food aid or nutrition treatment, but also medical services, and crucial <a href=\"/features/2025/8/13/health-champions-local-women-lead-the-fight-against-polio-in-nigeria\">vaccines</a> children need in the first years of life to guard against infectious diseases like measles.</p><p>Analysts like Adamu, however, criticise aid groups for what he said is their failure to create a system where people don’t rely on food aid. In Borno, the state government has, since 2021, gradually shut down camps for internally displaced people and resettled some in their communities. The aim, the government argues, is to reduce dependency and restore dignity. However, the move faces <a href=\"/news/2022/11/2/nigerians-displaced-by-insurgency-struggling-for-food-shelter-hrw\">widespread backlash</a> as aid agencies and rights organisations point out that some areas are still unsafe, and that displaced people simply move to other camps.</p><p>“They should have supported the government on security reforms for the state,” Adamu argued. That, he said, would have been a more sustainable way of empowering people and would have eased the food crisis.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1255575\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1255575\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1255575\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/000_8W492B.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Farmers killed by Boko Haram\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1255575\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mourners attend the funeral of 43 farm workers in Zabarmari, about 20km from Maiduguri, after they were killed by Boko Haram fighters in rice fields near the village of Koshobe in November 2020 [File: Audu Marte/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"rain-time-sick-time\">Rain time, sick time</h2><p>For now, the food crisis looks set to continue, and children in particular appear to be bearing the brunt, especially as heavy rains arrive.</p><p>Muhammad Bashir Abdullahi, an officer with medical aid group Doctors without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, told Al Jazeera that more malnourished children are being admitted to the organisation’s nutrition facility in Maiduguri since early August. It is possible, he said, that the shuttered services in other organisations were contributing to the higher numbers.</p><p>“We used to admit 200 children weekly, but last week we admitted up to 400 children,” Abdullahi said. MSF, which is not dependent on US aid, has recorded more than 6,000 malnourished children in its Maiduguri nutrition centre since January. Typically, children receive the protein paste, or in acute cases, a special milk solution. Abdullahi said more children are likely to be admitted in the coming weeks.</p><p>Back at the government hospital where Ali was seeking treatment for her daughter, another woman stopped outside the clinic with her children, twin baby boys.</p><p>One of them was sick, the mother, 33-year-old Fatima Muhammad, complained, and is suffering from a swollen head. This is the third hospital she was visiting, as two other facilities managed by NGOs were overwhelmed. Unfortunately, her son had not been accepting the protein paste, a sign that medical experts say signals acute malnutrition.</p><p>“His brother is sitting and crawling already, but he still cannot sit,” Muhammad said, her face squeezed in a frown. She blamed herself for not eating enough during her pregnancy, although she hardly had a choice. “I think that’s what affected them. I just need help for my son, nothing more.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

New Delhi’s relations with Washington grew particularly strong under the presidencies of George W Bush and Barack Obama, and remained that way during Trump’s first term and under Joe Biden.</p><p>At the heart of that US warmth towards India, say analysts, was its bet on New Delhi as a balancing force against Beijing, as China’s economic, military and strategic heft in the Asia Pacific region grew. With Soviet communism history, and China, the US’s biggest strategic rival, Washington increased its focus on Asia – including through the Quad, a grouping also including fellow democracies India, Australia and Japan.</p><p>But a decade after Obama famously described the US and India as “best partners”, they appear to be anything but.</p><p>Trump has <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/us-india-relations-at-their-worst-as-trump-slaps-50-percent-tariff\">imposed a 50 percent tariff</a> on Indian imports, among the highest on any country’s products. Half of that penalty is for India’s purchases of Russian oil during its ongoing war with Ukraine – something that the Biden administration encouraged India to do to keep global crude prices under control.</p><p>Meanwhile, China – which buys even more Russian oil than India – has received a reprieve from high US tariffs for now, as Washington negotiates a trade deal with New Delhi.</p><p>That contrast has prompted questions over whether Trump’s approach towards China, on the one hand, and traditional friends like India on the other, marks a broader shift away from the US pivot to Asia.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3509430\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3509430\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3509430\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25044858165155-1739494885.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Narendra Modi and Donald Trump shake hands.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3509430\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President Donald Trump and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, DC, on Thursday, February 13, 2025 [Alex Brandon/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"troubles-for-india-and-modi\">Troubles for India, and Modi</h2><p>Since the early 2000s, successive governments in New Delhi have embraced closer ties with Washington, with its stocks rising in the US as an emerging strategic partner in security, trade and technology.</p><p>Trump made that relationship personal – with Modi.</p><p>During Trump’s first term, he shared the stage twice in public rallies with Modi, as they also exchanged frequent bear hugs and described each other as friends.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But none of that could save New Delhi when Trump hit India with tariffs only matched by the levies issued against <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/10/whats-behind-trumps-50-percent-tariff-for-brazil-despite-trade-surplus\">goods from Brazil</a>.</p><p>“The tariff moves have triggered the most serious rupture in the US-India relations in decades,” said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>For months after Trump threatened tariffs on Indian imports, New Delhi tried to placate the US president, refusing to get drawn into a war of words. That has now changed, with India <a href=\"/news/2025/8/5/india-accuses-us-eu-of-russia-trade-double-standards-who-is-right\">accusing the US of hypocrisy</a> – pointing out that it still trades with Russia, and that Washington had previously wanted New Delhi to buy Russian crude.</p><p>“One thing is clear: Trust in the United States has eroded sharply in recent days, casting a long shadow over the bilateral relationship,” Vaishnav told Al Jazeera.</p><p>To Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, the crisis in the relationship also reflects a dramatic turn in the personal equation between Modi and Trump. The state of ties, he said, is “a result of a clash of personalities between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi”.</p><p>India has previously faced the threat of US sanctions for its close friendship with Russia, when it decided to buy S-400 missile defence systems from Moscow. But in 2022, under the Biden administration, it secured a waiver from those proposed sanctions.</p><p>“Not long ago, India could avoid sanctions despite purchasing S-400 weapon systems from Russia. However, now, India’s policy of multi-alignment clashes with President Trump’s transactional approach to geopolitics,” said Donthi.</p><p>To be sure, he pointed out, America’s Cold War history of bonhomie with Pakistan has meant that “a certain distrust of the US is embedded in the Indian strategic firmament”. The Trump administration’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/trumps-pakistan-embrace-tactical-romance-or-a-new-inner-circle\">recent cosiness with Pakistan</a>, with its army chief visiting the US this year, even getting a rare meeting with the president at the White House, will likely have amplified those concerns in New Delhi.</p><p>But through ups and downs in India-US ties over the years, a key strategic glue has held them close over the past quarter century: shared worries about the rise of China.</p><p>“A certain bipartisan consensus existed in the US regarding India because of its long-term strategic importance, especially in balancing China,” said Donthi.</p><p>Now, he said, “the unpredictable Trump presidency disrupted the US’s approach of ‘strategic altruism’ towards India”.</p><p>It is no longer clear to Asian partners of the US, say experts, whether Washington is as focused on building alliances in their region as it once said it was.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3312522\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3312522\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3312522\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP19265688980585-1731163135.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi walk around NRG Stadium waving to the crowd during the \"Howdy Modi: Shared Dreams, Bright Futures\" event, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2019, in Houston.

The US withdrawal from the TPP in early 2017 removed the signature trade pillar, leaving behind a strategy that leaned heavily on military cooperation and less on binding economic partnerships.</p><p>Yet, he refrained from the bulldozing negotiations that have shaped his approach to tariffs, even with <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/3/us-japan-trade-deal-will-this-one-be-too-tricky-for-trump\">allies like Japan</a> and South Korea, and from the kind of tariffs Trump has imposed now on India.</p><p>“There is currently a period of churn and uncertainty, after which clarity will emerge,” Donthi said. “There might be some cautious rebalancing in the short term from the Asian powers, who will wait for more clarity.”</p><p>India, which, unlike Japan and South Korea, has never been a treaty ally to the US – or any other country – might already be taking steps towards that rebalancing.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3889279\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3889279\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3889279\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP16243221138351-1755222012.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C529&amp;quality=80\" alt='FILE - In this Sunday, Jan. 25, 2015 file photo, President Barack Obama, left, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have coffee and tea in the gardens of the Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India.

Foreign Minister S Jaishankar is scheduled to travel to the Russian capital later this month. Also in August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is expected to visit New Delhi. And at the end of the month, Modi will travel to China for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, his first trip to the country in seven years.</p><p>India has also indicated that it is open to considering the revival of a Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral mechanism, after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov proposed the platform’s resurrection.</p><p>The concept of trilateral cooperation was first proposed in the 1990s and formally institutionalised in 2002, an idea Lavrov credited to the late Yevgeny Primakov, former chair of the Russian International Affairs Council.</p><p>Although the RIC met regularly in the years following its creation, there has been a gap in recent times, with the last meeting of RIC leaders in 2019, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan.</p><p>India’s Modi faces some “very difficult choices”, said Michael Kugelman, a senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation. “Clearly, India is not going to turn on Russia, a very special partner. And India does not turn on its friends.”</p><p>But doubling down on its strategic independence from the US – or multi-alignment, as India describes it – could come with its costs, if Trump decides to add on even more tariffs or sanctions.</p><p>“The best outcome for India immediately is the Russians and Ukrainians agree to a ceasefire,” said Kugelman, “because at the end of the day, Trump is pressuring India as a means of pressuring Russia.”</p><p>Even as questions rise over Washington’s pivot to Asia under Trump, such a rebalance will not be easy for countries like India, say experts. Ultimately, they say, the US will find its longtime partners willing to return to the fold if it decides to reinvest in those relationships.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3267931\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3267931\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3267931\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-23T112332Z_1911926536_RC29QAAPW2ZV_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-BRICS-1729695647.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C487&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3267931\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi take part in a photo ceremony before a plenary session of the BRICS 2024 summit in Kazan, Russia, October 23, 2024 [Alexander Kazakov/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-cost-of-a-rebalance\">The cost of a rebalance</h2><p>An RIC troika would ultimately be “more symbolic than substantive”, Kugelman said.</p><p>That’s because one of the sides of that triangle is “quite small and fragile: India-China ties”.</p><p>While there have been “notable easing of tensions” in recent months, “India and China <a href=\"/news/2024/10/22/how-india-and-china-pulled-back-from-a-border-war-and-why\">remain strategic competitors</a>,” added Kugelman. After four years of an eyeball-to-eyeball standoff along their Himalayan border, they finally agreed to withdraw troops last year, with Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping meeting in Kazan.</p><p>But “they continue to have a long disputed border”, Kugelman said, and trust between the Asian giants remains low.</p><p>Vaishnav of the Carnegie Endowment agreed.</p><p>“There may be opportunistic venues and moments where the countries’ interests converge. But I think, beyond defence and energy, Russia has little to offer India,” he said. “With China, while we may see a thaw in economic relations, it’s difficult to see a path to resolving broader security and geostrategic disputes.”</p><p>Jon Danilowicz, a retired diplomat who worked in the US State Department, said that a total breakdown of the US-India partnership is in neither’s interest. “The cooperation in other areas will continue, perhaps with less open enthusiasm than had been the case in recent years,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Trump tariffs could help Modi domestically.</p><p>“Trump’s hardball tactics could bolster Modi’s domestic standing. They highlight Washington’s unreliability, allowing Modi to frame himself as standing firm in the face of the US pressure,” said Vaishnav.</p><p>Modi had been facing pressure from the opposition over the ceasefire with Pakistan after four days of military hostilities in May, after 26 civilians were killed in an attack by gunmen in Kashmir in April. The opposition has accused Modi of not going harder and longer at Pakistan because of pressure from Trump, who has claimed repeatedly that he brokered the ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad – a claim India has denied.</p><p>“Any further appearance of yielding – this time to the US – could be politically costly. Resisting Trump reinforces Modi’s image as a defender of national pride,” added Vaishnav.</p><p>Many analysts have said they see Trump’s tariffs also as the outcome of as-yet unsuccessful India-US trade talks, with New Delhi reluctant to open up the country’s agriculture and dairy sectors that are politically sensitive for the Indian government. Almost half of India’s population depends on farming for its livelihood.</p><p>Modi has in recent days said that he won’t let the interests of Indian farmers suffer, “even though I know I will have to pay a personal cost”.</p><p>“He is demonstrating defiance to the domestic electorate,” said Donthi, of the International Crisis Group.</p><p>Ultimately, though, he said, both India and the US would benefit if they strike a compromise that allows them to stop the slide in ties.</p><p>“But the warmth and friendliness won’t be present, and this will be evident for some time,” Donthi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2025/6/10/two-chinese-aircraft-carriers-seen-in-pacific-for-first-time-japan-says\">aircraft carriers into the Pacific together</a> for the first time.</p><p>Maritime expert and former United States Air Force Colonel Ray Powell described the “simultaneous deployment” of China’s two aircraft carriers east of the Philippines as a “historic” moment as the country races to realise Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ambition of having a world-class navy by 2035.</p><p>“No nation except the US has operated dual carrier groups at such distances since [World War II],” said Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project of the Gordian Knot Center at Stanford University.</p><p>“While it will take years for China’s still-nascent carrier capabilities to approach that of America’s, this wasn’t just a training exercise – it was China demonstrating it can now contest and even deny US access to crucial sea lanes,” Powell told Al Jazeera.</p><p>China’s state-run news agency Xinhua described the exercise by the aircraft carriers as a “far-sea combat-oriented training”, and the state-affiliated Global Times reported that China was soon poised to enter the “three-aircraft-carrier era”, when its Fujian carrier enters service later this year.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"east-asia-is-a-home-game-for-china\">East Asia is a ‘home game’ for China</h2><p>China currently has two operational aircraft carriers – the Liaoning and Shandong – and the Fujian is undergoing sea trials.</p><p>While the Chinese navy operates the world’s largest naval fleet with more than 370 ships compared with the US’s 251 active ships in commission, Beijing still lacks the global logistics network and advanced nuclear submarine technology required of a truly mature blue water force, Powell said.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Beijing’s three aircraft carriers run on diesel compared with Washington’s 11 carriers, all of which are nuclear powered.</p><p>But “gaps” in naval capabilities are <a href=\"/news/2021/3/13/chinas-next-aircraft-carrier-could-be-nuclear-powered-report\">closing between the US and China</a>.</p><p>“[China] fully intends to close these gaps and is applying tremendous resources toward that end, and with its rapidly improving technical prowess and vastly superior shipbuilding capacity, it has demonstrated its potential to get there,” Powell said.</p><p>Beijing’s more immediate focus is not directed towards competing with the US globally, Powell added.</p><p>Rather, China is focused on changing the balance of power and convincing its allies and adversaries to accept China’s dominance within its <a href=\"/news/2023/10/24/why-does-china-claim-almost-the-entire-south-china-sea\">chosen sphere of influence</a> in East Asia.</p><p>The second option, if ever necessary, is to defeat them.</p><p>“East Asia is a ‘home game’ for China – a place where it can augment its small carrier force through its far larger land-based air and rocket forces – including so-called [aircraft] ‘carrier killer’ missile systems that can strike targets up to 4,000km [2,485 miles] away,” Powell said.</p><p>Regionally, while the Philippines engages in increasingly frequent high seas confrontations with the Chinese coastguard, it is Japan that is <a href=\"/news/2025/6/12/japan-protests-to-china-after-dangerous-moves-by-warplanes-over-pacific\">watching China’s naval build-up with concern</a>, experts said.</p><p>Japan’s Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said in June – after confirming that China’s two carriers had operated simultaneously in the Pacific for the first time – that Beijing apparently aims “to advance its operational capability of the distant sea and airspace”.</p><p>With the US increasingly perceived as becoming more inward-looking under President Donald Trump, Japan is considered a growing force in the contested maritime terrain in the Asia Pacific region amid what Tokyo has called “the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"preparation-for-a-more-uncertain-future\">‘Preparation for a more uncertain future’</h2><p>Even before Trump’s second stint as US president, Japan had embarked on the most pivotal shift in post-World War II military spending.</p><p>Tokyo’s defence spending and related costs are expected to total 9.9 trillion yen (about $67bn) for fiscal year 2025, equivalent to 1.8 percent of Japan’s gross domestic product (GDP), and the government has committed to raising spending on defence to 2 percent of GDP by 2027, according to Japanese media reports.</p><p>“[Japan’s] naval capacity is growing steadily, not just in support of the US alliance but in quiet preparation for a more uncertain future – perhaps even one in which America withdraws from the Pacific,” said Mike Burke, lecturer at Tokyo-based Meiji University.</p><p>Collin Koh, senior fellow at the Singapore-based Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS), also said that China’s growing military might, assertiveness and proclivity to resort to coercive behaviour have “aggravated Japan’s threat perception”.</p><p>But Japan alone cannot guarantee security in such a regional hotspot as the South China Sea, said Burke.</p><p>Instead, Tokyo’s goal is to check Beijing’s growing power through a Japanese presence and building partnerships with other regional players.</p><p>This year alone so far, Japan has deployed two naval fleets to “realise” what Japanese officials describe as a free and open Asia Pacific region. The first fleet was deployed from January 4 to May 10 and docked in 12 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman.</p><p>The second was deployed on April 21 and is ongoing until November, with port calls in some 23 countries, as well as roles in multilateral military exercises.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3889265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3889265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3889265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2015-10-15T000000Z_832463363_GF10000245611_RTRMADP_3_JAPAN-DEFENCE-1755219796.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sailors stand aboard the Kokuryu submarine of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) during its fleet review at Sagami Bay, off Yokosuka, south of Tokyo October 15, 2015.

The 64,000-acre outfit is a key US site for Arctic military drills and readiness.</p><p></p><p>When Trump visited the base during his first term, in 2019, he said the troops there “serve in our country’s last frontier as America’s first line of defence”.</p><p>But that wasn’t always the case. Indeed, the US government actually bought Alaska from Russia – separated by just 90km (55 miles) at the narrowest point of the Bering Strait – in 1867.</p><p>At a news briefing on August 9, Russian presidential assistant Yuri Ushakov pointed out that the two countries are neighbours.</p><p>“It seems quite logical for our delegation simply to fly over the Bering Strait and for such an important … summit of the leaders of the two countries to be held in Alaska,” Ushakov said.</p><h2 id=\"when-did-russia-assume-control-of-alaska\">When did Russia assume control of Alaska?</h2><p>When Russian Tsar Peter the Great dispatched the Danish navigator Vitus Bering in 1725 to explore the Alaskan coast, Russia already had a high interest in the region, which was rich in natural resources – including lucrative sea otter pelts – and sparsely populated.</p><p>Then, in 1799, Emperor Paul I granted the “Russian-American Company” a monopoly over governance in Alaska. This state-sponsored group established settlements like Sitka, which became the colonial capital after Russia ruthlessly overcame the native Tlingit tribe in 1804.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Russia’s Alaskan ambitions, however, quickly faced numerous challenges – the vast distance from then-capital St Petersburg, harsh climates, supply shortages, and growing competition from American explorers.</p><p>As the US expanded westward in the early 1800s, Americans soon found themselves toe to toe with Russian traders. What’s more, Russia lacked the resources to support major settlements and a military presence along the Pacific coast.</p><p>The history of the region then changed dramatically in the mid-19th century.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3886400\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-When-Russia-sold-Alaska-to-the-US-Trump-Ukraine-1755095075.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - When Russia sold Alaska to the US Trump Ukraine-1755095075\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"why-did-russia-sell-alaska-after-the-crimean-war\">Why did Russia sell Alaska after the Crimean War?</h2><p>The Crimean War (1853-1856) started when Russia invaded the Turkish Danubian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, modern-day Romania. Wary of Russian expansion into their trade routes, Britain and France allied with the ailing Ottoman Empire.</p><p>The war’s main theatre of battle became the Crimean Peninsula, as British and French forces targeted Russian positions in the Black Sea, which connects to the Mediterranean through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits – previously controlled by the Ottoman Empire.</p><p>After three years, Russia humiliatingly lost the war, forcing it to reassess its colonial priorities. According to calculations by Advocate for Peace, a journal published by the American Peace Society in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Russia spent the equivalent of 160 million pounds sterling on the war.</p><p>Meanwhile, due to overhunting, Alaska yielded little profit by the mid-1800s. Its proximity to British-controlled Canada also made it a liability in any future Anglo-Russian conflict.</p><p>By the early 1860s, Tsar Alexander II concluded that selling Alaska would both raise funds Russia desperately needed and prevent Britain from seizing it in a future war. The US, which had continued to expand across the continent, emerged as a willing buyer, leading to the 1867 Alaska Purchase.</p><h2 id=\"how-was-the-sale-received-in-the-us\">How was the sale received in the US?</h2><p>After the American Civil War ended in 1865, Secretary of State William Seward took up Russia’s longstanding offer to buy Alaska. On March 30, 1867, Washington agreed to buy Alaska from Russia for $7.2m.</p><p>For less than 2 cents an acre (4 metres), the US acquired nearly 1.5 million sq km (600,000 square miles) of land and ensured access to the Pacific northern rim. But opponents of the Alaska Purchase, who saw little value in the vast ice sheet, persisted in calling it “Seward’s Folly” or “Seward’s Icebox”.</p><p>“We simply obtain by the treaty the nominal possession of impassable deserts of snow, vast tracts of dwarf timbers… we get… Sitka and the Prince of Wales Islands. All the rest is waste territory,” wrote the New York Daily Tribune in April 1867.</p><p>But in 1896, the Klondike Gold Strike convinced even the harshest critics that Alaska was a valuable addition to US territory. Over time, the strategic importance of Alaska was gradually recognised, and in January 1959 Alaska finally became a US state.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-its-economy-like-now\">What’s its economy like now?</h2><p>By the early 20th century, Alaska’s economy began to diversify away from gold. Commercial fishing, especially for salmon and halibut, became a major industry, while copper mining boomed in places like Kennecott.</p><p>Then, during World War II, the construction of military bases brought infrastructure improvements and population growth. The most transformative moment, however, came in 1968 with the discovery of vast oil reserves at Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic coast.</p><p>Oil revenues became the cornerstone of Alaska’s economy, funding public services as well as the Alaska Permanent Fund, which pays annual dividends – via returns on stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets – to residents.</p><p>These payments, known as the Permanent Fund Dividend, will ensure that Alaska’s oil wealth continues to benefit residents even after reserves run out. This system has allowed Alaska to have no state income tax or state sales tax, a rarity in the US.</p><p>More recently, tourism has surged in Alaska, drawing visitors to the state’s national parks and glaciers. Today, Alaska has transformed from a ridiculed purchase into a resource-rich state, built on a mix of natural resource extraction, fishing and tourism.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite Alaska’s history of trading land like currency, President Zelenskyy will <a href=\"/news/2025/8/13/what-are-zelenskyy-europe-demanding-of-trump-ahead-of-putin-summit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hope</a> that Friday’s meeting between Trump and Putin does not come at the expense of Ukrainian territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Both the company and the union have issued notices that disruptions to the airline’s services will begin on Saturday.</p><h2 id=\"what-services-will-be-affected-and-when\">What services will be affected, and when?</h2><p>Air Canada said it will reduce flights gradually over three days, starting with dozens of cancellations on Thursday and about 500 more by Friday evening. By 1am Toronto time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, all flights will be halted.</p><p>Cargo services will also be affected, but Air Canada Express regional flights will operate as usual, as they rely on contracts with other airlines.</p><p>However, these partners handle only about 20 percent of Air Canada’s daily passengers. Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge, a subsidiary that offers low-cost flights, <a href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/media/air-canada-receives-72-hour-strike-notice-from-cupe-and-issues-lockout-notice-in-response/\">carry roughly 130,000 passengers a day</a>.</p><p>In response to the walkout anticipated for early Saturday, Air Canada has announced its own “lockout”, a strategy that prevents employees from coming into work in order to force them to the negotiating table.</p><p>The airline has warned that once the lockout begins, about 1:30am Toronto time (05:30 GMT), it may not be able to quickly restore flights.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Mark Nasr, the chief operations officer for Air Canada, explained that a restart, “under the best circumstances, will take a full week to complete”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3888922\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3888922\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3888922 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-14T142541Z_45681574_RC255GA85F9U_RTRMADP_3_AIR-CANADA-LABOR-STRIKE-1755195136.jpg?resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Air Canada protests with a line of flight attendants holding signs that read, &quot;Unpaid work won't fly&quot;\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3888922\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Air Canada flight attendants, represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, form a picket line at the Toronto Pearson international airport on August 11 [Carlos Osorio/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-are-flight-attendants-striking\">Why are flight attendants striking?</h2><p>Wages are the main sticking point in the negotiations.</p><p>The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) said its negotiators are unhappy with Air Canada’s proposed wage hikes and other compensation terms, and they have therefore turned down an offer to move the contract discussions into arbitration.</p><p>“For the past nine months, we have put forward solid, data-driven proposals on wages and unpaid work, all rooted in fairness and industry standards,” said Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada component of CUPE, <a href=\"https://cupe.ca/air-canada-flight-attendants-forced-issue-strike-notice-end-unpaid-work#:~:text=Wesley%20Lesosky%2C%20President%20of%20the%20Air%20Canada%20Component%20of%20CUPE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a statement</a>. “Air Canada’s response to our proposals makes one thing clear: they are not interested in resolving these critical issues.”</p><p>According to the union, the airline declined to raise flight attendant pay to meet industry standards, keep pace with inflation or match the federal minimum wage.</p><p>Since 2000, starting wages for flight attendants with Air Canada have risen only $3 per hour, while inflation has climbed 69 percent over the same period, the union explained.</p><p></p><p>Air Canada, however, <a href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/media/air-canada-declares-an-impasse-in-cupe-negotiations-as-midnight-threshold-for-a-strike-or-lockout-notice-nears/#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> the union turned down a proposal sent on Monday that included a 38-percent pay increase over four years, along with other benefits and protections.</p><p>But the union disputed the benefits of that deal. Instead, it explained that the flight attendants suffered a 9-percent cut in their last contract, meaning that an 8-percent increase over the first year of the new deal is inadequate to recoup the costs.</p><p>“It is, in effect, a pay cut,” CUPE said in its statement.</p><p>The union also argues that Air Canada does not currently offer “ground pay”, an industry term that describes compensation given for all the services provided before a plane’s doors close.</p><p>That work can include assistance given to travellers in the airport, baggage handling and helping travellers get settled in their seats as the plane prepares to push back from the airport gate.</p><p>“[For] any of our federally regulated safety checks, which we do an hour before boarding, we are not compensated. We are not compensated for boarding and deplaning,” Shanyn Elliott, the chair of the CUPE strike committee, told the news outlet Global National.</p><p>“It averages about 35 hours a month that we are at work not paid.”</p><p>The union said that it is seeking full pay for all hours worked, along with cost-of-living increases.</p><p>Ground pay, also called “boarding pay”, has been a key issue in negotiations at US airlines as well, since many carriers do not compensate flight attendants at their hourly rate during crucial periods before or after the flight.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3888939\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3888939\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3888939 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-14T165720Z_2013197635_RC227GAKQZ5P_RTRMADP_3_AIR-CANADA-LABOR-STRIKE-1755196679.jpg?resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt='Union activists hold placards that read \"UnfAIR Canada\" and \"Poverty wages = unCanadian\"' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3888939\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Union activists hold placards as they interrupt a news conference by Air Canada executives on August 14 [Kyaw Soe Oo/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-many-passengers-will-be-affected-and-what-will-they-get-in-return\">How many passengers will be affected, and what will they get in return?</h2><p>The airline, which serves 64 countries with a fleet of 259 aircraft, said the shutdown poses “a major risk” to both the company and its employees. The disruption could impact 130,000 passengers each day, including 25,000 Canadians, during the height of the summer travel season.</p><p>Air Canada <a href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/about/corporate-profile.html#/\">has nearly 430 daily flights</a> between Canada and the US, reaching more than 50 US airports. It also provides domestic service to 50 Canadian airports and averages more than 500 daily flights.</p><p>The airlines said that passengers whose flights are cancelled will be notified and can receive a full refund online.</p><p>The airline has also arranged with other Canadian and international carriers to offer alternative travel options where possible. But it emphasised that some flight alternatives may not be feasible.</p><p>“Given other carriers are already very full due to the summer travel peak, securing such capacity will take time and, in many cases, will not be immediately possible,” the airline explained.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-government-responded\">How has the government responded?</h2><p>Air Canada has said it has sought government-directed arbitration to resolve the situation.</p><p>Under Canada’s Labour Code, the government’s labour minister has the power to intervene and trigger the imposition of a deal through the Canada Industrial Relations Board.</p><p>That, in turn, could force flight attendants back to work. The union has <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/accomponent/posts/pfbid02GrQ1saC1QzRKtFPq8A2eRAB4eUV1etfuPbYRa8ieixofJJB1ntG8G7Eshgx1jvDCl#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-component=\"link\">asked</a> Canada’s PM Mark Carney “to refrain from intervening”. It argued that government action would tip the negotiations in Air Canada’s favour.</p><p>“Why would any employer bother negotiating if they know the government is going to bail them out when negotiations get tough?” the union wrote in a letter posted to social media.</p><p>Canada’s Labour Minister Patty Hajdu urged both sides to return to the bargaining table. “To be clear: deals that are made at the bargaining table are the best ones,” Hajdu said.</p><p>“I urge both parties to put their differences aside, come back to the bargaining table and get this done now for the many travellers who are counting on you,” she added.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"
