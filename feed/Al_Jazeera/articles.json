That’s 90 billion euros. The remainder would be for international partners to cover,” she said.</p><p>“We are increasing the cost of Russia’s war of aggression. And this should act as a further incentive for Russia to engage at the negotiating table,” von der Leyen added.</p><p>The Commission president suggested that the proposal to EU member states had taken into account almost all the concerns raised by Belgium, whose Brussels-based financial institution <a href=\"/news/2025/10/23/eu-leaders-delay-decision-on-using-frozen-russian-funds-to-aid-ukraine\">Euroclear</a> is the main holder of the frozen Russian assets.</p><p>Von der Leyen said the new proposal also covers other financial institutions in the EU holding Russian assets, while EU officials said France, Germany, Sweden and Cyprus also hold such assets that will be used to fund the proposed loan.</p><p>The Commission also said the scheme does not amount to confiscating the money as it would be in the form of a loan – although Ukraine would only have to redeem it if Russia pays reparations for the war damage caused.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The EU could proceed with the frozen assets proposal if 15 out of 27 members vote in favour. The Commission said it hoped to clinch a firm commitment from member states at an EU leaders summit on December 18.</p><p>The second option – borrowing on international markets – would normally require unanimity among EU countries, which could prove a difficult hurdle as Hungary’s Russia-friendly government has opposed previous funding for Ukraine.</p><p>Belgium has repeatedly voiced its resistance to the frozen assets plan, suggesting the proposed use of 140 billion euros ($163bn) it holds would imperil a peace deal in the short term while placing it at risk of future crippling legal action by Russia.</p><p>One demand from Brussels is that EU countries commit to covering all legal costs arising from any future Russian lawsuits challenging the scheme.</p><p>On Wednesday, hours before the proposal’s presentation, Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot reiterated these reservations, saying the legal texts “do not address our concerns in a satisfactory manner”.</p><p>“We have repeatedly said that we consider the option of the reparations loan the worst of all, as it is risky; it has never been done before,” Prevot said. “This explains why we keep on pleading for an alternative, namely the EU borrowing the amounts needed on the markets.”</p><p>Russia, meanwhile, has said the EU using its assets would constitute theft. On Monday, Andrei Kostin, the head of Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB, threatened the bloc with 50 years of litigation if the idea comes to fruition.</p><p>Von der Leyen, meanwhile, said United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had “positively received” news of the proposed reparation loan. That reported assurance comes despite complexities shrouding the scheme related to the Trump administration’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">28-point plan</a> to end the war, which proposed using some of the assets in a joint US-Russian investment vehicle.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, the EU also agreed to phase out Russian gas imports by late 2027, taking a significant stride towards ending the bloc’s decades-long dependency on Russian energy.</p><p>The EU announced the “historic agreement” had been reached between EU government and European Parliament representatives on June proposals set out by the European Commission to end Russian energy shipments.</p><p>Under the agreement, member states will halt imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) by the end of 2026. Pipeline gas imports will stop by November 2027.</p><p>The body said the move allows it to end its “dependence on an unreliable supplier”, which has “repeatedly destabilised European energy markets, put at risk security of supply with energy blackmail and harmed the European economy”.</p><p>Von der Leyen hailed the move, saying that “today, we enter the era of Europe’s full energy independence from Russia”.</p><p>“By depleting Putin’s war chest, we stand in solidarity with Ukraine and set our sights on new energy partnerships and opportunities for the sector,” she said.</p><p>Hungary and Slovakia look likely to mount legal challenges to the measure, with both countries still highly reliant on gas and oil supplies from Moscow and fearful that more costly alternatives will damage their economies.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Since India’s independence from British rule and its partition to create the state of Pakistan in 1947, the two countries have fought two of their three full-scale wars over Kashmir.</p><p>In the late 1980s, an armed rebellion against New Delhi’s rule erupted on the Indian side, which has since claimed tens of thousands of lives, most of them civilians. The rebellion saw the deployment of nearly a million Indian soldiers, making it one of the world’s most militarised regions. The rebels aim to either carve an independent nation out of Kashmir or merge the region with Muslim-majority Pakistan.</p><p>The anti-India sentiments in Kashmir intensified in 2019 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu majoritarian government <a href=\"/news/2023/12/11/whats-article-370-what-to-know-about-india-top-court-verdict-on-kashmir\">scrapped a law</a> that granted the region partial autonomy in matters of land ownership and livelihoods, and split it into two “union territories” to be directly governed by New Delhi. Since then, suspected Kashmiri rebels have launched several attacks against Indian security forces and government employees. India accuses Pakistan of training and financing the rebels, but Islamabad dismisses the charge, claiming it only provides diplomatic backing to Kashmir’s struggle.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack as well, and swiftly moved to downgrade all diplomatic ties, suspend bilateral trade, and place a key water treaty in abeyance. Two weeks after the killings, in early May, India and Pakistan engaged in an intense <a href=\"/news/2025/6/30/political-limits-why-did-india-lose-jets-to-pakistani-fire-in-may-fight\">four-day air war</a>, each striking the other’s military bases. Dozens of people were killed on both sides — India insists it only hit “terrorists” in Pakistan, while Islamabad said civilians were principally the victims — before the neighbours <a href=\"/news/2025/6/18/indias-modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-pakistan-ceasefire\">agreed to a ceasefire</a>.</p><p>But seven months later, the pause in fighting has meant little for hundreds of families, like Majid’s and Samina’s, that were <a href=\"/features/2025/4/30/exiled-india-pakistan-families-split-as-border-shuts-over-kashmir-attack\">broken apart</a> by one of India’s moves.</p><p>In the <a href=\"/news/2025/4/25/were-cursed-kashmiris-under-attack-across-india-after-pahalgam-killings\">aftermath of the Pahalgam attack</a>, India revoked all visas issued to Pakistani citizens residing in India, including medical and diplomatic visas, giving them an April 29, 2025 deadline to leave the country, and closing the Attari-Wagah border in Punjab province’s Amritsar district on May 1.</p><p>Nearly 800 Pakistanis – many of them married to Indian nationals in Kashmir and other parts of India – were deported.</p><p>With authorities providing no clarity on whether those families will ever be reunited, the wait drags on for relatives on both sides of the border.</p><h2 id=\"i-think-of-ending-my-life\">‘I think of ending my life’</h2><p>Majid married Samina, his 38-year-old Pakistani cousin, in 2018.</p><p>Despite tense relations between their countries, their marriage was not especially rare. When millions of Muslims moved to a newly-created Pakistan in 1947 – as did Hindus to India – many left behind relatives on both sides of the border. Over the years, these blood ties gave rise to cross-border marriages between citizens of the two countries.</p><p>But on April 28, Samina was summoned to the local police station in Srinagar’s Dalgate area. Noorie and Hussein slept on their laps as the couple met the police officer. When the children woke up, they realised their father had brought them back home, their mother no longer around.</p><p>Samina was detained at the police station and informed that she would be deported to Pakistan — she is originally from Lahore — the next day.</p><p>Sitting quietly in a dimly lit room that served as a bedroom and kitchen, Majid said he is still struggling to process the events that turned his life upside down.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4049846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4049846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4049846\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4287-1-1761052046.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistanis deported by India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4049846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Majid’s children looking out of the window of their one-room home [Arjumand Shaheen/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>He used to wait tables at a local restaurant and earned about $70 a month. But since his wife was taken away, he has not been able to leave his little children alone. He is now jobless.</p><p>“I have not slept properly for six months now. My whole time is spent taking care of the children. I cannot think about doing anything else,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Confined to his room, Majid says he is unable to go out even to buy groceries. “Sometimes, I think of ending my life,” he said. “But I stop myself, wondering who would take care of them when I am gone.”</p><p>Majid’s children, Hussein and Noorie, also do not know when they will be able to see their mother.</p><p>“The sudden separation from Samina has traumatised them. They call out to their mother in sleep,” Majid told Al Jazeera as he made a futile attempt to distract his children by showing them cartoons on his mobile phone.</p><p>“All they know is that the police took her away. Whenever they see any police or army officer, they ask them to bring their mother back.”</p><p>Meanwhile, forcibly separated from her children, Samina is struggling with health issues in Pakistan. Her blood pressure is unstable due to stress. “She gets hospitalised every now and then. Her blood pressure isn’t normalising,” said Majid.</p><p>When asked about the deportations, Shazia Ilmi, spokeswoman for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), suggested that the moves were driven by national security concerns. Those deported were Pakistani nationals, she emphasised, and often were “married to those who have been found involved in terrorism and activities that are antinational”, she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“So this cannot become a way for Pakistani nationals to marry into India and support such activities. Why should India have Pakistani nationals?” she said.</p><p>When pressed to present evidence in support of her allegation that deportees were often married to those involved in “terrorism”, Ilmi accused Al Jazeera of having a “dubious agenda”. “I think you have a nasty agenda to find things against India and the Indian government, and it will not work,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"reunited-after-years-separated-again-in-12-days\">Reunited after years, separated again in 12 days</h2><p>Muhammad Shehbaz is a 32-year-old resident of Daryaganj, a densely populated neighbourhood of what is called Old Delhi. In 2014, he married his maternal cousin from Pakistan, 27-year-old Erum. Since then, Erum had been living in India on a long-term visa until she travelled to Pakistan to introduce their three-year-old son, Almeer, to her family.</p><p>That was in March 2020 – just 10 days before a lockdown and travel restrictions were imposed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Erum was forced to extend her stay in Pakistan, during which her Indian visa expired.</p><p>After the lockdown was lifted, Shehbaz tried hard to secure another Indian visa so that Erum could return. After five years of repeated rejections, she was finally granted one in April this year. After more than five years of separation, an elated Shehbaz was finally going to be reunited with his family.</p><p>Erum reached New Delhi on April 17. Twelve days later, the Pahalgam attack happened. She was deported back to Pakistan on April 29.</p><p>“After so many years of separation, hard work and longing, she had finally come home. My world had lit up, and I forgot everything. And then, in the blink of an eye, it all collapsed again. She was taken away, leaving me vulnerable and drowning in despair,” Shehbaz told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“When the police came to our home and informed us about Erum’s deportation, I became numb. My son was crying inconsolably. The struggles I faced all these years to reunite my family are beyond words. And now, it feels like it was all in vain.”</p><p>Almeer, now nine, first grew up for years without his father and has now been torn away from his mother. Shehbaz, who runs a small jewellery business, is worried about his future.</p><p>“He has grown frail and quiet, not expressing much, but I can see he is shattered inside,” Shehbaz told Al Jazeera. “Caught in the animosity between the two countries, why are ordinary citizens pushed to the wall? What is our fault?”</p><h2 id=\"parveena-hadn-t-been-to-pakistan-in-40-years\">Parveena hadn’t been to Pakistan in 40 years</h2><p>Back in Indian-administered Kashmir, Fazl‑u‑Rehman, 62, does not know if he might be able to see his wife, Parveena, who was deported in April to Pakistan, a country she had not seen in more than four decades.</p><p>Parveena, 65, was born in Pakistan’s Karachi city. But she never went back after marrying Rehman in 1982, as she built a life with her husband and children in Baramulla district.</p><p>Rehman now fears he may die without seeing her. “Our home has been divided. Everything is in ruins.

Left with no option, I had to sacrifice my education.”</p><p>Soliha said her mother has been undergoing treatment for heart disease in Kashmir. But she has no means to continue her treatment in Pakistan, where she has no immediate relatives or financial support. She said her mother lives in Karachi with a distant relative, who is paralysed.</p><p>“There is no one to look after her. If anything happens to my mother there, the Indian government would be responsible,” she said.</p><p>“If someone else committed the crime, why are we being punished for it? My education and career are at stake. I am facing mental health issues because of my mother’s deportation.”</p><p>Her father, Rehman, intervened. “There are 700,000 to 800,000 armed forces in Kashmir. If they couldn’t prevent the [Pahalgam] attack, how are civilians being held responsible for it?” he asked, furiously.</p><p>Parveen urged the government to “stop punishing your own citizens” and demanded the return of their loved ones.</p><h2 id=\"never-felt-so-helpless-in-life\">‘Never felt so helpless in life’</h2><p>Abdullah* says he has been forced to rebuild his life that fell apart after his wife, Tamarah*, 25, was deported on April 29. He says his twin toddlers – Ayan and Atif, just 18 months old – no longer play, laugh, or eat as they once did. One of the twins was still breastfeeding when Tamarah was deported.</p><p>Abdullah, a 38-year-old public bank manager in Kashmir’s Kupwara district, married Tamarah in 2018. As she was driven to the Attari-Wagah border for deportation, Abdullah took his children and followed the police van in his car all the way from Kupwara to Amritsar, a distance of more than 500km (324 miles).</p><p>“I cried on the way, pleading helplessly with the police to at least let the children see their mother one last time,” he told Al Jazeera. “But they didn’t even allow us a proper goodbye.”</p><p>The first two months were “nothing short of hell” for the children.</p><p>“After the sudden separation from their mother, their health began to deteriorate. They suffered frequent fevers and vomiting,” he said, adding that he has barely attended office in the past six months, with one or the other child needing hospitalisation.</p><p>“Everything is disrupted. Life has turned upside down. I have never felt so helpless in my life,” he said.</p><p>Abdullah said even lawyers refused to take up the case of his children, separated from their mother. He said the lawyers said no legal action could proceed without permission from the federal Ministry of Home Affairs. In desperation, Abdullah said he wrote to Prime Minister Modi and other authorities in New Delhi and Kashmir, but received no response.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"because-they-are-pakistanis-and-muslims\">‘Because they are Pakistanis and Muslims’</h2><p>Human rights activists say there is no justification for penalising innocent civilians due to the tensions between India and Pakistan.</p><p>“Ordinary people hold no enmity towards each other. Why should they suffer because of political or diplomatic conflicts?” said Shabnam Hashmi, a New Delhi-based activist. “In any conflict, civilians must never be the casualties. To separate a child from their mother is cruel, traumatic, and utterly inhuman – a clear violation of human rights.”</p><p>Waheed Para, a Kashmiri legislator from the Peoples Democratic Party, said the deportation of Pakistani nationals is unjust and unfortunate.</p><p>“After Kashmir’s conversion into a union territory, our ability to influence or resolve such issues has been severely limited. We can raise our voices and try to intervene, but we remain largely powerless in the face of decisions made elsewhere,” he told Al Jazeera, referring to the federal government in New Delhi.</p><p>“In cross-border shelling, civilians lose lives and homes. Unfortunately, innocent citizens, children, and women continue to be the casualties of a geopolitical issue between India and Pakistan,” Para added.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the Ministry of Home Affairs for their response, but did not receive any reply.</p><p>Colin Gonsalves, Supreme Court lawyer and rights activist, said the deportation of Pakistani nationals has no legitimate connection to the Pahalgam attack.</p><p>“Linking them to Pahalgam [attack] is simply an excuse and a deeply flawed one … The government may claim it is a fallout of Pahalgam, but that claim is not only misleading, it’s dangerous,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They were deported simply because they are Pakistanis and Muslims – a clear reflection of a bias against both.”</p><p>Back in Kupwara, Abdullah wipes the tears rolling down his cheeks, struggling to speak as he recollects the months since his wife Tamarah was deported.</p><p>“What the Indian government did to us is no different from what the attackers did in Pahalgam. They destroyed our families and homes too,” he said. “Why are our innocent children being punished? What did they do?”</p><p><em>*Names changed to protect their identities over fears of government reprisal.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Since the end of the Cold War, it has deepened strategic and military ties with the US while trying to keep its friendship with Russia afloat.</p><p>Yet, Russia’s war on Ukraine has challenged that balance – and Putin’s visit could offer signs of how Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans to juggle New Delhi’s competing relationships without sacrificing any of them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3034793\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3034793\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3034793\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-08T214113Z_1994694215_RC27R8A94GVJ_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-INDIA-TALKS-1720490958.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C475&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russia's President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence near Moscow, Russia July 8, 2024.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3034793\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, right, shakes hands with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence near Moscow, Russia, July 8, 2024 [Sergei Bobylyov/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-scheduled-for-putin\">What’s scheduled for Putin?</h2><p>Putin is expected to land on Thursday evening and head for a private dinner with Modi at the prime minister’s residence in the heart of the Indian capital, New Delhi.</p><p>On the morning of Friday, December 5, Putin is scheduled to visit Rashtrapati Bhavan, the presidential palace, for a guard of honour and a meeting with India’s ceremonial head of state, Droupadi Murmu. He will then, like all visiting leaders, travel to Raj Ghat, the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p>Then, Putin and Modi will meet at Hyderabad House, a complex that hosts most leadership summits for the latest chapter of an annual India-Russia summit. After that, they are scheduled to meet business leaders, before attending a banquet thrown in Putin’s honour by Murmu, the Indian president.</p><p>Earlier, the Kremlin said in a statement that Putin’s visit to India was “of great importance, providing an opportunity to comprehensively discuss the extensive agenda of Russian-Indian relations as a particularly privileged strategic partnership”.</p><p>Putin will be joined by Andrei Belousov, his defence minister, and a wide-ranging delegation from business and industry, including top executives of Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport, and reportedly the heads of sanctioned oil firms Rosneft and Gazprom Neft.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4149316\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4149316\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4149316\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25335239159230-1764816544.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C566&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi greet each other before their meeting in New Delhi, India, on Dec. 6, 2021.

Modi was supposed to visit Russia for the summit, but the conclave was put off.</p><p>In 2023, Putin skipped a visit to India for the G20 summit in New Delhi. At the time, Putin was rarely travelling abroad, largely because of an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against him related to the Ukraine war. India is not a member of the ICC – and so it would have been safe for Putin to attend, but Western members of the G20 made it clear that their leaders would be uncomfortable sharing the room with the Russian president.</p><p>Finally, in 2024, the annual summit resumed, with Modi visiting Russia.

The West was stopping purchases of Russian crude, and a complete global ban on that oil would have shrunk global supplies, raising prices. India, by increasing its uptake of Russian oil, helped stabilise the global market.</p><p>But as Trump, in his second term, has looked for levers to use to pressure Moscow and Kyiv to end the war, he has targeted India for buying Russian oil. After initially imposing 25 percent tariffs on Indian goods, Trump doubled that to 50 percent as a penalty for Russian crude purchases.</p><p>For months after that, India continued importing Russian oil and defended what it called its “strategic autonomy”.</p><p>However, in October, Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two biggest oil firms – Rosneft and Lukoil – and threatened sanctions against firms of other countries that trade with them.</p><p>Reliance, India’s largest private oil refiner – and the biggest buyer of Russian oil in India – has since said that it will no longer export petroleum products that use Russian crude.</p><p>Indian imports of Russian crude are expected to fall to a three-year low now. Meanwhile, India recently signed a deal to dramatically ramp up its import of gas from the US.</p><p>In the defence sector too, the US has been pressuring India to buy more from it and less from Russia.</p><p>“New Delhi is wary of upsetting Washington regarding its defence deals with Moscow, but that’s not going to deter it from making important deals,” said Donthi, the analyst at Crisis Group. “India hopes to blunt US criticism by making similar deals with it, some of which are already under way.”</p><p>But Trump’s pressure risks hurting goodwill for the US in India.</p><p>Kanwal Sibal, former Indian foreign secretary and an ex-ambassador to Russia, said Trump and the US were employing “double standards”.</p><p>“Trump can roll out a red carpet for Putin in Alaska. Why should India not build on its ties with Russia then?” he added, referring to the Trump-Putin summit in August.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4147510\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4147510\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4147510\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-09-01T071903Z_1458167711_RC2VIGAJHB0S_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-SCO-PUTIN-MODI-1764750848.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C530&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"putin\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4147510\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attend a meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, September 1, 2025 [Vladimir Smirnov/Sputnik/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"in-which-sector-are-india-russia-ties-strong\">In which sector are India-Russia ties strong?</h2><p>While the bilateral energy ties between India and Russia face several barriers, their defence ties are steadier.</p><p>Russia remains India’s largest defence supplier, accounting for roughly 36 percent of arms imports, and more than 60 percent of India’s existing arsenal.</p><p>Import numbers have come down from 72 percent in 2010, as India attempts to boost domestic production and also buy more from the US and European nations.

India’s air force chief, Marshal AP Singh, said that “the S-400 was a game changer” for India.</p><p>New Delhi is now looking to buy additional S-400 air defence systems.

The India-Russia goal of reaching $100bn in trade by 2030 appears distant.</p><p>Instead, analysts told Al Jazeera, the two countries now appear to be betting on labour migration as a driver of people-to-people and economic ties.</p><p>According to the estimates of the Russian Ministry of Labour, by 2030, the country is expected to see a shortfall of 3.1 million workers. Indian workers could fill that gap.</p><p>“Russia is opening up its labour market for India and looking to change its traditional supplier of labour from Central Asian countries to India,” said Kumar, the professor of international studies. “This kind of migration can have a positive impact on India-Russia relations.”</p><p>That won’t change the fundamental tension that undergirds India’s ties with Russia: New Delhi’s keenness to not damage relations with the US in the process.</p><p>As India simultaneously negotiates trade deals with the US, the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union, an economic bloc led by Russia at the moment, New Delhi is walking a fine line “where it risks antagonising either of them, who are all important economic trade partners,” said Kumar.</p><p>The one thing that could help: a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, say analysts.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump adviser Jared Kushner spent hours at the Kremlin but departed with no breakthrough on ending the war.</li>\n<li>Trump said Witkoff and Kushner briefed him about the talks and told him their impression of Putin was “he would like to make a deal”. But Trump added that he “can’t tell” what will come out of the meeting “because it does take two to tango”. He added that Washington already has “something pretty well worked out [with Ukraine]”.</li>\n<li>Asked if it would be correct to say that Putin had rejected Washington’s proposals, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov disagreed. “A direct exchange of views took place yesterday for the first time,” Peskov said. “Some things were accepted, some things were marked as unacceptable. This is a normal working process of finding a compromise.”</li>\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed his team is preparing for meetings in the US and that dialogue with Trump’s envoys will continue. “Only by taking Ukraine’s interests into account is a dignified peace possible,” he said.</li>\n<li>An unnamed White House official confirmed to Reuters that Witkoff and Kushner would meet with Ukrainian officials in Miami on Thursday.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"united-nations\">United Nations</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ninety-one countries at the United Nations General Assembly, including the US, have backed a resolution demanding Russia “ensure the immediate, safe and unconditional return of all Ukrainian children who have been <a href=\"/news/2025/6/10/russia-ukraine-children-war\">forcibly transferred or deported</a>” from Ukraine since Moscow launched its war in 2022.</li>\n<li>Russia and 11 other countries voted against the resolution – which was drafted by Ukraine, Canada and the European Union – while 57 countries abstained.</li>\n<li>Ahead of the vote, Russia had urged countries to oppose the resolution. “Each vote for the resolution is support for lies, war and confrontation.

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the body is “proposing to cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s financing needs for the next two years. That’s 90 billion euros”. She added that the “remainder would be for international partners to cover”.</li>\n<li>But Belgium, whose Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear is the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/12/2/europe-should-seize-russias-frozen-assets-now\">main holder of the Russian assets,</a> has voiced a range of legal concerns. While von der Leyen said the proposal had taken into account Belgium’s concerns, Brussels does not “share that assessment”, a senior official told Reuters, adding that it “cannot accept being asked to bear the risks of such an operation alone”.</li>\n<li>The EU also agreed to phase out Russian gas imports by late 2027 as part of an effort to end the bloc’s decades-long dependency on Russian energy. Under the agreement, the EU will permanently halt the import of Russian gas and move towards a phase-out of Russian oil. Liquefied natural gas imports will be phased out by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by the end of September 2027.</li>\n<li>Hungary and Slovakia are both weighing up legal options to challenge the order, as both EU members are still highly reliant on gas and oil supplies from Moscow and fearful that more costly alternatives will damage their economies.</li>\n<li>More than two-thirds of NATO member states have so far committed $4bn worth of weapons for Ukraine through the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/15/germany-pledges-2bn-in-military-aid-for-ukraine-as-kyiv-seeks-more-funds\">Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL)</a> – an initiative to supply Kyiv with weapons bought from the US – according to the alliance’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte.</li>\n<li>Outside NATO, Australia and New Zealand have also agreed to contribute to the PURL initiative, Rutte said.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"european-defence\">European defence</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Germany has become the first European nation to deploy the Arrow air defence system, built to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles such as Russia’s Oreshnik.</li>\n<li>The system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in cooperation with the US Missile Defense Agency, is used as the upper layer of Israel’s missile defences. “Who could have imagined that only 80 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the Jewish state, through the technologies it develops, would help defend not only Germany but all of Europe,” said Ron Prosor, Israel’s ambassador to Germany.</li>\n<li>The Romanian military has blown up a maritime drone it said was endangering navigation in the Black Sea, identifying it as a Ukrainian-developed Sea Baby. Ukraine’s SBU security service, however, said that all of its Sea Baby maritime drones engaged in operational tasks in the Black Sea region were accounted for, with none entering Romanian waters.</li>\n<li>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has described attacks on Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea in recent days as <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/russian-tanker-struck-off-turkiye-as-ukraine-targets-shadow-fleet\">“very scary”</a>.

for the next chair of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>While Trump has yet to confirm his nominee, one name stands out as the overwhelming favourite: Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Prediction market Kalshi on Wednesday put the odds of Hassett being nominated at 86 percent, compared with 6 percent for former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and 4 percent for sitting Fed governor Michelle Bowman.</p><h2 id=\"why-does-it-matter-who-leads-the-federal-reserve\">Why does it matter who leads the Federal Reserve?</h2><p>As the central bank of the world’s largest economy, the Fed is arguably the most important financial institution on the planet.</p><p>The Fed performs several key roles in the US economy, including setting monetary policy, supervising and regulating banks, and promoting the stability of the financial system by serving as a lender of last resort.</p><p>The most closely watched of these functions is monetary policy, which the Fed primarily manages by setting interest rates.</p><p>The Fed’s policymaking committee meets eight times each year to set the federal funds rate, the target interest rate at which commercial banks lend to each other on a short-term basis.</p><p>The committee is holding its final meeting of 2025 on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, when it is widely expected to agree on a 0.25 percent cut to the benchmark rate, currently set in the range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent.</p><p>The benchmark rate has far-reaching implications for the entire economy, since banks’ borrowing costs influence the interest rates they charge customers for mortgages, car loans and other forms of credit.</p><p>Typically, the Fed, which has the dual mandate of encouraging employment and keeping prices stable, lowers interest rates when the economy is struggling and raises them when prices are rising too fast.</p><p>Cheaper borrowing encourages businesses to invest and consumers to spend more, stimulating economic growth.</p><p>On the other hand, higher borrowing costs act as a brake on economic activity, helping to bring down inflation.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-hassett-and-what-is-his-background\">Who is Hassett and what is his background?</h2><p>Though Hassett is among several names that have been mooted for the top job at the Fed, he stands alone for the amount of time he has spent in Trump’s proximity.</p><p>A career economist, Hassett was appointed as Trump’s top coordinator on economic policy after serving in his first administration as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, an older, more research-oriented body than the National Economic Council.</p><p>After leaving the first Trump administration in 2019, Hassett briefly returned to the White House to serve as an adviser on the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Crucially, Hasset has signalled his support for cutting interest rates faster – something Trump has been angrily demanding from the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, for months to little avail.</p><p>Trump has insisted that concerns that his tariffs could spell a return to high inflation are overblown and suggested that the benchmark rate should be set as low as 1 percent.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News last month, Hassett said he would be “cutting rates right now” if he were in Powell’s shoes.</p><p>Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Hassett would likely push for faster rate cuts in the role, albeit probably not at the pace Trump would prefer.</p><p>“I think it is likely that Hassett would try to lower the Fed’s policy interest rates, but probably not all the way to the 1 percent level that President Trump has demanded,” Gagnon told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He would probably argue that the administration’s deregulation agenda and the AI boom give the economy more room to grow without causing inflation.”</p><p>Before and in between his stints at the Trump White House, Hasset was an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, where he published extensively on tax and trade policy.</p><p>Hassett also served as an economic adviser to the presidential campaigns of John McCain, George W Bush and Mitt Romney.</p><p>Prior to getting involved in the world of politics, the economist did stints at Columbia Business School and the Fed’s research and statistics division.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-hassett-s-potential-nomination-attracting-controversy\">Why is Hassett’s potential nomination attracting controversy?</h2><p>Hassett’s reputation as a Trump loyalist has raised concerns in some quarters about the independence of the Fed.</p><p>The ability of the central bank to make its decisions free from political influence or considerations is widely seen as being crucial to confidence in the US economy.</p><p>But that longstanding expectation is already under scrutiny due to Trump’s repeated verbal attacks on Powell, whose term expires in May, and his <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/26/trump-orders-removal-o-fed-governor-cook-over-mortgage-fraud-claims\">push to remove Lisa Cook</a>, one of the Fed’s six other governors, over unproven claims of mortgage fraud.</p><p>“I think that concerns regarding the Fed’s independence are very real and valid,” Anastassia Fedyk, an assistant professor of finance at the Haas School of Business of the University of California Berkeley, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s not just about Kevin Hassett being closer to President Trump than prior Fed chairs were to their nominating presidents. There is also the contextual background: the firing of Lisa Cook, the attempts to end Jerome Powell’s term early, and Kevin Hassett’s own stated approval for those attempts.”</p><p>Still, Hassett would not have free rein to steer the Fed if nominated and subsequently confirmed by the US Senate.</p><p>The central bank’s policy committee has 12 members – including four nominees of former Democratic President Joe Biden – and makes its decisions by majority vote.</p><p>David Wilcox, an economist with Bloomberg Economics and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that whoever leads the Fed next will face the same difficult task of supporting jobs without stoking higher inflation.</p><p>“On one hand, the jobs market appears to be weakening, albeit only slowly. On the other hand, inflation remains too high – noticeably above the Fed’s 2 percent objective,” Wilcox told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“There’s plenty of room for reasonable people to disagree about how these competing considerations should best be balanced against each other, but no one should pretend that the choice is obvious,” Wilcox added.</p><p>“Any move toward a dramatically easier stance of policy risks pushing inflation higher for longer. We’ve just been through the worst bout of inflation in 40 years, and the American people have spoken loud and clear about how strongly they dislike inflation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Two days later, he said, he found himself in the middle of a conversation that appeared to feature some of the most senior officials in President Donald Trump’s administration.</p><p>Among the participants were Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><h2 id=\"trump-defends-signal-chat\">Trump defends Signal chat</h2><p>In the Signal chat, Hegseth reportedly <a href=\"/news/2025/3/26/the-atlantic-publishes-us-attack-plans-shared-on-signal\">divulged details</a> in advance about a March 15 attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Those details included the precise timing when the F-18 planes would launch, when the drones would arrive, and when both parties would conduct their air strikes.</p><p>Goldberg’s reporting on the chat prompted outrage towards the Trump administration and Waltz and Hegseth in particular.</p><p>Critics decried the risks that the messages posed to US military operations overseas, with some worrying that, if the Signal chat had fallen into the wrong hands, it could have endangered service members’ lives.</p><p>This week’s inspector general report recommends greater training to ensure compliance with operational security standards.</p><p>But it declines to weigh whether the material Hegseth transmitted over Signal was, in fact, classified at the time.</p><p>Instead, the inspector general points out that, as secretary of defence, Hegseth has the right to determine the classification level of military intelligence and could have declassified the information if he decided to do so.</p><p>Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for Hegseth’s office, described that finding as a victory for the embattled defence secretary, who has long denied that <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/pete-hegseth-says-signal-chat-had-no-war-plans-hes-wrong-say-experts\">“war plans” were shared</a> over the messaging app.</p><p>“The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along – no classified information was shared,” Parnell wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/1996367776089571829\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>“This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”</p><p>Parnell also took the media to task for highlighting the risks the information posed to US military members.</p><p>“There is zero evidence that supports this conclusion. None,” Parnell <a href=\"https://x.com/SeanParnellUSA/status/1996358373978304864\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in response to a New York Times post that raised the potential dangers.</p><p>On the contrary, Parnell argued, the “flawless execution &amp; success of Operation Rough Rider” – the name of the Yemen bombing campaign – was evidence that no troops were put in harm’s way.</p><p>President Trump himself has previously called the fallout from the scandal <a href=\"/news/2025/3/27/trump-calls-signal-chat-fallout-a-witch-hunt-amid-calls-for-probe\">a “witch-hunt”</a> and questioned whether Signal itself was not “defective”.</p><p>Administration officials <a href=\"/news/2025/3/31/white-house-dismisses-investigation-calls-says-case-closed-on-signalgate\">have repeatedly called</a> for the scandal, dubbed Signalgate, to be “case closed”.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>United States President Donald Trump has announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on car makers to control pollution from petrol-powered cars and trucks.</p><p>The plan was announced on Wednesday. If finalised next year, it would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon (3.8 litres) of petrol, through the 2031 model year.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of petrol vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles (65.5km) per gallon in the 2031 model year. That frees up car makers to produce larger vehicles like sports utility vehicles, which are more profitable than smaller cars.</p><p>The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse policies from the era of former Democratic President Joe Biden that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles (EVs). Burning petrol for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and in the US, it is the largest contributor.</p><p>Trump announced the plan at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest US automakers, who have praised the planned changes. The auto industry has complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.</p><p>Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases.</p><h2 id=\"split-response\">Split response</h2><p>Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement that the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense”.</p><p>“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.</p><p>Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real-world market conditions”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Environmentalists decried the decision.</p><p>“In one stroke, Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.</p><p>“Gutting the [petrol-mileage] programme will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,’’ said Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All programme.</p><p>“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.</p><p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Major carmakers will save more than $35bn in technology costs through 2031 under a broad rollback of vehicle fuel economy standards, the Trump administration said.</p><p>General Motors would save $8.7bn from 2027 through 2031, while Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis would each save more than $5bn, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said. Hyundai would save $4.6bn, Subaru $3.8bn, and Toyota $2.3bn, it said.</p><p>But at the same time, fuel costs for drivers are expected to soar, and US drivers are expected to pay up to $185bn more through 2050, the NHTSA reported.</p><h2 id=\"false-ev-claims\">False EV claims</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate”, referring incorrectly to  Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8 percent of new vehicle sales in the US in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.</p><p>No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.</p><p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included the use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on petrol. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.</p><p>Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81km) per gallon of petrol for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63km) per gallon today.</p><p>The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2 percent each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2 percent per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.</p><p>The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of petrol from being burned by 2050, according to the NHTSA’s 2024 calculations.</p><p>Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tonnes of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tonnes a year of deadly soot particles and more than 4,870 tonnes a year of smog components – nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons – going into the air in the coming years.</p><p>Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.</p><p>The proposal must undergo public comments over a 45-day period before it can be finalised.</p></div></div></body></html>"

US President Donald Trump has sharply criticised the Fed for not lowering its short-term interest rate more quickly. When the Fed reduces its rate, it can over time lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.</p><p>The prospect of the administration “vetoing” regional bank presidents would represent another effort by the administration to exert more control over the Fed, an institution that has traditionally been independent from day-to-day politics.</p><p>The Federal Reserve seeks to keep prices in check and support hiring by setting a short-term interest rate that influences borrowing costs across the economy.</p><h2 id=\"complicated-structure\">Complicated structure</h2><p>The Fed has a complicated structure that includes a seven-member board of governors based in Washington as well as 12 regional banks that cover specific districts across the US.

Regional Fed banks have repeatedly argued that in selecting new leaders, merit and ability have driven their decision-making.</p><p>The seven governors and the president of the New York Fed vote on every interest-rate decision, while four of the remaining 11 presidents vote on a rotating basis. But all the presidents participate in meetings of the Fed’s interest-rate setting committee.</p><p>Bessent, who is in the process of selecting a candidate to recommend to Trump as the successor for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, said the fact that many of the current regional bank presidents were hired from outside their districts is at odds with the spirit of how the US central bank’s system was designed.</p><p>Bessent argued last month in an interview on CNBC that the reason for the regional Fed banks was to bring the perspective of their districts to the Fed’s interest rate decisions and “break the New York hold” on the setting of interest rates.</p><p>But now, he said last month, “three, maybe four” of the Fed presidents were appointed from outside their districts, with some living in New York.</p><p>“I’m not sure that’s the way the Federal Reserve was designed,” Bessent said in the interview.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Much of the power grid is considered outdated, with a heavy reliance on fossil fuels from sources like Venezuela.</p><p>Most of the infrastructure also dates to the Cold War era. It saw a leap in construction in the 1980s, and by 1989, the grid was expanded to reach 95 percent of all households.</p><p>In recent years, Cuba has invested in renewable energy as an alternative to its current energy production model.</p><p>In April 2024, for instance, the Caribbean nation inked a deal with China to open 92 solar farms by 2028. The first of those solar plants opened in February of this year.</p><p>But natural disasters, particularly hurricanes, have posed continued hurdles to electricity distribution on the island.</p><p>In late September, for instance, Hurricane Imelda churned through the Caribbean Sea, bringing floods and landslides to Cuba, where at least two people died.</p><p>Then, in October, Cuba was struck again, this time by Hurricane Melissa, one of the most intense Atlantic storms on record.</p><p>The hurricane had slowed to a Category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba, but it nevertheless pounded the island with more flash floods, leaving homes destroyed and thousands displaced.</p><p>Cuban officials have also blamed the United States for contributing to the island’s limping infrastructure.</p><p>Since 1962, the US has placed Cuba under a wide-reaching embargo, which critics say has undermined the island’s economy.</p><p>Despite efforts to loosen the sanctions in recent decades, the administration of US President Donald Trump has kept the embargo in place, citing reports of human rights abuses under the Cuban government.</p><p>Nevertheless, in October, a majority vote at the United Nations General Assembly once again passed a non-binding resolution calling on the US to end its embargo, as part of an annual appeal.</p><p>The economic sanctions, the resolution argues, are disproportionately punitive.</p><h2 id=\"president-blames-us-blockade\">President blames US ‘blockade’</h2><p>Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Wednesday cited that rationale, along with the toll of the recent storms, as challenges impeding the proper functioning of the electrical grid.</p><p>“The workers at [the Ministry of Energy and Mines], who never rest amidst the daily challenges imposed by the blockade and the recovery efforts following Hurricane Melissa, are already working to resolve the issue,” Diaz-Canel <a href=\"https://x.com/DiazCanelB/status/1996212184552980747\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “Once again, we have faith in them.”</p><p>Since taking office in 2019, Diaz-Canel has faced significant pressure from the blackouts and the public unrest they cause.</p><p>In 2021, amid the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and shortages of basic supplies like fuel, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest deteriorating conditions on the island. Among their complaints were the regular blackouts the island faces.</p><p>Those protests coincided with a record-setting mass exodus from Cuba. Estimates vary as to the island’s population, but government statistics indicate that, in 2021, the total number of residents was around 11,113,215.</p><p><span>As of 2024, that number has plummeted to 9,748,532. That suggests a steep population drop of more than 12 percent, much of which is attributed to migration off the island.</span></p><p>That decline corresponds to a spike in Cuban arrivals documented by the US Customs and Border Protection agency.</p><p>For fiscal year 2023, the agency reported 200,287 “encounters” with Cuban migrants attempting to enter the United States. For fiscal year 2024, that number rose to 217,615.</p><p>Under Trump, however, the US has this month suspended all immigration applications from Cuba and 18 other countries the Republican president <a href=\"/news/2025/11/28/trump-pauses-immigration-from-third-world-countries-what-that-means\">has described</a> as “third world”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Palestinian group demanded mediators – Egypt, Qatar and the US – restrain the Israeli military.</p><p>According to authorities in Gaza, Israeli forces have violated the ceasefire at least 591 times since it came into effect on October 10, killing at least 360 Palestinians and wounding 922 others.</p><p>Separately on Wednesday, Israel’s military also confirmed receiving the remains of what could be one of the two remaining captives in Gaza from Palestinian armed groups via the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4148612\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4148612\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4148612\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/afp_69307599770e-1764783513.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Islamic Jihad and Hamas militants transport a white body bag believed to carry the remains of an Israeli hostage in the town of Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip on December 3, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4148612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Islamic Jihad and Hamas soldiers transport a body bag in northern Gaza on Wednesday [AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>The handover came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that forensic testing on partial remains returned by Hamas the previous day did not match either of the captives still in Gaza.</p><p>Since the fragile truce started, Hamas has returned all 20 living captives and 26 bodies in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners.</p><h2 id=\"rafah-crossing\">Rafah crossing</h2><p>The exchanges are a key condition of the initial phase of US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. The first phase also calls for Israeli authorities to let in humanitarian aid into the territory and open “the Rafah crossing in both directions”.</p><p>Israel, however, has continued to restrict the entry of aid, while a military unit called Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said on Wednesday that the “Rafah Crossing will open in the coming days exclusively for the exit of residents from the Gaza Strip to Egypt”.</p><p>Those wishing to leave Gaza will require “security approval”, COGAT added.</p><p>Israel’s statement immediately raised fears the move could lead to the permanent displacement of Palestinians, something far-right ministers in Netanyahu’s hardline government <a href=\"/news/2023/12/31/israeli-minister-reiterates-calls-for-palestinians-to-leave-gaza\">have promoted for months.</a></p><p>“It’s hard to see this statement on the Rafah crossing as something that is meant to restore freedom of movement for Palestinians rather than restricting it,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City.</p><p>“It’s directed to give less mobility to Palestinians because it does not guarantee their return after being forced out of Gaza. It’s rather accelerating the process of depopulating the Gaza Strip,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Egypt, meanwhile, said the crossing will open only if movement goes both ways.</p><p>Egypt’s State Information Service, citing an unnamed official, said Cairo has not agreed to any plan to open the crossing for outbound movement only.</p><p>Any agreement with Israel, the official said, would require opening Rafah in both directions in line with the current ceasefire plan. The source denied coordination with Israel over the reopening.</p><p>Hussein Haridy, a former Egyptian assistant foreign minister, said Egypt remains “committed to UN Security Council Resolution 2803, adopted on October 17 last year, which endorsed a ceasefire plan”.</p><p>All crossings should be opened under the resolution, and Egypt is working with the European Union and the Palestinian Authority on operating the posts, including Rafah, when conditions allow, he told Al Jazeera from Cairo.</p><p>“We need to operate the Rafah crossing according to the [US President Donald] Trump peace plan. Ever since 1948, the date Israel was established, we’ve become accustomed to Israeli manoeuvring when it comes to implementing ceasefire agreements,” said Haridy.</p><p>“Having said that, we will take Israel to task if they don’t implement the Security Council resolution.”</p><h2 id=\"full-reopening\">Full reopening</h2><p>The United Nations also called for the full reopening of Rafah.</p><p>“What we want to see is Rafah reopened fully for the movement of humanitarian cargo, for the movements of people, and both for humanitarian workers,” said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p><p>“If residents of Gaza, Palestinians, want to leave, they need to be able to do so voluntarily and freely without any pressure. And for those residents of Gaza who may have left the enclave a while ago, if they wish to return, they should be able to return,” he added.</p><p>President Trump, meanwhile, insisted that the ceasefire was “going along well” and that “we have peace in the Middle East”. He also told reporters in Washington, DC, that the second phase of his plan for Gaza was “going to happen very soon”.</p><p>Once the terms of the first phase are completed, the Trump plan is supposed to advance to the next phases, which call for creating an international stabilisation force, forming a technocratic Palestinian government and disarming Hamas.</p><p>The Palestinian group, however, has opposed the move, saying it will not lay down arms as long as Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory continues.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The World Health Organization, meanwhile, estimates more than 8,000 Palestinian patients have been evacuated out of Gaza since the start of the war in October 2023. But it said there are still more than 16,500 sick and wounded people who need to leave Gaza for medical care.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, told the AFP news agency that the need for more medical evacuations is “really huge”.</p><p class=\"p1\">So far, more than 30 countries have accepted patients, but only a few – including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – have taken in large numbers.</p><p class=\"p1\">Italy has taken in more than 200 patients, compared with France, which had accepted 27 by the end of October, and Germany, which had taken in none.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Countries are taking a long time to decide or allocate the budget for these patients, but [they cannot] wait for this discussion to happen,” said Hani Isleem, MSF’s coordinator for medical evacuations from Gaza.</p><p>Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 70,117 Palestinians and wounded 170,999 since October 2023. A total of 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks, and about 200 were taken captive.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2886953\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/INTERACTIVE-Rafah-border-crossing-closed-1715153393.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE Gaza Rafah border crossing closed Israeli tanks-1715153393\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p></div></div></body></html>"
