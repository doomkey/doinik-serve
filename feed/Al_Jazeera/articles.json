(ISIS) detainees have been transferred from Syrian jails to a prison in neighbouring Iraq so far, according to Iraq’s Ministry of Justice.</p><p>In comments to the Iraqi News Agency on Friday, ministry spokesperson Ahmed Laibi said the transfers and ongoing detention of the prisoners had been carried out at the request of an international coalition led by the United States to combat ISIL, of which Iraq is a key member.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>In separate comments on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein gave a lower figure, telling Reuters that about 3,000 ISIL-linked detainees had been transferred.</p><p>He told the news agency that the process was ongoing and that Baghdad was in discussions with various countries about repatriating their nationals who had been transferred.</p><p>Iraq would need more ⁠financial assistance to ⁠deal with the intake, he said, adding that there had been a recent ⁠uptick in ISIL activity in Syria.</p><p>The US military <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-begins-transferring-isil-linked-detainees-from-syria-to-iraq\">has been transporting</a> thousands of ISIL-linked prisoners from jails and detention centres previously run by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria.</p><p>The transfers have come as control of the prisons has been handed over to the Syrian government, amid a push by Damascus to assert its authority over the full extent of a country still fragmented in the wake of a brutal war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Deadly clashes with SDF forces broke out amid the Syrian army’s advance in recent weeks, including in and around key prison sites, resulting in some ISIL detainees escaping and raising fears the armed group could exploit any security vacuum to regroup.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/syrian-forces-deploy-in-hasakah-under-ceasefire-agreement-with-sdf\">ceasefire</a> has since been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/kurdish-led-sdf-agrees-integration-with-syrian-government-forces\">struck</a> between the government and the SDF.</p><h2 id=\"detainees-mostly-syrian-nationals\">Detainees mostly Syrian nationals</h2><p>Laibi, the Iraqi Justice Ministry spokesperson, said that of the 5,064 ISIL detainees transferred so far, more than 3,000 were Syrian, while at least 270 were Iraqi.</p><p>He said the detainees were being held in a single prison, in a section separated from other prisoners.</p><p>The detainees would all be investigated and prosecuted under Iraqi law, he said, while the responsibility for feeding the thousands of detainees was being handled by the international coalition, rather than Iraq.</p><p>Last month, lawyers for a group of French ISIL suspects who had been transported by the US military from Syria to Iraqi prisons in an earlier series of transfers <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/french-isil-suspects-transferred-from-syria-allege-torture-in-iraqi-prisons\">claimed the inmates</a> had been subjected to “torture and inhumane treatment” there.</p><h2 id=\"damascus-becomes-us-s-main-anti-isil-partner\">Damascus becomes US’s main anti-ISIL partner</h2><p>The US military has previously said up to 7,000 people with alleged ISIL links could be transferred to Iraqi-controlled facilities.</p><p>US Admiral Brad Cooper, the head of US forces in the Middle East, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-begins-transferring-isil-linked-detainees-from-syria-to-iraq\">said last month</a> that facilitating the secure transfer of detainees was critical to preventing mass breakouts that could pose a direct threat to the US and regional security.</p><p>The statement came shortly after the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/us-envoy-says-sdfs-role-in-syria-has-largely-expired-after-isil\">US special envoy to Syria</a> said that Washington’s main partner against ISIL in Syria would be the Syrian government, rather than the SDF, which had held that position for years.</p><p>The shift followed Syria – under new President Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former leader of the armed group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, who was once deemed a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” by the US – joining the anti-ISIL coalition in November.</p><h2 id=\"us-departs-syrian-base\">US departs Syrian base</h2><p>The ongoing transfers of the detainees from Syria have come as the US military reduces its presence in the country, where it has conducted operations against ISIL for years.</p><p>On Thursday, Syrian ⁠forces ⁠announced they had <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/syrian-army-takes-control-of-al-tanf-military-base-as-us-troops-pull-out\">taken control</a> of the al-Tanf military base, a strategic garrison near the border with Iraq and Jordan, following the withdrawal of US forces.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Cooper, the commander of US forces in the Middle East, said the departure was “part of a deliberate and conditions-based transition”, and that US forces remained “poised to respond to any [ISIL] threats that arise in the region as we support partner-led efforts” to prevent the group’s resurgence.</p><p>While ISIL was largely defeated in 2017 in Iraq and in Syria two years later, sleeper cells still carry out attacks in both countries.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The whole of Gaza remains under harsh Israeli occupation.</p><p>While the al-Najjar family has been reunited, “the reality is that this process [of Palestinians returning home via the Rafah crossing] remains limited and tightly controlled,” said Mahmoud.</p><p>“Many families are still waiting, separated not just by distance, but by borders, paperwork, and an uncertain timeline.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Hundreds of thousands across the country have protested for an end to the war and punitive action against Israel.</p><p>The United Kingdom said last June that it would ban Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws. This put the organisation on par with armed groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) in the UK, making it a criminal offence to belong to the group.</p><p>The government’s announcement prompted legal battles, criticism from human rights organisations and triggered <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/6/24/palestine-action-supporters-protest-against-uk-ban\">protests</a>, amid concerns that the move was draconian overreach that criminalised legitimate political dissent.</p><p>Among those arrested for supporting the group were some 2,787 people arrested made for terrorism offences for peacefully holding signs saying “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action” in silent vigils across the UK, a statement by the campaign group Defend Our Juries said.</p><p>It said those arrests would now be unlawful as a result of the ruling.</p><p>A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said that “thousands of people of conscience” had seen that “branding protest as terrorism was a move straight out of the dictator’s playbook”.</p><p>“Together we took action at great personal risk – inspired by each other’s courage. We helped make this proscription unenforceable by saying ‘we do not comply’.”</p><p>The spokesperson added that most people in the UK had been “disgusted by both the government’s complicity in what most experts agree is an ongoing genocide in Gaza by Israel”.</p><h2 id=\"an-absolute-triumph\">An ‘absolute triumph’</h2><p>Speaking at the court, artist Nicola Moxham, who had been arrested herself for support of the group, described the ruling as a “vindication”.</p><p>The court’s decision, she said, was and “absolute triumph for direct action in support of Palestine Action and opposing, most importantly, the genocide of Palestinians and destruction of Gaza”.</p><p>“It’s kind of unbelievable really that the Labour Party is supposedly the party of ordinary people and here they are repressing ordinary people for standing for justice and against genocide,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Her husband, retired professor of medicine John Moxham, said he was “absolutely delighted” by the outcome.</p><p>Moxham said he had marched in support of Palestine Action, and considered the ban on the group “a total travesty”.</p><p>“There ought to be a lot of resignations of government ministers,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The Prime Minister and (Justice Secretary) David Lammy have got a lot of blood on their hands.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4311285\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4311285\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4311285\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Image-2026-02-13-at-10.48.36-1-1770979792.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nicola and John Moxham welcomed the court's announcement that the ban Palestine Action as a ‘terror group’ was unlawful [Brian Ging/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4311285\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nicola and John Moxham welcomed the court’s announcement that the ban Palestine Action as a ‘terror group’ was unlawful [Brian Ging/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>The ruling triggered scenes of jubilation at the court in London, where supporters could be heard chanting: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”<strong>.</strong></p><p>Campaign group CAGE International said in a statement that the ruling represented “a decisive rejection of attempts to shield corporations complicit in arming the genocide in Gaza”.</p><p>“While the infrastructure of terrorism laws remains in place, fundamental freedoms are conditional, dependent on political whim,” said the group’s head of public advocacy, Anas Mustapha. “Today’s decision is the correct legal outcome, though it was secured only through principled sacrifice and collective will.”</p><p>He said the ruling should lead to the withdrawal of charges against “all Palestine Action activists in prison and the thousands who acted on their conscience as part of the largest civil disobedience campaign this country has seen in recent years”.</p><p>Ammori said the group had been banned because its actions targeting the UK subsidiary of Israel’s largest arms manufacturer Elbit Systems had “cost the corporation millions of pounds in profits”.</p><p>“Banning Palestine Action was always about appeasing pro-Israel lobby groups and weapons manufacturers, and nothing to do with terrorism,” she said.</p><p>Elbit Systems describes its drones, which have been used extensively by Israel in Gaza to deadly effect, killing large numbers of Palestinians, as “the backbone” of Israel’s drone fleet.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The 60-year-old leader returned to Bangladesh from self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom weeks before the elections. He had fled the country in 2008 after what he deemed politically motivated persecution.</p><p>Reuters reported, citing the EC, that the BNP won 181 seats, Jamaat-e-Islami won 61 and others won seven seats.</p><p>The electoral body has yet to announce the official <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/12/counting-begins-as-polls-close-in-landmark-bangladesh-election\">results</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"are-there-concerns-about-result-tampering\">Are there concerns about result tampering?</h2><p>Both the NCP and the BNP have alleged irregularities and result tampering, suggesting that some parties are benefiting from “election engineering”, though they have so far provided limited specific evidence.</p><p>Jamaat has also voiced its concern in a statement about the unofficial results, posted on its Facebook page.</p><p>“We are not satisfied with the process surrounding the election results. From candidates of the 11-party alliance narrowly and suspiciously losing in various constituencies, to repeated inconsistencies and fabrications in unofficial result announcements, the Election Commission’s reluctance to publish voter turnout percentages, and indications that a section of the administration leaned towards a major party – all of this undoubtedly raises serious questions about the integrity of the results process,” the statement said.</p><p>Jamaat has urged its supporters to wait for the official results.</p><h2 id=\"who-won-who-lost\">Who won, who lost?</h2><p>The BNP chairman, Rahman, has been declared elected in two constituencies – the Dhaka-17 and Bogura-6, according to Bangladesh’s The Daily Star newspaper, though official results are yet to be announced.</p><p>Jamaat leader Shafiqur Rahman won the Dhaka‑15 constituency, local media reported.</p><p>BNP Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has won the Thakurgaon-1 constituency in northwestern Bangladesh, according to multiple media outlets. His nearest rival, Jamaat-e-Islami candidate Delwar Hossain, trailed behind him.</p><p>“Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami is expected to serve as the opposition party, with an eye on winning the next election. It is reasonable to expect that they will play a responsible and constructive role in parliamentary politics,” Asif Nazrul, a law professor at Dhaka University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Rumeen Farhana, an independent candidate and a former BNP lawmaker, has won the Brahmanbaria-2 constituency in eastern Bangladesh, according to local media.</p><p>The BNP has won 13 of the 20 seats in Dhaka, according to multiple local outlets. Jamaat has won four seats while its ally, the National Citizen Party (NCP), won one.</p><p>Local media is also reporting wins for prominent BNP candidates, including Salahuddin Ahmed, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, Lutfozzaman Babar, Mirza Abbas, Fazlur Rahman, Reza Kibria and Bobby Hajjaj.</p><p>The NCP was formed by students who led the protests against Hasina in 2024. Local media reports that NCP founder <a href=\"/features/2026/2/11/nahid-islam-and-the-uneasy-alliance-that-could-shape-bangladeshs-vote\">Nahid Islam</a> has won the Dhaka-11 seat.</p><p>“Although the NCP did not secure major electoral success, for a party formed only months before the election, its performance was not insignificant given its limited experience in electoral politics,” Nazrul said.</p><p>“While expectations were higher in some quarters, if the NCP positions itself as a constructive and principled political alternative, it may gradually strengthen its position in future elections.”</p><h2 id=\"was-the-bnp-win-expected\">Was the BNP win expected?</h2><p>Experts say the BNP’s win was widely expected.</p><p>Months before the election, the BNP had been drawing huge support in rallies organised to highlight unemployment and rising prices, among other issues. The party helped organise and ride the wave of mass protests that followed the student‑led uprising against Hasina’s government.</p><p>By May 2025, the BNP was also staging rallies against the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, demanding early elections and other concessions.</p><p>“Unlike other participating parties, the BNP has a strong support base across every part of the country, a winning political culture and past experience in governance,” Nazrul said.</p><p>“Its leader, Tarique Rahman, created a positive impact following his return to Bangladesh, which further strengthened the party’s momentum.”</p><h2 id=\"bangladesh-also-held-a-referendum-on-the-july-charter-did-it-win\">Bangladesh also held a referendum on the July Charter. Did it win?</h2><p>Voters in Bangladesh cast their votes on two ballots on Thursday: a white parliamentary voting ballot and a pink ballot for a referendum on the July National Charter.</p><p>According to the latest results released by the EC, 60.26 percent of voters cast their ballot in favour of the July Charter.</p><p>The charter was drafted by the caretaker government led by Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus, following the student protests, and outlines a roadmap for constitutional amendments, legal changes and the enactment of new laws.</p><p>It contains more than 80 proposals to overhaul Bangladesh’s system of governance, with key reforms being “increasing women’s political representation, imposing prime ministerial term limits, enhancing presidential powers, expanding fundamental rights, and protecting judicial independence”, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA).</p><p>The charter recommends creating a 100-member upper chamber alongside Bangladesh’s current single parliamentary body, the 350-member parliament.</p><p>Local newspaper The Daily Star says that, so far, 72.9 percent of votes counted are in favour of adopting the charter, as opposed to 27.1 percent opposed.</p><p>The BNP says it will back the implementation of the charter.</p><p>“Major parties appear to agree on almost all the core referendum issues. However, disagreements remain regarding specific details, particularly in regard to the formation of the proposed Upper House,” Nazrul explained.</p><p>“The BNP favours forming it in proportion to parliamentary seats, while Jamaat and the NCP prefer a system of proportional representation. Resolving this dispute remains a key challenge.”</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>Rezaul Karim Rony, a Dhaka-based political analyst, told Al Jazeera that the BNP win means a “victory of a democratic force”.</p><p id=\"the-challenge-now-is-to-ensure-good-governance-law-and-order-and-public-safety-and-to-establish-a-rights-based-state-which-was-at-the-heart-of-the-aspirations-of-the-2024-mass-uprising-he-told-al-jazeera\">“The challenge now is to ensure good governance, law and order, and public safety, and to establish a rights-based state, which was at the heart of the aspirations of the 2024 mass uprising,” Rony told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Nazrul, the professor from Dhaka University, expressed optimism for the future of Bangladesh without the Awami League.</p><p>“Awami League governed through a one-party parliament following fake elections for nearly 16 years. The present parliament will function without that one party. It’s poetic justice, in my view,” he said.</p><p>“The new parliament includes much more diverse voices and competitive political engagement. As a result, parliamentary functioning is expected to improve. The Awami League should engage in reflection, express remorse and learn from past experiences.”</p><p>Awami League’s Hasina, who remains in India, was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/sheikh-hasina-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity-what-we-know\">convicted</a> of war crimes last November for her brutal crackdown on protesters that killed an estimated 1,400 people and injured more than 20,000. India’s refusal to extradite her despite a request from Bangladesh has strained ties between the neighbours.</p></div></div></body></html>"

There is room to question whether I should have investigated more thoroughly. I regret not doing so,” said Barak.</p><p>But, despite Epstein having been convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008 and spending about a year in prison during the course of their relationship, Barak claimed he was unaware of the scope of Epstein’s crimes until a wider probe into him was opened in 2019.</p><p>“I did not know the manner of his crimes until 2019, and you probably didn’t know it either,” he said, according to Israeli media reports, claiming that in the 15 years he knew Epstein, he “never saw any unreasonable occurrence, or any unreasonable behaviour”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"visits-to-home-island\">Visits to home, island</h2><p>Barak did not deny his contacts with Epstein after his 2008 conviction, which included staying, along with his wife, at the financier’s Manhattan home on multiple occasions between 2015 and 2019, as well as exchanging emails and meeting him in person.</p><p>He also acknowledged visiting Epstein’s notorious island in the US Virgin Islands, Little Saint James, where parties involving sex trafficking victims are said to have taken place.</p><p>He said it was a single visit, for three hours in broad daylight, accompanied by his wife and three guards, and that he saw nothing there except Epstein and some workers.</p><p>Barak sought to deflect his continued business and social contacts with Epstein after his 2008 conviction by saying that during that period, the financier was widely treated as someone who had “paid his debt to society” and been readmitted to public life.</p><p>It was not until the reopening of the investigation into him in 2019, which revealed the scale and severity of his actions, that his influential associates severed their ties with him, he said.</p><p>Epstein killed himself in prison that year while facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.</p><p>The ties between the disgraced <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">Epstein and Israel</a> have come into sharp focus after the release of millions of documents.</p><p>The documents have revealed more details of Epstein’s interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak.

I used to tell [Russian President Vladimir] Putin always, what we need is just one more million,” he says in the audio, released by the US Department of Justice last month.</p><p>Such an immigration wave would mean “many young, beautiful girls would come, tall and slim”, from Russia to Israel, he says in the recording.</p><p>Addressing his comments, Barak said he was “not proud of that choice of words, but I did not say that to Putin”.</p><p>He denied that his remarks were racist, saying they were a conversation about the demographic challenge Israel faced from its growing Arab population.</p><h2 id=\"questions-swirl-over-norwegian-diplomat\">Questions swirl over Norwegian diplomat</h2><p>Barak claimed that while further documents may emerge from the released files detailing his ties to Epstein, none would reveal inappropriate conduct.</p><p>The release of the files, compiled by investigators looking into Epstein’s activities, have further revealed his links to a sprawling, global network of powerful contacts.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Among those involved is <a href=\"/features/2026/2/12/compromised-peace-oslo-accords-figure-deeply-linked-to-epstein-network\">Terje Rod-Larsen</a>, the Norwegian diplomat who was a key architect of the 1993 <a href=\"/news/2023/9/13/what-were-oslo-accords-israel-palestinians\">Oslo Accords</a>, who is facing a storm of corruption and blackmail allegations after files revealed he was deeply embedded in Epstein’s inner circle.</p><p>Norwegian media investigations have exposed a relationship involving illicit loans, visa fraud for sex-trafficked women, and a beneficiary clause for his children in Epstein’s will worth millions of dollars, raising questions about whether Oslo’s foundational agreements of the two-state solution were brokered by a mediator vulnerable to elite blackmail and foreign intelligence pressure.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US did this by <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/how-us-sanctions-crippled-lives-of-iranians-trump-says-he-wants-to-help\">imposing sanctions on Iranian oil</a>, meaning anyone buying or selling it would be subject to punitive measures.</p><p>Given Iran’s dependence on oil for revenue, economic sanctions on its oil can create a severe FX constraint.</p><p>“By using secondary sanctions to threaten any global entity trading in dollars with Iran, the US traps Iran’s existing reserves abroad and prevents new dollars from entering the domestic market,” Farzanegan told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4254143\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4254143\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4254143\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-20T134032Z_852073972_RC215JATQDZO_RTRMADP_3_DAVOS-MEETING-1768916853.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 20, 2026\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4254143\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on January 20, 2026 [Denis Balibouse/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-has-us-treasury-secretary-scott-bessent-said\">What has US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said?</h2><p>Replying to a query about dealing with Iran at a Congressional hearing last week, Treasury Secretary Bessent described the US strategy to send the Iranian currency plunging.</p><p>“What we [have done] at Treasury is created a dollar shortage in the country,” Bessent said, adding that the strategy came to a “grand culmination in December, when one of the largest banks in Iran went under … the Iranian currency went into freefall, inflation exploded, and hence, we have seen the Iranian people out on the street.</p><p>“We have seen the Iranian leadership wiring money out of the country like crazy,” Bessent added. “So the rats are leaving the ship, and that is a good sign that they know the end may be near.”</p><p>Before this, speaking with Fox News at the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, Bessent explained the role US sanctions played in driving the recent nationwide protests.</p><p>“President Trump ordered Treasury … to put maximum pressure on Iran, and it’s worked,” he said. “Because in December, their economy collapsed. They are not able to get imports, and this is why the people took to the streets.”</p><p>In both instances, Bessent referred to his earlier remarks at the Economic Club of New York, in March last year, when he outlined how the White House would leverage President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign to collapse Iran’s economy.</p><p>In his address there, Bessent said the US “elevated a sanctions campaign against [Iran’s] export infrastructure, targeting all stages of Iran’s oil supply chain”, coupled with “vigorous government engagement and private sector outreach” to “close off Iran’s access to the international financial system”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305316\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305316\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305316\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-02T173415Z_39798660_RC2O5JAKKLO8_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-CRISIS-1770810872.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"iran\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305316\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Iranian scholars stand in the Islamic seminary that was burned during Iran’s protests, in Tehran, Iran, January 21, 2026 [Majid Asgaripour/West Asia News Agency (WANA) via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-effect-did-the-dollar-shortage-have-in-iran\">What effect did the dollar shortage have in Iran?</h2><p>In January, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/irans-currency-drops-to-record-low-against-dollar-as-tensions\">Iranian rial</a> was trading at 1.5 million to the dollar – a sharp decline from about 700,000 a year earlier in January 2025 and about 900,000 in mid-2025. The plummeting currency triggered steep inflation, with food prices an average of 72 percent higher than last year.</p><p>In 2018, during his first presidency, Trump withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a deal between Iran and global powers limiting Tehran’s nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.</p><p>Since re-election last January, President Trump has doubled down on his so-called “maximum pressure” to cripple Iran’s economy and corner Tehran to renegotiate its nuclear and regional policies. Last month, Trump threatened a 25 percent tariff on countries doing business with Iran.</p><p>Through the rigorous blocking of Iran from the global financial system by creating a dollar shortage, the US pushed Tehran towards a severe “import compression, [and as a result, Iran] cannot pay for the intermediate goods and machinery required for domestic production”, said Farzanegan, the economist.</p><p>The US strategy, he said, “is particularly devastating because it leverages commercial risk management against humanitarian needs”. In short, Washington’s strategy “makes the small Iranian market a commercial liability” for any company, even if they are only dealing with medicine, for instance, Farzanegan added.</p><p>A research paper published by Farzanegan and Iranian American economist Nader Habibi last year found that the size of Iran’s middle class would have expanded by an annual average of approximately 17 percentage points, between 2012 and 2019, if it were not for US action.</p><p>In 2019, the estimated size of loss in the middle-class share of the population in Iran was 28 percentage points, the research found.</p><p>“People lost their purchasing power, and savings were wiped out,” the economist told Al Jazeera. “This is a long-term destruction of the country’s human capital.”</p><p>Besides the US action is the existing vulnerability of Iran’s economic structure, with factors like long-term mismanagement, high rates of corruption and over-reliance on oil revenues making it fragile.</p><p>While the US sanctions created external shock, a lack of domestic structural reforms left the government with “no fiscal space to cushion the blow”.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-us-s-endgame-here-and-will-it-succeed\">What is the US’s endgame here – and will it succeed?</h2><p>Bessent’s admission that Washington deliberately created a “dollar shortage” signals the US’s shift towards a <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/12/sanctions-are-not-a-humane-alternative-to-war\">total economic warfare</a> narrative.</p><p>“This is economic statecraft; no shots fired,” Bessent said at the WEF in Davos last month.</p><p>“This admission may complicate the US’s diplomatic standing, as it confirms that the humanitarian channels for food and medicine are often rendered useless if the entire banking system is being targeted for collapse,” Farzanegan said.</p><p>Bruce Fein, a former US associate deputy attorney general who specialises in constitutional and international law, told Al Jazeera that this type of economic coercion is “as common as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west”, pointing to economic sanctions against Russia, Cuba, North Korea, China and Myanmar.</p><p>However, unlike in other cases where the US has applied economic pressure, Farzanegan said Iran’s case is “a unique experiment due to the duration and intensity of the pressure”.</p><p>Unlike Russia, which has a more diversified export base and larger reserves, Iran has been facing varied forms of sanctions for decades since the supreme leader took power in 1979.</p><p>“Iran has a sophisticated internal mechanism for sanctions circumvention that makes the ‘dollar shortage’ a game of cat-and-mouse rather than a one-time shock,” the economist said.</p><p>With a US armada currently stationed in the Arabian Sea, the US and Iran are in talks to defuse tensions. The US wants <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-us-tensions-soar-what-do-both-sides-want\">three key things from Iran</a>: To stop enriching uranium as part of its nuclear programme, to get rid of its ballistic missiles and to stop arming non-state actors in the region.</p><p>Ultimately, observers say, the US wants regime change in Iran.</p><p>But Fein said his experience shows that economic sanctions alone “seldom, if ever, topple regimes … Regime change comes externally only with the use of military force.</p><p>“Iran’s dollar shortage will not oust the mullahs or Revolutionary Guard,” he said, referring to Iran’s current administrative structure.</p><p>The impoverishment of Iranians will diminish, Fein told Al Jazeera, “rather than promote the likelihood of a successful revolution because day-to-day survival will be the priority”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p><strong>Nablus, the occupied West Bank –</strong> For decades, the Zenabia Elementary School has been offering an intimate learning environment to aspiring young students from across the educational spectrum in the northern West Bank city of Nablus.</p><p>But now, due to Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/israels-war-on-gaza-curbs-drive-palestinian-economy-to-record-collapse\">years-long withholding of tax revenues</a> owed to the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian school system is effectively broke. Like administrators at all government-run schools in the West Bank, the Zenabia school principal, Aisha al-Khatib, is struggling to keep her small, public school in session.</p><p>For most of the week, the Zenabia school is shuttered, and children roam the streets or stay at home. School supplies are woefully missing, with even regular schoolbooks now reduced to “bundles of pages”.</p><p>“We do everything we can, but we do not have the time or the materials or the consistency to properly teach our children and keep them off the streets,” says al-Khatib. “And this is everywhere in the West Bank.”</p><p>Targeting the education of Palestine’s children, she says, “means destroying the nation”.</p><p>Under the direction of far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Israel has systematically been withholding billions of dollars in tax revenues over the past two years that Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The measure is partly intended to punish the PA for its longstanding policy of paying families of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel for resisting the occupation – even after the PA announced early last year that it was reforming such policies.</p><p>Public services have faced severe cuts, affecting the salaries of bureaucrats, sanitary workers, and the police.</p><p>But possibly nowhere has that budgetary crisis been felt more than in the education sector.</p><p>At Zenabia and elsewhere in the West Bank, public schools are currently only open for a maximum of three days a week. Teachers face long stretches of not being paid, and when they are, they only receive about 60 percent of what they were earning before, resulting in strikes.</p><p>And the effects of these cuts in education are showing up on the days when school is in session. Class time is so diminished at Zenabia that teachers focus almost solely on teaching mathematics, Arabic, and English, with subjects like the sciences being essentially cut altogether.</p><p>The result, educators warn, could be lasting educational gaps for a generation of Palestinian students.</p><p>“As principal of the school, I know that [the students] are not [at] the same [educational] level as before,” al-Khatib says.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-are-always-absent-from-school\">‘We are always absent from school’</h2><p>Spending most of his days out of school, star student Zaid Hasseneh, 10, tries to keep improving his English by looking up words on Google Translate. Zaid dreams of going to university someday in the United States, with hopes of becoming a doctor.</p><p>“I want my son to grow up to be cultured – not just memorise the material he learns at school,” says his mother, Eman. “No, I want his cultural knowledge to develop and become diverse and advanced.”</p><p>Eman helps Zaid when she can with his studies, but she is busy keeping the family afloat financially after her husband lost his work in Israel. Before Israel’s war on Gaza began in 2023, Eman’s husband worked in Tel Aviv as a mechanic. After Israel revoked his work permit, along with those of some 150,000 other West Bank Palestinians, he has been unable to find work. Eman now works in a halawa factory as the sole breadwinner.</p><p>“I go home tired from work, but I have to keep up with [Zaid] regularly,” says Eman. “I tell him, ‘The most important thing is studying. Studying is essential for life.’”</p><p>But Eman realises how limited she is in helping her son with his studies. “The teacher knows one thing, but I don’t know how to explain it,” says Eman. “And now, the books [they receive in school] aren’t complete books anymore. They’re bundles. Regular books are 130 pages, but these are 40 or 50 pages.”</p><p>To compound the dearth in school resources, students and their families describe erratic schedules that make cumulative learning a near impossibility. “The whole family’s routine is affected,” says Eman.</p><p>Even Zaid is now often spending his days out in the streets rather than studying in the classroom – or otherwise on his phone, playing mobile games.</p><p>That is the case for most students these days.</p><p>Muhammad and Ahmed al-Hajj joined Zenabia four years ago as six-year-olds when they faced extreme bullying in another school. They came to love the new school and the intimate setting it offers. But the twins now mostly spend their time on their phones. With their parents also struggling to earn enough money to get by, they’re left at home alone during their days off from school.</p><p>“It’s not good at all. We are always absent from school,” says one of the twins. “It’s not like a full schedule, and we try to study as much as we can, but still, we don’t feel good about it.”</p><p>Some families have switched their children over to private schools, but few can afford to do so. “My [monthly] salary is 2,000 shekels [$650],” explains Eman Hassaneh. “About 1,000 goes towards the home rent. Another 500 goes towards bills. And only very little is left for food. I cannot also take care of his education.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4310487\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4310487\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4310487\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Eman-Hassaneh-and-her-son-Zaid-2-1770951543.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Eman Hassaneh and her 10-year-old son, Zaid [Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4310487\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Eman Hassaneh and her 10-year-old son, Zaid [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"teachers-quitting-and-mounting-dropouts\">Teachers quitting, and mounting dropouts</h2><p>Collectively, the PA’s multi-year budget cuts of billions of dollars are shrinking both the attendance of students and the number of teachers, too.</p><p>“Many of the teachers left working in the schools to work in factories because they do not get enough salary,” says al-Khatib. “And they don’t feel that they are giving what they need to give the students.”</p><p>Tamara Shtayeh, a teacher at Zenabia, nowadays only teaches maths, English, and Arabic due to the reduced funding. “As a teacher, the three-day solution is a bad solution because it doesn’t cover the minimum education that is needed,” she said. “Not for the students, and not for the teachers as well.”</p><p>Due to her reduced salary, Shtayeh, a mother of three girls, is selling products online on the side to support her family. Even the school’s principal, al-Khatib, says she can now only afford to send one of her two college-age daughters to university, with the other daughter staying at home.</p><p>School hours are reduced even further as Israeli soldiers regularly raid the surrounding areas, closing the school every time they do so. With the crisis stretching on for years now, Shtayeh is sensing a generational gap widening between the previous generation that received five days of school, and this one going to school for about half of that.</p><p>Shtayeh and al-Khatib worry about the lack of routine in the children’s lives. For every student like Zaid, who is devoted to educating himself despite the circumstances, many more students are dropping out of the system altogether.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4310490\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4310490\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4310490\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Abu-Zaid-Al-Hajj-with-his-sons-Muhammad-and-Ahmed-2-1770951593.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Abu Zaid al-Hajj with his twin sons, Muhammad and Ahmed, age 10 [Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4310490\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abu Zaid al-Hajj with his twin sons, Muhammad and Ahmed, age 10 [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Not far from Zenabia, Talal Adabiq, 15, now spends his days selling sweets and drinks for eight hours a day on the streets of Nablus.</p><p>“I don’t really like school,” says Talal. “I prefer working.”</p><p>Talal told his parents about a year ago that he wanted to drop out of school. Though they wanted him to continue his studies, he told them he did not find much use for school anymore – and he used the irregular school schedule to prove his point.</p><p>Offering to help support his struggling family financially, Talal subsequently dropped out of al-Kindi School. He now makes “about 40 to 50 shekels a day” ($13-16) hawking street goods.</p><p>As he sells lollipops and other sweets on a Tuesday afternoon, several teenage boys looked on nearby. They say they’re still in school, but on this budget-mandated day off, some of the boys joke about how “fun” it would be to not go to school at all.</p><p>Talal, meanwhile, shrugs off questions about what dropping out of school portends for his future. “God willing, things will be better,” says Talal. “I don’t know how.”</p><p>In the estimations of educators and representatives from the Palestinian Authority, about 5 to 10 percent of students have dropped out of school in the West Bank in the past two years.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4309405\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4309405\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4309405\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dropout-Talal-Adabiq-1-1770920901.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Talal Adabiq\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4309405\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Talal Adabiq, 15, has dropped out of school completely and now sells items on the street [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"our-children-deserve-a-chance-at-life\"><strong><br>\n</strong>‘Our children deserve a chance at life’</h2><p>While massive budget cuts roil the education sector, the Palestinian Authority is struggling to come up with solutions as its budgetary woes deepen – and schoolchildren otherwise face threats, violence and demolitions at the hands of Israeli soldiers, settlers and the Israeli Civil Administration.</p><p>Even before the war on Gaza began, the school sector was facing a variety of crises, with teacher strikes commonplace, as well as Israeli attacks on school infrastructure and children on their way to class, with <a href=\"/news/2023/5/11/israels-demolition-surge-schools-become-a-primary-target\">at least 36 demolitions of 20 schools</a> between 2010 and 2023.</p><p>But systemic <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/israel-orders-eviction-of-bedouins-as-settlers-target-west-bank-schools\">attacks on education</a> are now intensifying. According to Ghassan Daghlas, the governor of Nablus, in his district alone, three schools have been attacked in the last two months by settlers. In nearby Jalud last month, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTR6mGaiHHU/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">settlers set a school on fire</a>. The rise in violence is leaving students at once traumatised and fearful of going to school, says Daghlas.</p><p>“In the past three months, most of the invasions that target homes in the Nablus district are targeting schoolchildren. They will take the kid along with one of the parents. They subject them to interrogation for a few hours,” says the governor. “What kind of psychological state will the students have after these interrogations?”</p><p>According to PA estimates, more than 84,000 students in the West Bank have had their education disrupted by incidents including settler attacks, military raids and demolitions of schools. More than 80 schools serving approximately 13,000 students are under threat of full or partial demolition by Israeli authorities in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. Between July and September 2025 alone, more than 90 such education-related incidents were documented in the West Bank.</p><p>In Area C – the 60 percent of the West Bank under full Israeli military control – students from isolated villages sometimes have to walk several kilometres to reach their schools, in which they regularly face harassment or attacks from settlers as well as soldiers on the way, with a rising trend in <a href=\"/features/longform/2025/9/8/israels-settler-outposts-choke-palestinian-life-in-west-banks-villages\">settler outposts</a> deliberately placed <a href=\"/features/2024/12/3/rooted-in-this-land-until-death-a-palestinian-familys-olive-harvest\">near schools</a>.</p><p>“These are not individual acts by some violent settlers,” says Mahmoud al-Aloul, the vice chairman of the central committee of Fatah, the Palestinian Authority’s ruling political party. “Rather, it’s a general policy that is supported by the occupation.”</p><p>In 2025, Nablus governorate alone had 19 students killed by Israeli army gunfire, according to Daghlas. A total of 240 were injured.</p><p>Education officials say the longer the crisis persists, the greater the long-term impact will be as teacher attrition, interrupted learning and rising dropout rates compound over time.</p><p>“The continuation of the crisis means risking long-term institutional erosion, in which temporary solutions become permanent, and the regime becomes less able to restore its previous level of quality, efficiency and justice,” says Refaat Sabbah, the president of the Global Campaign for Education. “Saving education today is not a sectoral option, but a strategic necessity to protect society and its future.”</p><p>For Eman Hassaneh, that means safeguarding her son Zaid’s future hopes and dreams. “We hope all of these barriers to education won’t actually affect our children and their passion for learning,” she says.</p><p>“Our children deserve a chance at life.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Are you a military officer or have dealings with the military? Do you work in intelligence, diplomacy, economics, science, or advanced technology fields, or deal with people working in these fields?”</p><p>Beijing did not immediately comment on the CIA’s video, but its Ministry of Foreign Affairs has described previous US intelligence recruitment drives as malicious “smears and attacks” against China that deceive and lure Chinese personnel to “surrender”.</p><p>The CIA’s network in China was famously dismantled by Beijing between 2010 and 2012, leading to the death or imprisonment of at least 30 people, according to a 2018 investigation by Foreign Policy magazine.</p><p>The collapse of the US spying network was linked in part to a botched communication system.</p></div></div></body></html>"

finalised a trade deal to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/us-trade-with-southeast-asia-and-taiwan-surging-despite-trump-tariffs\">reduce tariffs on Taiwanese exports</a> and facilitate billions of dollars of spending on US goods.</p><p>The agreement announced on Thursday lowers the general tariff on Taiwanese goods from 20 percent to 15 percent, the same level as Asian trade partners South Korea and Japan, in exchange for Taipei agreeing to buy about $85bn of US energy, aircraft and equipment.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span

href=\"/economy/2026/1/13/taiwan-says-general-consensus-reached-with-us-on-trade-deal\">Under the deal</a>, Taiwan will eliminate or reduce 99 percent of tariff barriers and provide preferential market access to numerous US goods, including auto parts, chemicals, machinery, health products, dairy products and pork, the office of the US trade envoy said in a statement.</p><p>The US will, in turn, exempt a large range of Taiwanese goods from tariffs, including chalk, castor oil, pineapples and ginseng.</p><p>Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te said Taipei had secured tariff exemptions for some 2,000 Taiwanese products, hailing the agreement as a “pivotal” moment for the self-governing island’s economy.</p><p>Lai said the deal, when various carve-outs are included, would take the average tariff rate on Taiwanese goods to 12.3 percent.</p><p>“From familiar items such as Phalaenopsis orchids, tea, bubble tea ingredients (tapioca starch), and coffee, to pineapple cakes, taro, pineapples, and mangoes – these products that represent Taiwan will become more price-competitive in the US market,” Lai said in a statement on social media.</p><p>“We aim not only to sell Taiwan’s great flavors overseas, but also to ensure Taiwanese brands truly enter international markets,” he said.</p><p>Lai made no mention of Taiwan’s chip industry, a crucial driver of the island’s economy that is estimated to account for up to 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>Taiwan’s exports rose by 35 percent in 2025 on the back of furious demand for its AI chips, hitting a record $640.75bn.</p><p>Thursday’s agreement notably does not include specific commitments from Taiwan to invest in the US chip industry, despite an announcement by US President Donald Trump’s administration last month that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/taiwan-and-us-seal-deal-to-lower-tariffs-boost-chip-investment\">Taiwanese firms would pour $250bn</a> into the sector.</p><p>A fact sheet released by the Office of the US Trade Representative said the two sides “take note” of the January deal, which included a prior commitment by chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/20/how-will-trumps-semiconductor-tariffs-affect-the-global-chip-industry\">invest $100bn in the US.</a></p><p>US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Thursday’s agreement built on the longstanding trade relations between Taiwan and the US and would “significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors”.</p><p>“President Trump’s leadership in the Asia Pacific region continues to generate prosperous trade ties for the United States with important partners across Asia, while further advancing the economic and national security interests of the American people,” Greer said.</p><p>Nearly one-third of Taiwan’s exports went to the US in 2025, making the country the island’s biggest market for the first time since 2000.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The drone attack also damaged energy infrastructure, the emergency service added in a post on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s General Staff said that, according to preliminary reports, Ukrainian forces hit an oil refinery in Ukhta in Russia’s Komi Republic, about 1,750km (1,087 miles) from the border with Ukraine, causing a fire to break out.</li>\n<li>A Russian attack last month on the Ukrainian branch of ⁠the Soviet-built Druzhba oil pipeline halted the transit of Russian oil to eastern Europe, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said. Despite its war with ⁠Russia, Ukraine continues to transport Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary even though it stopped the transit of Russian gas last year.</li>\n<li>Ukraine said the bodies of two Nigerians fighting for Russia have been found in the east of the country. Hamzat Kazeem Kolawole and Mbah Stephen Udoka both served in the 423rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, according to a statement by Ukrainian intelligence.</li>\n</ul><h3>Military aid</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukraine’s allies have pledged about $35bn in military aid to Kyiv this year, British Defence Minister John Healey said. The figure includes new commitments by individual countries, but also previous promises of weapons made by Ukraine’s allies, including the 11.5 billion euros ($13.6bn) already announced by Germany, a diplomat told the Reuters news agency.</li>\n<li>German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said his country was ready to deliver five new PAC-3 interceptors for Ukraine’s air defence, provided Ukraine’s other allies deliver at least 30 more of their own.</li>\n<li>Norway announced it was buying a “large volume” of French glide bombs as part of a bilateral agreement to support Ukraine militarily against Russia’s invasion.</li>\n<li>The United Kingdom announced it will “urgently provide” air defence missiles and systems worth more than 500 million British pounds ($681m) “to protect Ukraine from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s brutal attacks on energy sites and homes”.</li>\n<li>US military aid to Ukraine fell by 99 percent in 2025 compared with 2024, according to a report from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a think tank based in Germany. “European military aid rose by 67 percent above the 2022–2024 average” in 2025, the Kiel report found.</li>\n</ul><h3>Peace talks</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that another round of talks on ending the war in Ukraine was expected “soon” but gave no further details.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Sybiha said that Russia’s more recent overnight attacks on Ukraine further undermined efforts to end the war through dialogue. “Each such strike is a blow to peace efforts aimed at ending the war. Russia must be forced to take diplomacy seriously and de-escalate,” Sybiha wrote on X.</li>\n</ul><h3>Regional security</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Estonia is to buy 12 more Caesar self-propelled howitzer artillery pieces from France to strengthen its defence capabilities.</li>\n<li>European Union leaders broadly agreed Thursday on a plan to restructure the 27-nation bloc’s economy to make it more competitive as they face antagonism from US President Donald Trump, strong-arm tactics from China and hybrid threats blamed on Russia.</li>\n<li>Ukraine will begin exporting weapons, including drones, in the coming weeks, Ukrainian Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said in a news conference, according to Ukraine’s Ukrinform news agency.</li>\n</ul><h3>Energy</h3><ul>\n<li>Power plants in Ukraine that have been damaged by Russian missile and drone attacks continue to produce far too little electricity to supply the country’s citizens, Ukraine’s Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal told a parliamentary energy committee.</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>French President Emmanuel Macron said there was no rush to open dialogue with Russian leader Putin, stressing the need for Europeans to fine-tune their objectives. Macron raised the prospect of reviving dialogue with Putin in an interview published on Tuesday by several newspapers.</li>\n<li>Six more Russian and Ukrainian children are being reunited with ⁠their families, Washington and Moscow said. One child would return to Russia, and five children would be reunited with their families in ‌Ukraine, Russia’s presidential commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, said in a post on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Ukraine has accused Russia of abducting thousands of children, and the International Criminal Court has called for the arrest of President <a href=\"/news/2023/3/17/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-russias-putin-over-ukraine-crimes\">Putin and Lvova-Belova</a> on suspicion of unlawful deportation of children.</li>\n<li>⁠US Secretary of State Marco Rubio ⁠said he would have a chance to ‌meet Zelenskyy at this week’s Munich Security Conference.</li>\n</ul><h3>Sport</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukrainian athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych has lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after he was barred from competing in the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics. The skeleton racer was banned over a dispute concerning a helmet he wanted to wear in the event to honour Ukrainian athletes killed in the war with Russia.</li>\n<li>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in a statement: “[The decision] was taken by the jury of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) based on the fact that the helmet he intended to wear was not compliant with the rules.”</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy reacted to the decision, accusing the IOC of playing “into the hands of aggressors” as Ukraine’s Sport Minister Matviy Bidnyi said Ukraine would go through legal channels to reverse the decision.</li>\n<li>“We are proud of Vladyslav and of what he did. Having courage is worth more than any medal,” Zelenskyy said.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

The section also highlights Trump’s recent push to end conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan.</p><p>But the document also alludes to a wider vision for US-Africa ties, shifting from a “foreign aid paradigm to an investment and growth paradigm”.</p><p>That approach would be fuelled by new bilateral relationships with countries “committed to opening their markets to US goods and services”. In turn, the US envisions boosting development efforts on the continent, particularly when it comes to accessing strategic energy and rare earth mineral resources.</p><p>However, that paradigm shift — away from foreign aid — has had a disproportionate effect on Africa and is likely to be a topic of conversation at Friday’s summit.</p><p>An estimated 26 percent of the continent’s foreign aid came from the US. As of 2024, the country’s direct foreign investment in Africa was estimated at <a href=\"https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?ReqID=2&amp;step=1&amp;_gl=1*1awx5r9*_ga*NTM4MTU5NTkzLjE3NzA5MzAxMjM.*_ga_J4698JNNFT*czE3NzA5MzAxMjMkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzA5MzAxMzEkajUyJGwwJGgw#eyJhcHBpZCI6Miwic3RlcHMiOlsxLDIsMyw0LDUsNywxMF0sImRhdGEiOltbIlN0ZXAxUHJvbXB0MSIsIjEiXSxbIlN0ZXAxUHJvbXB0MiIsIjEiXSxbIlN0ZXAyUHJvbXB0MyIsIjEiXSxbIlN0ZXAzUHJvbXB0NCIsIjMwIl0sWyJTdGVwNFByb21wdDUiLCIxIl0sWyJTdGVwNVByb21wdDYiLCIxIl0sWyJTdGVwN1Byb21wdDgiLFsiNzEiXV0sWyJTdGVwOFByb21wdDlBIixbIjEiXV0sWyJTdGVwOFByb21wdDEwQSIsWyIxIl1dXX0=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$47.47bn</a>, much of it coming through the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p><p>But Trump has since dismantled USAID, as well as cancelled billions of dollars in aid programmes.

Experts say the repercussions have already been felt on the ground in Africa.</p><p>“We have experienced the end of USAID, and that has had huge, detrimental negative impacts — at least in the short run — on global health, particularly on health funding for African countries,” Belinda Archibong, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Center for Global Development has assessed that the current US foreign aid cuts could lead to 500,000 to 1,000,000 deaths annually.</p><p>In a December report, the organisation said the evidence of Trump’s aid cuts could be seen through increases in malnutrition mortality in northern Nigeria and Somalia, food insecurity in northeast Kenya and malaria deaths in northern Cameroon, among others.</p><p>Archibong also pointed to disruptions in HIV treatment and prevention across the continent, an area of concern for African Union members.</p><p>Trump’s funding freeze, for example, has caused service interruptions for programmes financed by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a US initiative credited with saving 25 million lives, primarily in Africa.</p><p>“So what does the health funding and health security globally look like in the aftermath of the US pulling back?” Archibong said. “That is going to be a very, very key point of discussion at the summit.”</p><p>With USAID scuttled, the Trump administration has pursued at least 16 preliminary <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/us-and-ivory-coast-sign-480m-deal-as-part-of-america-first-aid-strategy\">bilateral agreements</a> on public health aid, including with Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Kenya. It has dubbed its new aid model the “America First global health strategy”.</p><p>Critics, though, have raised concerns about such deals being tainted by “transactional pressures”, creating the potential for corruption and questions about their long-term sustainability.</p><h2 id=\"strategic-ambiguity\">‘Strategic ambiguity?’</h2><p id=\"professor-everisto-benyera\">For Everisto Benyera, a politics professor at the University of South Africa in Pretoria, Trump is likely to be the “proverbial elephant in the room” during the African Union’s two-day summit.</p><p>“This summit will be aware of his presence in his absence,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Trump’s tariff policies have also had a wide impact on the continent. In April, 20 countries were hit with custom tariffs ranging from 11 percent to 50 percent, and another 29 countries faced a baseline tariff of 10 percent.</p><p>Experts say the nature of the tariffs adds to the air of uncertainty before this year’s summit.</p><p>The heightened, individualised tariffs disproportionately affect countries with specialised export industries that rely, in part, on protectionist trade policies to keep their economies afloat.</p><p>For instance, the kingdom of Lesotho, a nation of about 2 million, landlocked by South Africa, initially faced a staggering 50 percent tariff rate, risking <a href=\"/news/2025/4/3/trump-imposes-50-tariff-on-africas-lesotho-the-highest-among-nations\">ravages</a> to its garment industry. Meanwhile, Madagascar, known for its vanilla exports, was slammed with an initial 47 percent tariff rate.</p><p>The rates for both Lesotho and Madagascar were later dropped to 15 percent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Some reprieve has been offered by Trump’s decision this month to temporarily extend the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a trade agreement dating back to 2000.</p><p>It allows eligible countries to export 1,800 products — including fossil fuels, car parts, textiles and agricultural products — to the US duty-free. However, the extension only stretches through the end of 2026.</p><p>Adding to the tensions is Trump’s decision to stop processing immigration visas for 75 countries, including 26 in Africa. That accounts for nearly half of the African Union’s members.</p><p>Three African countries have launched reciprocal policies, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/why-are-some-african-countries-banning-us-citizens-from-entry\">banning</a> travel for US citizens.</p><p>Still, Benyera predicted most leaders at this week’s summit would strive to maintain “strategic ambiguity”, with an eye towards arranging future agreements.</p><p>“The African Union will, therefore, not want to make policy pronunciations that contradict Trump,” he said.</p><p>“They will aim to strike a strategic balance between appeasing Trump, reassuring [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, and maintaining relations with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping.”</p><h2 id=\"normative-actor\">‘Normative actor’</h2><p>Lopes, meanwhile, predicted that the summit will include “subtle but pointed language emphasising international law, multilateralism and consistency”.</p><p>He pointed out that several African states have taken “vocal stances” on “global flashpoints”, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza — which the US supports — and the recent US military action in Venezuela.</p><p>The governments of South Africa, Namibia and Ghana, for instance, have led condemnation of the US’s abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as a blatant violation of international law.</p><p>South Africa, meanwhile, has <a href=\"/news/2025/9/20/brazil-joins-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-at-icj\">spearheaded</a> a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).</p><p>“I do expect that theme of international justice to continue, not necessarily as open confrontation but as a reminder that Africa increasingly sees itself as a normative actor on the global stage,” Lopes said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He explained that recent dealings between the US, South Africa and Nigeria have been “illustrative” of the tightrope walk many African Union members face in the Trump era.</p><p>In South Africa, Trump has pushed claims that white Afrikaner farmers have been persecuted in a “white genocide”, a position rejected by the government of Cyril Ramaphosa and several top Afrikaner officials.</p><p>But even after an extraordinary — and falsehood-laden — <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trumps-ramaphosa-ambush-key-takeaways-from-heated-white-house-meeting\">confrontation</a> at the Oval Office, Ramaphosa’s government has sought to forge new deals with the Trump administration, while also strengthening ties with its top trading partner, China.</p><p>Trump has also pushed dubious claims about Christian persecution in Nigeria. In December, the US struck an alleged ISIL (ISIS)-linked group in the country’s restive northeast, promising more bombings if armed actors “continue to kill Christians”.</p><p>Nigeria’s government has responded to the US attack carefully, characterising it as a “joint operation”, while rejecting the notion that religion was the root of the violence.</p><p>It has also used Trump’s interest in the region to boost security cooperation and intelligence sharing with the US, in an effort to counter the persistent insecurity in the country’s north.</p><p>“Both have experienced a more antagonistic tone from Washington. Yet, both have also leveraged that friction to diversify partnerships and assert strategic autonomy,” Lopes said.</p><p>“That reflects the broader balancing act under way across the continent.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

LOCK THEM UP?” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115582451169685243\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in one post.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115582703277798715\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another</a>, he suggested a harsher punishment: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”</p><p>Shortly thereafter, the Defense Department announced it had <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/pentagon-says-it-is-investigating-us-senator-over-illegal-orders-video\">launched an investigation</a> into the video and Kelly specifically, given his role as a retired Navy captain.</p><p>Hegseth accused Kelly of using “his rank and service affiliation” to discredit the US armed forces, and he <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/2008189258528665898\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">echoed</a> Trump’s claims that the video was “reckless and seditious”.</p><p>His decision to pen a formal letter of censure against Kelly prompted the senator to sue.</p><p>Such a letter serves as a procedural step towards lowering Kelly’s military rank at the time of his retirement, as well as curbing his post-military benefits.</p><p>But Kelly argued that such punishment would serve to dampen the rights of veterans to participate in political discourse – and would additionally hinder his work as a member of Congress.</p><h2 id=\"an-exclamation-filled-ruling\">An exclamation-filled ruling</h2><p>In Thursday’s <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365.37.0_2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruling</a>, Judge Leon determined that Kelly was likely to prevail on the merits of his case – and, citing the folk singer Bob Dylan, he added that it was easy to see why.</p><p>“This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,” Leon said in his often quippy ruling.</p><p>“After all, as Bob Dylan famously said, ‘You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.'”</p><p>Leon acknowledged that granting an injunction against the government is an “extraordinary remedy”. But he argued it was necessary, given the gravity of the case.</p><p>The judge conceded that the Defense Department does have the ability to restrict the speech of active-service military members, given the need for discipline among troops.</p><p>But the Trump administration argued in its court filings that those restrictions extended to retired military veterans as well.</p><p>Leon, however, dismissed that assertion with the verbal equivalent of a snort: “Horsefeathers!”</p><p>“Speech from retired servicemembers – even speech opining on the lawfulness of military<br>\noperations – does not threaten ‘obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de corps’ in the same way as speech from active-duty soldiers,” Leon wrote.</p><p>“Nor can speech from retired servicemembers ‘undermine the effectiveness of response to command’ as directly as speech from active-duty soldiers.”</p><p>Leon also acknowledged that Kelly’s role as a lawmaker in Congress compounded the harms from any attempts to curtail his free-speech rights.</p><p>“If legislators do not feel free to express their views and the views of their constituents without fear of reprisal by the Executive, our representative system of Government cannot function!” he wrote, in one of his many exclamatory statements.</p><p>The judge was also harshly critical of the Trump administration’s arguments that Kelly’s rank and retirement benefits were solely a military matter, not a judicial one.</p><p>Leon described Hegseth’s letter of censure as making Kelly’s punishment a “fait accompli” – a foregone conclusion – given that such a document cannot be appealed and could itself serve as the basis for a demotion.</p><p>“Here, the retaliation framework fits like a glove,” Leon said, appearing to validate the crux of Kelly’s lawsuit.</p><p>At another point, he rejected the government’s arguments by saying, “Put simply, Defendants’ response is anemic!”</p><p>The injunction he offered, though, is temporary and will last only until the lawsuit reaches a resolution.</p><h2 id=\"trump-administration-responds\">Trump administration responds</h2><p>In the wake of the injunction, Kelly took to social media to say the short-term victory was a win for all military veterans.</p><p>“Today a federal court made clear that Pete Hegseth violated the Constitution when he tried to punish me for something I said,” Kelly said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/senmarkkelly/status/2022008602194526370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> statement.</p><p>“But this case was never just about me. This administration was sending a message to millions of retired veterans that they, too, can be censured or demoted just for speaking out.”</p><p>He added that the US faces a “critical moment” in its history, warning of the erosion of fundamental rights.</p><p>Kelly then proceeded to accuse the Trump administration of “cracking down on our rights and trying to make examples of anybody they can”. He also acknowledged that the legal showdown had only just begun.</p><p>“I appreciate the judge’s careful consideration of this case,” Kelly said. “But I also know that this might not be over yet, because this president and this administration do not know how to admit when they’re wrong.”</p><p>Within a couple of hours of Kelly’s post, Hegseth himself shared a <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/2022035474337214836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">message</a> on social media, confirming that the Trump administration would forge ahead with contesting Thursday’s decision.</p><p>“This will be immediately appealed,” Hegseth said of the injunction. “Sedition is sedition, ‘Captain.'”</p><p>Kelly is considered a Democratic contender for the presidency in 2028.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The endangerment finding, he argued, is “one of the greatest scams in history”, adding that it “had no basis in fact” or law.</p><p>“On the contrary, over the generations, fossil fuels have saved millions of lives and lifted billions of people out of poverty all over the world,” Trump said at a White House ceremony on Thursday.</p><p>He hailed the repeal of the endangerment finding as “the single largest deregulatory action in American history, by far”.</p><p>EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, who also attended the ceremony, described the endangerment finding as “the Holy Grail of federal regulatory overreach”.</p><p>Rescinding the endangerment finding repeals all greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks. It could also unleash a broader unravelling of climate regulations on stationary sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities, experts say.</p><p>But Thursday’s new rule is likely to face pushback in the US court system.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Overturning the finding will “raise more havoc” than other actions Trump has taken to roll back environmental rules, environmental law professor Ann Carlson told The Associated Press news agency.</p><p>Environmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in US history against federal authority to address <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/climate-study-finds-overheating-world-will-add-57-superhot-days-a-year\">climate change</a>. Evidence backing up the endangerment finding has only grown stronger in the 17 years since it was approved, they said.</p><p>As part of Thursday’s decision, the EPA also announced it will end tax credits for automakers who install automatic start-stop ignition systems in their vehicles. The device is intended to reduce emissions, but Zeldin said “everyone hates” it.</p><p>Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticised his Democratic predecessors, saying that, in the name of tackling climate change, they were “willing to bankrupt the country”.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/trump-administration-moves-to-nix-key-finding-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">endangerment finding</a> “led to trillions of dollars in regulations that strangled entire sectors of the United States economy, including the American auto industry”, Zeldin said, criticising the leadership of Obama and former President Joe Biden in particular.</p><p>“The Obama and Biden administrations used it to steamroll into existence a left-wing wish list of costly climate policies, electric vehicle mandates and other requirements that assaulted consumer choice and affordability.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The endangerment finding had allowed for a series of regulations intended to protect against climate change and related threats.</p><p>They include deadly floods, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/why-is-europe-facing-record-breaking-heatwaves\">extreme heat waves</a>, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the US and around the world.</p><p>Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who served as the White House’s climate adviser in the Biden administration, called the Trump administration’s actions reckless.</p><p>“This EPA would rather spend its time in court working for the fossil fuel industry than protecting us from pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change,” she said.</p><p>EPA has a clear scientific and legal obligation to regulate greenhouse gases, McCarthy explained, adding that the health and environmental hazards of climate change have “become impossible to ignore”.</p><p>Thursday’s EPA action follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding.</p><p>Conservatives have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.</p><p>Democratic Senator <a href=\"/opinions/2023/3/25/we-need-a-fossil-fuel-phase-out-now\">Ed Markey</a> said that keeping the endangerment finding should have been a “no-brainer”.</p><p>“Trump and Zeldin are putting our lives and our future at risk,” he said in a video statement.</p><p>“They have rolled back protection after protection in a race to the bottom.
