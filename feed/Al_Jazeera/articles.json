Kugler is returning to her tenured professorship at Georgetown University.</p><p>The term expires January 31, 2026, and is subject to approval by the Senate. Trump said the White House continues to search for someone to fill the 14-year Fed board seat that opens on February 1.</p><p>Miran, who served as an economic adviser in the Department of the Treasury during the first Trump administration, has advocated for a far-reaching overhaul of Fed governance that would include shortening board member terms, putting them under the clear control of the president, and ending the “revolving door” between the executive branch and the Fed and nationalising the Fed’s 12 regional banks.</p><p>The appointment is Trump’s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining federal agencies that is still independent. Trump has relentlessly criticised the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/30/us-federal-reserve-leaves-rates-unchanged-despite-pressure-from-white-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">short-term interest rates unchanged</a> – a major point of contention between the White House and the central bank.</p><p>Miran has been a major defender of Trump’s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He has also played down the risk that Trump’s tariffs will generate higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.</p><p>Trump has unsuccessfully pressured Fed policymakers – who include Powell, his six fellow board members and the 12 Fed bank presidents – to lower rates. Appointing Miran to the central bank, even in a placeholder role, gives the president a potentially more direct route to pursue his desire for easier monetary policy.</p><h2 id=\"trump-loyalist\">‘Trump loyalist’</h2><p>It is unclear how much time Miran would have at the Fed to try to deploy his ideas, or even vote on interest rates, though.</p><p>All Fed nominees require Senate confirmation, a process that includes a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, a vote from that panel advancing the nomination and a series of floor votes before the full Senate, where Democrats have been slowing the pace of approval for Trump appointments.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Stephen Miran is a Trump loyalist and one of the chief architects of the President’s chaotic tariff policy that has hurt Americans’ wallets,” the Senate Banking Committee’s top-ranking Democrat, Elizabeth Warren, said on X following the announcement. “I’ll have tough questions for him about whether he’d serve the American people or merely serve Donald Trump.”</p><p>The Senate is on summer recess until September 2.</p><p>There are just four policy-setting meetings, including one on September 16-17, before the end of what would be Miran’s term.</p><p>Fed policymakers kept the policy rate in its current 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent range at their July meeting, with Powell citing somewhat elevated inflation and the concern that Trump’s tariffs could keep it that way as reasons to keep policy restrictive.</p><p>Several central bankers this month have raised concerns about labour market weakness, and at least a couple have expressed renewed confidence that tariffs may not push up inflation as much as earlier thought. Those views echo the arguments made by two Fed governors who last month dissented on the decision to leave policy on hold.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Youths ranging from age one to 18 reported that nearly 62 percent of their diet was highly processed. That number dipped to 53 percent among adults over age 19.</p><p>Ultra-processed foods are common and can take a variety of forms, from pre-packaged snacks, frozen foods and bottled soda drinks.</p><p>But Thursday’s findings are likely to add fuel to a campaign under Health and Human Services Secretary <a href=\"/news/2025/2/13/us-senate-confirms-robert-f-kennedy-as-health-and-human-services-leader\">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a> to reform the US diet, as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign (MAHA).</p><p>Just one day before the latest CDC numbers were published, Kennedy used his social media account to once again blame high-calorie, processed foods for a variety of ailments.</p><p>“Genes don’t cause epidemics. They may provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin — and we know what it is.

About <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5,000 people</a> take part each year.</p><p>In the latest edition of the survey, researchers found that income played a significant role in how much ultra-processed foods were consumed per household. High-income groups corresponded with lower mean percentages of highly processed foods consumed.</p><p>This was particularly pronounced among adults. For those whose salaries were equivalent to 3.5 times the federal poverty level or more, a mean of 50.4 percent of their diet was comprised of processed foods.</p><p>That number rose to 54.7 percent for those whose incomes were slightly above, at or below the federal poverty level.</p><p>The survey also identified the primary culinary culprits behind Americans’ consumption of highly processed foods.</p><p>Sandwiches, including burgers, were the highest source of ultra-processed foods, comprising 7.6 percent of the calories consumed by youth and 8.6 percent for adults. Sweet bakery foods were the next highest category, at 6.3 percent for minors and 5.2 percent for adults.</p><p>Sweetened beverages and savoury snacks were also prominent sources of calories.</p><p>But the study did contain some positive news, showing that the mean consumption of ultra-processed foods had decreased.</p><p>In the survey period from 2013 to 2014, adults consumed a mean of 55.8 percent of their calories from highly processed items. But by the current period, that number slid to 53 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

would require universities to disclose to the federal government data about their student admissions.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the news in a post on the social media platform X, reposting an article from the right-wing publication The Daily Caller.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span

list</span></div><p>Trump has long sought to exert greater control over the country’s higher education system, which he and other prominent Republicans consider ideologically skewed.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has also sought to dismantle initiatives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion — goals known collectively by the acronym DEI — on the basis that such efforts are inherently discriminatory.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rolling-back-dei\">Rolling back DEI</h2><p>This was such a priority for Trump that, on January 20, during the first day of his second term, he signed <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an executive order</a> titled “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing”.</p><p>That order repealed a previous directive, issued under President Joe Biden, to advance “racial equity” and better support “underserved communities”.</p><p>It also called diversity initiatives “illegal and immoral” and ordered the termination of any such programmes run by the federal government.</p><p>“Federal employment practices, including Federal employee performance reviews, shall reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and shall not under any circumstances consider DEI,” the order explained.</p><p>Trump has sought to extend his campaign against DEI beyond the auspices of the federal government, including to private enterprises.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s inauguration, major US companies like <a href=\"/economy/2025/1/24/target-becomes-latest-us-firm-to-end-dei-initiatives\">the retailer Target</a> and the carmaker Ford have reframed or dialled back their DEI programming, in an apparent response to the president’s platform.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But critics have questioned whether Trump may be exceeding his constitutionally mandated powers.</p><p>Some have argued that an embrace of diversity practices falls well within a private enterprise’s free speech rights under the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p><p>They also point out that, without proactively supporting diversity in companies and universities, those institutions are likely to maintain imbalances in race, gender and ability that do not reflect the wider public.</p><p>That, in turn, keeps certain groups out of positions of power, perpetuating a history of segregation and bias in the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"peeling-back-affirmative-action\">Peeling back affirmative action</h2><p>But Trump and his allies have long argued that diversity-promoting practices use race, gender and other factors to discriminate against qualified candidates who may belong to over-represented groups.</p><p>In a subsequent <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> on January 21, Trump pledged to restore “merit-based opportunity” in the US.</p><p>“Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex,” the executive order said.</p><p>Under Trump, the Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-takes-action-eliminate-dei\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has taken steps</a> to roll back diversity initiatives and other “divisive ideology” in schools, including by freezing federal funds to institutions that do not comply.</p><p>That has put it at loggerheads with academic freedom advocates, who fear the independence of US schools is being trampled in favour of advancing a political agenda.</p><p>Opponents of diversity initiatives, however, have won significant victories, most recently in 2023.</p><p>That year, the <a href=\"/news/2023/6/29/us-top-court-bans-colleges-from-considering-race-in-admissions\">US Supreme Court ruled</a> that affirmative action — the practice of considering race and other diversity factors in school admissions — violated the US Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment, which asserts the right to equal protection under the law.</p><p>That decision, delivered by the court’s conservative supermajority, overturned decades of precedent and barred schools from using race as a factor for choosing students.</p><p>Some conservative groups, however, have continued to question whether there is a bias in school admissions against white, male and Asian students.</p><h2 id=\"trump-versus-the-ivy-league\">Trump versus the Ivy League</h2><p>The US president has been among the sceptics clamouring for more information about university admissions and hiring practices, and he has made that demand a pillar in his fights with various top schools.</p><p>Trump has yanked billions in federal contracts, grants and other funds from schools, including Columbia University in New York, Harvard University in Massachusetts and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which reported this week a pause on $584m in grants.</p><p>To restore those suspended funds, Trump has called on university leaders to agree to his demands, including oversight over admissions.</p><p>Columbia was the first major campus to do so. As part of <a href=\"https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/03.21.2025%20Columbia%20-%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its deal</a> with the Trump administration, Columbia agreed to review its admissions practices and establish an advisory group to “analyze recent trends in enrollment”.</p><p>The advisory group will then “report to the President”, according to the deal.</p><p>The Trump administration has also launched federal investigations into universities, alleging violations of civil rights law. Some universities have submitted to Trump’s demands in part to bring those probes to a close.</p><p>On July 30, for instance, another Ivy League school, Brown University in Rhode Island, announced <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-07-30/brown-united-states-resolution-agreement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it had struck a deal</a> in exchange for the continuation of its federal funding and a “permanent closure” to the “open reviews and investigations” the Trump administration had launched.</p><p>As part of the deal, however, Brown <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/brown-university-strikes-50m-deal-to-end-trump-administration-pressure\">agreed to spend $50m</a> on workforce development programmes and maintain “merit-based admissions policies”.</p><p>“No proxy for racial admission will be tolerated,” <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/sites/default/files/brown-and-united-states-resolution-agreement_July-30-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the deal reads</a>. “Brown may not use personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means to introduce or justify discrimination.”</p><p>Still, some schools have resisted Trump’s demands, <a href=\"/news/2025/4/15/harvard-university-defies-trumps-demands-faces-2-3bn-in-funding-cuts\">most notably Harvard</a>, the nation’s oldest university.</p><p>In April, Harvard President Alan Garber rejected an agreement proposed by the Trump administration, which <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">would have required</a> a “comprehensive audit” of the school’s hiring and admissions practices.</p><p>That data would have then been shared with the federal government.</p><p>“No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/the-promise-of-american-higher-education/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> at the time.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/corporate/tan-joins-intel-ceo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was appointed</a> as Intel’s CEO on March 12, and he also serves on the company’s board of directors.</p><p>Previously, Tan served in leadership positions at the software company Cadence Design Systems, and he was a founding partner for the venture capital firm Walden Catalyst Ventures.</p><p>His personal investments — and the investments of the venture funds he manages — caught the public’s attention shortly after his appointment at Intel, though.</p><p>In April, the news agency Reuters reported that, between March 2012 and December 2024, Tan invested in Chinese firms that create technology for the People’s Liberation Army, China’s armed forces.</p><p>For some US politicians, that raised a conflict of interest.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>On Wednesday, for instance, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas <a href=\"https://x.com/SenTomCotton/status/1953108003525185686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> a letter on social media written to the chairman of Intel’s board of directors, Frank Yeary.</p><p>In it, he demanded more information about Tan’s hiring and his investments in China.</p><p>Cotton pointed out that, on July 28, Cadence Design Systems agreed to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cadence-design-systems-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-over-140-million-unlawfully-exporting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plead guilty</a> to federal charges concerning the sale of technology and intellectual property to China’s National University of Defense Technology.</p><p>That plea deal resulted in criminal and civil penalties of more than $140m.</p><p>“I write to express concern about the security and integrity of Intel’s operations and its potential impact on US national security,” Cotton wrote in his letter to Yeary.</p><p>“Mr Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”</p><p>In an accompanying message to his social media followers, Cotton added that Intel “owes Congress an explanation”.</p><p>Intel responded to the allegations on Thursday by saying that both the company and Tan remain “deeply committed” to advancing US national security and economic prosperity.</p><p>“Intel has been manufacturing in America for 56 years,” it said in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/corporate/our-commitment-to-advancing-u-s-national-and-economic-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>. “We are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&amp;D [research and development] and manufacturing.”</p><h2 id=\"trump-pushes-america-first-plan\">Trump pushes ‘America First’ plan</h2><p>For years, the US and China have been locked in tense competition for economic and political dominance, and the US has repeatedly accused China of attempting to poach American innovation and spy on its technology firms.</p><p>China, meanwhile, has denied such allegations, describing them as part of a US smear campaign.</p><p>Founded in 1968, Intel has long been a flagship US technology firm, known for producing computer parts like microprocessors. But in recent decades, the company has struggled to keep pace with its competitors, particularly as artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed Silicon Valley, Intel’s longtime home.</p><p>Trump, however, has sought to bolster domestic manufacturing with his “America First” economic agenda, which leverages tariffs to discourage the import of products from abroad.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Republican leader even said he planned to impose <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/6/white-house-says-apple-to-invest-billions-in-us-manufacturing\">100-percent tariffs</a> on foreign chips and semiconductors sold in the US.</p><p>But Trump has faced criticism for testing the boundaries of his executive power — and, in some cases, seeking to impose his will on the running of private companies.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term, for instance, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/3/22/how-columbia-gave-in-to-trumps-demands-to-get-its-400m-funding-back\">has withheld federal funds</a> from private universities in order to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/columbia-university-to-pay-200m-to-settle-anti-semitism-claims\">extract guarantees</a> that those institutions would eliminate their diversity initiatives and implement disciplinary reforms, among other demands.</p><p>In an interview with Reuters, analysts appeared split over whether Trump was overplaying his hand.</p><p>“Many investors likely believe that President Trump has his hand in too many cookie jars, it’s just another signal that he’s very serious about trying to bring business back to the US,” said David Wagner, the head of equity and a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which has invested in Intel.</p><p>Meanwhile, Phil Blancato, the CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, told Reuters that Trump ousting Tan could have a chilling effect on US business.</p><p>“It would be setting a very unfortunate precedent,” Blancato said. “You don’t want American presidents dictating who runs companies, but certainly his opinion has merit and weight.”</p><p>It is unclear how Trump’s pressure campaign against Tan may affect Intel’s future.</p><p>But in its statement, Intel said that it was “making significant investments aligned with the President’s America First agenda”.</p><p>“We look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration,” it added.</p><p>Last year, Intel received $8bn in subsidies under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, to build further chip manufacturing plants in the US.</p></div></div></body></html>"
