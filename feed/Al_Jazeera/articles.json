Carlson, an influential figure who has been vocally critical of Israel over the past year, repeatedly asked Huckabee whether he supported Israel controlling all the land between the Nile River in Egypt and the Euphrates River in Iraq.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Huckabee, a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/what-is-christian-zionism-us-envoy-beliefs-about-israels-mena-expansion\">Christian Zionist</a>, would not disavow the belief that the Bible promised that land to Israel – even though it now encompasses all or part of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria.</p><p>“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee said, leading to anger from those countries and others in the region, many of which are close US allies.</p><p>Then, speaking on Monday, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said that he would support “anything that will allow the Jews a large, broad, strong land and a safe haven for us”.</p><p>“Zionism is based on the Bible. Our mandate over the land of Israel is biblical, [and] the biblical borders of the land of Israel are clear … Therefore, the borders are the borders of the Bible,” the apparently secular Israeli politician said.</p><p>So what is Greater Israel exactly? And is it really an ultimate goal for some Israeli politicians?</p><h2 id=\"defining-greater-israel\">Defining Greater Israel</h2><p>The most expansionist claim for a Greater Israel is based on a biblical verse (Genesis 15:18-21), which narrates God making a covenant with Abraham that promises his descendants the land between the Nile and the Euphrates.</p><p>That would include the Jewish people, with the tribes of Israel believed to be descended through Abraham’s son, Isaac. But it would also include the children of another of Abraham’s sons, Ishmael (Ismail), regarded as the forefather of the Arabs.</p><p>Other definitions based on different biblical verses are narrower in their territorial scope and specify that the land of Israel would be promised to the tribes of Israel descended from Isaac.</p><p class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why “Greater Israel” Is No Longer A Fantasy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-gDbGvK2Og0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">VIDEO</iframe></p><h2 id=\"how-has-israel-worked-to-achieve-expansion\">How has Israel worked to achieve expansion?</h2><p>The current state of Israel emerged from the British Mandate for Palestine in 1948. The mandate, created by the League of Nations in the wake of World War I and the occupation of Palestine by the British, geographically limited Israel upon its creation.</p><p>The 1948 war that followed the end of the mandate led to Israel taking control of all of Mandatory Palestine, with the exception of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p><p>But Israel soon expanded by force – in 1967 it defeated Arab forces and took control of the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, and Syria’s occupied Golan Heights. Israel continues to occupy all of those regions, with the exception of the Sinai, which it returned to Egypt in 1982.</p><p>Since then, Israel has ignored international law and continued occupying Palestinian and Syrian land, and has shown little respect for its neighbours’ sovereignty, occupying more land in Syria, as well as in Lebanon.</p><h2 id=\"how-popular-is-the-idea-of-greater-israel\">How popular is the idea of Greater Israel?</h2><p>This needs to be broken down into two separate concepts – the expansion of Israel into the territory that immediately borders it, and the most extreme definition of Greater Israel: between the Nile and the Euphrates.</p><p>In terms of expansion into its immediate surroundings, Israeli Jews by and large support the annexation of East Jerusalem, which is occupied Palestinian territory, and the Golan Heights.</p><p>The Israeli government continues to move towards the de facto annexation of the occupied West Bank. Israeli politicians vary in how open they are in their support for the formal annexation of the West Bank, but most mainstream Israeli politicians are supportive of the illegal Israeli settlements in the territory.</p><p>An expansion of Israeli settlements into Gaza is not as popular, but is supported by far-right Israeli parties.</p><p>A Greater Israel, including parts of Jordan, or the most irredentist definition between the Euphrates and the Nile, is more controversial. Pre-1948, many Zionists sought not just Palestine but also Jordan for their future state – one of the most important Zionist armed groups at the time, the Irgun, even included the map of both Palestine and Jordan in its emblem.</p><p>But after the foundation of Israel this took a back seat, and open calls for a vastly expanded Israel were largely restricted to the fringes. But those fringes – far-right figures like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – are now in government, reflecting a wider radicalisation within Israeli society itself.</p><p>That means the Israeli ‘mainstream’, politicians such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and centrists like Lapid, are either more open in their support for some form of Greater Israel beyond the West Bank, or less willing to publicly oppose it.</p><h2 id=\"how-threatened-do-regional-countries-feel\">How threatened do regional countries feel?</h2><p>Regional states have said that the annexation of the West Bank would be a red line, but have been unable to reverse Israel’s occupation.</p><p>Hints at a wider expansion have led to an angry reaction from Arab countries. This goes further back than Huckabee’s recent comments. For example, Jordan condemned Smotrich – Israel’s finance minister – when he gave a speech in 2023 at a podium that displayed a map that showed Jordan as part of Israel.</p><p>And Huckabee’s support for Greater Israel was <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/arab-islamic-countries-condemn-netanyahus-greater-israel-remark\">roundly condemned</a> by more than a dozen states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkiye.</p><p>For Arab and Muslim states, the anger at the comments partially emanates from the sense of a lack of respect towards the sovereignty of regional states by a US official. But it also highlights fears that the balance of power in the region is weighted towards an Israel that is increasingly willing to attack across the Middle East, and has little interest in peace.</p><p>Even if the takeover of the land between the Nile and the Euphrates is not feasible, a region where Israel is the primary hegemon will likely lead to more attacks, more wars, and, if Israel determines it necessary, more occupation of land.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/epa_69a04dee8981-1772113390.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"332\" data-end=\"737\">Benjamin Netanyahu and Narendra Modi shared a conspicuously warm embrace as the Indian prime minister stepped off Air India One at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport on Wednesday, a moment that captured the political intimacy between the two leaders. Over the course of his two-day visit, the two sides are expected to sign several agreements, further consolidating an already deepening partnership between Israel and India.</p><p data-start=\"739\" data-end=\"1194\">Modi has long been a driving force behind this closeness. His 2017 trip marked the first visit to Israel by an Indian prime minister and signalled a decisive shift in bilateral relations. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, he called this trip a “historic visit”, later receiving a standing ovation at a reception at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, where Netanyahu declared, “This is true friendship, between two leaders, between two countries, and between two ancient nations.”</p><p data-start=\"1196\" data-end=\"1531\">Of course, this friendship does not just hinge on the deals and agreements the two leaders are set to sign. While welcoming Modi on the tarmac at Ben Gurion airport, Sara Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister’s wife, wore orange/saffron, the colour of Hindutva. The Israeli prime minister also pointed out that her outfit matched the orange pocket square Modi was wearing.</p><p data-start=\"1533\" data-end=\"2021\">The prominence of Hindutva’s signature colour was difficult to ignore and suggested a clear ease with, and affirmation of, the ideological framework underpinning Modi’s politics. The ideological partnership between Netanyahu and Modi rests on a belief that both leaders stand as a bulwark against what they consider an existential civilisational struggle against Islam and Islamism. Bibi’s Israel is meant to serve as a haven for all Jews, while Modi’s India is meant to keep Hindus safe.</p><p data-start=\"2023\" data-end=\"2101\">But it is worth asking, whose safety is really guaranteed in Israel and India?</p><p data-start=\"2103\" data-end=\"2508\">The genocide in Gaza and the ongoing settler violence and annexation of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank are only the latest reminders that Palestinians cannot expect to be safe in the Holy Land. Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up about 19 percent of the population, face various forms of institutionalised discrimination and are, in fact, as Amnesty International put it, “lesser citizens” of Israel.</p><p data-start=\"2510\" data-end=\"2705\">But not all Jewish citizens of Israel are “safe” either. Racial discrimination against Mizrahi Jews has been a matter of official policy, written into the very foundations of the state of Israel.</p><p data-start=\"2707\" data-end=\"2900\">A distinct antagonism towards Mizrahi Jews’ Middle East roots was evident when Ze’ev Jabotinsky, the founder of Revisionist Zionism and the Zionist paramilitary group Irgun, said, “We Jews have nothing in common with what is called the Orient, thank God. To the extent that our uneducated masses [i.e. Middle Eastern Jews] have ancient spiritual traditions and laws that call the Orient, they must be weaned away from them, and this is in fact what we are doing in every decent school, what life itself is doing with great success. We are going in Palestine, first for our national convenience, to sweep out thoroughly all traces of the Oriental soul.”</p><p data-start=\"2902\" data-end=\"3348\">Declassified state documents show that thousands of babies from Arab Jewish families arriving in Israel after its creation were stolen by hospitals and clinics and handed over “to wealthy Jewish families in Israel and abroad”. Yemeni families suffered the “largest proportion of disappearances”. It is estimated that “one in eight children [from Yemeni families] under the age of four” had gone missing by the time the State of Israel turned six.</p><p data-start=\"3350\" data-end=\"3847\">Racial discrimination is not a matter of the past, and this white supremacy is ever more evident in the structural and everyday racism faced by Ethiopian Jews. Though accounting for only 2 percent of the population, more than half of Ethiopian Jewish citizens live below the poverty line. Their neighbourhoods are chronically under-resourced, and Ethiopian Jewish children and youth face substance abuse, violence, high school dropout rates, as well as an alarming increase in cases of depression and suicide.</p><p data-start=\"3849\" data-end=\"3968\">Reflecting this experience, one participant in a<a href=\"https://www.associationforjewishstudies.org/docs/default-source/ajs-perspectives/ajs-perspectives-hate-issue-marom.pdf?sfvrsn=1c2b9306_0\"> study</a> published by the Association for Jewish Studies said, “No matter what we do, this is what we get. ‘These Ethiopians, these barbarians, they infiltrate Israel.’ Take police racism, for instance, they treat us like invaders, criminals, even though this is our home. And the strangest thing is, who knows the feeling of exclusion better than the Jewish people? We weren’t accepted in Europe because we were Jewish, and now you don’t accept us because we’re Black?! You were discriminated and now you discriminate us. You’re not accepting yourself! We are PART of you, can’t you SEE?”.</p><p data-start=\"3970\" data-end=\"4041\">These realities show that Israel is not a place of safety for all Jews.</p><p data-start=\"4043\" data-end=\"4332\">India is no different. Structural and everyday discrimination faced by the country’s minority Muslim population is <a href=\"/features/2022/6/10/analysis-islamophobia-is-the-norm-in-modis-india\">well documented</a> across legal, political and social spheres. Critics and oppositional voices remain under threat. But are all Hindus safe under a Hindu nationalist leadership?</p><p data-start=\"4334\" data-end=\"4487\">Caste-based discrimination, while not an invention of this government, remains a central feature of Indian society and has intensified under Modi’s rule.</p><p data-start=\"4489\" data-end=\"5035\">In January, the University Grants Commission (UGC) introduced the Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations. The move followed Supreme Court pressure to address harassment and discrimination faced by <a href=\"/video/101-east/2017/3/3/indias-dalit-revolution#:~:text=We%20go%20inside%20the%20Dalit,minutes%2040%20seconds%2024:40\">Dalit students</a>. The regulations “make heads of institutions directly responsible for preventing and responding to discrimination on the basis of caste, religion, gender or disability by students, teachers or non-teaching staff”. The measures faced immediate backlash, and the court has since “stayed the new regulations”.</p><p data-start=\"5037\" data-end=\"5569\">Behind these regulations lies a tragic record of suicides among Dalit students. This includes the highly publicised case of Dalit PhD candidate Rohith Vemula at the University of Hyderabad in 2016. Vemula was active on campus, raising the issue of caste discrimination, prompting complaints from the student wing of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The matter reached Smriti Irani, the then-human resource development minister in the Modi government, who asked university leadership to investigate. Vemula’s fellowship was suspended, and he was forced to vacate his dormitory.</p><p data-start=\"5571\" data-end=\"5681\">He died by suicide on January 16, 2016, writing in his suicide note that his “birth was his fatal accident”.</p><p data-start=\"5683\" data-end=\"6253\">A 2021 <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/06/29/attitudes-about-caste/\">Pew study</a> reveals that a majority of Indians “do not see widespread discrimination against Scheduled Castes and Tribes”. Yet UGC data from 2025 shows caste-related complaints have risen sharply. Employment patterns also reproduce caste hierarchies, with 77 percent of sewer and septic workers coming from Dalit communities. Research suggests that caste hierarchies are increasingly reproduced in artificial intelligence systems. The anti-affirmative action activism of the Hindu nationalist diaspora also demonstrates that caste hierarchies extend beyond national boundaries.</p><p data-start=\"6255\" data-end=\"6370\">What is the point of dredging up this record of exclusion, discrimination and hierarchy in light of Modi’s bromance with Netanyahu? It certainly does not mean that if racism in Israeli society did not exist, or if casteism were eliminated in India, their ideologies and political actions would be any more acceptable. Rather, it is to highlight the expansive and multifaceted nature of the hierarchies and structures of exclusion propagated by the two leaders. The main targets of their discourse and policies are Palestinians across Palestine and Israel, and Muslims in India. Yet the proponents of their politics are equally keen to weaponise this discourse and brand of statecraft to target those who do not fit their hegemonic conception of life and politics.</p><p data-start=\"6255\" data-end=\"6370\">That is to say, truly, no one is safe in Israel and India.</p><p data-start=\"6928\" data-end=\"6985\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

While still under British rule in the 1920s and 1930s, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.</p><p>India initially opposed Israel’s creation and United Nations membership before recognising the state in 1950.

Nine years ago, Modi became the first Indian prime minister ever to visit Israel.</p><p>India is currently Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/indias-modi-visits-israel-whats-on-the-agenda-and-why-it-matters\">second largest trading partner</a> in Asia after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.</p><p>“Modi is underscoring IMEC and I2U2 as part of a broader push to deepen economic and strategic cooperation with Israel and key Middle Eastern partners, positioning India at the centre of emerging trade and technology corridors amid shifting regional geopolitics,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the London-based Chatham House think tank.</p><p>Collaborative projects like the IMEC and I2U2 are central elements of the expanding partnership between India and Israel. Additionally, they connect India and Israel to Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>“For Gulf states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, IMEC and I2U2 offer a chance to cement their roles as pivotal connectivity and logistics hubs linking Asia, the Middle East and Europe while accelerating economic diversification beyond oil,” Vakil told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“However, lingering UAE-Saudi policy competition and Israel’s stance on Palestine inevitably complicate the political cohesion needed to fully deliver projects like IMEC.”</p><h3>Regional tensions</h3><p>Modi’s visit to Israel also comes amid worsening regional tensions.</p><p>It follows India’s decision to join more than 100 states in condemning Israel’s de facto <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/illegal-settlement-expansion-how-israel-is-redrawing-occupied-west-bank\">expansion in the occupied West Bank</a>, a move New Delhi delayed by a day, suggesting hesitation as a result of its close ties with Israel.</p><p>This week, Netanyahu said he plans to form a new regional bloc of countries that he <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/whats-netanyahus-planned-hexagon-alliance-and-can-it-work\">called a “hexagon” alliance</a> to stand against “radical” Sunni and Shia Muslim “axes”.</p><p>On Sunday, Netanyahu said this alliance would include Israel, India, Greece and Cyprus along with other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states. None of these governments, including India, has officially endorsed this plan, however.</p><p>At the same time, US-Iran tensions are escalating. Washington is building up military assets near Iran while US President Donald Trump threatens limited strikes over Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes.

Now, that label has been seemingly applied to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a key leader during that ruinous war against Iraq that left a million dead.</p><p>But while the “war script” sounds familiar, the geopolitical stage has shifted dramatically.</p><p>As Washington pivots from the neoconservatives’ “preemptive” doctrine of the Bush era to what experts are calling the “preventive maintenance” of the Trump era – following the June 2025 strikes on Iran in tandem with Israel’s attack in the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a> – questions are mounting about the intelligence, the endgame, and the alarming lack of checks and balances.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-semiotics-of-fear-from-clouds-to-tunnels\">The semiotics of fear: From clouds to tunnels</h2><p>In 2003, the visual language of war was vertical: The fear of a “mushroom cloud” rising over US cities, or a biological weapon seeping into populated areas. Today, the fear has gone in the other direction: Purportedly deep underground.</p><p>“The administration is updating the visual dictionary of fear,” says Osama Abu Irshaid, a Washington-based political analyst. “They are exaggerating the nuclear threat exactly as the Bush administration did with the ‘smoking gun’ metaphor. But there is a key difference: In 2003, US intelligence was manipulated to align with the lie. In 2026, the intelligence assessments actually contradict Trump’s claims.”</p><p>While Trump asserted in his State of the Union address that Iran is “rebuilding” its nuclear programme to strike the US mainland, his own officials offer conflicting narratives. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">insisted</a> Tuesday, parroting her boss, that the 2025 “Operation Midnight Hammer” had “obliterated” Iran’s facilities. Yet, days earlier, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff claimed Tehran was “a week away” from the bomb.</p><p>This “information chaos”, analysts argue, serves a specific purpose: Keeping the threat vague enough to justify perpetual military pressure.</p><p>“Bush benefitted from the post-9/11 anger to link Iraq to an existential threat,” Abu Irshaid told Al Jazeera. “Trump doesn’t have that. Iran hasn’t attacked the US homeland. So, he has to fabricate a direct threat, claiming their ballistic missiles can reach America – a claim unsupported by technical realities.”</p><h2 id=\"the-regime-change-quagmire\">The regime change quagmire</h2><p>Perhaps the most glaring contrast with 2003 is the internal coherence of the administration.</p><p>The Bush team – Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz – moved in ideological lockstep. Cheney famously predicted US troops would be “greeted as liberators”.</p><p>They were anything but. The made-for-television scene of a statue of Saddam Hussein being torn down in central Baghdad quickly gave way to sustained, organised fighting against the US occupation, heavy US troop losses, as well as sectarian bloodletting that forced Iraq onto the cusp of all-out civil war.</p><p>Bush declaring major combat operations over under a huge “Mission Accomplished” banner in May 2003 came back to haunt his administration and the US for years to come.</p><p>The Trump team of 2026 appears far more fractured, torn between “America First” isolationism and aggressive interventionism.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>The official line:</strong> Vice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have publicly <a href=\"/news/2025/6/22/senior-trump-officials-say-us-attacks-on-iran-not-about-regime\">stated</a> the goal is not regime change. “We are not at war with Iran, we’re at war with Iran’s nuclear programme,” Vance said Sunday.</li>\n<li><strong>The president’s instinct:</strong> Trump contradicted them on social media, posting: “If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!”</li>\n</ul><p>“The Neocons who hijacked policy under Bush have been weakened,” notes Abu Irshaid. “But they have been replaced by figures like Stephen Miller, who holds absolute loyalty to Trump and close ties to the Israeli right. Trump is driven by instinct, not strategy. He seeks the ‘victory’ that eluded his predecessors: The total hollowing out of Iran, whether through zero-enrichment surrender or collapse.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-lonely-superpower-coercion-over-coalition\">The lonely superpower: Coercion over coalition</h2><p>In 2003, Bush and United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair worked tirelessly to build a “Coalition of the Willing”. It was a diplomatic veneer, but it existed. Blair remains a much-loathed figure in the Middle East and in some quarters in the West for giving diplomatic cover to the Iraq debacle.</p><p>In 2026, the US is operating in stark isolation.</p><p>“Trump is not building a coalition; he is alienating allies,” Abu Irshaid explains. He points to a pattern of “extortion” extending from tariffs on the European Union to attempts to “buy” Greenland. “The Europeans see the coercion used against Iran and fear it could be turned against them. Unlike 2003, only Israel is fully on board.”</p><p>This isolation was highlighted when the UK reportedly refused to allow the US to use island bases for strikes on Iran, forcing B-2 bombers to fly 18-hour missions directly from the US mainland during the 2025 campaign.</p><h2 id=\"the-collapse-of-checks-and-balances\">The collapse of checks and balances</h2><p>Following the damning intelligence failures and lies of the Iraq war, promises were made to strengthen congressional oversight. Two decades later, those guardrails appear to have vanished.</p><p>Despite efforts by US Representatives Ro Khanna (a Democrat) and Thomas Massie (a Republican) to invoke a “discharge petition” to block an unauthorised war, the political reality is grim.</p><p>“The concept of checks and balances is facing a severe test,” warns Abu Irshaid. “The Republican Party is now effectively the party of Trump. The Supreme Court leans right. Trump is operating with expanded post-9/11 powers that allow for ‘limited strikes’ – strikes that can easily spiral into the open war he claims to avoid.”</p><p>With the administration citing “32,000” protesters killed by Tehran – a figure significantly higher than independent estimates, and which Iran dismissed as “big lies” on Wednesday – the moral groundwork for escalation is being laid, bypassing the need for United Nations resolutions or congressional approval.</p><p>As US and Iranian negotiators meet in Geneva for make-or-break talks under the shadow of last year’s “Operation Midnight Hammer”, the question remains: Are the two nations with decades of enmity boiling between them on the brink of a new deal, or the prelude to a war that could ignite the entire region in flames?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Of those, 387 are from the Green Party, 375 from the governing Labour Party and 115 from the Liberal Democrats.</p><p>Five councillors from the Conservative Party are among the signatories, along with hundreds more from the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Scottish Greens and local parties, or who serve as independents. No candidates from the far-right Reform UK have signed the pledge.</p><p>The initiative, which will be opened to all candidates in March, is supported by Vote Palestine, a grassroots campaign coordinated by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and backed by the Palestinian Youth Movement Britain, the Palestinian Forum in Britain, The Muslim Vote and the British Palestinian Committee.</p><p>It aims to pressure councils to adopt policies aligned with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, including divesting pension funds from companies linked to Israeli arms production.</p><p>Local Government Pension Scheme funds, administered by councils, invest more than 12.2 billion pounds ($16.5bn) in companies that are complicit in violations of international law, according to the <a href=\"https://lgpsdivest.org/lgps-investments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a>.</p><p>Thirty-one councils have passed motions or issued statements supporting divestment of pension funds, the campaign <a href=\"https://lgpsdivest.org/timeline-of-divestment-milestones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">says</a>. It notes 46 percent of voters back divestment, compared with 14 percent who oppose it.</p><p>Supporters describe the movement as inspired by the anti-apartheid campaign of the 1980s, when more than <a href=\"/features/2016/2/23/bds-movement-lessons-from-the-south-africa-boycott\">100 local authorities</a> banned South African goods from their offices and schools, and others ended pension fund investments in companies with South African subsidiaries.</p><h2 id=\"corbyn-backs-campaign\">Corbyn backs campaign</h2><p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has endorsed moves to make Palestine a central issue in the 2026 local elections. In a post on X, he wrote: “Let’s make the Palestinian issue non-negotiable in this election.” He called on campaigners to back a “people’s pledge”, whereby supporters promise to support only those council candidates who have backed Vote Palestine.</p><p></p><p>Signatories of the “candidates’ pledge” include Green Party deputy leader Mothin Ali and Trafford councillor Hannah Spencer, a by-election candidate in Gorton and Denton; Matthew Brown, Labour leader of Preston City Council; and Ayoub Khan, an independent member of Parliament and Birmingham councillor.</p><p>The May local elections are widely seen as a litmus test for the Labour government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which has faced declining poll ratings since it was elected in 2024. Critics within and outside the party have linked some of the discontent to its handling of Israel’s genocide in Gaza.</p><p>With every council seat in London – traditionally a Labour stronghold – up for election, campaigners believe Vote Palestine could influence results in closely contested areas.</p><p>In Hackney, north London, where Labour currently holds a large majority, the party faces a challenge from the Greens and the Independent Socialists. All six of the borough’s Green councillors have signed the pledge, compared with three from Labour.</p><p>“We’ve all seen the devastation caused by Israel’s genocide in Gaza, but none have felt it more deeply than Hackney residents I’ve spoken to who have lost family members in Palestine,” said Zoe Garbett, a Green councillor in Hackney who is running for mayor.</p><p>“The council took a stand against South African apartheid, and now it’s time we make a similar stand for the Palestinians.”</p><p>Left-wing figures within Labour have also endorsed the pledge. Richard Burgon, Labour MP for Leeds East, said: “Keir Starmer’s refusal to stand up for the rights of the Palestinian people is wrong and has already badly hurt Labour at the polls. We saw that in the last general election, and I fear we will see it again in the May local elections.”</p><p>He added that the government “needs to listen” to members “demanding action against Israel’s genocide and war crimes and do so before even more damage is done and we lose more hard-working, principled councillors”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"pro-palestine-candidate-running-from-prison\">Pro-Palestine candidate running from prison</h2><p>The election campaign comes amid legal challenges surrounding the Palestine Action activist group. Earlier this month, the High Court <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/uk-decision-to-ban-palestine-action-as-terror-group-unlawful-court-says\">ruled</a> that a decision to proscribe the group under antiterrorism legislation was unlawful, but the ban remains in place after the Home Office was granted an appeal to challenge the ruling.</p><p>One of its alleged members, Amu Gib, is standing as a candidate for Islington Council in London’s Finsbury Park while in prison. He <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/two-palestine-action-hunger-strikers-in-uk-prisons-admitted-to-hospital\">went on a hunger strike</a> for 49 days last year.</p><p>Gib was arrested by counterterrorism police in connection with an alleged break-in at RAF Brize Norton, the United Kingdom’s largest air force base. The trial is ongoing. The charges relate to allegations that aircraft used to support Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza were vandalised.</p><p>Gib also took part in the Prisoners for Palestine hunger strike, which ended after the government decided not to award a contract worth 2 billion pounds ($2.7bn) to Elbit Systems UK, an arms company.</p><p>In a statement sent from prison, Gib told Al Jazeera that they were running on a platform calling for “no more endless wars”, as well as action on housing and food poverty. If elected, campaigners say they would be the first prisoner chosen for public office in the UK while imprisoned since Irish hunger striker Bobby Sands won a parliamentary seat in 1981.</p><p>Dan Iley-Williamson, a political organiser at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said: “The mass movement for Palestine – which has brought millions onto Britain’s streets – is not going away. Vote Palestine will take our demands into the May elections and deliver a message to those seeking office: If you want our votes, stand up for Palestine.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

and military officials.</p><p>Dubbed the “Greek Watergate” by local media, the scandal <a href=\"/news/2022/11/17/reporters-dig-up-more-links-between-greek-government-and-spyware\">engulfed Greece in 2022</a> following allegations by opposition party leader Nikos Androulakis and journalist Thanasis Koukakis that they had been under state surveillance via phone malware.</p><p>On Wednesday, a judge at the Second Single-Member Misdemeanour Court of Athens said the four were found guilty of “breaching the confidentiality of telephone communications”.</p><p>The defendants, who were not present at the court, were also found guilty of “tampering with a personal-data filing system … on a repeated basis”, as well as of “illegal access to an information system or data”, the judge said.</p><p>The four include Tal Dilian, a former Israeli soldier and founder of Intellexa, a company specialising in the supply of spyware, which marketed Predator in Greece. His business partner, as well as two former Greek executives of the company, were also on trial.</p><p>The court announced a combined sentence of 126 years and eight months, eight of which will have to be served, according to Greek media reports. The four will remain free pending an appeal requested by their lawyers.</p><p>The affair broke in early 2022 when Koukakis, an investigative journalist, discovered he had been wiretapped by the intelligence services (EYP) and that his phone had also been infected with Predator, a sophisticated software that makes it possible to infiltrate mobile phones, access messages and photos, and even remotely activate the microphone and camera.</p><p>The independent telecommunications privacy authority ADAE said Predator was used against more than 90 people.</p><p>Some of EYP’s targets during that period were the same people whose phones were infected with Predator, according to an experts’ report included in documents seen by the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Greece’s right-wing government has said it lawfully monitored the communications of Socialist party leader Nikos Androulakis. It has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>The scandal prompted judicial investigations and forced the <a href=\"/news/2022/8/5/greece-intelligence-boss-quits-amid-phone-surveillance-scandal\">resignation</a> of senior officials in Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s administration, including a senior aide to the conservative leader and the head of EYP, Panagiotis Kontoleon.</p><p>Mitsotakis later weathered a motion of no confidence in parliament over the case.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Behind its heavy doors and long dining tables, masked balls and private dinners unfolded. In 2006, it hosted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before he attended Princess Beatrice’s 18th birthday party. Among the guests at Royal Lodge were jailed sex offender Harvey Weinstein and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>Earlier this week, British police officers spent days searching Royal Lodge’s rooms as part of an inquiry into whether Mountbatten-Windsor, while serving as the UK’s trade envoy, shared confidential government material with Epstein. He was briefly arrested last week on suspicion of misconduct in public office and released without charge.</p><p>Newly released files by the United States Department of Justice, reviewed by Al Jazeera, suggest the significance of Royal Lodge extended beyond ceremony and social privilege. Emails from 2009 to 2011 indicate that, at the height of his diplomatic role, Mountbatten-Windsor convened financial meetings at the residence involving Epstein.</p><h2 id=\"the-august-2010-meeting\">The August 2010 meeting</h2><p>On August 30, 2010 – by which time Epstein was already a registered sex offender – Mountbatten-Windsor hosted a “big meeting” at Royal Lodge, according to an email chain.</p><p>An email, where the sender is redacted, asks Epstein if they should attend the meeting. “F writes me below. Its better if I do NOT go, correct? PA says its up to me,” the email reads, before it goes to what “F” wrote to the sender.</p><p>“Can you come down to Royal Lodge on sept 1st .. Wednesday.. To a big meeting of the way ahead of ME! Prince Andrew is calling it for 10.30am and then lunch afterwards. I would really need your help,” the email reads.</p><p>While the email does not specify who “F” and “PA” are, the exchange appears to be a quote originating from Sarah Ferguson, Mountbatten-Windsor’s then wife, referred to elsewhere in the emails as “F”.</p><p>“PA” is how Mountbatten-Windsor – at the time Prince Andrew – is referred to widely in the Epstein files.</p><p>In the same chain, Epstein advises on financial strategy, warning: “Ask Andrew what he wants.. she said they might suggest her going bankrupt. when i spoke to her last week. I think you need to go. otherwise, she will go after you.”</p><p>Three weeks earlier, on July 20, 2010, another email from a sender, Sarah, to Epstein reads: “In London, at Royal Lodge, to discuss all finances today”.</p><p>On July 12, 2010, another email sender told Epstein they would be “with PA at 1200 UK time at Royal Lodge (Windsor)”, adding that Epstein could join by phone.</p><p>The emails do not say whether Epstein attended these meetings in person, but they offer a glimpse into how Royal Lodge functioned as a structured venue for coordinated financial discussions where Epstein was being consulted, at a time when Mountbatten-Windsor was representing British commercial interests abroad.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The context for these meetings appears to have been Ferguson’s mounting financial distress. Her company, Hartmoor, appeared to be going bankrupt. At the time, Ferguson reportedly faced debts estimated between 2 million pounds and 5 million pounds and was considering voluntary bankruptcy.</p><p>Earlier correspondence from October 2009 shows a proposed settlement being forwarded to Epstein for review by a US lawyer “re the IP situation following a bankruptcy”, using Ferguson’s office address at Royal Lodge. The subject is entitled “Hartmoor Settlement”.</p><p>Ferguson ultimately avoided bankruptcy.</p><h2 id=\"trade-envoy-and-international-deals\">Trade envoy and international deals</h2><p>Correspondence reviewed by Al Jazeera also shows Epstein being looped into discussions about international commercial engagements.</p><p>In February 2010, an email from Sarah, reviewed by Al Jazeera, states: “I was introduced to David Stern by Jeffrey. He came to Royal Lodge for dinner. He has been helping me a great deal with an ear and advice to my way ahead. He has a great roladex for China. And infact his company is called Asia Gateway. Anyway, David has offered his help to assist in the wealth Fund idea with China. Jeffrey rates David Stern highly …”</p><p>Mountbatten-Windsor has said he cut ties with Epstein in December 2010 and resigned from his trade envoy role in 2011. However, later correspondence challenges that account.</p><p>In October 2013, Epstein wrote to David Stern, by then an aide to Mountbatten-Windsor, suggesting the then-prince might wish to host dinner for a “very beautiful friend” visiting London. “Andrew might want to have her for a dinner,” Epstein wrote. In April 2017, Stern emailed Epstein about organising a “super” dinner at Windsor Castle, asking “who else” should be invited.</p><p>The UK police have said they are examining whether a criminal offence was committed in relation to the sharing of official material with Epstein. However, no arrest has been made in relation to sexual allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor.</p><p>In her memoir, one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre, wrote that she was forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor on three occasions, including once in the presence of Epstein and “eight other young girls”. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied the allegations and reached a financial settlement with Giuffre in 2022.</p><p>Epstein was later charged in 2019 with sex trafficking involving minors before his death by suicide in federal custody.</p><h2 id=\"an-empty-royal-lodge\">An empty Royal Lodge</h2><p>On October 30, 2025, Buckingham Palace announced that Mountbatten-Windsor and his family would vacate Royal Lodge amid renewed scrutiny over his association with Epstein after a tranche of files was released.</p><p>In principle, Mountbatten-Windsor was entitled to 488,000 pounds for the early surrender of his 75-year lease. However, a Crown Estate report concluded that the property’s condition was so decrepit that he would, in all likelihood, receive no compensation.</p><p>Mountbatten-Windsor left Royal Lodge in February 2026 and relocated to Wood Farm, on the Royal Family’s Sandringham estate, while arrangements were made for a more permanent residence nearby.</p><p>The stately home, bought in 1862 as a private royal retreat, spans roughly 80sq km (31 sq miles) of woodland, farms and villages in Norfolk. It remains one of the monarchy’s most expansive estates.</p><p>Royal Lodge now stands empty.</p></div></div></body></html>"

them to end up fighting on the front lines of Ukrainian battlefields.</p><p>In a statement released late on Wednesday, Kenyan officials said Festus Arasa Omwamba was being detained in Moyale, a town in the country’s north bordering Ethiopia.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The 33-year-old “is believed to be a key player in a more extensive human trafficking syndicate that exploits vulnerable individuals by promising them legitimate employment opportunities in European countries”, read a statement from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations on X. “However, upon arrival, these unsuspecting victims find themselves trapped in illegal and perilous jobs, stripping them of their dignity and safety.”</p><p>The suspect was in police custody, undergoing preparation for his “impending” court appearance, it added.</p><p>Quoting police spokesperson Michael Muchiri, NTV Kenya reported that Omwamba was arrested after arriving from Russia. He was detained for allegedly recruiting Kenyans into the Russian military, Muchiri said.</p><p></p><p>The arrest comes after Kenya’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) last week unveiled a report which said more than 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited “to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war”, with 89 currently on the front line, 39 hospitalised, and 28 missing in action.</p><p>A day after the NIS released its report, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/kenyan-families-demand-return-of-loved-ones-conscripted-by-russian-army\">dozens of families protested</a> in Nairobi, demanding the government take action against the network of officials and syndicates tricking locals into joining the war. Many are still awaiting news about their loved ones’ whereabouts and when they might return.</p><p>Meanwhile, other families are grieving the deaths of their sons and brothers.</p><p>The Russian embassy in Nairobi denies the allegations, calling them in a statement last week “misleading propaganda”. It added that it never issued visas to Kenyan citizens who sought to travel to Russia with the aim to fight in Ukraine. However, the embassy added that Moscow does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in its armed forces.</p><p>Kenya’s Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said he would travel to Russia in March to engage directly with the authorities and secure a safe return of Kenyans believed to be stranded there.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"fraudulent-schemes-to-lure-foreign-fighters\">Fraudulent ‘schemes’ to lure foreign fighters</h2><p>Reports of African men being fraudulently recruited and wilfully duped for work abroad to end up on the front lines in Ukraine have also surfaced from <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/did-ex-south-african-president-zumas-daughter-recruit-for-russias-war\">South Africa</a>, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa.</p><p>Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of using deception to recruit more than 1,700 Africans to join its war effort as the conflict <a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/russia-has-not-won-as-ukraine-war-enters-fifth-year-zelenskyy-says\">drags into a fifth year</a>.</p><p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha made the allegation during a news conference in Kyiv with his visiting Ghanaian counterpart, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa.

Madrid has banned a club member for performing the Nazi salute during the Champions League playoff second leg against Benfica, a game already overshadowed by <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/19/real-madrid-send-all-available-vinicius-evidence-to-uefa-in-racism-row\">allegations of racism</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Madrid said in a statement that it had “urgently” requested the club’s disciplinary committee to start an “immediate expulsion procedure” for the member, who was caught on TV cameras making the gesture in the stands before kickoff in the game on Wednesday evening.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">“This [club] member was identified by the club’s security staff moments after appearing on the broadcast and was immediately expelled from the Santiago Bernabeu stadium,” the club said.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Real Madrid condemns this type of gesture and expression that incites violence and hatred in sports and society.”</p><p class=\"p1\">The incident comes after the first leg of the playoff last week, which Madrid won 1-0, was <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/17/vinicius-earns-real-madrid-1-0-win-at-benfica-in-match-marred-by-racism-row\">marred by alleged racial abuse</a> aimed at Vinicius Junior by Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni.</p><p class=\"p2\">Prestianni, who denies the allegation, was <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/23/benficas-prestianni-gets-provisional-one-match-ban-for-vinicius-incident\">provisionally suspended</a> by UEFA for the game while the incident is under investigation, and Benfica had an appeal against his ban rejected earlier on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"p1\">Madrid midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni said his team’s <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/25/vinicius-hits-winner-as-real-madrid-eliminate-benfica-from-champions-league\">2-1 win over Benfica</a> to reach the Champions League last 16 was a “victory for everyone who is against racism”.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We didn’t play our best match of the season, that’s for sure,” Tchouameni told reporters after Wednesday’s game.</p><p class=\"p1\">“But I think there are things more important than this match, and more important than football.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Vinicius, who scored Madrid’s second goal at the Santiago Bernabeu, wrote on social media after the game that “the dance continues”, alongside a photo of a huge “no to racism” banner hung at the Bernabeu.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4339002\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4339002\" class=\"wp-caption

class=\"p1\">Real Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa said he was happy when Vinicius found the net.</p><p class=\"p1\">“[I reacted] with joy obviously, for the great goal he scored, and because it was him, he deserves it,” said Arbeloa.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Without [Kylian] Mbappe, I think it’s even more important, and I am very happy for him.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Before the game, Arbeloa said French superstar Mbappe would spend some time out as he recovers from a knee problem.</p><p class=\"p1\">“After yesterday’s session, we talked with the doctors, I spoke with him, and we felt the best thing was for him to stop, to recover 100 percent, and to come back in top shape, confident and without any discomfort for everything that’s coming, which is obviously very important,” Arbeloa told reporters after the match.</p><p class=\"p1\">Asked if it was discomfort or an injury, he said: “I think we can call it an injury, but it seems, and I hope, that it’s not a very serious injury, nothing major, and that he’ll be able to come back in a few days or weeks.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Campaigners have warned that in areas where ethnic minority communities are smaller and more geographically isolated, they face heightened risks, as visibility increases vulnerability.</p><p>A single mother working full time, Nabila has been documenting incidents of racism, supporting victims and organising meetings with local authorities.</p><p>She said she no longer feels safe in the place she calls home.</p><p>After being racially abused while walking through her favourite park, she stopped going there altogether. Women, she said, are increasingly changing their daily routines, constantly watching over their shoulders. Racism now permeates every aspect of their lives, she added.</p><p>At a women’s listening circle organised by Nabila in collaboration with the local authority at the Wat Tyler Centre, another Muslim woman, Zarka*, spoke about her experiences as a young mother in Basildon who wears the hijab.</p><p>After being told to “take that rag off your head” during the school run by a passer-by, she stopped taking her children to school for two weeks. Beyond verbal abuse, she described the cumulative effect of everyday hostility, from cars failing to stop at zebra crossings and hostile looks from passers-by.</p><h2 id=\"i-can-t-do-this-any-more-mum\">‘I can’t do this any more, Mum.’</h2><p>Hundreds of miles north, similar experiences are unfolding in Scottish classrooms.</p><p>Etka Marwaha’s daughter Anisa was seven when she first experienced racist taunting at her primary school in Glasgow.</p><p>Marwaha said Anisa became quiet and withdrawn. She was isolated on the playground and subjected to racial slurs. Months later, she broke down in tears in front of her mother, explaining the abuse she had suffered.</p><p>On multiple occasions, Marwaha contacted the school, urging them to take action, even offering her own support on understanding racism. But, she said, they failed in their duty of care, and the extent of the problem was kept hidden.</p><p>It went on for two years before Etka felt compelled to take her daughter out of the school.</p><p>“The plan was never to move her into a different school,” she told Al Jazeera. “But she was refusing to go to school; she would come home very, very upset. She was isolated.</p><p>“She was in tears, saying, “I can’t do this any more, Mum.’ So she made the decision, at that young age, that ‘I want to get out of here.'”</p><p>The girl’s new school is not in the catchment area, nor is there a direct bus to it, causing further inconvenience. But it has a zero-tolerance approach to racism, and Anisa is happier.</p><p>At her new school, Anisa can speak about her experiences of racism and how it made her feel.</p><p>The ordeal brought back painful memories for Marwaha’s own experiences at school.</p><p>“The racist bullying, for me, started at secondary school. You’d think times have changed, that people have been educated, but I think things have changed for the worse when a seven-year-old can openly make a racist comment and that’s accepted by society, and parents don’t address it.”</p><p>Sam*, a doctor in northwest Scotland with dual heritage children, said he has been surprised by the level of racism in local schools.</p><p>“There has been a clear normalising of racist jokes and name-calling. Every one of our kids has been affected,” he said. “Perhaps the biggest surprise is how few other students stand up against racism. When I was growing up, if someone was racist, they would be the person being socially excluded. Now, silence. It has forced us to look at moving out of the UK.”</p><h2 id=\"racism-is-out-of-control\">‘Racism is out of control’</h2><p>In the latest incident of alleged and potentially dangerous racism, a man walked into Manchester Central Mosque on Tuesday, reportedly with an axe and weapons. The man was arrested. There had been 2,000 worshippers in the mosque at the time, for the evening tarawih prayers during Ramadan.</p><p>Official figures underline the scale of the problem.</p><p>In October 2025, the UK Home Office revealed that the number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales had risen for the first time in three years, including increases in racially and religiously motivated offences.</p><p>Religious hate crimes against Muslims rose by 19 percent, with a <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/fears-anguish-and-frustration-in-a-northern-uk-town-hit-by-racist-riots\">spike</a> following the Southport murders and subsequent riots in mid-2025, the Home Office said.</p><p>The rise comes as hard-right politicians and activists, such as <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/could-far-right-reform-really-in-a-uks-general-election-now\">Reform leader Nigel Farage</a> and the Islamophobic activist <a href=\"/news/2026/2/26/uk-far-right-activist-tommy-robinson-talks-up-us-state-department-visit\">Tommy Robinson</a>, rail against immigration. According to recent YouGov polling, if a general election were held tomorrow, Reform would lead with 24 percent.</p><p>Shabna Begum, head of Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said, “Mainstream political and media actors have played in normalising and enabling racist narratives that have scapegoated migrants, people seeking asylum, Muslims and people of colour generally.”</p><p>In a report released last year, How Racism Affects Health, Runnymede highlighted the hypervigilance that people of colour have to operate with in order to guard their safety, and which causes long-term physiological damage, affecting life expectancy and mental health outcomes.</p><p>“For those that live in more disparate communities where they show up as minorities in a more visible way, that sense of threat is acute,” said Begum.</p><p>School suspensions for racist incidents have more than doubled in recent years, according to UK Department for Education data.</p><p>“Children as young as four are being sent home for racist behaviour,” Begum said. “This shows a society where racism is out of control, and that our school systems are failing to deal with the problem.</p><p>“They are making calculated decisions about where they will go, what travel routes they will take; withdrawing from regular social and community activities because they can no longer trust that those spaces will be safe for them.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
