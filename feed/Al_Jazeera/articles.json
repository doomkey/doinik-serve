Condom distribution in Nigeria dropped by 55 percent.</p><p>“The funding crisis has exposed the fragility of the progress we fought so hard to achieve,” said Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of UNAIDS.</p><p>“Behind every data point in this report are people … babies missed for HIV screening, young women cut off from prevention support, and communities suddenly left without services and care. We cannot abandon them.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite the financial crisis, UNAIDS said there were some positive trends emerging, including national and regional initiatives to bolster health programmes and treat the disease.</p><p>“Communities are rallying to support each other and the AIDS response. Although the most impacted countries are also some of the most indebted, limiting their ability to invest in HIV, governments have taken swift action to increase domestic funding where they can,” the report read.</p><p>“As a result, some countries have maintained or even increased the number of people receiving HIV treatment.”</p><p>The report recommends restructuring the international debt of lower-income countries and pausing their payments until 2030 to allow them to direct more resources to HIV care and prevention.</p><p>It also called for “inspiring innovation with prizes instead of patents, and treating health innovations as global public goods in times of pandemics”.</p><p>On top of dwindling funds, the report highlighted another challenge in the fight <a href=\"/features/2025/5/1/african-researchers-could-stop-hiv-but-us-aid-cuts-are-in-the-way\">against AIDS</a>: “a growing human rights crisis”.</p><p>“In 2025, for the first time since UNAIDS began monitoring punitive laws in 2008, the number of countries criminalizing same-sex sexual activity and gender expression increased,” it said.</p><p>“Globally, anti-gender and anti-rights movements are growing in influence and geographic reach, jeopardizing gains made to date on the rights of women and girls, people living with HIV and LGBTIQ+ people.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But that sentence did not begin immediately, to allow for appeals.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"bolsonaro-disputes-defeat\">Bolsonaro disputes defeat</h2><p>A member of Brazil’s far-right Liberal Party, known by the acronym PL, Bolsonaro was a former army captain who served nearly 27 years in the Chamber of Deputies before becoming president.</p><p>He led the country from 2019 to 2023. But critics accused him of manipulating his office to undermine Brazil’s voting system, and in June 2023, after he left office, Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court ruled he had <a href=\"/news/2023/6/30/brazil-court-votes-to-bar-bolsonaro-from-office-until-2030\">abused his power</a>.</p><p>Bolsonaro ran for re-election in the 2022 race, but in a run-off vote, he was <a href=\"/news/2022/10/30/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-narrowly-defeats-jair-bolsonaro\">narrowly defeated</a> by left-wing leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p><p>The right-wing leader, however, refused to publicly concede his loss, although <a href=\"/news/2022/11/2/brazil-election-it-is-over-bolsonaro-tells-supreme-court\">media reports indicated</a> he may have done so in private in a meeting with the Supreme Court.</p><p>Instead, Bolsonaro and his allies filed a legal challenge arguing the election results were riddled with “discrepancies”.</p><p>De Moraes, at the time, <a href=\"/news/2022/11/24/brazilian-judge-rejects-attempt-to-overturn-lula-election-victory\">rejected the complaint</a>, citing its “total absence of any evidence” and “bad faith” arguments. He also fined Bolsonaro’s team nearly $4.3m.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bolsonaro’s supporters held protests around the country, <a href=\"/news/2022/11/1/brazils-supreme-court-orders-removal-of-pro-bolsonaro-roadblocks\">blocking highways</a> and <a href=\"/news/2022/12/13/bolsonaro-supporters-attack-police-headquarters-in-brazil\">attacking police headquarters</a> in Brasilia.</p><p>The unrest came to a climax on <a href=\"/news/2023/1/8/bolsonaro-supporters-storm-government-buildings-in-brazil\">January 8, 2023</a>, a week after Lula was sworn in. Bolsonaro had briefly left the country, but his supporters converged on the Three Powers Plaza in Brasilia and stormed government buildings.</p><p>The riot precipitated several federal investigations. And in November 2024, the federal police <a href=\"/news/2024/11/26/brazil-ex-president-bolsonaro-plotted-election-coup-police-report\">issued an 884-page report</a> detailing evidence they said showed Bolsonaro and his allies had conspired to overturn the election results.</p><p>Recordings and testimony indicated that Bolsonaro and his codefendants had hoped to prompt a military uprising to prevent Lula from taking power and force new elections.</p><p>Some military officers allied with Bolsonaro even suggested a plot to poison Lula and shoot de Moraes, according to the police findings.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-flight-risk\">A flight risk?</h2><p>In February, prosecutors formally charged Bolsonaro, who was subsequently brought to trial.</p><p>But Bolsonaro’s defence repeatedly framed the charges as a political manoeuvre, and the ex-president himself has maintained his innocence.</p><p>United States President Donald Trump has also sought to pressure the Brazilian government to drop the case, imposing 50-percent tariffs on some of the country’s exports and calling the trial a “witch hunt”.</p><p>Since August, Bolsonaro has been under house arrest for fear he might attempt an escape abroad. Already, in 2024, he had spent several nights in the Hungarian embassy, stirring reports he could have been seeking diplomatic sanctuary with the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.</p><p>Police also recovered a letter reportedly addressed to Argentinian President Javier Milei, wherein Bolsonaro had claimed he was being persecuted and appealed for political asylum.</p><p>Earlier this month, Brazil’s Supreme Court <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/brazil-supreme-court-panel-rejects-bolsonaros-prison-sentence\">rejected Bolsonaro’s appeal</a> to overturn his prison sentence.</p><p>His defence team has since petitioned for the 27-year sentence <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/former-president-jair-bolsonaro-asks-to-serve-house-arrest-in-brazil\">to be served under house arrest</a> on humanitarian grounds. Bolsonaro was stabbed on the campaign trail in 2018, and he continues to suffer from abdominal problems.</p><p>But on Saturday, he was abruptly taken into police custody after he was found to have tampered with his ankle monitor.</p><p>Bolsonaro <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/brazils-supreme-court-panel-votes-to-keep-bolsonaro-in-police-custody\">reportedly told a court officer</a> that the medications he was taking left him feeling paranoid and had “hallucinatory” side effects. He denied being a flight risk.</p><p>De Moraes, however, signalled there were “very serious indications of a possible attempt to flee”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But experts say the story is more complicated than what packages of stuffing and tinned pumpkin can tell.</p><p>The retailer is advertising a lower price this year at $4 per person for 10 people compared with $7 per person for 8 people in 2024, a talking point the White House has embraced.</p><p>On Friday, Trump once again pointed that out: “We’ve got [prices] way down from last year,” Trump said while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. “Walmart said that Thanksgiving this year is exactly 25 percent less than last year.”</p><p>But the Bentonville, Arkansas–based retailer’s offer comes with caveats. The kit contains fewer items – 20 compared with 29 last year – and uses more generic products rather than name brands, a switch that typically lowers costs.</p><p>Companies like Walmart, Amazon and Kroger that offer Thanksgiving meal kits can shape what goes into their bundles and choose to absorb costs.</p><p>But official data actually suggests that prices are going up. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasts suggest turkey prices will be about 40 percent higher than this time last year, largely because of supply shortages tied to avian flu.</p><p>Data, however, on the price of turkey has varied depending on where you look. The American Farm Bureau estimates that the cost of turkey will be 16 percent less than this time last year. But, researchers at Purdue University found that the price will be up 25 percent compared with this time last year.</p><p>Prices for other staples have also risen – potatoes by 3.7 percent, rolls by 3.9 percent and apples by 5.3 percent – all outpacing the 3 percent annual inflation rate, government data show.</p><p> </p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4117939\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACIVE-THANKSGIVING-DINNER-COST-1763571536.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACIVE-THANKSGIVING-DINNER-COST-1763571536\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>New analysis from Groundwork Collaborative, The Century Foundation, and AFT found that another Thanksgiving staple, cranberry sauce, is up by 22 percent from this time last year.</p><p>CPI data shows wine prices declining due to domestic production, but imported European bottles face 15 percent increase.</p><p>Amid tariff-related uncertainty, rising wholesale costs, limited economic data and concerns over future social safety net programmes, Americans have grown more cautious in their spending. Consumer confidence continues to fall hitting its lowest level since April in its most recent reading published on Tuesday.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-prices-up\">Why are prices up?</h2><p>For poultry, the surge has little to do with economic policy. An ongoing strain of avian flu is limiting the supply of turkeys, with more than 2.2 million birds affected so far in 2025 and more than 600,000 confirmed infections in September. Even when only a single bird tests positive, farmers must slaughter the entire flock to contain the spread, further reducing supply.</p><p>“The current global H5N1 panzootic is the largest, most geographically widespread outbreak of avian flu ever recorded. The virus has affected more countries, more wild species, and more continents simultaneously than any previous avian influenza event,” Crystal Heath, the executive director of Our Honor, a veterinary advocacy organisation, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The virus started spreading through commercial poultry operations in the United States in February 2022,” Heath said.</p><p>For other staples, however, economic policy is a driving factor for the rise in prices.</p><p>Agricultural products, including tomatoes and potatoes, are up in price, driven by both import costs and the rising price of farm inputs – many of which are imported themselves, like the fertiliser needed to grow food and farm equipment like tractors.</p><p>“Tariffs on imported materials, including parts, fertiliser and other chemicals, are raising input costs for farmers. Those higher costs then get passed along, driving up the price of each unit and contributing to inflation,” Babak Hafezi, chief executive officer at Hafezi Capital, an international consulting firm, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Labour shortage drives up costs of agricultural products like apples, potatoes and tomatoes, which have seen a surge in prices, Hafezi said.</p><p>“The thing is, when fruit hangs on the trees with no one to pick it, it never makes it into the market. But the demand is still there, so it gets filled by imports. I visited a lemon farm in California and saw fruit everywhere, lemons just dropping to the ground and rotting because there weren’t enough workers to harvest them.”</p><p>Tariffs have pushed up the cost of canned goods as well.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/9/3/campbells-sees-tariff-hit-in-year-ahead-as-economic-uncertainty-looms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Campbell’s</a>, one of the nation’s largest producers of prepared foods, said earlier this year it would need to raise prices because tariffs increased the cost of steel used in its cans.</p><p>“The impact of tariffs, and to whatever extent immigration issues are affecting agricultural workers or people in meat-processing plants, is still being felt. There are a lot of exogenous shocks continuing to hit the system. So this isn’t just, ‘Hey, we had this huge run-up in inflation during COVID and prices just haven’t come down’,” Matthew Higgins, professor of management at Tulane University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Last week, Trump rolled back tariffs on some foods and other consumer goods. While the change immediately affects imports and wholesale goods, experts say that does not mean that consumers may see lower prices this Thanksgiving or even at all.</p><p>“The probability of the prices massively decreasing is very low unless there is some major disruption like a recession, and people can no longer consume at the level they were,” Hafezi said.</p><p>There is a historical precedent for this. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, producers raised prices because of supply-chain strains, and retailers followed suit. But even after those strains eased, consumers had already shown they would tolerate higher prices, leaving grocery stores with little incentive to reduce them.</p><p>That came to light in a 2024 report by the Federal Trade Commission, which outlined elevated prices at grocery stores.</p><p>“Some firms seem to have used rising costs as an opportunity to further hike prices to increase their profits, and profits remain elevated even as supply chain pressures have eased,” the report said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"spending-pressures\">Spending pressures</h2><p>Regardless of the cause, the strain on consumers preparing for the holidays is intensifying, including on the back of the US government shutdown that ended recently.</p><p>City Harvest, a New York City–based organisation that partners with soup kitchens and food distribution centres, told Al Jazeera it has seen an increase in demand in the weeks following the shutdown.</p><p>“A lot of federal workers that were visiting the pop-up distributions were people seeking food assistance for the first time, so that was definitely a new population of people that were looking for support,” Jenna Harris, associate director of donor relations at City Harvest, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>City Harvest also noted that the city’s soup kitchens and food pantries are experiencing their highest number of visitors on record.</p><p>“We do see that about 67 percent of New Yorkers that visit food pantries have a job, sometimes multiple jobs, so it’s really just showing that the rising cost of food is an issue,” Harris added.</p><p>This trend is not new – visits have risen 85 percent since 2019, according to FeedNYC, but new challenges are compounding the pressure. Families are navigating looming changes to the <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/25/will-millions-of-low-income-americans-lose-food-stamps-during-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SNAP</a> programme and uncertainty about healthcare costs in 2026. Across the country, states have begun notifying recipients of new requirements and giving them three months to comply, or they could lose benefits altogether.</p><p>Similarly, with<a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/us-shutdown-ends-what-happens-now-when-will-services-resume\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies still up for debate</a>, approximately 2.2 million Americans could lose their health insurance premiums if they are not extended, according to the Congressional Budget Office, leaving low- and middle-income families struggling to maintain coverage.</p><p>“There’s tremendous uncertainty, and as you move down the socioeconomic ladder, that uncertainty only increases. To some extent, you’d expect people to be more cautious with holiday spending,” Higgins added.</p><p>“What we’re seeing is a massive bifurcation of the American economy. The ultra-wealthy, with access to inflation-adjusted and future-oriented assets, are doing extremely well, while the middle and lower classes are struggling. Companies serving the upper and upper-middle classes are likely to thrive, whereas those catering to the rest of the market will have to focus on value-oriented products,” Hafezi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel completely blocked aid to the Strip from March this year, claiming that Hamas was stealing aid provided by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. Israel did not provide any evidence for this and also blocked UNRWA workers from entering the Strip from February.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>While the UNRWA network operated about 400 sites across the Strip before that, the GHF, guarded by armed US private security contractors, set up only <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/5/29/visual-guide-to-how-the-gaza-aid-distribution-turmoil-unfolded\">four “mega-sites”</a> – three in southern Gaza and one near Gaza City – to distribute food and other aid to Gaza’s population of about two million Palestinians.</p><p>Furthermore, since the organisation began operations in Gaza in May, Israeli forces and some US contractors have routinely opened fire on Palestinians arriving to receive aid. Disorganisation around the sites has caused large crowds to gather, and some people have suffocated or died in stampedes.</p><p>While GHF Executive Director John Acree said in a statement on Monday that the organisation delivered the “only aid operation that reliably and safely provided free meals directly to Palestinian people in Gaza”, more than 2,000 aid seekers have been crushed to death or killed by gunfire, according to UN figures.</p><p>Here is how the GHF “mission” to Gaza unfolded this year:</p><p><strong>May 26 –</strong> GHF issues a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/26/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-to-launch-aid-deliveries-despite-losing-chief\">statement</a> announcing it will begin direct aid delivery inside the battered enclave, hours after its executive director, Jake Wood, resigned, citing concerns about the agency’s independence. The UN and other aid agencies refuse to work with GHF, warning that requiring Palestinians to gather at a few centralised aid points would put people at risk and undermine other aid efforts.</p><p><strong>May 27</strong> – GHF begins operating in Gaza. Israeli forces open fire on thousands of Palestinians attempting to receive food in southern Gaza’s Rafah area, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens. Aid seekers are forced to clamber over fences and <a href=\"/gallery/2025/5/27/photos-thousands-of-palestinians-crowd-a-controversial-aid-centre-in-gaza\">push through packed crowds</a> to reach life-saving supplies. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric says seeing thousands of Palestinians storming the aid site is “<a href=\"/news/2025/5/27/heartbreaking-chaos-in-gaza-as-starving-palestinians-seek-us-israeli-aid\">heartbreaking</a>” as the chaos underscores the staggering level of hunger gripping Gaza. Gaza’s Government Media Office calls the incident a “<a href=\"/news/2025/5/27/heartbreaking-chaos-in-gaza-as-starving-palestinians-seek-us-israeli-aid\">deliberate massacre</a> and a full-fledged war crime.”</p><p><strong>May 29</strong> – Israeli forces open fire at an aid point in southern Gaza, killing 10 people and injuring dozens. Shortly after, multiple <a href=\"/news/2025/5/29/two-dead-after-crowds-rush-un-aid-warehouse-amid-gaza-hunger-crisis\">explosions</a> are reported near another aid centre on the Netzarim Corridor, which divides northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip. It is not clear what caused the blasts, and there are no reports of casualties.</p><p><strong>May 30</strong> – Israeli forces <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/5/30/live-israel-forces-new-displacement-in-north-gaza-as-strikes-intensify\">open fire</a> on civilians waiting to collect food at a GHF distribution point on Salah al-Din Street in central Gaza, wounding at least 20 people.</p><p><strong>June 1</strong> – Israeli tanks <a href=\"/news/2025/6/1/israel-kills-32-palestinians-waiting-for-food-at-us-backed-gaza-aid-sites\">kill at least 32 Palestinians</a> waiting to get food at two aid distribution sites in Gaza, leaving more than 200 others injured.</p><p><strong>June 3</strong> – UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the killing and injuring of Palestinian aid seekers is “unacceptable” and calls for an independent investigation after Israeli forces open fire close to an aid distribution site in Rafah. Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least 27 Palestinians have been killed in the incident and 90 injured.</p><p><strong>June 8</strong> – At least 13 Palestinians are killed, and more than 150 are injured when Israeli troops and US security contractors open fire on crowds waiting for food near two aid distribution sites in Gaza, one east of Rafah and another near the Wadi Gaza Bridge. Gaza’s Government Media Office accuses Israel of turning distribution sites into “<a href=\"/news/2025/6/8/gaza-aid-sites-branded-human-slaughterhouses-under-deadly-israeli-fire\">human slaughterhouses</a>”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>July 16</strong> – At least 21 Palestinians are killed at a GHF aid distribution centre in southern Gaza.

At least 15 people died of suffocation, while others were shot. Twenty-four-year-old Mohammed Abedin, who survived the incident, told Al Jazeera that they were “<a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/suffocation-stampede-death-tragedy-at-gazas-aid-centre\">shot at like animals</a>”.</p><p><strong>July 22</strong> – The United Nations says the number of Palestinians killed while trying to access food in Gaza from GHF distribution points has <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/un-says-israeli-military-killed-over-1000-seeking-gaza-aid-since-late-may\">topped 1,000</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3848760\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3848760\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3848760\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/INTERACTIVE-Israel-Gaza-Aid-under-tank-fire-july-21-2025-1753099771.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Israel - Gaza -Aid under tank fire - july 21, 2025-1753099771\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3848760\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p><strong>August 1</strong> – A former contractor for GHF, Anthony Aguilar, tells Al Jazeera about what he describes as the <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/8/1/hear-from-the-former-guard-blowing-the-whistle-on-ghf-aid-sites-in-gaza\">deadly and unprofessional practices</a> he witnessed firsthand at aid distribution sites in Gaza.

against a backdrop of poor public finances and widespread public discontent with the governing Labour Party.</p><p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces the onerous task of restoring the public finances to health, while upholding a number of pledges that leave her with little manoeuvring room on taxes and spending.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Economists say that Reeves will have little choice but to compromise on her plans as she faces what a leading think tank has dubbed an “impossible trilemma”.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-budget-so-challenging-for-the-uk-government\">Why is this budget so challenging for the UK government?</h2><p>The UK has struggled with weak economic growth, high inflation and a rapidly expanding national debt for years.</p><p>After Germany, the UK has had the weakest economic performance among the Group of Seven (G7) countries in the post-COVID era.</p><p>GDP grew just 1.7 percent from the final quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2024, compared with 8.7 percent in the US, 5.1 percent in Canada, and 4.6 percent in Italy, according to government data.</p><p>While Labour promised to revive the economy upon its election in a landslide victory in July last year, economic conditions continue to be difficult.</p><p>While the economy had a strong start to 2025 – putting the UK on track to be the best-performer in the G7 after the US – growth slowed to a meagre 0.1 percent in the quarter ending in September.</p><p>At the same time, the UK’s borrowing costs have soared, with the interest rate on long-term government bonds in September hitting its highest level in nearly 30 years.</p><p>In October alone, the UK government borrowed 17.4 billion pounds to cover the gap between tax revenues and spending.</p><p>Reeves, whose Labour Party campaigned against spending cuts after years of austerity policies under the Conservatives, has made the already difficult task of drafting her budget more challenging with a number of self-imposed pledges.</p><p>Reeves’s “fiscal rules” dictate that the exchequer should balance day-to-day spending and reduce the national debt by 2029-30 – all without raising income tax, VAT or national insurance.</p><p>Reeves raised taxes by about 40 billion pounds ($52.6bn) in last year’s budget – the biggest hike in revenue-raising measures in decades – in what she cast as a one-off dose of pain needed to put the government’s finances on an even keel.</p><p>Despite the tax hikes, Reeves has once again found herself facing a major shortfall between spending and revenues amid the rising cost of government borrowing.</p><p>National Institute of Economic and Social Research, one of the UK’s top think tanks, estimated earlier this year that Reeves would need to find another 41.2 billion pounds to meet her targets – leaving her with the “impossible trilemma” of higher taxes, reduced spending or amended fiscal rules.</p><p>Other estimates, including more recent assessments based on improved economic data, have put the fiscal “black hole” closer to 20 billion pounds ($26.3bn).</p><p>“I do think it is a particularly challenging budget in that the Government is caught between their commitments to avoiding deep cuts to public services, not raising taxes for working people, and self-imposed fiscal rules and a jittery bond market,” Jasper Kenter, an economics professor at Aberystwyth University in Wales, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“They are also suffering from major hangovers from the last government, who put in place significant tax cuts to national insurance shortly before they left as a failed electoral stunt.”</p><p>After backtracking on an income tax hike that would have broken Labour’s manifesto pledge, Reeves is expected to announce other revenue-raising measures, including a tax on properties worth more than 2 million pounds ($2.6m) and a freeze on adjustments to the income tax thresholds.</p><p>In the lead-up to the budget, Labour’s standing in the polls has plummeted, falling far behind the right-wing populist Reform UK.</p><p>Costas Milas, an economics professor at the University of Liverpool, said Reeves had exacerbated the UK’s economic difficulties with conflicting signals in the run-up to the budget.</p><p>“Investors are unwilling to invest in the economy until they see what economic measures she will actually implement,” Milas told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Consumers are also worried and therefore hesitant to consume and spend, at least until they see what extra taxes they will be faced with.”</p><h2 id=\"why-has-the-uk-economy-struggled-in-recent-years\">Why has the UK economy struggled in recent years?</h2><p>Some of the UK’s difficulties stem from factors shared by almost all developed economies, in particular, falling birth rates and rising welfare bills.</p><p>But more so than many of its peers, the UK has had a longstanding problem with low labour productivity growth.</p><p>In 2023, the UK’s labour productivity (GDP per hour worked) placed it fourth among the G7 nations.</p><p>However, productivity growth in the UK has lagged behind its peers in recent decades.</p><p>GDP per hour worked in the UK grew only about 6 percent from 2007 to 2022, according to OECD data, compared to 17 percent in the United States, 12 percent in Japan and 11 percent in Germany.</p><p>Economists have blamed the productivity gap on years of chronic underinvestment resulting from austerity policies introduced in the wake of the 2007-08 global financial crisis.</p><p>According to a PwC analysis of World Bank figures, the UK’s investment spending from 2017 to 2021 was equal to 18 percent of GDP, compared with 25 percent of GDP in Japan, 23 percent in France and 21 percent in the US.</p><p>Brexit has been widely blamed for exacerbating the post-financial crisis trend.</p><p>The UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the UK’s exit from the bloc will reduce long-term productivity by 4 percent.</p><p>Jonathan Daniel Portes, an economist at King’s College London, said the UK needed to tackle long-run structural problems, including by undertaking “pro-growth tax reform” and “reversing anti-growth policies on immigration and universities”.</p><p>“I expect significant tax rises but no major tax reform. I don’t think it will make a huge difference,” Portes told Al Jazeera, describing his expectations for the budget.</p><p>Michael Ben-Gad, a professor of economics at City St George’s, University of London, said the UK could benefit from tinkering with the tax system, but it will be unable to avoid reforms to its welfare state over the longer term.</p><p>“Pay-as-you-go national pension schemes were designed for a growing population or at least one that was stable,” Ben-Gad told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“No one anticipated either below replacement fertility or the lengthening of life-spans when modern welfare states were introduced.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Right now, the threats to our constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but right here at home,” the video added.</p><p>“Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders.”</p><p>In response to the video, the Pentagon has announced an investigation into alleged breaches of military law by Kelly, a former navy captain, which is an unusual step against retired military personnel.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://jsc.defense.gov/portals/99/documents/section4punitivearticles.pdf?ver=2017-07-19-103116-810\">US Manual for Courts-Martial</a>, which outlines conduct in the military: “An order requiring the performance of a military duty or act may be inferred to be lawful and it is disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate.”</p><p>However, that inference does not apply if an order is contrary to the constitution or US law, is given by an officer without the authority to issue it or is “patently illegal”, such as ordering the commission of a crime.</p><p>Here’s everything we know:</p><figure id=\"attachment_4129704\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4129704\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4129704\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/afp_69257c201c3d-1764064288.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"(FILES) Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (L) and husband US Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat from Arizona, stand on stage during the Harris-Walz Campaign Election Eve rally and concert at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix, Arizona, on November 4, 2024.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4129704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband, US Senator Mark Kelly [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-is-mark-kelly\">Who is Mark Kelly?</h2><p>The Arizona senator is a former senior navy officer and pilot who flew combat missions in the first Gulf War.</p><p>In 2001, Kelly became an astronaut and flew four space shuttle missions over a decade, two of which were as commander.</p><p>In 2011, Kelly retired as a captain, a rank just below rear admiral.</p><p>In his first Senate campaign in 2020, Kelly finished the term of Republican Senator John McCain, who died in office. Two years later, Kelly was re-elected to a full term. In the Senate, he has focused on national security and the military.</p><h2>Is Kelly right about ‘illegal orders’?</h2><p>According to Bruce Fein, a lawyer specialising in constitutional and international law and who served as Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of Justice under former President Ronald Reagan, Kelly was “simply echoing the law”.</p><p>“[For example] a member of the United States Armed Forces is required to disobey a clearly illegal order of a superior. There is no ‘following orders’ defence,” Fein told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Lt William Calley was convicted of war crimes for the [1968] My Lai Massacre against civilians in Vietnam. His ‘following orders’ defence was rejected,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-pentagon-investigation-about-then\">What is the Pentagon investigation about, then?</h2><p>In a statement posted on X on Monday, the Pentagon said it had received “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly, suggesting that the video had interfered with the “loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces”.</p><p>“A thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures. This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality,” the statement read.</p><p>“All service members are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice] to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful. A service member’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order,” it added.</p><p>On the same day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X that the “seditious six” lawmakers in the video were “despicable, reckless, and false”.</p><p>“Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of ‘good order and discipline.’ Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion – which only puts our warriors in danger,” Hegseth said, adding that only Kelly falls under the Department of Defense’s jurisdiction.</p><p>“Kelly’s conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately,” Hegseth said.</p><p>While all six lawmakers served in the military or intelligence agencies, Kelly is the only person to have formally retired from the military, meaning he can still be recalled for active duty or face a court martial for misconduct.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-kelly-said-about-the-action-against-him\">What has Kelly said about the action against him?</h2><p>In a post on X on Monday, Kelly wrote that he had “sworn an oath to the Constitution in 1986”.</p><p>“I’ve upheld it through 25 years of service and every day since I retired. If [President Donald] Trump’s trying to intimidate me, it won’t work. I’ve given too much to our country to be silenced by bullies who care more about power than the Constitution,” he said.</p><p>In a post last week, Kelly wrote he “had a missile blow up next to my airplane, been shot at dozens of times by anti-aircraft fire, and launched into orbit – all for my country”.</p><p>“I never thought I’d see a President call for my execution. Trump doesn’t understand the Constitution, and we’re all less safe for it,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said\">What has Trump said?</h2><p>In a post on his Truth Social platform last week, the president wrote that the video was “really bad, and Dangerous to our Country”.</p><p>“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!” he said. In a separate post, Trump added that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH”.</p><p>But a day after his comments, Trump told Fox News that he wasn’t threatening death but the Democrats were in “serious trouble”.</p><p>When asked how far the Trump administration could realistically take its action against Kelly, Fein said it could “harass Kelly with a spurious investigation or charges”.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-trump-administration-focusing-on-this\">Why is the Trump administration focusing on this?</h2><p>The fury over the video comes at a time when the US military is conducting strikes on <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/major-us-carrier-arrives-in-caribbean-as-trump-puts-venezuela-in-crosshairs\">vessels</a> that the Trump administration has alleged are carrying drugs.</p><p>The strikes have killed at least 83 people in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.</p><p>At the end of October, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee called on the Department of Justice (DOJ) to hand over all legal opinions on the legality of the military’s strikes.</p><p>“Summarily killing criminal suspects is prohibited under domestic and international law in both peacetime and wartime,” they wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi that the Reuters news agency saw.</p><p>But two weeks ago, a memo from the DOJ stated that service members could not be prosecuted for the killings.</p><p>“The strikes were ordered consistent with the laws of armed conflict, and as such are lawful orders. Military personnel are legally obligated to follow lawful orders and, as such, are not subject to prosecution for following lawful orders,” The Hill, a US political website, reported, citing a statement from a DOJ spokesperson.</p></div></div></body></html>"
