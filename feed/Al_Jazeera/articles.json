the Taliban authorities must face the stark truth that if they are ever to be accepted internationally, they must respect the rights of women to education and sport.</p><p>Asghari, who at 31 is living in exile for the second time, does, however, favour engaging with Afghanistan’s rulers.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span

barred women from most jobs and public services – and from playing sport.</p><p>Asghari, who in 2018 became Afghanistan’s first ever IOC member, accepts her “situation is quite challenging” and beating the drum for Afghan women’s sport “does require certain precautions”.</p><p>Nevertheless, the former international basketball player, like many top Afghan women athletes, is undeterred in speaking out about the treatment of women under the Taliban authorities.</p><p>“The reality is that when you take a public stand for women’s rights you do become a target, but I believe strongly in communication and engagement,” she said in an email interview with the AFP news agency.</p><p>“As long as the Taliban remain the reality on the ground in Afghanistan, we cannot afford to waste time doing nothing.</p><p>“In my role, I have tried to help smooth the discussions between the IOC and those currently in control, focusing on the sport rights of women and girls and particularly primary school girls who are still inside Afghanistan.”</p><p>Asghari, one of four children born to a retired professional makeup artist mother and a father who was a manager in the Afghan Olympic national committee, says the “conversations are not always easy”.</p><p>“They are not about legitimising any government,” she said.</p><p>“But they are very important for creating tangible opportunities for future generations of young boys and girls in Afghanistan.”</p><h2 id=\"i-hope-fifa-can-align-with-ioc-talks-with-the-taliban\">‘I hope FIFA can align with IOC talks with the Taliban’</h2><p>With Afghan sportswomen spread around the globe, putting together teams is complex.</p><p>However, a women’s football team, Afghan Women United, made up of players based in Europe and Australia, <a

competed in FIFA Unites: Women’s Series 2025</a> in Morocco.</p><p>“This support for athletes outside Afghanistan is just the first step, and I hope FIFA can align with the IOC’s ongoing talks with the Taliban,” she said.</p><p>Asghari, who had been involved in the “project” for more than a year, hopes the message gets through to Afghanistan’s rulers.</p><p>“The Taliban were given the country and now they’re trying to maintain power while ignoring fundamental human rights, particularly for women,” she said.</p><p>“It’s very difficult for them to continue ruling Afghanistan this way in the long term, and the Taliban need to understand that their international acceptance is directly linked to respecting human rights, including the rights of women to education and sport.”</p><p>Asghari, who attended the recent Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh, where Afghan women and men competed, said she hoped for “small openings” in the Taliban’s stance.</p><p>“I also believe that if we can find small openings — like developing sport in primary schools where girls are still allowed to attend up to sixth grade — we should take them,” she said.</p><p>“This isn’t about accepting the Taliban’s restrictions, it’s about not abandoning the girls and women of Afghanistan.</p><p>“We have to work with reality, while continuing to push for fundamental change.”</p><p>Asghari says even achieving small breakthroughs like that could prevent the long-term harm women suffered during the Taliban’s first spell in power, from 1996 to 2001.</p><p>She said she had seen the impact on her return from her first period of exile, in Iran.</p><p>“What concerns me deeply is that we’re creating another lost generation,” she said.</p><p>“I remember when I was in sixth grade aged 12, and there was a 20-year-old woman sitting next to me in the same class because she couldn’t go to school during the previous Taliban era.</p><p>“I didn’t know how to communicate with her and it was difficult for both of us, but especially for her because she had lost so many years.</p><p>“I cannot accept seeing this happen again. That’s why even small opportunities matter so much.”</p><p>Asghari retains hope despite the bleak outlook and believes in “continued engagement and dialogue” with the Taliban.</p><p>“The future of Afghanistan is this young generation. We need to give them every opportunity we can, no matter how small, and never, ever give up on them.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

UN officials have warned the attacks amount to “war crimes”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Khodr explained that the attacks form part of a sustained military pressure campaign.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“This is all part of military pressure on Hezbollah to force it to disarm,” she said. Israel wants the group “to give up its strategic weapons, its long-range weapons, its precision-guided missiles, its drones” which the Israeli military believes are stored in the Bekaa Valley and further inland.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But Hezbollah has sharply refused to relinquish its arsenal as long as Israel bombards and occupies parts of Lebanon. The group “doesn’t want to give up its weapons because it would view that as surrender”, Khodr added, noting that “Hezbollah and Lebanon do not have the upper hand. Israel enjoys air superiority.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Tensions escalated further two weeks ago when Israel bombed Beirut’s southern suburbs, killing Hezbollah’s top military commander, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/who-was-haytham-ali-tabatabai-hezbollah-official-killed-by-israel\">Haytham Ali Tabatabai</a>. The group has yet to respond, but said it will do so at the right time.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The attacks come as Lebanon and Israel recently dispatched civilian envoys to a committee monitoring their ceasefire for the first time in decades, a move aimed at expanding diplomatic engagement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">However, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem criticised Lebanon’s decision to send former Ambassador Simon Karam to the talks, calling it a “free concession” to Israel.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Lebanese officials have expressed frustration over Israel’s near-daily attacks.</p><p>“It is one of the reasons why Lebanon agreed to sit down for face-to-face talks with the Israelis,” Khodr said, “engaging in diplomatic talks that are seen as very sensitive in Lebanon, in the hopes that it would avoid war.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">President Joseph Aoun said last week that Lebanon “has adopted the option of negotiations with Israel” aimed at stopping the continued attacks, while Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called for a more robust verification mechanism to monitor both Israeli violations and Lebanese army efforts to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure.</p><p>“But the US ambassador to Lebanon, Michel Issa, made it clear a few days ago that even though Lebanon is sitting down in a room with a longtime enemy, it does not mean that the Israeli attacks will stop,” Khodr said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It will enable officials to collect up to five years of social media history from travellers from certain visa-waiver countries before they can enter the country.</p><p>The proposal states that this mandatory social media history disclosure is in line with Executive Order 14161, signed by Trump in January 2025.</p><p>That order, titled “Protecting the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats”, required US government agencies to increase their vetting of foreign nationals entering the country.</p><h2 id=\"who-would-this-affect\">Who would this affect?</h2><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">The requirement will apply to travellers using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) under the US’s Visa Waiver Program.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">The Visa Waiver Program permits citizens of <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">42 countries</a> – including the United Kingdom, Germany, Qatar, Greece, Malta, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Israel and South Korea – to travel to the US for tourism or business purposes for up to 90 days.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">At present, the ESTA automatically screens applicants and grants travel approval without requiring an in-person interview at a US embassy or consulate, unlike standard visa applications. Applicants are required to provide a more limited set of information, such as their parents’ names, current email address and details of any past criminal record.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">Since 2016, the ESTA has included an optional question asking travellers to disclose their social media information.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-this-work\" data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">How would this work?</h2><p>Once the proposal comes into effect, visitors will be required to provide CBP with a list of their social media handles or usernames used over the past five years.</p><p>The visitors would not have to give CBP their social media log‑in credentials or passwords. They will use this information to review the publicly accessible information on the social media profiles of these visitors.</p><p>The new notice also states that travellers will have to provide additional personal information, including all telephone numbers used over the past five years and email addresses used over the previous 10 years.</p><p data-start=\"1488\" data-end=\"1872\">Authorities also said they plan to add what are described as “high-value data fields” to the ESTA application “when feasible”. These will include metadata from electronically submitted photographs, extensive personal details about applicants’ family members, such as their places of birth and telephone numbers used over the past five years, as well as biometric information, including fingerprints, DNA and iris data.</p><p data-start=\"1488\" data-end=\"1872\">The announcement did not include information about what the administration will be looking for within social media accounts of visitors or why it is asking for that information.</p><p id=\"it-is-unclear-when-the-proposal-would-take-effect\">It is unclear when the proposal will take effect. However, the public now has 60 days to submit comments about the proposed changes before they are finalised, the notice in the Federal Register states.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-us-government-doing-this-now\">Why is the US government doing this now?</h2><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">Travellers from non-Visa Waiver Program countries have been required to disclose their social media handles since 2019. This is an extension of that.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">That measure was first introduced by the Trump administration during his first term as president, and was kept in place during President Joe Biden’s tenure.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">The CBP and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have been seeking to significantly broaden the existing social media disclosure rules for some time.</p><p data-start=\"169\" data-end=\"451\">“USCIS has proposed to extend the social media disclosure requirement to applicants for other immigration benefits as well – up through naturalisation,” Caroline DeCell, a senior staff attorney and legislative adviser at Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In June this year, the State Department also announced that it now requires all F, M and J visa applicants to make their social media profiles public as part of enhanced screening to identify national security threats.</p><p>Most social media platforms allow users to either keep their profiles private or make them public.</p><p>Private profiles can only be viewed by people actively added as friends – this includes all posts, photos, videos or other content posted by the profile user. Content posted on public profiles can be viewed by anyone.</p><p>This relates to student visas for those enrolled in accredited colleges, or in vocational or technical, non‑academic educational programmes. It also covers exchange visitors participating in approved exchange study programmes.</p><p>“A US visa is a privilege, not a right,” the State Department statement from June said.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-privacy-implications-of-this\">What are the privacy implications of this?</h2><p>DeCell said that if the CBP proposal is approved, the privacy implications would be “significant” as it will require disclosure not only of social media handles, but also of all phone numbers used in the past five years and email addresses used in the past 10 years, as well as biometric data.</p><p>“Even travellers who post publicly on social media typically maintain some expectation of obscurity, if not privacy, online. And those who use pseudonymous social media handles or email addresses would be directly deprived of their online anonymity,” she said.</p><p>DeCell added that if the USCIS proposal to seek this information for all immigration visa and citizenship applicants is also approved, besides the CBP proposal for travellers from visa waiver countries, “then nearly every non-US citizen who seeks to enter or remain in the United States would be subject to indefinite social media surveillance by the US government”.</p><p>Under the USCIS proposal, US citizens who petition in support of their relatives’ immigration applications would also be subjected to this “surveillance”.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-implications-for-freedom-of-speech\">What are the implications for freedom of speech?</h2><p>The First Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion, speech, the press and peaceful assembly.</p><p>However, DeCell warned that this expanding system will deter free speech online and many foreigners will be put off from travelling to the US, whether for work or leisure.</p><p>“It’s a massive blow to First Amendment freedoms,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Anyone doubting the intentional lethality of coercive economic measures would do well to recall the 1996 <a href=\"/opinions/2022/3/25/lets-remember-madeleine-albright-as-who-she-really-was\">response</a> of then-US ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright to the estimate that half a million Iraqi children had thus far perished as a result of the US sanctions regime: “We think the price is worth it.”</p><p>Sanctions on Venezuela were then drastically intensified by Trump in 2019, with an eye to assisting <a href=\"/tag/juan-guaido/\">Juan Guaido</a> – the little-known right-wing character who had spontaneously appointed himself interim president of Venezuela – in his efforts to oust Maduro.</p><p>Those efforts were unsuccessful, and Guaido ended up in Miami, but sanctions continued to wreak devastating havoc. In March 2019, Trump’s former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href=\"https://2017-2021-translations.state.gov/2019/03/11/remarks-to-the-press/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">boasted</a> eloquently to the press of the effectiveness of economic warfare: “The circle is tightening. The humanitarian crisis is increasing by the hour … You can see the increasing pain and suffering that the Venezuelan people are suffering from.”</p><p>Indeed, while the official narrative is that sanctions are meant to target the powers that be, it is the general public that pays the price. In the years following Guaido’s failed auto-election, the “suffering that the Venezuelan people are suffering from” became ever more apparent, and by 2020, former UN Special Rapporteur Alfred de Zayas <a href=\"https://venezuelanalysis.com/sanctions-kill/\">estimated</a> that 100,000 Venezuelans had died on account of sanctions.</p><p>In 2021, UN expert Alena Douhan reported that the economic blockade had rendered more than 2.5 million Venezuelans severely food insecure. This is to say nothing of <a href=\"/video/the-stream/2023/6/13/how-are-us-sanctions-affecting-life-in-venezuela\">outbreaks of previously controlled diseases</a>, stunted growth among children, and shortages of water and electricity.</p><p>It can meanwhile be safely filed under the “can’t make this sh*t up” category that, at the very moment he is going after alleged narco-traffickers in Venezuela, Trump chose to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/02/politics/juan-orlando-hernandez-pardon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pardon</a> Juan Orlando Hernandez, the right-wing former narco-president of Honduras who was <a href=\"/opinions/2024/3/17/the-criminal-hypocrisy-of-hernandezs-drug-conviction-in-a-us-court\">convicted</a> last year in a US federal court.</p><p>In October, Trump <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/23/venezuela-a-not-so-covert-cia-disaster-in-the-making\">authorised</a> the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela – the same CIA, mind you, that has been <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/23/venezuela-a-not-so-covert-cia-disaster-in-the-making\">up to its eyeballs</a> in the drug trade since forever. Now with the tanker hijacking, the administration has underscored its acute disregard for anything resembling civilised diplomacy.</p><p>The other day, I spoke with a young Venezuelan man whom I met in the <a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/22/the-darien-gap-closure-border-theatre-in-the-jungle\">Darien Gap</a> in 2023 as he made his way towards the US – one of millions of Venezuelans forced to leave home in search of a life that is economically sustainable.</p><p>After almost drowning in the river as he crossed from Mexico into the US, he was detained for a month and then provisionally released into the country. Two years later, he was captured by ICE agents in California, detained for several more months, and then deported to Caracas.</p><p>When I asked him his thoughts on Trump’s current machinations in Venezuela, he said simply: “I have no words.”</p><p>And as the US barrels towards another surreal war armed with blatant lies, words are indeed often hard to come by.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Africa’s forests and woodlands have historically served as a carbon sink. Now, they are contributing to widening the global greenhouse gas emissions gap that needs to be filled to stay within the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the report stated.</p><p>The 2015 Paris Agreement is a treaty between 196 countries acting to mitigate <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/un-climate-talks-go-into-overtime-as-divisions-over-fossil-fuels-persist\">climate change</a> and to keep the world’s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-the-study-found\">What has the study found?</h2><p>In short, Africa’s forests are facing “increasing pressures” which have led to a decline in their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Currently, Africa’s forests are responsible for about one-fifth of global carbon removal. The largest of the continent’s forests is the Congo rainforest – the second largest in the world after the Amazon, and often dubbed the “lungs of Africa”.</p><p>The report found that between 2011 and 2017, Africa’s forests lost 106 million tonnes in biomass – living organisms such as plants – each year. This means their ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere has been severely reduced.</p><p>The worst-affected areas were reportedly the tropical broadleaf forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and other parts of West Africa.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-caused-this\">What has caused this?</h2><p>Carbon output has risen exponentially in the industrial age and is largely caused by burning <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/cop30-draft-text-urges-more-funds-for-poorer-countries-omits-fossil-fuels\">fossil fuels</a> such as coal, oil and gas.</p><p>While forests were adept at absorbing this excess carbon for some time, their ability to do so has been impacted by increased logging to make way for agricultural land and to provide materials for infrastructure projects.</p><p>“The observed trends may be further exacerbated in the future by population growth in Africa, the increasing export demand, particularly from Asia, and the resulting pressure on natural resources (agricultural expansion for commodity crop, timber and fuelwood),” the report found.</p><p>“The long-term persistence of these trends will depend on local governance and whether resources are used sustainably,” it added.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-carbon-sink-and-how-does-it-work\">What is a carbon sink, and how does it work?</h2><p>A “sink” is any area of land or sea that absorbs more carbon dioxide than it produces.</p><p>On land, these areas tend to be abundant in bio material such as plants and trees, which absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store it in their biomass and in the soil. Farming, however, can disrupt this process in the soil.</p><p>The largest carbon sink in the world is the ocean, which absorbs about one-quarter of the Earth’s carbon output, according to ClientEarth, an environmental organisation. Carbon dioxide dissolves on the surface of the water and marine organisms absorb it via photosynthesis.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-areas-of-the-world-are-at-risk\">Which other areas of the world are at risk?</h2><p>The Amazon rainforest is another area of concern.</p><p>Last year, the United States-based nonprofit Amazon Conservation found that deforestation in the Amazon rainforest was also eliminating trees that could absorb carbon.</p><p>Cleared land is often used for farming and livestock. These also tend to produce more emissions of greenhouse gases, which trap heat and produce carbon dioxide.</p><p>But due to the Brazilian government’s crackdown on deforestation, fears that the Amazon could also stop being a carbon sink have so far been averted.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), an environmental non-governmental organisation, the loss of the world’s forest carbon sinks will have “catastrophic consequences for people and the planet”.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-solution\">What’s the solution?</h2><p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">The authors of the report noted that a Brazilian initiative, known as the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), is trying to raise $100bn, which will be used to compensate countries that leave their forests untouched. So far, however, only $6.5bn has been raised by a small number of donor countries.</p><p>The report, therefore, called for more efforts to be focused on protecting Africa’s carbon sink and countering climate change.</p><p>“The world otherwise risks losing an important carbon sink needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the report found.</p><p>“Reversing biomass losses in Africa requires actions in the political, economic and societal spheres, to promote capacity building [and] improve forest governance,” it added.</p><p>Ultimately, however, more must be done to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, experts say.</p><p>Heiko Balzter, professor of physical geography at the University of Leicester and one of the authors of the report, told New Scientist magazine: “If we are losing the tropical forests as one of the means of mitigating climate change, then we basically have to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning even faster to get to near-zero emissions.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

With Storm Byron descending upon the enclave, a sense of terror has seized a population already exhausted from two years of <a href=\"/features/2025/12/2/israels-genocide-in-gaza-has-not-stopped-despite-ceasefire-analysts\">Israel’s genocidal war</a> with its unrelenting bombardment, starvation and chaos.</p><p>For the 1.5 million Palestinians living under plastic sheets and tattered tarps, the storm means something more than just bad weather. It’s another danger piled on top of the current <a href=\"/features/longform/2023/12/24/staying-warm-in-gaza-a-battle-for-survival\">battle for survival.</a></p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>For several days, meteorologists have warned that heavy rainfall and strong winds could hit the strip today, tomorrow and over the weekend, risking flash flooding and significant wind damage. What is certain, though, is that Gaza is not facing this storm with ready infrastructure, stocked shelters or functioning drainage systems.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It faces it with tents propped up with pieces of scrap metal, paths that become mud rivers after only one night of rain and families who have nothing left to protect.</p><h2 id=\"solidarity-a-survival-strategy\">Solidarity a survival strategy</h2><p>In the camps of Gaza City, the scenes of vulnerability are everywhere. Most tents are constructed from aid tarpaulins, pieces of plastic salvaged from rubble and blankets tied to recycled wooden poles. Many sag visibly in the middle; others are erected inadequately, so much so that they quiver and flap violently under the slightest breeze.</p><p>“When the wind starts, we all hold the poles to keep the tent from falling,” said Hani Ziara, a father sheltering in western Gaza City after his home was destroyed months ago.</p><p>His tent was flooded last night in the heavy rain, and his children had to stay outside in the cold. Hani wonders painfully what else he can do to protect his children from the rain and strong winds.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167385\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167385\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167385\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture4-1765452701.jpg?w=430&amp;resize=430%2C330&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Palestinian father taking shelter in a tent in Gaza City.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hani Zaira, a Palestinian father taking shelter in a destroyed building in Gaza City [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>In many camps, the ground was already soft from previous rainfall. Wet sand and mud stick to shoes, blankets and cooking pots as people shuffle through. Trenches dug by volunteers to divert water often collapse within hours. With nowhere else to go, families who live in low-lying areas are preparing for the worst: that floodwaters will be pushed directly into their tents.</p><p>Stocking up on food, storing clean water and securing shelter are the most basic steps when people prepare for a storm, but that is considered a luxury for the displaced of Gaza.</p><p>Most families receive scant water deliveries, going sometimes days without enough to cook or wash. Food supplies are equally strained, and while irregular aid distributions provide basics like rice or canned beans, the quantities seldom last more than a few days. Preparing for a storm by cooking ahead, gathering dry goods or storing fuel is simply not possible.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167412\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167412\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167412\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture5-1765453479.jpg?w=438&amp;resize=438%2C275&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mervit, a Palestinian mother of 5 children displaced near the Gaza Sea Port.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mervit, a mother of five children displaced near the Gaza port [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>“We could not sleep last night. Our tent was flooded with rainwater. Everything we had was flushed out by water. We want to prepare, but how?” asked Mervit, a mother of five children displaced near the Gaza port. She added, “We barely have enough food for tonight. We can’t save what we don’t have.”</p><p>Despite poverty, solidarity has become Gaza’s strongest survival strategy. Neighbours, with whatever they have, help secure the tents. Young men go through the rubble and scavenge for metal and wood remains to serve as temporary posts. The women organise collective cooking so that hot meals can be distributed to families in need, particularly those with young children or elderly family members, whenever possible.</p><p>These unofficial networks become more active the closer a storm gets. Volunteers trudge from tent to tent, helping families raise sleeping areas off the ground, patch holes in canopies with plastic sheets, and dig drainage channels. Crowds try to move those who are in precarious, extremely exposed areas to other locations, sharing information about safer places.</p><h2 id=\"we-are-exhausted\">‘We are exhausted’</h2><p>Beyond physical danger, the psychological impact is deep. After months of displacement, loss and deprivation, another crisis – this time, not war, but forces of nature – feels overwhelming.</p><p>“Our tents were destroyed. We are exhausted,” said Wissam Naser. “We have no strength left. Every day there is a new fear: hunger, cold, disease, now the storm.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4167434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4167434\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4167434\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture1-1765454064.jpg?w=480&amp;resize=480%2C311&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Wissam Naser, a displaced Palestinian sheltering in a tent in Gaza City. \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4167434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wissam Naser, a displaced Palestinian sheltering in a tent in Gaza City [Hani Mahmoud/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Many residents describe the feeling of being sandwiched between the sky and the ground, exposed on both ends and unable to protect their families from either.</p><p>As clouds mass along Gaza’s shore, families prepare to take a hit. Some weigh down tent walls against the wind with rocks and sandbags. Others push children’s blankets to the driest corner, hoping a roof will last. Most don’t have a plan. They just wait.</p><p>The storm will not be another single-night affair for the displaced in Gaza. It would be a further reminder of how fragile life has become, how survival depends not on preparedness but rather on endurance.</p><p>They wait because they have no alternative. They prepare with what little they have. They pray that this time, the winds will be merciful.</p></div></div></body></html>"
