We never thought about it.”</p><p>But Mahmood, an anthropology professor and postcolonial scholar at Columbia University, framed his son’s electoral success as evidence of a shifting political landscape.</p><p>Zohran, for instance, campaigned heavily on questions of affordability and refused to back away from his criticisms of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/mamdanis-new-york-victory-boosts-pro-palestine-politics-in-us\">Israel’s abuses against Palestinians</a>, long considered a taboo subject in US politics.</p><p>He is the first Muslim person to become mayor of the country’s largest city by population, as well as its first mayor of South Asian descent.</p><p>“There were certain things that were near and dear to him,” Mahmood explained. “Social justice was one of them. The rights of Palestinians was another.”</p><p>“These two issues he has stuck by. He’s not been willing to trade them, to compromise them, to minimise them.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"inside-the-mamdani-family\">Inside the Mamdani family</h2><p>The son of Mahmood and Indian American director Mira Nair, Zohran first emerged as the frontrunner in the mayoral race in June, when his dark-horse campaign dominated the Democratic Party primary.</p><p>He earned 56 percent of the final tally, besting former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>When Cuomo ran as an independent in the November 4 election, Zohran once again beat him by a wide margin, with more than 50 percent of the vote to Cuomo’s 41 percent.</p><p>Mahmood told Al Jazeera that, while his son’s sudden political ascent came as a surprise, his resilience did not.</p><p>“It didn’t surprise us, with his grit and determination,” he said of the election. “I don’t think he joined the race thinking that he was going to win it. I think he joined the race wanting to make a point.”</p><p>He traced back some of Zohran’s electoral finesse to his upbringing. Zohran, Mahmood explained, was not raised in a typical US nuclear family but instead shared his home with three generations of family members.</p><p>Living with a diverse age range allowed Zohran to expand his understanding and build his people skills, according to Mahmood.</p><p>“He grew up with love and patience. He learned to be very patient with people who are slower, people who were not necessarily what his generation was,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“He was very different from the American kids around here who hardly ever see their grandparents.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122211\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122211\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-05T050247Z_1026356933_RC24QHAXIBXO_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-NEW-YORK-MAYOR-1-1763758816.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zohran Mamdani and his family\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani stands with his wife Rama Duwaji, mother Mira Nair and father Mahmood Mamdani after winning the 2025 New York City mayoral race [Jeenah Moon/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-mood-of-change\">A ‘mood of change’</h2><p>Mahmood also credited his son’s victory to a shifting political landscape, one where voters are fed up with the status quo.</p><p>“There’s a mood of change. The young voted like they never voted before,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“Sections of the population which had been completely thrown into the sidelines – Muslims, recent immigrants whether Muslim or not – he gave them enormous confidence. They came out and they voted. They mobilised.”</p><p>Local media outlets in New York reported that turnout for November’s mayoral race was the highest in more than 50 years. More than two million voters cast a ballot in the closely watched race.</p><p>Mahmood cast his son’s upcoming tenure as mayor as a test of whether that voter faith would be rewarded.</p><p>“America is marked by low levels of electoral participation, and they’ve always claimed that this is because most people are satisfied with the system,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“But now the levels of political participation are increasing. And most people, it’s not just that they are not satisfied, but they no longer believe – or they begin to believe that maybe the electoral system is a way to change things. Zohran’s mayoral term will tell us whether it is or it is not.”</p><p>Mahmood was frank that his son faces an uphill battle as mayor.

Democrats, meanwhile, feared that, if they passed the continuing resolution without changes, there would be no further opportunity to address healthcare spending before the end of the year.</p><p>The two parties hit an impasse as a result. Non-essential government functions were halted during the shutdown, and many federal employees were furloughed.</p><p>Only on November 10 did a breakthrough begin to emerge.

Sometimes, many of them wear [army] uniforms. Sometimes these are soldiers on reserve duty that are on a break,” she said.</p><p>Some Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/after-israel-pms-trip-to-occupied-syria-is-a-deal-off-the-table\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, have condemned settler violence, but Novak dismissed the move as a ploy to blame Israel’s policies on a “small group of crazy settlers”.</p><p>Novak also highlighted that most of the killing and destruction in the West Bank is carried out by official Israeli forces, not settlers. “So this is another arm of the violence that Israel inflicts on Palestinians,” she said.</p><h2 id=\"meeting-us-lawmakers\">Meeting US lawmakers</h2><p>Novak and her B’Tselem colleague Kareem Jubran have been in Washington, DC, this week, where they met with US lawmakers, including Democratic Senators Peter Welch, Jeff Merkley and <a href=\"/video/the-bottom-line/2025/6/19/senator-van-hollen-netanyahu-outsmarted-trump-on-iran\">Chris Van Hollen,</a> as well as Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.</p><p>Novak said the group wants to stress the need for accountability for the genocide in Gaza.</p><p>“We are talking about a governing system, the Israeli system, that conducted genocide for two years — war crimes on a daily basis — and got away with it with no accountability,” she said.</p><p>“The current situation is probably the most dangerous that we’ve ever been in because not only this violence and this criminality took place, it was also normalised, and in any moment, it can start again, go back to the same scale.”</p><p>US President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that there is peace in the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years because of the truce he helped broker in Gaza.</p><p>And earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution backing the US president’s 20-point <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/unsc-approves-us-resolution-mandating-intl-stabilisation-force-in-gaza\">plan for Gaza</a>, which calls for an end to the fighting, gradual Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of an international force to the territory.</p><p>The plan would also see Hamas disarm and Gaza’s governance handed over to an international commission, dubbed “the Board of Peace”.</p><p>It has no accountability or compensation mechanism for the horrors that Israel unleashed on Gaza for two years.</p><p>Novak said Trump’s plan is disconnected from the reality on the ground.</p><p>“It just allows everybody to move on, instead of dealing with the situation and demanding Israel not only to be held accountable but also stop this kind of systematic oppression over the Palestinians,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-plan\">Trump’s plan</h2><p>Since the Security Council embraced the ceasefire deal, Israel has faced less international pressure. Even the push for measures like suspending the country from the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/will-a-boycott-over-israel-divide-the-eurovision-song-contest\">Eurovision </a><a href=\"/news/2025/9/17/will-a-boycott-over-israel-divide-the-eurovision-song-contest\">singing contest</a> and European football have lost momentum.</p><p>On Monday, Germany announced it was <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/germany-lifts-curbs-on-arms-exports-to-israel-citing-gaza-ceasefire\">lifting restrictions</a> on weapons exports to Israel, citing the truce.</p><p>“That is probably what scares us the most because we see regression here,” Novak said.</p><p>Jubran, B’Tselem’s field research director, also stressed the need for accountability, saying that the previous rounds of wars on Gaza <a href=\"/news/2019/3/30/gazas-great-march-of-return-protests-explained\">from 2006 onwards</a> enabled the genocide.</p><p>“That’s what allowed the genocide system to be more brazen in order to do its crime against the Palestinians in Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Despite the lack of political or legal accountability, Novak hailed the growing international public awareness of Israel’s atrocities, which she said politicians are choosing to ignore.</p><p>“If there is something that gives us hope in this really, really terrible moment, it is the fact that many people around the world are able to see through the Israeli propaganda and just to make sense of what their eyes saw, and some of the voices of the victims were able to come out from Gaza and from the West Bank,” she said.</p><p>“So people do understand. We are in the moment where people need to demand their leaders and politicians to hold Israel accountable.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was all under the watchful eye of a mural of Claudia Cardinale, the renowned Italian actress born in La Goulette, a reminder of the distant past when the district was home to thousands of Europeans.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120841\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120841\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120841\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3562-1763691944.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A crowd carry a statue of the Virgin Mary in a square, with a mural depicting Claudia Cardinale on a wall\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People carry the shrine of the Virgin Mary, as a mural depicting Italian actress Claudia Cardinale overlooks the crowd [Joseph Tulloch/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-melting-pot\">A melting pot</h2><p>The Catholic feast of Our Lady of Trapani was brought to La Goulette in the late 1800s by Sicilian immigrants, in the days when the port town was a hub for poor southern European fishermen in search of a better life.</p><p>Immigration to Tunisia from Sicily peaked in the early 20th century. Nearly all of the fishermen, along with their families and descendants, have now returned to European shores, but the statue of the Virgin remained – and, every year on August 15, it is carried in procession out of the church.</p><p>“It’s a unique event,” Hatem Bourial, a Tunisian journalist and radio presenter, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He went on to describe how, in the procession’s heyday in the early 20th century, native Tunisians, Muslims and Jews alike, would join Tunisian-Sicilian Catholics in carrying the statue of the Virgin Mary from the church down to the sea.</p><p>There, participants would ask Mary to bless the fishermen’s boats. Many residents would shout “Long live the Virgin of Trapani!”, Bourial said, while others threw their chechia, a traditional red cap worn in the Maghreb, in the air.</p><p>As well as its religious significance – for Catholics, August 15 marks the day that Mary was taken up into heaven – the feast also coincides with the Italian mid-August holiday of Ferragosto, which traditionally signals the high point of the summer.</p><p>Silvia Finzi, born in Tunis in the 1950s to Italian parents, described how, after the statue had been brought down to the sea, many of La Goulette’s residents would declare that the worst of the punishingly hot Tunisian summer was over.</p><p>“Once the Virgin had been taken down to the water, it was as if the sea had changed”, Finzi, a professor of Italian at the University of Tunis, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“People would say ‘the sea has changed, the summer’s over’, and you wouldn’t need to go swimming to cool down any more”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-1763692311.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C579&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Canal port of La Goulette, late 19th century\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The canal port of La Goulette, in the late 19th century [Courtesy of Dialoghi Mediterranei]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"european-exodus\">European exodus</h2><p>The first European immigrants began to arrive in La Goulette in the early 19th century. Their numbers rapidly increased after 1881, when Tunisia became a French protectorate. At its height in the early 1900s, the number of Italian immigrants – who were largely Sicilians – across the whole of Tunisia is estimated to have been more than 100,000.</p><p>In the decade after 1956, when Tunisia gained its independence from France, the vast majority of its European residents left the country, as the new government pivoted towards nationalism.</p><p>In 1964, the Vatican signed an agreement with Tunisia, transferring control of the majority of the country’s churches – now largely empty – to the government for use as public buildings. The agreement also put an end to all public Christian celebrations, including the procession in La Goulette.</p><p>For more than half a century, August 15 was marked only with a Mass inside the church building, and the statue of Our Lady of Trapani remained immobile in its niche. The date remained important for La Goulette’s much-reduced Catholic population, but it largely ceased to be an important event for the wider community.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120855\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120855\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120855\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3419-1763692569.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The Catholic Church Saint Augustine-and Saint-Fidèle\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120855\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Catholic Church of Saint Augustin and Saint Fidele [Joseph Tulloch/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"nostalgia\">Nostalgia</h2><p>In 2017, the Catholic Church received permission to restart the procession, initially just inside the church compound. This year, when Al Jazeera visited, the procession left the church property but only travelled as far as the square outside.</p><p>Many attendees were young Tunisian Muslims, with little connection to La Goulette’s historic Sicilian population.</p><p>A major reason for this is undoubtedly the high status accorded to the Virgin Mary in Islam – an entire chapter of the Quran is dedicated to her.</p><p>Other participants seemed to be drawn by a feeling of nostalgia for La Goulette’s multiethnic, multireligious past.</p><p>“I love the procession”, Rania, 26, told Al Jazeera. “Lots of people have forgotten about it now, but European immigration is such an important part of Tunisia’s history”.</p><p>Rania, a student, told Al Jazeera of her love for the 1996 film, Un ete a La Goulette (A Summer in La Goulette).</p><p>Featuring dialogue in three languages, and evocative shots of sunlit courtyards and shimmering beaches, the film is an ode to La Goulette’s past.</p><p>Directed by the renowned Tunisian filmmaker Ferid Boughedir, it follows the lives of three teenage girls – Gigi, a Sicilian, Meriem, a Muslim, and Tina, a Jew – over the course of a summer in the 1960s.</p><p>The film ends, however, on a bleak note, with the outbreak of the 1967 War between Israel and several Arab states, and the subsequent departure of almost all of Tunisia’s remaining Jewish and European residents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120861\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120861\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120861\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-1763692837.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C506&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Procession of Our Lady of Trapani in La Goulette, 1950s\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120861\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The procession of Our Lady of Trapani in La Goulette in the 1950s [Courtesy of Dialoghi Mediterranei]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"new-migrations\">New migrations</h2><p>As Tunisia’s European population declined, the country has seen an influx of new migrant communities from sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The majority of these new migrants, who number in the tens of thousands, hail from Francophone West Africa. Many come to Tunisia in search of work; others hope to find passage across the Mediterranean to Europe.</p><p>Many of the sub-Saharan migrants – who face <a href=\"/news/2023/7/14/black-tunisians-lie-low-violence-against-black-people-worsens\">widespread discrimination in Tunisia</a> – are Christian, and as a result, they now make up the vast majority of Tunisia’s churchgoing population.</p><p>This fact is reflected in a mural in the church in La Goulette, inspired by the feast of Our Lady of Trapani. Painted in 2017, it depicts the Virgin Mary sheltering a group of people – Tunisians, Sicilians and sub-Saharan Africans – under her mantle.</p><p>The air around the Virgin in the mural is full of passports. The church’s priest, Father Narcisse, who hails from Chad, told Al Jazeera that these represent the documents that immigrants throw into the sea while making the journey from North Africa to Europe in the hope of evading deportation.</p><p>The mural highlights the fact that the Madonna of Trapani, once considered the protector of Sicilian fishermen, is today called upon by immigrants of far more varied backgrounds.</p><p>“This celebration, in its original form, marked the deep bonds between the two shores of the Mediterranean,” Archbishop of Tunis Nicolas Lhernould told Al Jazeera. “Today, it brings together a more diverse group – Tunisians, Africans, Europeans; locals, migrants, and tourists.”</p><p>“Mary herself was a migrant,” Archbishop Lhernould said, referring to the New Testament story which narrates Mary’s flight, together with the child Jesus and her husband Joseph, from Palestine to Egypt.</p><p>From a Christian perspective, he suggested, “we are all migrants, just passing through, citizens of a kingdom which is not of this world”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120866\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120866\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120866\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3658-1763692934.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A mural of the Virgin Mary with migrants and passports around her\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120866\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A mural of the Virgin Mary in the Saint Augustin and Saint Fidele church sheltering a group of people – Tunisians, Sicilians, and sub-Saharan Africans – under her mantle.

The vast majority of these structures – modest buildings built by the newly-arrived fishermen – have been torn down and replaced, and little more than the church remains to testify to the area’s once significant Sicilian presence.</p><p>As of 2019, there were only 800 Italians descended from the original immigrant community left in the whole of Tunisia.</p><p>“There are so few of us left”, said Rita Strazzera, who was born in Tunis to Sicilian parents. The Tunisian-Sicilian community meets very rarely, she explained, with some members coming together for the celebration on the 15th August, and holding occasional meetings in a small bookshop opposite the church.</p><p>Still, the spirit of Little Sicily has not entirely vanished. Traces of the old La Goulette linger – in memory, in film, and, Strazzera told Al Jazeera, in other, more surprising ways as well.</p><p>“Every year, on All Saints’ Day, I go to the graveyard”, said Strazzera, referring to the annual celebration when Catholics remember their deceased loved ones.</p><p>“And there are Tunisians there, Muslims, people who maybe had a Sicilian parent, or a Sicilian grandparent, and have come to visit their graves, because they know it’s what Catholics do.”</p><p>“There have been lots of mixed marriages”, Strazzera added, “and so, every year, there are more of them visiting the graves. When I see them, it’s like a reminder that Little Sicily is still with us.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4120872\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4120872\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120872\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-1763693203.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C471&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sicilian peasants in Tunisia, 1906\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4120872\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sicilian peasants in Tunisia in 1906 [Courtesy of Dialoghi Mediterranei]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"
