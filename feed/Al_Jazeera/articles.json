His statement, however, failed to identify the precise circumstances that prompted the warning.</p><p>“The US would consider anyone supporting such a disruptive step favoring the gangs to be acting contrary to the interests of the United States, the region, and the Haitian people and will act accordingly,” Landau said.</p><p>Haiti continues to struggle with the ravages of widespread gang violence, instability and corruption in its government.</p><p>But the US threat is likely to send shudders throughout the region, particularly in the aftermath of the January 3 attack on Venezuela.</p><p>The administration of President Donald Trump has repeatedly advanced the notion that the entire Western Hemisphere falls under its sphere of influence, as part of a policy it dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine”, a riff on the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine.</p><p>Trump has referenced that premise to justify the use of US military force to abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, as well as to claim the US needs to control Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"a-political-crisis\">A political crisis</h2><p>Located some 11,000 kilometres (800 miles) southeast of the US, Haiti has long struggled with instability. It is considered the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, as it continues to suffer from the legacy of foreign intervention, dictatorship and natural disasters.</p><p>But in 2021, the country faced a new crisis when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home in the capital, Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Federal elections have not been held since, leading to a crisis of confidence in the government. The last federally elected officials saw their terms expire in 2023.</p><p>Experts say the lack of leadership has allowed Haiti’s gangs to flourish, and since the Moise assassination, they have taken control of vast stretches of the territory, including up to 90 percent of the capital.</p><p>The resulting violence has forced more than 1.4 million Haitians from their homes. Millions more suffer from food insecurity, as thoroughfares are often restricted by gang-led roadblocks.</p><p>This week, a United Nations report found that, between January and November of last year, an estimated 8,100 people were killed in the violence. That marks an escalation from 2024, when the yearly total was 5,600.</p><p>But efforts have been made to restore the country’s stability. The Transitional Presidential Council was designed as a temporary governing structure to set the framework for new federal elections. Established in 2024, it has nine members who rotate to serve as chair.</p><p>Very quickly, however, the council faced criticism for its membership – largely selected from the country’s business and political elite – and allegations of corruption swirled. Infighting has also broken out among the members.</p><p>The US too has added to the tensions on the council. In November, it <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/us-imposes-visa-sanctions-against-haitian-official-on-governing-council\">announced visa restrictions</a> against an unnamed government official, later identified in the media as one of the council’s members, economist Fritz Alphonse Jean.</p><p>While the council had been slated to hold tiered elections starting last November, it failed to meet that benchmark, and the first vote has been postponed to August.</p><p>In the meantime, the council’s mandate is set to dissolve on February 7, and the panel’s future remains unclear.</p><h2 id=\"un-calls-for-action\">UN calls for action</h2><p>In this week’s report on Haiti, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres linked Haiti’s ongoing humanitarian crisis to the vacuum in its government.</p><p>“Violence has intensified and expanded geographically, exacerbating food insecurity and instability, as transitional governance arrangements near expiry and overdue elections remain urgent,” Guterres said.</p><p>Another UN representative – Carlos Ruiz-Massieu, who leads the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) – was also emphatic about the immediate need for transparent democratic processes and unified governance.</p><p>“Let us be clear: the country no longer has time to waste on prolonged internal struggles,” he said.</p><p>Still, in a speech on Wednesday to the UN Security Council, Ruiz-Massieu added that there have been “encouraging” signs ahead of this year’s scheduled elections. He applauded efforts to increase voter registration, including in Haiti’s diaspora, and encourage political participation among women.</p><p>But Ruiz-Massieu underscored that security concerns, including gang violence, could impede the democratic process, and that there was more work to be done before elections could be held.</p><p>“Achieving this goal will require sustained coordination among relevant institutions, predictable financing of the electoral process and security conditions that allow all voters and candidates to participate without fear,” he said.</p><p>The UN also signalled it would bolster its multinational security support mission in Haiti with more troops later this year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Larry Ellison is also a close ally of US President Donald Trump.</p><p>As of late Wednesday, Paramount said more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. That remains far below the 50 percent threshold needed to gain control of the company, which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in its Series A common stock.</p><p>“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,” Warner said in an emailed statement on Thursday, adding that it is “clear our shareholders agree”, as more than 93 percent have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme”.</p><p>In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner’s studio and streaming business for $72bn. This week, it switched its offer from a cash and stock combination to an <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/netflix-switches-its-warner-bros-offer-to-all-cash-deal-to-quell-paramount\">all-cash deal </a>that the companies say is more straightforward and will speed the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of that deal is about $83bn, or $27.75 per share.</p><p>Paramount, however, argues its offer is better and has accused Warner’s leadership of a lack of transparency with shareholders.</p><p>On Thursday, the company said Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, warning that debt from a previously announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business could reduce the eventual payout to shareholders.</p><p>The battle for Warner is complicated by the fact that Netflix and Paramount are seeking different assets.</p><p>A successful deal would reshape Hollywood by handing control of franchises from Friends to Batman, along with the HBO Max streaming service, to a single buyer.</p><h2 id=\"netflix-deal-lingers\">Netflix deal lingers</h2><p>Netflix’s bid covers only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including HBO Max and its TV and film production arms. Paramount’s offer, by contrast, is for the entire company, including its news and cable operations, potentially putting CNN under the same roof as CBS.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>If Netflix prevails, Warner’s networks would be spun off into a separate company called Discovery Global under a previously announced plan.</p><p>A sale of Warner Bros Discovery <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/paramounts-warner-bros-discovery-bid-faces-conflict-of-interest-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is expected to be lengthy</a> and face intense antitrust scrutiny. Politics are likely to play a role under Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement in the approval process.</p><p>The Ellisons have argued that their relationship with Trump gives them an easier regulatory path. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday that the company has made progress toward securing the necessary approvals.</p><p>On Wall Street, Paramount Skydance is up 1.9 percent, Warner Bros Discovery is down 0.4 percent.

At a minimum, he committed large scale perjury!”</p><p>All the while, Smith told the committee his investigations were nonpartisan — and that there were, indeed, grounds to bring two federal indictments against Trump during the period between his two terms in office.</p><p>“I made my decisions without regard to President Trump’s political association, activities, beliefs or candidacy in the 2024 election,” Smith told the congressional panel.</p><p>“President Trump was charged because the evidence established that he willfully broke the law — the very laws he took an oath to uphold.”</p><p>Formerly a war-crimes prosecutor at an international tribunal in The Hague, Smith was selected to serve as special counsel in 2022, under former Democratic President Joe Biden.</p><p>Special counsels are tapped to operate independently, without the usual day-to-day oversight from politically appointed Justice Department leadership.</p><p>But Smith’s mandate was particularly sensitive. He was charged with investigating Trump, Biden’s 2020 election rival whom the Democrat would face again in the 2024 race.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260373\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260373\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260373\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-22T153241Z_1248616273_RC2F6JAGFYXC_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-SMITH-1769098155.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jack Smith raises his hand to be sworn in\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260373\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Special Counsel Jack Smith raises his hand to be sworn in on January 22 [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"inside-the-investigations\">Inside the investigations</h2><p>The 2020 election was a central part of Smith’s investigation. So were Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021, when thousands of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in an apparent attempt to disrupt the certification of the election results.</p><p>Smith ultimately determined that Trump had intentionally attempted to subvert the vote. In August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on four charges: conspiracy to defraud the country, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against the free exercise of rights under the US Constitution.</p><p>A separate grand jury, this time in the state of Florida, issued a second federal indictment in June 2023, related to another probe Smith led.</p><p>That investigation focused on Trump’s decision to withhold classified documents after leaving office and defy a subpoena for their return. Trump was ultimately charged with 40 counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice, making false statements, and failing to adhere to standards concerning sensitive documents under the Espionage Act.</p><p>Both federal cases were dropped after Trump was re-elected in 2024. It is Justice Department policy not to investigate or prosecute sitting presidents. Smith himself resigned shortly before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.</p><p>Nevertheless, at Thursday’s hearing, Smith defended the indictments and suggested his cases would have been successful had the circumstances been different.</p><p>“I want to be clear: I stand by my decisions as special counsel, including the decision to bring charges against President Trump,” Smith told the committee.</p><p>“Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity. If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Democrat or a Republican.”</p><p>He added that the evidence compelled him to move forward with the indictments, regardless of the high-profile defendant.</p><p>“The law required that he be held to account,” Smith said. “So that is what I did. To have done otherwise on the facts of these cases would’ve been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor.”</p><p>Later on in his testimony, he emphasised his stance: “ We were ready, willing and able to go to trial in the case.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260495\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260495\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260495\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022580949846-1769102231.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jim Jordan and Jamie Raskin on the House Judiciary panel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260495\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Representative Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and ranking member Representative Jamie Raskin speak to Jack Smith on January 22 [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"republican-criticisms\">Republican criticisms</h2><p>But Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sought to portray Smith as a partisan shill whose mission was to take down Biden’s political rival.</p><p>Some of the most aggressive questioning came from Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California, who cast doubt on Smith’s independence as special prosecutor.</p><p>“You, like the president’s men for Richard Nixon, went after your political enemies. Maybe they’re not your political enemies, but they sure as hell were Joe Biden’s political enemies, weren’t they?” Issa asked.</p><p>“They were the enemies of the president. And you were their arm, weren’t you?”</p><p>Smith replied to the accusation with a single word: “No.”</p><p>Issa went on to assert that, in spreading false statements denying his 2020 election defeat, Trump was simply expressing his First Amendment right to free speech.</p><p>“ You understand the Constitution? Do you understand the Bill of Rights that someone has the absolute right to believe something, whether it’s true or not, and to advocate for something whether it’s true or not?” Issa said at one point.</p><p>“So if you know that people have a right to opine, lobby for, assert [and] do everything they can legally to ask for people to make different decisions, then why is it you saw criminal conduct on behalf of a president who believed he didn’t win?”</p><p>Smith was not able to respond to that question, but his indictment asserts that Trump went beyond simply voicing his disagreement with the results.</p><p>Rather, it argues that Trump and his allies attempted to recruit “false electors” to submit fraudulent Electoral College votes for certification, and it highlights evidence that Trump pressured elected officials to reject unfavourable vote outcomes.</p><p>Another key point of criticism among Republicans was Smith’s decision to seek “limited toll records” from the telephones of nine lawmakers who communicated with Trump during his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, was among the Congress members targeted.</p><p>Such toll records do not include the content of the calls in question. Rather, they identify where the call originated from, who it was received by, and how long the connection lasted.</p><p>Republicans argued that subpoenaing the telephone records amounted not only to a violation of privacy but also to an infringement of the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause, which protects lawmakers from legal action stemming from their legislative duties.</p><p>Conservative members of the committee also questioned the secrecy of the subpoenas, something Smith argued was necessary.</p><p>“The subpoenas that we secured, we secured with non-disclosure orders from a judge because I had grave concerns about obstruction of justice in this investigation,” Smith responded.</p><p>“Specifically with regards to Donald Trump, not only did we have the obstruction of justice that we were investigating in the classified documents case, but I was aware during the course of our investigation of the targeting of witnesses.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260513\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260513\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260513\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022607184489-1769103274.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A photographer snaps a shot of Jack Smith at a committee meeting.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith takes his seat as he prepares to testify [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"smith-defends-team-s-work\">Smith defends team’s work</h2><p>While Republicans blasted Smith for what they perceived to be prosecutorial missteps, Democrats praised him as a paragon of integrity.</p><p>“I want you to lean in today. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You did everything right, sir,” Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell told Smith.</p><p>He then proceeded to accuse his Republican colleagues of hypocrisy, particularly after the 2021 attack on the Capitol.</p><p>“These guys are so lucky they’re not under oath because they would have to tell you what they really think of Trump,” Swalwell said, gesturing to the Republicans on the panel. “ They call him crooked. They call him cruel. They call him a scumbag. I’ve heard you all say it.”</p><p>Swalwell invited Smith to reflect on the Capitol attack and how he felt watching Trump supporters break into the legislature while lawmakers fled. At the time, Smith was in Europe on behalf of the State Department, working on the war-crimes tribunal.</p><p>“ I was shocked by it. Being in Europe and not following things as closely, I was not frankly up to speed on the events leading up to it,” Smith replied. “ I just had never seen anything like that happen in our country.”</p><p>Smith also denied that he faced any pressure from the Biden administration to come to any foregone conclusion.</p><p>“ I was given the independence to conduct my investigation,” he said.</p><p>Since being named special prosecutor, Smith has become a frequent target for criticism on the political right. Just this week, Trump himself called Smith a “sick son of a b****” who led a group of “ handpicked radical-left Marxist prosecutors”.</p><p>Over the past year, the Trump administration has largely removed the nonpartisan federal employees who were involved in the two federal investigations Smith led.</p><p>Smith used Thursday’s committee hearing to lash out at those employment decisions, accusing Trump of seeking retribution against government workers who served presidents of both parties.</p><p>“ I’m proud of the work my team did, and I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to correct false and misleading narratives about our work,” Smith told the panel.</p><p>“President Trump has sought to seek revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff simply for having worked on these cases,” he added. “To vilify and seek retribution against these people is wrong. Those dedicated public servants are the best of us.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4260590\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4260590\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4260590\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022583919808-1769107061.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jack Smith testifies at House Judiciary Committee\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4260590\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The House Judiciary Committee hears Jack Smith’s testimony [Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"president-responds-to-smith-s-testimony\">President responds to Smith’s testimony</h2><p>Trump, meanwhile, appeared to be watching Smith’s testimony live. In the midst of the committee’s back-and-forth dialogue, the president posted on Truth Social a message applauding Republicans for their takedowns of Smith.</p><p>“Deranged Jack Smith is being DECIMATED before Congress. It was over when they discussed his past failures and unfair prosecutions,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115939889414201547\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “He destroyed many lives under the guise of legitimacy. Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”</p><p>Trump also suggested Smith should face professional penalties or even prosecution, in a message seemingly directed at the Justice Department.</p><p>“If he were a Republican, his license would be taken away from him, and far worse! Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he’s done,” Trump continued.</p><p>“The whole thing was a Democrat SCAM — A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!”</p><p>Trump has deployed a similar tactic in the past, using his social media account <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in September</a> to direct the Justice Department to indict <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/us-judge-dismisses-criminal-charges-against-james-comey-letitia-james\">other critics of his actions</a>, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.</p><p>Smith was <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/us-house-judiciary-committee-subpoenas-former-trump-prosecutor-jack-smith\">subpoenaed</a> by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in early December and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-defends-record-before-republican-lawmakers\">testified</a> later that month in a closed-door hearing, despite his protestations that the proceedings should be public.</p><p>He is currently under a gag order barring him from divulging evidence about the classified documents case, though US District Judge Aileen Cannon indicated she would allow his report to be released on February 24. The Trump administration has appealed that decision.</p><p>As part of his prepared remarks, Smith implored his audience to defend the rule of law, regardless of which party might seek to undermine it.</p><p>“After nearly 30 years of public service, including in international settings, I have seen how the rule of law can erode,” Smith said.</p><p>“My fear is that we have seen the rule of law function in our country for so long that many of us have come to take it for granted. The rule of law is not self-executing. It depends on our collective commitment to apply it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

And nowhere was that more apparent than with the accolades showered on Sinners.</p><p>Actors Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo, both passed over at the Golden Globes, scored acting nods alongside their Sinners costar Michael B Jordan.

South Africa has deployed an air force helicopter to assist with rescue operations.</p><p>Reporting from Manhica district in Maputo province in southern Mozambique, Al Jazeera’s Haru Mutasa said residents rescued by the helicopter were being offered medical assistance, food and temporary shelter.</p><p>Celeste Maria, a 25-year-old hospital worker, told Reuters her family fled their home in Chokwe in southern Gaza province after authorities issued flood warnings last week.</p><p>“Our home is now completely submerged … We left behind neighbours who are now telling us they are sheltering on rooftops as the water continues to rise,” she explained by phone from a resettlement centre.</p><p>Aerial images showed expansive flooded areas with only treetops visible above the water.</p><p>Officials have not yet released casualty figures from the latest flooding.</p><p>Mozambique has experienced repeated weather-related disasters that scientists link to climate change.</p><p>Heavy rainfall has also affected parts of South Africa, including the northeast, site of the famous Kruger National Park.</p><p>Flood damage to Kruger National Park will require years to repair at a cost of millions of dollars, Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Willie Aucamp said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>South African authorities temporarily closed the park last week after several rivers overflowed due to heavy rainfall. The park is a major attraction for both domestic and international tourists.</p><p>Fifteen tourist camps remain closed, with some completely inaccessible, Aucamp said. Hundreds were evacuated with no loss of life.</p><p>While assessment continues, repair costs are estimated to exceed 500 million rand ($30m).</p><p>“The recent floods that we’ve experienced have had a devastating effect on the park,” Aucamp told Reuters. “The indication is that it will take as long as five years to repair all the bridges and roads and other infrastructure.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
