            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>I was about 13 years old when the conflict in Darfur began in 2003. As a teenager reading and listening to the news before the dawn of social media, I didn’t fully understand the historical or political context, but I understood there was a need to act. A need to put an end to a humanitarian crisis. It is one of the events that ultimately led me to become a physician and work in areas of conflict and natural disasters.</p><p>In the first two weeks of December, I volunteered with an NGO providing medical care in a camp for internally displaced persons (IDP) in al-Dabba, in Sudan’s Northern State. In some ways, I have circled back to the beginning, back to the place that first incited me to action.</p><p>Over the course of the two weeks in which we were in al-Dabba, the population of the camp grew from 2,000 to more than 10,000. It felt at times like there would never be enough resources to accommodate all the newcomers. Not enough food and water. Not enough medication. Not enough latrines.</p><p>Instead, what I witnessed over and over again was the courage, generosity, and selflessness of the Sudanese people: From the IDPs themselves to the local staff of the NGO I was volunteering with.</p><p>These are the stories of some of those whom I met during the course of a day in the camp.</p><p>People like 15-year-old Fatima*. It had taken her 21 days to get to al-Dabba. She fled from el-Fasher as the Rapid Support Forces, a militia that is currently fighting the Sudanese army, advanced upon her hometown.</p><p>She was 10 weeks pregnant with her first child. She needed to be transferred to hospital for a fetal ultrasound. I asked her gently if the father of the child would be accompanying her to the hospital. She looked away. Her mother whispered to me that she had been raped. I took Fatima’s hand in mine and sat with her in silence, her tears falling onto my sleeves.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4191283\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4191283\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4191283\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251203_164927-1766479737.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='A photo of an inscription that reads \"We are all el-Fasher\" written in Arabic on the side of a tent' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4191283\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A graffiti written on a tent says “We are all el-Fasher” in Arabic, al-Dabba camp, Sudan [Courtesy of Dr Nabiha Islam]</figcaption></figure><p>Then I met Aisha, a mother of five. She had lost her husband on the long and harrowing journey from el-Fasher to al-Dabba. Her haemoglobin was extremely low and I told her I would need to transfer her to the nearest hospital for a blood transfusion. She couldn’t bear to leave her children as they were having recurrent nightmares and not sleeping well at night after losing their father.</p><p>We spent the better part of an hour trying to problem-solve with her and settled on having the children stay with their grandma while Aisha was transferred to the hospital.</p><p>Then there was Khadija. It had taken her four weeks to get to al-Dabba. In the chaos of fleeing el-Fasher, she watched her husband get shot in the back. As heart-wrenching as it was to leave without giving him a proper burial, she carried on with her three young children, fleeing on foot.</p><p>En route, there was little to eat and limited potable water. Her youngest child died from severe diarrhoea and malnutrition. She somehow managed to find the strength to cobble together enough money to hitchhike in a vehicle with her two remaining children for part of the way.</p><p>But tragedy struck again. They ended up in a motor vehicle accident. Her second child died from her injuries. Khadija arrived at al-Dabba with her eldest son – the only surviving child.</p><p>When I met her in our medical tent, Khadija was 36 weeks pregnant with her fourth child. She had a urinary tract infection, so I gave her a course of antibiotics. She thanked me profusely, kissing both my cheeks. Her gratitude made me feel all the more embarrassed that I had so little to offer someone who had been through so much. I told her she would be in my prayers.</p><p>Suddenly, she leaned in close and asked me my name. I told her my name and she repeated it, letting it roll gently off her tongue. Then she pointed at her pregnant belly and said, “This is what I will name my child.” I felt overwhelmed by what she was giving me when so much had already been taken from her.</p><p>At one point, I needed to take a break for noon prayers, so I walked over to the thatched straw home of Auntie Najwa. She had been in the IDP camp for more than a year. Her prayer mat was one of her very few possessions. But she offered it freely to anyone who needed it. Her home felt like a haven of safety. She insisted I drink tea. When I politely declined, she offered me cooked beans and lentils. Her generosity left me humbled.</p><p>And so did the courage of my translator, Ahmed. He was a member of the local staff at the NGO where I was volunteering. At the beginning of the war in 2023, Ahmed took his parents and siblings to Egypt, made sure they were safe, and then returned to Sudan to continue serving his people. I heard stories like this over and over again.</p><p>The local team in Sudan had made countless sacrifices to remain in the country and serve its people despite innumerable threats to their own personal safety. When I think about the worry and concern of my own father as he dropped me off at the airport before my flight to Sudan, I can only imagine what Ahmed’s parents feel knowing their son remains in a warzone by choice while they live in relative safety.</p><p>Sudan is experiencing the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. Yet it has received less than 35 percent of its global funding needs. One third of the population has been displaced. One in two is hungry. Many parts of the country are experiencing famine, with millions at risk of starvation.</p><p>I don’t know where the solutions lie. But I do know we, as an international community, have failed Sudan and its people over and over again.</p><p>We can do better. We must do better.</p><p>Fatima, Khadija, Aisha, Auntie Najwa, and Ahmed deserve better.</p><p>The Sudanese people deserve far better.</p><p><em>*All names have been changed to protect their identities.</em></p><p data-start=\"6919\" data-end=\"7201\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The family built a narrow set of creaking wooden steps to access their home, though these makeshift stairs threaten to give way at any moment. Yet amid the destruction, it remains home.</p><p>Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, destroyed or damaged more than 70 percent of the buildings, and displaced most of the territory’s 2.3 million residents.</p><p>In October, Israel reached an agreement to cease fire, but its attacks have not stopped. It has killed more than 400 Palestinians since then, in violation of the truce agreement. It has also not allowed the full entry of aid.</p><p>Reconstruction has not begun and is projected to take years, as Israel has kept total control over what goes in and comes out of the enclave. This means families like the Halawas are struggling to rebuild their lives.</p><p>The family abandoned their home three months after the war began on October 7, 2023. They returned during the fragile calm established by the truce. Like many others, this family of seven found living in their damaged residence preferable to tent life, particularly as winter rains flooded tent shelters over the past weeks.</p><p>In one damaged room, Amani Halawa brewed coffee in a small tin over a fire while thin rays of light filtered through concrete fragments. Amani, her husband Mohammed, and their children have made repairs using concrete scraps, hanging backpacks from exposed metal rods and arranging pots and pans across the kitchen floor.</p><p>The home’s walls feature a painted tree and messages to family members separated by the conflict.</p><p>Throughout damaged apartments in Gaza City, daily life persists, even as families lie awake fearing their walls might collapse. Health officials report that at least 11 people died from building collapses in a single week in December.</p><p>In her home, Sahar Taroush swept dust from carpets placed over rubble. Her daughter Bisan’s face glowed in the light of a computer screen as she watched a movie beside gaping holes in the wall.</p><p>On another building’s cracked wall, a family displayed a torn photo of their grandfather on horseback from his time serving in the Palestinian Authority’s security forces during the 1990s. Nearby, a man reclined on a bed precariously balanced on a damaged balcony, scrolling through his phone above the devastated al-Karama neighbourhood.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thousands of people were killed in the four decades of armed rebellion against the Turkish state.</p><p>Following the SANA report, the SDF said in a later statement that it had issued instructions to stop responding to attacks by Syrian government forces following de-escalation contacts.</p><p>Under a March agreement signed by the SDF and Damascus, the Kurdish-led force was to merge with the new Syrian army, but details were left vague, and implementation has stalled.</p><h2 id=\"sdf-playing-for-time\">SDF ‘playing for time’</h2><p>Syrian analyst Gamal Mansour, a lecturer in political science at the University of Toronto, told Al Jazeera that the SDF had been “playing for time” and that it was “politically inexpedient” for the group to “move the needle forward”.</p><p>Syrian forces had, however, “provoked the SDF into a kinetic movement from their strongholds of Ashrafiyah and Sheikh Maqsoud, the two neighbourhoods that they control”.</p><p>Kurdish units linked to the SDF and the Kurds’ domestic security forces retained control of the two neighbourhoods despite a disengagement agreement reached in April with the Syrian authorities.</p><p>Syria’s Ministry of Interior said on Monday that Kurdish forces attacked government personnel at joint checkpoints in the two Kurdish-majority areas.</p><p>But the SDF accused “factions affiliated with the interim government” of carrying out an attack on a checkpoint.</p><p>Both sides issued denials. The Syrian Defence Ministry denied attacking SDF positions, while the Kurdish-led force denied targeting Aleppo neighbourhoods.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"deep-fracture\">Deep fracture</h2><p class=\"p1\">Integrating the SDF into state forces would mend Syria’s deepest remaining fracture in the wake of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad’s ouster last year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Failing to do so risks an armed clash that could derail the country’s emergence from 14 years of devastating war, which killed more than 350,000 people and displaced nearly half of the country’s pre-war population of 13 million. There is a risk of potentially drawing in Turkiye, as well, which has threatened an incursion against Kurdish fighters it views as “terrorists”.</p><p>A major sticking point had been whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or whether it would be dissolved and its members individually absorbed into the new military.</p><p>Turkiye, which shares a 900km- (560-mile) border with Syria, is opposed to the SDF joining as a single unit because of the group’s links to the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/10/27/has-the-kurdish-pkk-given-up-on-its-dream-of-a-homeland\">PKK</a>.</p><p>Kurdish officials have said a preliminary agreement has been reached to allow three divisions affiliated with the SDF to integrate as units into the new army, but it is unclear how close the sides are to finalising it.</p><p>Mansour, the analyst, said time was running out. “Fidan said four days earlier that the parties in question have run out of patience, that the SDF’s manipulation of time as a strategic asset towards creating more latitude for themselves is something that cannot be withstood by Turkiye and the other parties in question,” he said.</p><p>Fidan, whose delegation also included Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, said on Monday: “Syria’s stability means Turkiye’s stability.”</p><p>He called on the SDF to “cease to be an obstacle to Syria achieving stability, unity and prosperity”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Asaad al-Shaibani, the Syrian foreign minister, accused the SDF of “systematic procrastination”.</p><p>Fidan’s delegation also met with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. According to al-Shaibani, talks also addressed “combating terrorism and preventing” a resurgence of the ISIL (ISIS) group.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Washington wants New Delhi to open its market to genetically modified (GM) soya and corn.</p><p>The GM technology involves altering plant DNA to introduce new traits that help speed up production compared with traditional breeding.</p><p>The US is the world’s second-largest producer of soya beans after Brazil, accounting for 28 percent, or 119.05 million metric tonnes, of global production.</p><p>China was the biggest buyer of US soya beans until the trade war with Beijing led to a <a href=\"/gallery/2025/10/14/us-soya-bean-farmers-battered-by-trade-dispute-with-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slump in sales</a>.</p><p>Suman Sahai, the founder of Gene Campaign, a nonprofit working for farmers, said the US desperately needs a market for its soya beans and corn, because China, its one-time top buyer, has dramatically scaled back its purchases.</p><p>“Trump has to sell this soya and corn so as not to annoy his big political base of the soya [and] corn farmers,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181565\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181565\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mahesh-Patel-soya-farmer-1766044366.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181565\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mahesh-Patel-soya-farmer-1766044366.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soybean India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Soya farmer Mahesh Patel says heavy rains wrecked his crop [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-s-reluctance\">India’s reluctance</h2><p>India has so far held off the imports of GM-variety soya beans and corn on the grounds that it produces non-GM, or organic, crops, which have a global niche market and could be undermined by the perception of GM varieties diluting the strain.</p><p>India produces about 13.05 million tonnes of soya beans, with Madhya Pradesh alone yielding more than half.</p><p>India’s corn production stands at approximately 42 million tonnes, 20 percent of which is used in making fuel-grade ethanol. The country is self-sufficient in its corn output but imports soya oil for cooking purposes because of a lack of processing infrastructure for edible oil.</p><p>Farmers of soya and corn, however, complain that they are already being ripped off by traders who pay below the price set by the government. On top of that are the steep costs of fertilisers, seeds and other farm items, coupled with the erratic rainfall that has destroyed crops.</p><p>“The traders set the prices at their will, as the government does not buy from us. We are unable to even recover the production cost,” said Prakash Patel, 50, a corn farmer in Madhya Pradesh.</p><p>“The profit is a distant dream for us, and we still have to pay the loans we took to buy our farming materials.”</p><p>Farmers worry that these losses would be exacerbated if US goods enter the Indian market.</p><p>A farmer in India typically produces about 1 metric tonne of soya beans in 0.40 hectares (1 acre). But GM soya bean yield can go up to 3 metric tonnes over the same land area, said Nirbhay Singh, a soya farmer in the state’s Piploda village.</p><p>Corn exporter Hemant Jain also worries about how US goods entering India may affect exports.</p><p>“The soya and corn from India have a major demand in the international market due to their non-GM quality,” Jain said.</p><p>“The import of GM material would create a doubt of adulteration in the minds of foreign buyers, who might be reluctant to buy from us.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181559\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181559\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG20251204094456-1766044326.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181559\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG20251204094456-1766044326.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soybean India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian growers cannot win against US farmers, who have large plots of land and heavy government subsidies, experts say [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Indra Shekhar Singh, an independent agrarian analyst in New Delhi, said farmers in India have average land holdings of about 2 hectares (5 acres), on which five to seven members of a family work and rely for food and livelihood. They often also have to work on other people’s land as labourers for more income.</p><p>This is unlike the US, where farmers have vast stretches of land for cultivation and, depending on the crop, receive heavy subsidies from the government.</p><p>“The US is trying to find an alternative market to China, but Indian farmers can’t win against the US government’s subsidised agri-commodities. They would capture the complete market in a few years, leaving our farmers in deep poverty and helplessness,” Singh said.</p><h2 id=\"strong-lobby-at-work\">Strong lobby at work</h2><p>However, some scientists and industry watchers believe there are benefits to GM production of soya and corn in India.</p><p>A senior scientist working with the Indian government on GM technology told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media that the introduction of the technology would allow farmers to use specific herbicides to control weeds without harming the crop.</p><p>“The GM technology is insect-resistant, and it would help to reduce the need for spraying insecticides and lower costs for farmers. Besides, production also increases massively in the GM technique that helps farmers to minimise their losses.”</p><p>Kawaljeet Bhatia, 52, a poultry feed supplier in India, said the production of corn and soya beans would increase manifold with the introduction of GM varieties, which would help farmers and businesses like his, which are part of the production chain.</p><p>But he suggested that the government develop its own GM seeds, instead of importing them.</p><p>“A handful of exporters receive a premium price, as they claim to export organic products. They want that status to continue as it benefits them. It is just a matter of time when we have to switch to GM for increased productivity,” Bhatia said.</p><p>The Indian government is being cautious, political analysts told Al Jazeera. Agriculture contributes 18 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) and supports 46 percent of its population.</p><p>“The government is acting with caution, taking lessons from the massive farmers’ protest that had rocked the nation in 2020-21,” Sibaji Pratim Basu, an independent political commentator in Kolkata, West Bengal, told Al Jazeera, referring to the yearlong protests by tens of thousands of farmers in northern India against three farm laws introduced by the government. The protests ended only after the government withdrew those rules.</p><p>“There are already hiccups in India-US relations due to tariffs that have badly hit several businesses in India dependent on the US market. The government is definitely concerned about its vote bank before taking any decision,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Russian investors pointed the finger at Ukraine. Kyiv has not commented on the incident.</li>\n<li>Russian forces struck <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/russian-attack-on-ukraines-odesa-kills-at-least-8-as-peace-talks-lumber-on\">Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odesa</a> late on Monday, damaging port facilities and a ship in the second such attack on the region in less than 24 hours, according to Ukrainian officials.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said on the Telegram app that the latest attack on Odesa is part of Russia’s attempt “to disrupt maritime logistics by launching systematic attacks on port and energy infrastructure”.</li>\n<li>Kuleba said the attack also caused damage to energy infrastructure, disrupting electricity supply to more than 120,000 customers in the Odesa region. One person was hurt in the attack, the Ministry of Internal Affairs said.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed media reports that residents of Hrabovske village, straddling the border with Russia in Ukraine’s Sumy region and home to 52 people, were taken by Russian troops. Zelenskyy said that 13 Ukrainian servicemen were among those taken.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s military said it hit a Tamanneftegaz oil terminal in Russia’s Krasnodar region in an overnight attack, causing explosions and a fire. The Ukrainian General Staff said the oil terminal was part of Russia’s energy infrastructure that supported the financing and logistics of Russian troops fighting in Ukraine.</li>\n<li>A Ukrainian drone attack also damaged two vessels in the same region. All crew on the ships at the Volna terminal have been safely evacuated, according to regional authorities.</li>\n<li>Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it had captured Vilcha village in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region. The claim could not be immediately verified.</li>\n</ul><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>US President Donald Trump said that talks to end the war in Ukraine are going “OK”, amid questions about their progress, with Moscow and Kyiv still far apart on some key matters.</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy, meanwhile, described the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/us-talks-with-russia-ukraine-in-miami-constructive-productive\">negotiations in Miami</a> as “very close to a real result”. He also told a gathering of Ukrainian diplomats that the peace process “all looks quite worthy”, even as he conceded that “not everything is ideal with this, but the plan is there”.</li>\n<li>Separately, in his nightly video address to the nation, Zelenskyy said the key issue in the talks was to determine whether the US was able to “get a response from Russia; real readiness on the part of that country to focus on something other than aggression”. He said that continued pressure on the Kremlin was vital to reduce Moscow’s capacity to wage war.</li>\n<li>The Kremlin said talks between Russia and the US in Miami on ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine should not be seen as a breakthrough. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Izvestia news outlet that the discussions were expected to continue in a “meticulous” expert-level format.</li>\n<li>Peskov also questioned the reliability of the sources cited in a Reuters news agency report, which said that the US intelligence community believes Putin wants to seize all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet bloc. Peskov told reporters in Moscow that if the report was accurate, then the US’s intelligence conclusions were wrong.</li>\n<li>Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov declared that Moscow is ready to confirm in a legal agreement that it has no intention of attacking either the European Union or the US-led NATO military alliance, the state RIA news agency reported.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"military-aid\">Military aid</h2><ul>\n<li>The Czech Republic’s National Security Council will debate the future of a Czech-led, Western-financed scheme organising artillery ammunition supplies for Ukraine on January 7, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said.

Swedish customs declined to say what cargo the Adler had been carrying.

These are bigger. They’ll be 100 times the force, the power [of the old ships], and there’s never been anything like these ships,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that the vessels would be “cutting edge” and equipped with the latest technology, including artificial intelligence and directed energy lasers. They will also be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles and rail guns – all technologies that are in various stages of development by the US Navy.</p><p>“Each one of these will be the largest battleship in the history of our country, the largest battleship in the history of the world,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump downplayed the idea that the new ships were meant to counter any particular country, saying that they were “a counter to everybody”.</p><p>The US president said that production would start with two ships, but could scale up to 10, and as many as 25, over an unspecified period of time.</p><p>Trump said work on the first two would begin “immediately” and that the first ship would be named the USS Defiant.</p><p>Both Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically, that term has referred to a very specific type of ship – a large, heavily armoured vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.</p><p>This type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the US battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tonnes. But after World War II, the battleship’s role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favour of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles.</p><p>Trump referenced the Great White Fleet, commissioned by former President Theodore Roosevelt during the early 20th century as a symbol of US naval strength, as well as a documentary about naval warfare during the second world war.</p><p>“Victory at Sea. I don’t know if anyone has seen Victory at Sea, but it was a classic,” he said, adding that the new ships would help “maintain American military supremacy”.</p><p>According to a newly created website for the Golden Fleet, this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships, but only weigh about half as much, approximately 35,000 tonnes, and have far smaller crews – between 650 and 850 sailors.</p><p>Its primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.</p><p>Trump said the naval expansion would also be paired with renewed pressure on defence contractors to ‌speed up production and rein in costs.</p><p>He said he will meet with major defence firms next week to address delays and overruns, ‌and to examine whether executive compensation, stock buybacks and dividends ⁠are contributing to missed production targets.</p><p>“We don’t want to have executives making $50m a year, issuing big dividends to everybody, and also doing buybacks”, while production of F-35s and other jets languishes, Trump said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
