But celebrations returned on Wednesday with parades and music. Hundreds of worshippers also gathered for mass at the Church of the Nativity on Wednesday night.</p><p class=\"p1\">With pews filled long before midnight, many stood or sat on the floor for the traditional mass to usher in Christmas Day.</p><p class=\"p1\">At 11:15 pm (21:15 GMT), organ music rang out as a procession of dozens of clergymen entered, followed by Jerusalem’s Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa, who blessed the crowd with signs of the cross.</p><p class=\"p1\">In his homily, Pizzaballa urged peace, hope and rebirth, saying the Nativity story still held relevance in the turbulence of modern times.</p><p class=\"p1\">He also spoke of his visit to Gaza over the weekend, where he said “suffering is still present” despite the ceasefire. In the Strip, hundreds of thousands of people face a bleak winter in makeshift tents.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The wounds are deep, yet I have to say, here too, there too, their proclamation of Christmas resounds,” Pizzaballa said. “When I met them, I was struck by their strength and desire to start over.”</p><p class=\"p1\">In Bethlehem, hundreds also took part in the parade down the narrow Star Street on Wednesday, while a dense crowd massed in the square. As darkness fell, multi-coloured lights shone over Manger Square and a towering Christmas tree glittered next to the Church of the Nativity.</p><p class=\"p1\">The basilica dates back to the fourth century and was built on top of a grotto where Christians believe Jesus was born more than 2,000 years ago.</p><p class=\"p1\">Bethlehem residents hoped the return of Christmas festivities would breathe life back into the city.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The process has historically been deeply contested by candidates seeking top office.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The incumbent president, Mohamud, who won power twice through this system, announced in 2023 his commitment to transition to universal suffrage at the local, federal and presidential level.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">His government secured parliamentary approval for constitutional reforms and established a national electoral commission to oversee the transition, a move that has galvanised major opposition figures, including two former presidents.</p><p>An agreement reached in October 2024 between federal and regional leaders collapsed amid bitter opposition, complicating upcoming presidential polls.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"more-of-a-symbolic-vote\">‘More of a symbolic vote’</h2><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Prominent opposition figures have openly criticised the Mogadishu vote and the government’s overall trajectory, accusing it of excluding them from the electoral process.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed described the procedures as “unfortunate,” attacking what he called an “exclusionary voter registration process” that lacks legitimacy.

weapons smugglers in the country’s northern border regions with Syria, targeting sites used as “launch points” by trafficking groups into Jordanian territory, according to reports.</p><p>The Jordan News Agency, Petra, said the strikes on Wednesday “neutralised a number of arms and drug traffickers who organise weapons and <a

destroyed “factories and workshops” used by the trafficking groups, Petra reports, adding that the attacks were carried out based on “precise intelligence” and in coordination with regional partners.</p><p>The Jordanian military did not name the partner countries involved in the strikes but warned that it would “continue to counter any threats with force at the appropriate time and place”, Petra said.</p><p>Syrian state broadcaster Al-Ikhbariah TV reported on its Telegram channel that the Jordanian army had carried out air strikes on locations in the southern and eastern countryside of Syria’s Suwayda governorate.</p><p>A resident of Syria’s Suwayda border region told the AFP news agency that the bombardment “was extremely intense and targeted farms and smuggling routes”, while the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said jets and helicopters had reportedly taken part in the raid.</p><p>The observatory said photos taken at the scene of the attacks showed destruction at an abandoned military barracks of the former al-Assad regime in Suwayda.</p><p>There were no initial reports of casualties from the Jordanian attacks and no official comment from authorities in Damascus.</p><p>A farm believed to have been used for storing drugs was among the targets, according to the Zaman Al Wasl online news site, which also reported that similar Jordanian attacks had been carried out previously in a bid to <a href=\"/news/2023/5/9/what-is-captagon-the-addictive-drug-mass-produced-in-syria\">stem the flow of captagon</a> – an addictive, amphetamine-type stimulant.</p><p>Before the removal of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, captagon had become the regime’s largest export and key source of funding amid the country’s years of grinding civil war.</p><p>Produced in vast quantities in Syria, the synthetic drug flooded the region, particularly the Gulf states, prompting neighbouring countries to announce seizures and call on both Lebanon and Damascus to ramp up efforts to combat the trade.</p><p>Although Damascus denied any involvement in the drug trade, analysts estimated that production and smuggling of captagon brought in billions of dollars for al-Assad, his associates and allies as they looked for an economic lifeline amid the civil war, which was fought between 2011 and the regime’s toppling last year.</p><p><img

Israel has also increased the ferocity of its raids on Bethlehem and the occupied West Bank, where more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the past two years.</p><p>Attacks from the Israeli military and settlers alike have not spared Palestinian Christians, with attacks on Gaza’s <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/israel-bombs-gazas-only-catholic-church-sheltering-elderly-and-children\">only Catholic church</a> killing three in July, and a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/14/church-leaders-diplomats-condemn-israeli-settler-violence-in-west-bank\">predominantly Christian town</a> in the West Bank in the same month.</p><p>A ceasefire in Gaza that began in October has brought some respite, even as Israel continues its violations and attacks on the Strip, killing hundreds of people. The Israeli army also continued its military raids in <span>the occupied West Bank.</span></p><p>And even as the festive atmosphere lightened the mood in Manger Square, the reality of the war was not absent. Israeli military raids and checkpoints continued, with Israeli forces arresting three young men from the nearby refugee camps of Dheisheh and Aida just hours before the celebrations began.</p><p>Pizzaballa, who has just returned from Gaza, was quick to reference the suffering of Palestinians.</p><p>“In Gaza … I witnessed total destruction,” he said. “But amid Gaza’s destruction, I felt a passion for life. In the midst of nothingness, people created reasons for joy and celebration. They reminded us that we can return and rebuild again despite human destruction.”</p><p>“We will be able to celebrate in Gaza and Bethlehem,” Pizzaballa continued. “We will return to rebuild everything anew.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194655\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194655\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194655\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00010-1766614086.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa greets Palestinian residents and well-wishers as he arrives at the Church of the Nativity on December 24, on the occasion of Christmas.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa greets Palestinian residents and well-wishers as he arrives at the Church of the Nativity on December 24 [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"tough-journey\">Tough journey</h2><p>About 1,500 people – both Palestinians and foreign visitors – attended the Christmas celebrations, which have become one of the biggest symbols of Christian life in the region, even as the percentage of Palestinian Christians living in the West Bank gets smaller as a result of the Israeli occupation, among other factors.</p><p>George Zalloum, from occupied East Jerusalem, was one of the Palestinian Christians who had made the journey to Bethlehem.</p><p>He told Al Jazeera that he was enjoying the atmosphere, but that it was tinged with sorrow.</p><p>“Today’s atmosphere is half joy and half sadness, because we have brothers who are still dying in Gaza due to the ongoing bombardment and killing there,” Zalloum told Al Jazeera. “We hope the war will end, the killing will stop, peace will prevail in the Holy Land, and that these holidays … will continue.”</p><p>Other Palestinians travelled to Bethlehem from cities and villages across the West Bank, but their journeys highlighted the difficulties placed on them by Israel.</p><p>Many waited for hours at checkpoints surrounding Bethlehem, even as the physical distance between their homes and the city was not long.</p><p>“It is true that the atmosphere of joy, love and peace has returned to us, but the road to Bethlehem was difficult,” said Hussam Zraiqat, who travelled to Manger Square from Birzeit, near Ramallah. “We spent a long time at an Israeli military checkpoint, but thank God, we arrived.”</p><p>That was echoed by another Palestinian attendee, Ghassan Rizqallah, from the village of Jifna, also near Ramallah.</p><p>“We faced the military checkpoint, where we waited for at least an hour and a half before we were able to enter the city,” Rizqallah said. “The journey was very difficult.”</p><p>But once he arrived, Rizqallah was overjoyed to experience the Christmas atmosphere. “Watching the scout bands and hearing the music takes us back to the beautiful past of our country, our land, and our heritage – and we deserve to live in safety and peace.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194659\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194659\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194659\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00003-1766614156.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinian young women play drums\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194659\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Christmas celebrations had been suspended in Bethlehem for the past two years because of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and raids in the occupied West Bank [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"vital-tourism\">Vital tourism</h2><p>Bethlehem’s mayor, Maher Canawati, said that the Manger Square celebrations carried a meaning that went beyond Bethlehem.</p><p>“Bethlehem’s message today is one of steadfastness and hope for the people of the city, for Gaza, and for all of Palestine,” Canawati told Al Jazeera. “Today, we send a message to the entire world that the Palestinian people love life and peace, and that they cannot be uprooted from their land and their roots because they are the rightful owners.”</p><p>Canawati pointed to tentative signs of economic revival in the city, whose Church of the Nativity is a major site of Christian pilgrimage, after a prolonged collapse in tourism.</p><p>“All the Bethlehem hotels are reopening their doors to receive local and foreign visitors after nearly two years of almost complete shutdown,” Canawati said. “God willing, the wheel of tourism has started turning again.”</p><p>Bethlehem’s economy, heavily dependent on tourism, has been badly hit. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism, hotel occupancy rates since the beginning of the year stood at only 25 percent.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194667\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194667\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194667\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image00017-1766614496.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Women gathered at a barrier\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinians travelled from across the West Bank and Israel to attend the celebrations in Bethlehem [Ahmad Jubran/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Elias al-Arja, the head of the Palestinian Hotel Association, said that hotels in Bethlehem had suffered $300m in losses this year. However, the renewal of the Christmas celebrations has been a huge boon.</p><p>“Hotel occupancy rates over the past two days have risen to 80 percent, with around 8,000 visitors – 6,000 of them Palestinian citizens of Israel, and 2,000 from various nationalities from Europe and the United States,” al-Arja said.</p><p>Some of those visitors took the opportunity to watch the Christmas celebrations in Manger Square.</p><p>“It is good to see these celebrations returning,” said Dwayne Jefferson, who travelled from the US state of North Carolina. “It is a positive experience and opens the door to the possibility that this entire region can return to a state of normal life. I am very happy to be here.”</p><p>Jean Charles, a tourist from Italy, said that it was his first visit to Bethlehem, and that he was happy to see so much joy after two years of war.</p><p>“I see this feast as a celebration for every Palestinian, not only Christians,” said Charles. “I see Muslims here as well, and this is very important and interesting for the future of this people.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, I noticed the low number of tourists … But honestly, the situation is very calm.

The losses I suffered cannot be counted,” he said. “We hope there will be more activity at the beginning of the year.”</p><p>Souvenir shop owner Jack Jaqman struck a similar note. “The activity we saw today is not enough … Those who visited Bethlehem were [mainly] foreign workers in Israel from the Philippines, India and Romania, or our own people [living in Israel],” Jaqman said. “Still, it is important in showing the city’s reality and its readiness to receive pilgrims and tourists again.”</p><p>“I have been in my souvenir shop for 10 days and have not felt the presence of real tourist groups that could improve the economic situation,” he said. “On this day, we pray for the end of the siege that has turned Bethlehem into a large prison.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His arrival comes as the BNP regains momentum – after the 2024 ouster of longtime leader Sheikh Hasina.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Rahman’s return comes at a moment “when Bangladesh is going through a very volatile and uncertain future”, said Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury, reporting from Dhaka.</p><p>“Although the election date has been announced, there’s a vacuum for leadership and power, particularly within the Bangladesh Nationalist Party – which is one of the largest parties in Bangladesh – and his mother [who has] been critically ill, is the chairperson of the party. He’s going to fill up that vacuum,” he added.</p><p>Rahman is expected to bring unity to the currently polarised country, even while there is criticism that Hasina’s party is not being allowed to participate in the upcoming election, said Chowdhury.</p><p>The former self-exiled leader is expected to have some success with this as the head of the current interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, while also “immensely popular”, has not been able to “maintain the kind of law and order and stability that was expected, partly because there’s a lot of remnants of the last government who were in the security forces and in the administration”, he added.</p><h2 id=\"shifting-political-landscape\">Shifting political landscape</h2><p class=\"p1\">Rahman had been unable to return to Bangladesh for years while facing multiple criminal cases at home.</p><p class=\"p1\">He was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate Hasina, but the rulings were overturned after Hasina was ‌ousted last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to Rahman’s return.</p><p>Rahman’s move to London was for medical treatment after he was allegedly tortured while in custody during the military-backed government that ruled from 2006 to 2008.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4195061\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4195061\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4195061\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-25T072935Z_927277085_RC2HNIADJM8M_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-BNP-1766650001.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"BNP\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4195061\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters of the BNP gather to join a grand rally to welcome Rahman, in Dhaka on December 25 [Anik Rahman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p class=\"p1\">His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda Zia seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception ‌venue before visiting his mother.</p><p class=\"p1\">The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasina’s removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda ‌Zia largely alternated in office.</p><p>Khaleda Zia, a former housewife, came to politics after her husband, former military chief and then president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in a military coup in 1981. A non-elected government backed by the military took over in 2006 during a period of political chaos.</p><p class=\"p1\">A December survey by the United States-based ⁠International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats in the elections, with the Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race. Hasina’s Awami League party, which has been barred from the election, has ‌threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote.</p><p class=\"p1\">Bangladesh is heading to the polls under Yunus. While authorities have pledged a free and ‍peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman’s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

optimism”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of

likely to accept (or believe, hope?) future improvements this year, but they still do so with caution,” the organisation said in a review of its survey findings released online.</p><p>In a year-end presentation, VTsIOM deputy head Mikhail Mamonov said 70 percent of 1,600 people surveyed ​viewed 2026 as being a more “successful” year for Russia than this year, with 55 percent of respondents linking hope for a better year ‍to a possible end to what Russia officially calls its <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1400\">“special military operation” in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>“The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president,” Mamonov ‍said at the ⁠presentation.</p><p>Mamonov pointed to the Russian military’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/why-is-russia-escalating-attacks-on-ukraines-odesa\">ongoing offensive in Ukraine</a>, Washington’s reluctance to finance the Ukraine war and the European Union’s inability to fully replace the ‌United States’ role in Ukraine – financially and militarily – as key factors behind the prospects for an eventual deal to end the fighting.</p><p>At the conclusion of the conflict, reintegration of Russian military veterans into society and the reconstruction of Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine, as well as Russian border areas, will be the main priorities, Mamonov added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While the actual level of Russian public fatigue with the war is difficult to measure due to strict state controls on the media, expressions of public dissent as well as the prosecution of those who criticise Moscow’s war on its neighbour, approximately two-thirds of Russians support peace talks, according to independent pollster Levada, the highest number since the start of the war in 2022.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in comments released on Wednesday that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Moscow reciprocated by also pulling back its forces and allowed the area to become a demilitarised zone monitored by international forces.</p><p>In comments to reporters about an overarching 20-point plan that negotiators from Ukraine and the US had hammered out in Florida in recent days, Zelenskyy also said that a similar arrangement could be possible for the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently under Russian control.</p><p></p><p>Russia has given no indication that it will agree to any kind of withdrawal from land it has seized in Ukraine and has long insisted that Kyiv must give up the remaining territory it still holds in the Donbas industrial area before any discussions on the cessation of fighting.</p><p>Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70 percent of Donetsk – the two regions that make up the Donbas.</p><p>Zelenskyy also said that figuring out the future control of the Donbas as part of the plan was “the most difficult point”, and creating a demilitarised economic zone in the region would require difficult discussions on how far troops would be required to move back and where international forces would be stationed.</p><p>Such discussions should be held at the leaders’ level, he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Packed with protein, calcium, antioxidants and vitamins, the nuts have rapidly gained a reputation as major immunity boosters.</p><p>But they haven’t been immune to the effects of Trump’s tariffs: The US president first hit Indian goods with a 25 percent levy, then doubled that <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/27/trumps-india-tariffs-take-effect-which-sector-will-be-hit-whats-exempt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to 50 percent</a> on account of Indian imports of Russian oil, which he said were helping fuel Russia’s war on Ukraine.

The country dominates 90 percent of the global production.</p><p>The state produces 120,000 metric tonnes of seeds and 40,000 tonnes of popped fox nuts annually across 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) of land.</p><p>The cultivation is done in shallow agricultural fields with a depth of about 1.3 to 1.8 metres (4 to 6 feet). It is not expensive, as new plants easily germinate from older seeds.</p><p>The harvesting season starts from mid-July and continues until the end of November, during which labourers sweep the entire body of water collected on fields for seeds with traditional tools like horn-shaped split bamboo and nets, depending on the seeds’ size.</p><p>The collected seeds are first sun-dried, and then heated in a clay or iron pan to make the outer shells brittle. The seeds are finally hammered to release the whiter edible makhana puff, which is again roasted for a final crunch.</p><p>In 2024-25, India exported approximately 800 metric tonnes of fox nuts to countries like Germany, China, the US and the Middle East. But the US – where 50 percent of India’s exported fox nuts go – dominates the market, said Satyajit Singh, whose company, Shakti Sudha Agro Ventures, controls half of India’s total exports of the health food.</p><p>The total industry turnover – including the domestic market – is about 3.6 billion rupees ($40m), Singh told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But the sector has huge opportunities, as it is still in a nascent stage and limited to [the] Indian diaspora in [the] international market, and we need to spread more awareness about it both domestically and abroad,” he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181653\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181653\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251202-WA0067-1766045618.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181653\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251202-WA0067-1766045618.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fox nuts India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181653\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The sector is still in the nascent stage [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>He is already seeing demand from new markets, like Spain and South Africa, driven by the Indian diaspora and awareness of the health benefits of fox nuts, he said.</p><p>Ketan Bengani, 28, a Kolkata-based fox nut exporter, told Al Jazeera that the domestic demand for fox nuts has also been doubling each year since the COVID-19 pandemic, when people became aware of the nuts’ health benefits.</p><p>His exports to the US of about 46 metric tonnes have dropped by 40 percent due to the tariffs. But he is not too worried, and expects to make that up with the rising demand in India, he said.</p><p>In fact, the high demand has attracted several budding entrepreneurs.</p><p>Among them is Md Gulfaraz, 27, a fox nut producer and exporter based in Charkhi village in the Purnea district of Bihar.</p><p>Gulfaraz told Al Jazeera that this company’s sales have jumped from 5.4 million rupees ($60,000) in 2019 to 45 million rupees ($500,00) in the financial year ending March 2025, thanks to burgeoning domestic demand.</p><h2 id=\"strong-domestic-market\">Strong domestic market</h2><p>Makhanas, as fox nuts are popularly known in India, used to be common in Indian kitchens historically, but like many traditional foods, lost out to the slick marketing campaigns, branding and flavours of Western and more modern Indian snacks.</p><p>The pandemic served as a blessing in disguise, bringing fox nuts back in favour because of their immunity benefits. Now, makhanas line Indian supermarket shelves, with flavours ranging from peri peri to tangy tomato, cheese to onion and cream.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181647\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181647\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251202-WA0060-1766045608.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181647\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251202-WA0060-1766045608.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fox nuts India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181647\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Indian government has announced a makhana board to help the sector grow [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Sujay Verma, 43, a software engineer in Kolkata, who is a native of Bihar and grew up eating fox nuts, told Al Jazeera that he gives a plate to his two daughters every day at breakfast.</p><p>“We were rushing after the packed food items that were expensive and creating a hole in my pocket. But fox nuts are not only cheap, but also good for health,” he said.</p><p>The Indian government has also seen the business potential of fox nuts. Earlier this year, it announced the formation of a makhana board at an initial outlay of one billion rupees ($11m) to institutionalise the value chain and provide training, technical support, quality regulation and export facilitation to businesses.</p><p>The drive from the Indian government comes from the top: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a rally earlier this year that he eats fox nuts most days, and that it was time that India took the super food to the world.</p><p>Farmers and labourers are also switching to fox nut production from other crops due to higher returns.</p><p>Anil Kumar, assistant professor at Bhola Paswan Shastri Agricultural College in Purnia in Bihar, told Al Jazeera that the labourers who collect seeds earn about 2,000 rupees ($22) per day for every 50kg (110lbs) collected. This is more than double the 700 to 900 rupees ($8-$10) paid normally to unskilled labourers in India.</p><p>The production of fox nuts was limited to 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) of land in 2010, and farmers were paid 81 rupees ($0.90) per kilogramme, he said. Now, about 40,000 (99,000 acres) hectares of land are being used to cultivate fox nuts, while farmers get 450 rupees ($5) per kilogramme.</p><p>“The tariffs won’t hurt us, as the demand is increasing globally,” said Satyajit, from Shakti Sudha Agro Ventures.</p></div></div></body></html>"
