They’re not asking to take it over,” the ambassador replied.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The US envoy, an avowed Christian Zionist and <a href=\"/news/2024/11/13/who-is-mike-huckabee-the-evangelical-pro-settlement-envoy-to-israel\">staunch defender</a> of Israel, later appeared to walk back his assertion, saying that it “was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”.</p><p>Still, he left the door open for Israeli expansionism based on his religious interpretation.</p><p>“If they end up getting attacked by all these places, and they win that war, and they take that land, OK, that’s a whole other discussion,” Huckabee said.</p><p>The Department of State did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on whether Secretary of State Marco Rubio shares Huckabee’s views on Israel’s right to expand.</p><p>The principle of territorial integrity and the prohibition against the acquisition of land by force have been a bedrock of international law since World War II.</p><p>In 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must cease immediately.</p><p>But Israeli law does not clearly demarcate the country’s borders. Israel also occupies the Golan Heights in Syria, which it illegally annexed in 1981.</p><p>The US is the only country that recognises Israel’s claimed sovereignty over the Syrian territory.</p><p>After the 2024 war with Hezbollah, Israel also set up military outposts in five points inside Lebanon.</p><p>Some Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/8/16/arab-islamic-countries-condemn-netanyahus-greater-israel-remark\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, have openly promoted the idea of a “Greater Israel” with expanded borders.</p><p>Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stirred <a href=\"/news/2023/3/21/arab-states-condemn-israeli-ministers-no-palestinians-remark\">international outrage</a> in 2023 when he spoke at an event featuring a map that included the Palestinian territories and portions of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as part of Israel, set against the colours of the Israeli flag.</p><p>In his interview with Carlson, Huckabee tried to argue that Israel’s right to exist is rooted in international law, but he also attacked the legal institutions that oversee international law for their opposition to Israeli abuses.</p><p>“One of the reasons I’m so grateful President Trump and Secretary Rubio are pushing hard, trying to get rid of the ICC [International Criminal Court] and the ICJ is because they have become rogue organisations that are no longer really about an equal application of law,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Beyond his professed religious devotion to Israel, Huckabee has faced criticism for failing to speak up for the rights of US citizens who <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/young-palestinian-shot-killed-by-israeli-settlers-northeast-of-jerusalem\">have been killed</a> and imprisoned by Israeli forces during his ambassadorship.</p><p>Last year, Huckabee even sparked anger from some conservatives in the US when he met with convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, who sold US intelligence secrets to the Israeli government, details of which later made it to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.</p><p>Pollard, a former civilian analyst in the US Navy, served 30 years in jail and <a href=\"/news/2020/12/30/convicted-us-spy-pollard-arrives-in-israel\">moved to Israel</a> in 2020 after his release. He never expressed regret for his crimes, and in 2021, he called on Jewish employees in US security agencies to spy for Israel.</p><p>Huckabee said he does not agree with Pollard’s views, but he denied hosting him, arguing that he simply held a meeting with him at the US embassy in Jerusalem.</p><p>Asked if anyone can walk into the embassy to meet the envoy, Huckabee acknowledged that such a meeting requires a pre-approved appointment.</p><p>“He was able to come to the US embassy to have a meeting at his request. I did, and frankly, I don’t regret it,” Huckabee said.</p><p>“I met with a lot of people over the course of the time I’ve been here and will meet with a lot more.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In his dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that issuing refunds would present practical challenges and said it would be “a mess”.</p><p>The case will now return to the Court of International Trade to oversee the refund process.</p><p>More than 1,000 lawsuits have already been filed by importers in the trade court seeking refunds, and a wave of new cases is expected. Legal experts say the administration will likely require importers to apply for refunds individually. That process could disproportionately <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/9/i-dont-have-the-cash-to-pay-for-these-tariffs-us-small-biz-suffers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">burden smaller businesses</a> affected by the tariffs.</p><p>“The government is probably not going to voluntarily pay back the money it unlawfully took. Rather, the government is going to make everyone request a refund through different procedures by filing formal protests. They’re going to delay things procedurally as long as they can. Hiring lawyers and going through these procedures costs money and time,” Greg Shaffer, a law professor at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“I imagine the largest companies, who have been prepared for this eventuality, will eventually get their money back. But smaller importers, it’s a cost-benefit analysis where they might shrug their shoulders and say it’s not worth going through the hassle to get the unlawfully imposed taxes paid back to them.”</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-path-forward\">Trump’s path forward</h2><p>Despite Friday’s ruling, other sweeping levies remain in place. Trump had invoked Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act to impose sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminium, cars, copper, lumber, and other products, such as kitchen cabinets, worldwide.</p><p>On Friday, Trump said he would impose a 10 percent global tariff for 150 days to replace some of his emergency duties that were struck down. The order would be made under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and the duties would be over and above tariffs that are currently in place, Trump said.</p><p>The statute allows the president to impose duties of up to 15 percent for up to 150 days on any and all countries related to “large and serious” balance of payments issues. It does not require investigations or impose other procedural limits.</p><p>The president also has other legal avenues available to continue taxing imports aggressively.</p><p>“Our trading partners were well aware of the risks the President faced in using IEEPA as the basis for reciprocal and other tariffs. Nevertheless, they chose to conclude deals with Washington, convinced by Washington that other statutes would be utilised to keep the tariffs in place,” Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p><p>“With respect to China, USTR [United States trade representative] still has an active Section 301 investigation on China’s compliance with the Phase One agreement, which could be a major feature of the back-up plan for Beijing.”</p><p>The president is expected to travel to Beijing next month to meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to discuss trade.</p><p>“The two main options include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the traditional mechanism for imposing tariffs in response to unfair trade practices by other countries. It requires an investigation and a report, but ultimately gives the president considerable discretion to impose tariffs. It has been used in the past and will likely be the most frequently used measure going forward,” Shaffer, the law professor, said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He noted, however, that the administration’s tariff options could not be applied retroactively, meaning any new tariffs would apply only to future imports rather than covering duties already paid.</p><p>Raj Bhala, professor of law at The University of Kansas School of Law, argues there are remedies at the president’s disposal in addition to Section 122. Bhala said that Trump could use Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (also known as the Smoot-Hawley Act). That allows the president to impose a 50 percent tariff to challenge discriminatory trade practices from other countries.</p><p>“Each option involves procedural hurdles,” Bhala said.</p><h2 id=\"congressional-pressure\">Congressional pressure</h2><p>Roberts wrote that the president must “point to clear congressional authorization” to impose tariffs. The ruling has increased pressure on both Trump’s allies and critics in Congress to clarify the scope of executive trade authority.</p><p>“What a fantastic ruling for a feckless branch of government. While its current tendency is to abdicate, the court has told Congress to do its job,” a former official in the White House Office of Management and Budget told Al Jazeera in response to the decision.</p><p>“Congress must either act with specific legislation, or declare war, which would grant the President the emergency powers to levy tariffs.”</p><p>“Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a post on the social media platform X.</p><p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, by contrast, welcomed the ruling, saying it will “finally give families and small businesses the relief they deserve” and that Trump should end “this reckless trade war for good.”</p><p>But how that money will get paid back, and if it was already spent, will require Congress to step in.</p><p>“If it has been spent, the money will have to be reallocated by Congress. Congress will have to determine how much is owed to importers, pass a law to fund it, and create a mechanism for repayment. There’s also the question of who is entitled to it. Is it only the importer, or does it extend to the end consumer? Where does the line stop?” Babak Hafezi, professor of international business at American University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is not something that will be fixed in 24 hours. It will most likely take years, possibly even a decade, to resolve all the issues this less-than-a-year-old law has imposed on Americans.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They emphasised that Congress alone holds the power to levy tariffs in peacetime.</p><p>But instead of using IEEPA, Trump said on Friday that he would turn to the Trade Expansion Act to impose a 10 percent global tariff for 150 days, replacing some of the tariffs that were struck down by the court.</p><p>He added that investigations into unfair trade practices would allow him to expand his tariff campaign as well.</p><p>“We’re going straight ahead with 10 percent, straight across the board, which was the absolute right to do,” Trump said.</p><p>“That’s a lot of money coming into our country. And then during that period of about five months, we are doing the various investigations necessary to put fair tariffs — or tariffs, period — on other countries.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"future-of-us-tariff-revenue\">Future of US tariff revenue</h2><p>The duties would be over and above some of the tariffs that are currently in place, specifically the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminium, auto parts and other products. The new 10 percent tariff is expected to go into effect in about three days.</p><p>Friday’s decision was a major blow to Trump’s economic agenda as the tariffs were expected to rake in nearly $3.6 trillion in revenue from 2026 to 2035, as per estimates by Oxford Economics.</p><p>Friday’s ruling sharply lowers the effective tariff rate immediately to 8.3 percent from 12.7 percent, according to Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics.</p><p>But the US president has argued that his powers under the Trade Expansion Act could result in even higher tariff revenue in the long run.</p><p>“In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past period of a year under the various tariffs authorities,” Trump said.</p><p>“So we can use other of the statutes [sic], other of the tariff authorities, which have also been confirmed and are fully allowed.”</p><h2 id=\"tariff-cudgel-diminished\">‘Tariff cudgel diminished’</h2><p>That will be easier said than done, experts warned.</p><p>“Overall, it’s still a block to the Trump administration as it is harder to announce and implement tariffs quickly,” Rachel Ziemba, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The administration, as expected, is trying to patch together, via existing tools, a set of measures that will maintain tariff revenue and some leverage. But it is a time of uncertainty.”</p><p>In a note to Al Jazeera, Kimberly Clausing, a researcher at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, agreed that, with Friday’s ruling, “the strength of the president’s tariff cudgel is diminished”.</p><p>“Governments abroad and businesses at home can both expect, somewhat, less mercurial US tariff processes,” she said.</p><p>But the uncertainty that US consumers and businesses have faced over the past year is far from over, given Trump’s plan to pivot to other means to levy tariffs.</p><p>“This means that Trump’s tariffs will continue to burden the US economy, even if alternative instruments are not as agile or broad as the IEEPA tariffs,” Clausing said.</p><p>Over the last year, Trump has used tariffs not only to raise revenue for the US and increase domestic manufacturing but also as a catchall to pressure countries into compliance with US foreign policy.</p><p>For instance, he slapped India with a punitive 25 percent tariff for buying oil from Russia, a longtime US adversary.</p><p>With the IEEPA no longer available as a cudgel, it’s possible that Trump will lean more heavily on other economic penalties like sanctions — and even military action — to push his agenda.</p><p>“He was already using military force, including to enforce sanctions in Venezuela and Iran,” Ziemba pointed out.</p><p>“The bigger issue is if he tries to continue to pressure friend and foe alike and to change US friends. It’s too soon to tell on this, but his escalate to de-escalate strategy has its costs.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Javier Milei gives answers to the millions of Argentines who are currently in the informal economy,” Bornoroni posted on social media after the vote.</p><p>Since the bill was first drafted, business leaders have been divided over its potential effectiveness.</p><p>Some warned that its provisions, including those affecting collective bargaining and contract stability, could generate feelings of uncertainty among employees.</p><p>Others questioned how much it would boost hiring. Ricardo Diab, president of the Argentinian Confederation of Medium-Sized Enterprises (CAME), said in an interview with Cadena 3 that a law alone is not enough to create jobs.</p><p>“To hire [people], I need to have a need, and for there to be a need, there must be production and consumption,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, opposition politicians and trade unionists argue that the law will strip workers of their basic rights.</p><p>“Workers were already under pressure, and this just delivers another heavy hit, leaving them with very little room to negotiate anything,” Roxana Monzon, a national deputy for the opposition party Union por la Patria, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It means job insecurity for workers, and it will affect the most vulnerable even more.”</p><p>She pointed to the “time bank” as an example of the bill’s problematic proposals.</p><p>Instead of mandating paid overtime, the legislation would allow employers to compensate workers with time off later on, subject to the company’s approval.</p><p>That system, Monzon explained, is ripe for exploitation, since some workers rely on overtime to pay the bills.</p><p>“The hour bank, for example, will affect women in particular, as employers can decide what hours they must work, regardless of other responsibilities they have, such as caring,” Monzon said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326996\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326996\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326996\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Patricio-A.-Cabezas-%E2%80%93-View-of-the-National-Congress-of-Argentina-after-the-repression-of-the-march-against-the-Labor-Reform-08-1771611706.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Police stand behind a metal barricade around Argentina's Congress\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326996\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Law enforcement erects a barricade around Argentina’s Congress in Buenos Aires [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"anxiety-among-workers\">Anxiety among workers</h2><p>As members of Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies debated the bill on Thursday, thousands of people protested outside Congress in solidarity with a nationwide strike organised by the country’s main unions.</p><p>Gabriela Quiroz, a 31-year-old primary school teacher from Villa Soldati, near Buenos Aires, said she already works two jobs to make ends meet. She described the bill as an “abysmal step backwards”.</p><p>“I’m very concerned and anxious about what could happen. As a teacher, I do many extra hours, and now they won’t be paid in cash,” Quiroz said. “I barely make it to the end of the month as it is, and there are many people like me.”</p><p>She added that slashing overtime pay could have wider impacts on Argentina’s economy, with consumers spending less.</p><p>“When people don’t have money, everybody is affected,” she said. “If I don’t have money to spend, I don’t shop in my local shops, so they start to struggle. It’s a vicious circle.”</p><p>Quiroz was among the thousands of people who made their way to Congress, undeterred by the heat and the lack of public transport, one of the services disrupted by the strike.</p><p>The general strike also left airports empty, as hundreds of flights were cancelled. Factories and banks also shuttered for the day, and hospitals only provided emergency services.</p><p>As demonstrations in Buenos Aires drew to a close in the evening, security forces used water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters, a violent response that has become <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/10/14/they-could-have-killed-me-protesters-condemn-state-violence-in-argentina\">increasingly common</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326975\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326975\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Josefina-Salomon-Gabriela-Quiroz-with-sign-is-the-first-formally-employed-woman-in-her-family-at-the-march-against-the-Labor-Reform-1771610980.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gabriela Quiroz holds a sign protesting Argentina's labour reform\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gabriela Quiroz holds up a sign that says, ‘I am the first formal worker in my family.

The bill tries to tackle the issue from several angles.</p><p>Think tanks like the Argentina Institute of Fiscal Analysis have reported that the companies face high costs in hiring new workers, and as many as 40 percent of Argentina’s workers work in the informal sector, without job protections.</p><p>The bill offers incentives to address those issues. But analysts say what is needed is a broader look at the country’s economy.</p><p>While economic activity in Argentina has increased overall, that growth has been uneven. While sectors such as banking and agriculture have improved, manufacturing and commerce have experienced sharp declines in recent years.</p><p>More than <a href=\"https://centrocepa.com.ar/informes/725-analisis-de-la-dinamica-laboral-y-de-empleadores-datos-a-septiembre-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20,000</a> businesses with registered employees shut down between November 2023 and September 2025, at a pace of roughly 30 a day, according to the Center for Political Economics in Argentina (CEPA), a think tank.</p><p>During that same period, CEPA added, about 280,000 workers lost their jobs.</p><p>Stagnant salaries have also struggled to keep up with price increases for basic products and services <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/16/in-argentina-locals-are-taking-loans-to-buy-food\">like food</a>.</p><p>“While in Congress, we are debating the cost of employing people, in many homes, families are discussing whether their children can continue to go to school or need to find any job to help pay for rent and food. Everything snaps at the weakest link,” Monzon said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4327000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4327000\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4327000\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PH-Patricio-A.-Cabezas-%E2%80%93-Young-people-going-to-the-march-against-the-Labor-Reform-1771611767.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Young people march against the labour reform bill, passing posters denouncing the legislation\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4327000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Young demonstrators walk past posters that read, ‘No to the slave labour reform’ [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"significant-win\">Significant win</h2><p>In political terms, meanwhile, analysts say the bill’s passage represents a show of strength from Milei and his party.</p><p>Milei, who was in Washington, DC, on Thursday, celebrated the bill’s success with a <a href=\"https://x.com/JMilei/status/2024714164275421238\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a> on X.</p><p>“Historic. Argentina will be great again,” he wrote, offering his twist on a slogan made famous by United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>Andres Malamud, a senior research fellow at the University of Lisbon’s Institute of Social Sciences, said that for a country like Argentina, with a heavily regulated economy, the labour reform is not the most important bill, but it is the most symbolic.</p><p>It offers a blow to the historical power of Argentina’s unions, long associated with Peronism, the political movement that has governed since 1946, Malamud explained.</p><p>Milei, meanwhile, has rejected Peronism, and his party notched a decisive victory against the left-wing Peronist movement in October during Argentina’s <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/mileis-party-wins-big-in-argentina-midterm-elections-early-results-show\">midterm elections</a>.</p><p>“If international conditions do not worsen and social patience holds, Milei will have achieved what no president since 1983 has: governing longer than non-Peronists while reforming more than Peronists,” Malamud said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Buenos Aires, Susana Amatrudo, 54, a nurse from Avellaneda, told Al Jazeera she fears the changes will have a trickle-down effect across society.</p><p>“When factories close, and people lose their jobs, it affects everybody. People have less money, and they can buy less. This has been happening for a while and will only get worse,” Amatrudo said, tears streaming down her eyes, as she waved a large Argentinian flag in front of Congress.</p><p>“I’m OK, but I know a lot of people who are not, and that’s why we need to keep fighting.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Thursday’s arrest was not related to that allegation.</p><p>In 2022, the king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the US by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.</p><p>Other police forces are also conducting their own investigations into Epstein’s links to the UK, including the assessment of flight logs at airports. They are coordinating their work within a national group.</p><p>On Friday, London’s Metropolitan Police said it was assessing, with the help of US counterparts, whether the capital’s airports, which include Heathrow, “may have been used to facilitate human trafficking and sexual exploitation”.</p><p>It also said that it is asking past and present officers who protected Mountbatten-Windsor to “consider carefully” whether they saw or heard anything that may be relevant to the investigations.</p><p>As of now, it said no new criminal allegations have been made regarding sexual offences within its jurisdiction.</p><p>The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.

The opposition, meanwhile, published evidence suggesting its candidate had won by a considerable margin.</p><p>That prompted a sweeping government crackdown on dissenters.</p><p>In December 2024, Armas was arrested. He said he was taken to a house where he was blindfolded, tied to a chair for days and suffocated with a plastic bag.</p><p>Later, he shared a dingy cell with dozens of other prisoners – and rats. Once he was transferred to El Helicoide, his friends and family had no contact with him for 10 months.</p><p>His release, however, has not meant freedom. The day he stepped out of prison, he celebrated by joining a motorcycle parade with Juan Pablo Guanipa, a prominent politician who had also been freed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325401\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325401\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325401\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26039811205752-1771525517.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Juan Pablo Guanipa and Jesus Armas ride on the backs of motorcycles in a parade\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325401\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Opposition leader Juan Pablo Guanipa, right, and political activist Jesus Armas ride on the backs of motorbikes after their release [Cristian Hernandez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>There was a feeling of energy and optimism, Armas recalled, as they visited the families of other political prisoners. But within hours, Guanipa was abducted by masked individuals. No one knew where he had been taken.</p><p>\"I couldn’t sleep because I was scared,\" he said. His first night home was spent lying in bed, checking for news about Guanipa.</p><p>\"I had all this adrenaline, all these mixed emotions. I was happy because I was with my parents, but there was also fear.\"</p><p>Officials accused Guanipa of breaching the rules of his release, although it is not clear what those limits were. He was held incommunicado for hours before being fitted with an electronic ankle monitor and placed under house arrest.</p><p>Only after the passage of the amnesty bill on Thursday was Guanipa released from house arrest, according to a statement from his brother Tomas Guanipa.</p><p>Still, Guanipa himself warned that the amnesty law would not end the government's oppressive tactics. He highlighted its exclusions and loopholes.</p><p>\"What was approved today in the legislative palace is no amnesty,\" Guanipa <a href=\"https://x.com/JuanPGuanipa/status/2024710922296500571\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media after his second release in less than two weeks.</p><p>\"It is a flawed document intended to blackmail many innocent Venezuelans and excludes several brothers and sisters who remain unjustly behind bars.\"</p><p>For Tineo, cases of re-arrest like Guanipa's show that Venezuela is not sincere about ending government repression.</p><p>\"As long as judicial restrictions remain in place for those released and the 'revolving door' practice continues – new detentions following releases – it can’t be said that there is an end to the policy of persecution,\" she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
