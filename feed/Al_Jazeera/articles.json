Understandings were reached to secure the evacuation of workers in the field and avoid military confrontations to ensure that the oil field and its facilities are not subjected to sabotage and destruction, and tribal leaders also played a role in that.</p><p>The deployment of South Sudan forces was based on a previous oil and security cooperation agreement signed between Khartoum and Juba, which stipulates the protection of oil fields, pipelines and central pumping stations for South Sudan’s oil, in addition to the electricity interconnection project and strengthening cooperation in the energy sector.</p><p>The new factor is the involvement of the RSF.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">South Sudan People’s Defence Forces Chief of Staff Paul Nang said at Heglig that troops entered under a “tripartite agreement” involving President Salva Kiir, SAF chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti, according to state broadcaster SSBC News.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The pact requires both Sudanese forces to withdraw from the area.</p><p>Nang stressed that South Sudanese forces would maintain strict neutrality.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“The primary goal is to completely neutralise the Heglig field from any combat operations”, he said, because it “represents an economic lifeline not only for South Sudan but for Sudan as well”.</p><p>The deployment followed a deadly drone attack on Tuesday evening that killed dozens, including three South Sudanese soldiers.</p><p>SAF confirmed using a drone to target RSF fighters at the facility, though the exact death toll remains unclear. Local media reported that seven tribal leaders and numerous RSF personnel died in the attack.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Approximately 3,900 Sudanese soldiers crossed into South Sudan’s Rubkona County after evacuating Heglig, handing over tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery to South Sudanese authorities, according to Unity State officials in South Sudan.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Thousands of civilians have also fled across the border since Sunday.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Heglig houses a central processing facility able to handle up to 130,000 barrels per day of South Sudanese crude destined for export through Sudanese pipelines.

The paramilitary force secured complete control of Darfur in October with the fall of el-Fasher, prompting international alarm over mass atrocities.</p><p>Activists at the Tawila camp told Al Jazeera that refugees continue arriving, with some forced to sleep outdoors due to insufficient resources.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">UN human rights chief Volker Turk <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/un-warns-sudans-kordofan-faces-mass-atrocities-as-fighting-spreads\">repeated</a> a warning he issued last week that he was “extremely worried that we might see in Kordofan a repeat of the atrocities that have been committed in el-Fasher”, amid RSF advances in the region.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect echoed his warning, with Executive Director Savita Pawnday stressing that Sudan faces “one of the world’s gravest atrocity crises”, where civilians are enduring “unimaginable harm while the international community fails to respond”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The fighting has triggered displacement, with the International Organization for Migration reporting more than 1,000 people fled South Kordofan province in just two days this week as combat intensified around the state capital, Kadugli.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">In el-Fasher, the Sudan Doctors Network reported this week that the RSF is holding more than 19,000 detainees across Darfur prisons, including 73 medical personnel.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The medical advocacy group said cholera outbreaks are killing people due to overcrowding and the absence of adequate healthcare, with more than four deaths recorded weekly from medical neglect.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

In a post on the social media platform X, the Colombian president reminded Trump that his country has been integral in the “war on drugs”.</p><p>“If any country has helped stop thousands of tons of cocaine from being consumed by Americans, it is Colombia,” Petro <a href=\"https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1995948716440821836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>He also warned Trump not to “awaken the jaguar” by launching an attack on an ally.</p><p>“Attacking our sovereignty is declaring war,” Petro said. “Do not damage two centuries of diplomatic relations.”</p><p>Instead, he invited Trump to participate in the fight against cocaine trafficking firsthand: “Come to Colombia, Mr Trump. I invite you, so you can participate in the destruction of the nine laboratories we dismantle every day.”</p><p>In September, however, the Trump administration issued a notice that accused Colombia of having “failed demonstrably” to “adhere to [its] obligations under international counternarcotics agreements”.</p><p>The next month, the US made the historic decision to <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/u-s-decision-not-to-certify-colombias-counternarcotics-efforts-and-sanctions-actions-against-colombian-officials-involved-in-global-illicit-drug-trade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decertify</a> Colombia’s anti-narcotic efforts.

He warned he would not accept deportation flights from the US.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/2/4/petro-vs-trump-the-diplomatic-standoff-that-could-shape-colombias-future\">responded by threatening</a> to slap Colombia with 25-percent tariffs, an amount that would eventually rise to 50 percent. Petro ultimately backed down.</p><p>But the two leaders have continued to exchange blows. Trump, for example, has been highly critical of Petro’s “Total Peace” plan, a blueprint for negotiating with the rebel groups enmeshed in Colombia’s internal conflict.</p><p>The US president has also taken action to punish Petro personally. In September, Petro visited New York City to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where he spoke against Trump and participated in a pro-Palestinian rally.</p><p>Within hours, the Trump administration had yanked Petro’s visa, citing “his reckless and incendiary actions”.</p><p>The next month, it also <a href=\"/news/2025/10/24/us-sanctions-colombias-president-gustavo-petro-escalating-trump-feud\">sanctioned Petro</a>, freezing any assets he may have in the US.</p><p>The Colombian president, meanwhile, has emerged as one of the most vocal detractors of Trump’s bombing campaign in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Since September 2, the Trump administration has attacked at least 22 vessels, killing an estimated 87 people.</p><p>Trump has maintained that the victims are drug traffickers, though neither he nor his officials have offered public evidence to justify their claims. Colombians have been among the victims.</p><p>One boat strike on October 17 allegedly targeted members of Colombia’s National Liberation Army (ELN), a rebel group. Another attack, on October 16, left two survivors, one of whom was Colombian.</p><p>The family of one Colombian citizen, Alejandro Carranza, also filed a complaint this month with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), claiming the fisherman was killed in a strike on September 15.</p><p>Human rights experts at the UN have denounced the bombing campaign as a form of extrajudicial killings. Petro, for his part, has called the attacks “murder” and a violation of Colombian sovereignty.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The only thing they’re allowing at this point is some tarpaulin, which isn’t going to do much for people who need proper shelter.”</p><p>He said Palestinians were being forced to live in “deplorable conditions”, with well more than 50 percent of the population living in tents.</p><p>He anticipated many would attempt to find dry ground inside bombed-out buildings that were at heightened risk of collapse amid the forecast heavy rains and winds.</p><h2 id=\"families-flee-flooding-risk\">Families flee flooding risk</h2><p>Farhan Haq, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, warned that vulnerable groups, including newborn children, are at particular risk from the incoming winter storm.</p><p>About 200 families were expected to arrive at a new displacement site in eastern Khan Younis in the south of the Strip, fleeing a heightened risk of flooding in their present location, he said.</p><p>“These households made the decision to move given the impact of the frequent rains and the risk of flooding,” he said.</p><p>Ismail al-Thawabta, director of Gaza’s Government Media Office, told Al Jazeera that about 288,000 Palestinian families were without shelter as Storm Byron bore down on the enclave, and issued a call to the international community to pressure Israel to allow in supplies to help respond to the storm.</p><p>“We are issuing an urgent appeal to the world, [United States] President Trump and the [United Nations] Security Council to pressure the Israeli occupation,” he said.</p><p>Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, condemned global inaction as families in Gaza braced for the storm.</p><p>“Palestinians in Gaza are literally left alone, freezing and starving in the winter storm,” she posted on X.</p><p>“I keep asking how we became such monsters, [i]ncapable of stopping this nightmare.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

At least <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/another-us-citizen-killed-by-israeli-settler-attack-in-west-bank-family\">two US citizens</a> have been killed in settler attacks this year.</p><p>“When you are dealing with a group of people who continually call for the destruction of the State of Israel, who are OK with signs that say, ‘Jews may not enter these areas’, we want to be free of Jews, how do you make peace with that?” Fine asked Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, during the hearing.</p><p>“How do you create a long-term solution with that? Or is there another way that we have to go?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Klein – who previously used the slur “filthy Arab” and called for profiling Muslims in the US – said Islam needs to undergo a “reformation” and accept “Israel as a Jewish state”.</p><p>“Nobody wants to talk about it. They’re afraid of being called Islamophobic,” Klein said.</p><p>Fine interrupted, saying, “I’m not afraid of that.”</p><p>The Republican US congressman, who represents a district in the state of Florida, then doubled down on his volatile rhetoric.</p><p>“I don’t know how you make peace with those who seek your destruction. I think you destroy them first,” he said.</p><p>A United Nations convention defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, including killing, causing harm, preventing births, forcibly transferring children, and imposing life conditions to cause destruction”.</p><p>Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed nearly 70,400 Palestinians and turned nearly the entire territory into rubble, aimed to destroy the Palestinian people, leading rights groups and <a href=\"/news/2025/9/16/first-head-of-united-nations-body-declares-israels-gaza-war-a-genocide\">UN investigators</a> have said.</p><p>Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), slammed Fine, calling him “the Temu version of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/8/trump-to-host-netanyahu-at-white-house-on-december-29-israeli-government\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>,” referring to the discount online retailer and the Israeli prime minister.</p><p>“He’s hated by Republicans and Democrats for his policy of Israel first, Israel second, Israel third — Americans nowhere. He’s basically a foreign spokesperson at this point, and not even a good one,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“His unhinged, genocidal rhetoric shows his desperation as he tries to appease his bosses back in Tel Aviv.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Fine – who was elected to Congress earlier this year with the endorsements of Trump and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) – has made inflammatory statements about Palestinians.</p><p>In 2021, Fine commented on a social post with a photo of a dead Palestinian child asking him how he sleeps at night with: “Quite well, actually! Thanks for the pic!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier this year, he wrote “starve away” in response to a report about the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/world-reacts-as-un-backed-body-declares-famine-in-gaza\">deadly hunger</a> in Gaza due to the Israeli blockade.</p><p>Last year, Fine lauded the killing of <a href=\"/news/2024/9/13/light-in-any-room-friends-hail-aysenur-eygi-us-citizen-killed-by-israel\">Aysenur Ezgi Eygi</a>, a US activist who was fatally shot by the Israeli military in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>“Throw rocks, get shot. One less #MuslimTerror ist. #FireAway,” Fine wrote in a social media post.</p><p>He has also previously argued that fear of Muslims is warranted. “While many Muslims are not terrorists, they are the radicals, not the mainstream,” he wrote in a post on X in 2023. “Now is the time to speak truth, not bathe in political correctness that will kill us.”</p><p>Despite such comments, Fine – who refers to himself as the Hebrew Hammer – has been a regular guest on some mainstream media outlets, including CNN.</p><p>Hatem Abudayyeh, national chair of the US Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), called out Republicans in Congress and Trump for failing to denounce Fine.</p><p>“It’s one thing to read disgusting, racist, anti-Palestinian, anti-Black, and xenophobic vile on social media 24-7, but we’re not supposed to hear it from actual elected officials in this country,” Abudayyeh told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is what the Trump era has brought to the political arena: hateful speech from hateful people like Randy Fine, a sickening Zionist apologist for genocide who is allowed to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/horrors-upon-horrors-how-us-congress-responded-to-mass-hunger-in-gaza\">spew his racism</a> without condemnation from the rest of his party or his president.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

So you’ll be seeing that later, and you’ll be talking about that later with some other people.”</p><p>When faced with questions about the tanker at a roundtable with business leaders, Trump encouraged reporters to “follow the tanker” to find out more.</p><p>He also declined to identify the vessel’s owner. But, he added, “I assume we’re going to keep the oil.”</p><p>The Venezuelan government responded to the seizure, accusing the US of carrying out a “blatant theft”, which it described as an “act of international piracy, publicly announced by the President of the United States”.</p><p>Venezuela would “defend its sovereignty, natural resources, and national dignity with absolute determination”, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that it would also denounce the US before international bodies.</p><p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media that the tanker had been seized for transporting “sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran”.</p><p>“For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,” she wrote.</p><p>Her post was accompanied by a video that showed US soldiers rappelling onto the tanker from military helicopters. Bondi explained that the Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security cooperated with the coastguard on the operation.</p><p></p><p>The takeover of the oil tanker is likely to further inflame tensions with Venezuela, as Trump continues with his campaign of “maximum pressure” against the South American country.</p><h2 id=\"escalating-tensions\">Escalating tensions</h2><p>Since returning to office for a second term, Trump has ramped up his threats against Venezuela and deployed considerable military forces to the Caribbean region.</p><p>That includes sending the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and its strike group to the southern Caribbean Sea.</p><p>Under Trump, the US has also carried out a campaign of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-legal-basis-for-trumps-caribbean-boat-strikes\">lethal strikes</a> against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, with the Trump administration identifying Venezuela as the origin point for some of the vessels.</p><p>At least 22 boats have been attacked, and an estimated 87 people have been killed. Trump has repeatedly threatened to continue the bombing campaign on land as well.</p><p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has said that the US is seeking to topple his government.</p><p>He responded to Trump’s troop movements with his own military buildup along Venezuela’s coast and indicated his country’s armed forces <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/the-homeland-is-the-homeland-venezuelans-brace-for-possible-us-attack\">would resist</a> any potential military attack from the US.</p><p>Oil exports are a key source of revenue for the South American country, which exported more than 900,000 barrels per day last month. Oil futures rose following the seizure.</p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Mike Hanna noted that information about the tanker seizure remains scarce.</p><p>“There aren’t many details about the seizure of this tanker, apart from the president’s confirmation,” said Hanna.</p><p>But, he added, the seizure is likely to escalate an already volatile situation in the Caribbean.</p><p>“This does mark a massive escalation in terms of US action against Venezuela. It has been reported that President Trump has been pondering for weeks now what kind of action to take in Venezuela and has been very clear that he is contemplating regime change,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"punishment-for-violating-sanctions\">Punishment for violating sanctions?</h2><p>The US has taken action to seize high-value materials linked to Venezuela in the past. In February 2024, under then-President Joe Biden, the US <a href=\"/news/2024/2/13/us-takes-over-boeing-747-iran-had-sold-to-venezuela\">seized a cargo plane</a> Iran allegedly sold to Venezuela, claiming it violated sanctions on Tehran.</p><p>Then, a year later, the Trump administration seized a Dassault Falcon 2000EX jet linked to a state-run oil company in Venezuela, also claiming sanctions violations, this time against restrictions on the South American country.</p><p>The Maduro government denounced that confiscation as “brazen theft”.</p><p>Trump also recently declared Venezuelan airspace closed to travel, prompting <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/last-foreign-carriers-halt-flights-to-venezuela-after-trumps-airspace-ban\">foreign airlines to pause their flights</a> to the country.</p><p>Trump’s rivalry with Maduro stretches back to the Republican leader’s first term in office, when he first imposed a campaign of “maximum pressure” on Venezuela, including a multimillion-dollar reward for Maduro’s arrest.</p><p>The latest spike in tensions, however, has been met with domestic and international condemnation.</p><p>Just this month, two United Nations experts issued a joint statement expressing “deep concern about mounting pressure from the United States on Venezuela”.</p><p>Polls in the US also show disapproval over the escalating tensions. A November poll from The Economist and YouGov found that only 17 percent of US adults support using military force to overthrow the Venezuelan government, with 45 percent opposed.</p><p>And on Wednesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that 48 percent of respondents expressed opposition to the administration’s targeting of alleged drug vessels, widely considered illegal under international law.</p><p>About 45 percent, meanwhile, said that they generally supported using force near Venezuela to stem the flow of drugs, with 36 percent expressing opposition.</p><p>While Trump indicated earlier this month he had recently been in contact with Maduro, he told reporters on Wednesday that he has not spoken to the Venezuelan leader since the tanker’s seizure.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And this has huge implications, pushing back the earliest fire-making,” said archaeologist Nick Ashton, curator of Palaeolithic Collections at the British Museum in London.</p><p>While there are even older signs of humans using naturally occurring wildfires in Africa, this is the earliest proof that people knew how to start their own fires.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Fire was a crucial turning point in human evolution. Controlled flames allowed ancient hunter-gatherers to live in colder environments, cook food, and protect themselves from predators. Cooking also helped our ancestors get more energy from meat, roots and tubers, fuelling the growth of larger brains and enabling communities to support more people.</p><p>Scientists say fire likely transformed social life as well. It brought people together at night to share warmth, food and conversation, possibly encouraging storytelling, language and cultural beliefs.</p><p>“The campfire becomes a social hub,” British Museum archaeologist and study co-author Rob Davis said. “We’re a species who have used fire to really shape the world around us – and now we know this is something Neanderthals were doing far earlier than we thought, just like us.”</p><p>The evidence at Barnham suggests repeated fire use at temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 degrees Fahrenheit), pointing to deliberate fire-starting rather than reliance on natural flames. The team spent four years testing the materials to confirm the hearth’s age and human origin.</p><p>The finding supports the view that Neanderthals, and possibly their close relatives such as the Denisovans, were far more innovative than once assumed, sharing key survival skills long before the emergence of modern-day humans.</p></div></div></body></html>"
