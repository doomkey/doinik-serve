It served as a pointed warning about the economic consequences if Washington proceeds with its threats to strike Iran, highlighting how quickly a regional confrontation could spill into global markets.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-the-strait-of-hormuz\">Where is the Strait of Hormuz?</h2><p data-start=\"2029\" data-end=\"2094\">The Strait of Hormuz is the world’s most critical oil chokepoint.</p><p data-start=\"1467\" data-end=\"1755\">The curved waterway lies between Iran to the north and Oman and the United Arab Emirates to the south. It is roughly 50km (31 miles) wide at its entrance and exit and narrows to about 33km (20 miles) at its tightest point. It forms the only maritime link between the Gulf and the Arabian Sea.</p><p data-start=\"1757\" data-end=\"2003\">Despite its narrow width, the channel accommodates the world’s largest crude carriers. Major Middle Eastern oil and gas exporters rely on it to move supplies to international markets while importing nations depend on its uninterrupted operation.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3794723\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INTERACTIVE-Strait-of-Hormuz-Map-Iran-Israel-1750677677.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Strait of Hormuz Map Iran Israel-1750677677\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-much-oil-and-gas-pass-through-the-strait\">How much oil and gas pass through the strait?</h2><p data-start=\"2056\" data-end=\"2326\">According to the US <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65504\">Energy Information Administration</a> (EIA), about 20 million barrels of oil transited through the Strait of Hormuz each day in 2024. That equates to nearly $500bn in annual energy trade, underlining the waterway’s central role in the global economy.</p><p data-start=\"2328\" data-end=\"2564\">The crude passing through the strait originates from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p><p data-start=\"2413\" data-end=\"2508\">Any prolonged disruption would rattle producers and the economies that depend on their exports.</p><p data-start=\"2566\" data-end=\"2803\">The strait also plays a critical role in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade. In 2024, roughly a fifth of global LNG shipments moved through the corridor with Qatar accounting for the vast majority of those volumes, according to EIA <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65584\">data</a>.</p><h2 id=\"where-does-it-all-go\">Where does it all go?</h2><p data-start=\"2832\" data-end=\"3009\">The strait handles LNG flows in both directions. Kuwait and the UAE import supplies sourced outside the Gulf, including shipments from the US and West Africa.</p><p data-start=\"3011\" data-end=\"3257\">The EIA estimated that in 2024, 84 percent of crude oil and condensate shipments transiting the strait headed to Asian markets. A similar pattern appears in the gas trade with 83 percent of LNG volumes moving through the Strait of Hormuz destined for Asia.</p><p data-start=\"3259\" data-end=\"3516\">China, India, Japan and South Korea accounted for a combined 69 percent intake of all crude oil and condensate flows through the strait last year. Their factories, transport networks and power grids depend on uninterrupted Gulf energy.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4329332\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4329332\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4329332\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/000_97WK3YL-1771759990.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"This handout photo released by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)'s official website Sepanews on February 17, 2026, shows a rocket being fired during a military exercise by members of the IRGC and navy in the Strait of Hormuz.

At its narrowest stretch, the Strait of Hormuz and its designated shipping lanes fall entirely within the territorial waters of Iran and Oman.</p><p data-start=\"247\" data-end=\"518\">That legal reality gives Tehran geographic leverage. About 3,000 vessels transit the strait each month. If Iran tried to obstruct traffic, one of the most effective tactics would involve deploying naval mines using fast attack boats and submarines.</p><p data-start=\"520\" data-end=\"943\">Tehran’s fleet includes fast boats equipped with antiship missiles, alongside surface vessels, semisubmersible craft and submarines designed for asymmetric warfare.</p><p data-start=\"945\" data-end=\"1219\">Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2025/6/14/what-is-the-strait-of-hormuz-could-it-factor-into-israel-iran-conflict\">parliament</a> last year approved a motion to close the Strait of Hormuz. Any final decision rests with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.</p><p data-start=\"1221\" data-end=\"1614\">Regional dynamics could further complicate the situation.</p><p data-start=\"1221\" data-end=\"1614\">In Yemen, the Houthi group, which maintains close ties with Iran, could again try to disrupt traffic through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, another vital maritime chokepoint linking the Red Sea to global trade routes. Shipping through that corridor suffered significant disruptions after Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza began in October 2023.</p><p data-start=\"1616\" data-end=\"1868\">The Houthis, who control northwestern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, recently <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/houthi-threats-and-us-iran-conflict-escalate-ramadan-fears-in-yemen\">organised</a> a mass rally under the slogan Steadfast and Ready for the Next Round, signalling readiness for a potential confrontation with domestic or foreign adversaries.</p><p data-start=\"1870\" data-end=\"2008\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Any coordinated pressure on the Strait of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab Strait would amplify risks for global shipping, energy markets and international trade.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"impact-on-global-oil-prices\">Impact on global oil prices</h2><p data-start=\"3551\" data-end=\"3814\">Colby Connelly, head of Middle East content at Energy Intelligence, told Al Jazeera from the UAE that a full or partial closure of the Strait of Hormuz would have a “major impact on oil prices in the near term”, depending on how long the strait remains contested.</p><p data-start=\"3816\" data-end=\"4033\">“There are no other major sources of supply that can make up for what comes from the Gulf, especially given the consideration that around 70 percent of OPEC+ spare production capacity sits in the Gulf,” Connelly said, referring to the group of oil-producing countries that collectively sets production volumes.</p><p data-start=\"4035\" data-end=\"4231\">Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the strait to export its crude, shipping roughly 5.5 million barrels per day through the corridor – more than any other country in the region, according to EIA data.</p><p data-start=\"4233\" data-end=\"4387\">Iran’s oil exports, about 90 percent of which go to China, averaged roughly 1.7 million barrels per day in the first half of 2025, according to the EIA.</p><p data-start=\"4645\" data-end=\"4821\">“Saudi Arabia and the UAE both have limited pipeline capacity that can allow exports to continue via the Red Sea coast and Fujairah,” a UAE port on the Gulf of Oman, Connelly warned.</p><p data-start=\"4823\" data-end=\"5210\">While some Gulf producers hold substantial volumes in overseas storage that could cushion supply shocks, Connelly noted that buffers may prove limited in the face of serious disruptions.

Several major Asian economies depend heavily on shipments transiting through the strait.</p><p data-start=\"5872\" data-end=\"6128\">Almost half of India’s crude oil imports and about 60 percent of its natural gas supplies move through the Strait of Hormuz.

This may cause some investment hiccups in some of the Vision 2030 projects in Saudi Arabia.”</p><p data-start=\"6445\" data-end=\"6676\">“There’s many, many layers of concern here, not just exports and prices but also broader macroeconomic and microeconomic consequences.

The court said tariffs are a form of taxation, and under Article I of the Constitution, the power to tax belongs exclusively to Congress.</p><p>The court’s ruling, however, does not apply to Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminium, lumber and automotives since these were imposed under a different law – Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.</p><p>Following the verdict, a furious Trump called the Supreme Court judges “fools and lapdogs” who are “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution”. He immediately signed an executive order under Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974 to impose a blanket 10 percent tariff on all countries the US trades with, starting on February 24. On Saturday, he raised the tariff to 15 percent, the highest rate allowed under this trade law.</p><p>So, what is this new trade law that Trump has used to impose tariffs? What does this mean for trade deals the US has already signed with countries around the world?</p><p>Here’s what we know:</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-new-trade-law-trump-is-using\">What is the new trade law Trump is using?</h2><p>Under US law, Section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974 empowers the president to <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/20/tariff-refunds-could-take-years-amid-us-supreme-court-ruling-experts-warn\">impose tariffs</a> of up to 15 percent to address “large and serious balance-of-payments deficits”.</p><p>Tariffs can be imposed under this law only for 150 days unless the US Congress agrees to extend it. Trump is the first president to use this law to impose tariffs.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-a-temporary-import-duty-to-address-fundamental-international-payment-problems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Friday, the White House said some goods, such as certain agricultural products like beef, tomatoes, natural resources and fertilisers that cannot be grown or produced in the US, aerospace products, among others, will not be subject to the temporary levy.</p><p>Shantanu Singh, an international trade lawyer, noted that since this is the first time this legal authority has been used by any US president, it could likely be litigated.</p><p>“But the government has considerable leeway to determine this as trade deficits can form part of balance-of-payments deficits,” he told Al Jazeera. Trump has justified the tariffs as a way to balance the US’s trade deficits of more than $900bn.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-to-the-trade-deals\">What happens to the trade deals?</h2><p>Several countries had signed trade deals to cushion themselves from Trump’s punishing tariffs last year. The United Kingdom, India and the European Union, among others, had entered into deals to lower tariffs on their exports to the US.</p><p>But the ongoing tariff spectacle has thrown the future of those trade deals into doubt. Will they be charged the new 15 percent tariff or the agreed rate signed in the trade deals? Will India be tariffed at 18 percent, as per the trade deal, or 15 percent as announced by Trump on Saturday?</p><p>Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said some of these trade agreements will stand.</p><p>“The trade deals, because they are international, will likely remain in place,” Singh, the international trade lawyer, said.</p><p>However, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, he said, the big incentive for doing trade deals with the Trump administration, which was to get a lower reciprocal tariff rate before competitors, has vanished.</p><p>“That reduces the incentive for trade partners to comply with their part of the deal for the time being,” he said.</p><p>Here is a look at some of the trade agreements and what their future looks like.</p><h3 id=\"united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</h3><p>The UK was one of the first to sign a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/8/us-uk-trade-deal-how-are-trumps-global-tariff-talks-shaping-up\">trade deal</a> with the US last May after being hit by 5 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium exports, as well as a 25 percent tariff on cars and auto parts.</p><p>Under their <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/1/us-uk-agree-to-zero-tariffs-on-medicines-uk-commits-to-higher-spending\">agreement</a>, the US agreed that there would be zero tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the UK, and for other goods, it was set at 10 percent. Last December, the two nations also agreed to zero tariffs on pharmaceuticals and medical products.</p><p>After Friday’s Supreme Court ruling, William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chamber of Commerce, said in a <a href=\"https://www.britishchambers.org.uk/news/2026/02/new-tariff-rate-a-further-blow-to-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> that the ruling does “little to clear the murky waters for business”.</p><p>On Friday, a spokesperson told the media that the British government was “working with the US” to understand more about how the court’s ruling will affect the UK.</p><p>The court ruling will not impact the UK’s deal on steel, aluminium and pharmaceutical exports.</p><p>But Bain said the new 15 percent global tariff rate, which has been imposed under Section 122 of the Trade Act 1974, “will be bad for trade, bad for US consumers and businesses and weaken global economic growth”.</p><h3 id=\"china\">China</h3><p>Trump had imposed one of the highest tariffs on China, and the world’s two largest economies were engaged in a trade war. At one point, they had slapped reciprocal tariffs exceeding 100 percent on some goods.</p><p>The two countries have yet to sign a trade deal, but they agreed to lower the tariffs as part of a trade truce.</p><p>After several rounds of trade talks and a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the two countries agreed to a one-year truce with a 10 percent baseline tariff. Trump also slashed the so-called fentanyl tariff to 10 percent.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruling will lift tariffs imposed on chemicals used in fentanyl. However, tariffs on other Chinese exports, such as electric vehicles, aluminium and steel, will remain.</p><p>Following the court’s ruling, Chinese Embassy spokesperson in the US, Liu Pengyu, told journalists that tariffs and trade wars serve neither the US nor China’s interests. He called on Beijing and Washington to work together to “provide greater certainty and stability for China-US economic and trade cooperation and the global economy”.</p><p>Trump is scheduled to <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/trump-to-make-three-day-visit-to-china-next-month-white-house-says\">travel</a> to China from March 31 to April 2 to meet Xi and discuss trade.</p><p>But Singh, the trade lawyer, said countries like China that did not negotiate deals with the US are quite well placed because, as a result of the court’s ruling and repeal of the reciprocal tariffs, they have achieved a lower rate of tariff without having to make concessions.</p><p>“China will definitely feel it has the upper hand going into negotiations with the US,” he said.</p><h3 id=\"south-east-asia\">South East Asia</h3><p>Last year, South East Asian countries Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia entered into trade agreements with the Trump administration to lower tariffs.</p><p>Malaysia reduced its tariff from 25 percent to 19 percent, while Cambodia’s tariff dropped from 49 percent to 19 percent after their respective trade agreements with the US last year. Vietnam and Indonesia also signed deals, reducing their tariffs to 20 percent and 19 percent, respectively.</p><p>After ⁠the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News that US imports from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19 percent, even though the universal rate was fixed at 15 percent on Saturday.</p><p>Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, also said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19 percent remains in force despite the court decision.</p><h3 id=\"india\">India</h3><p>At 50 percent, India faced among the highest US tariffs. The US first imposed a 25 percent levy on Indian imports and later added another 25 percent citing the country’s purchases of Russian oil as the reason.</p><p>Earlier this month, the US and India reached a framework <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/modi-trump-announce-india-us-trade-deal-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont\">trade deal</a>. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and that US tariffs would be lowered to 18 percent for India’s top exports to the US, including clothing, pharmaceuticals, precious stones, and textiles. India said it will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a range of agricultural products.</p><p>An Indian trade delegation, which was scheduled to travel to the US to finalise details of the trade agreement, has been postponed.</p><h3 id=\"european-union\">European Union</h3><p>Last July, the EU and the US struck a <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/28/eu-and-us-announce-deal-a-breakdown-of-the-trade-agreement\">deal</a> to avert a transatlantic trade war after Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on imports from the 27-member bloc. Under the agreement, EU exports to the US would face a 15 percent tariff.</p><p>The deal, however, had not yet come into effect since EU lawmakers paused its ratification after Trump threatened to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, last month.</p><p>The European Parliament’s trade committee is set to vote on the EU’s trade deal with the US on February 24, but the Supreme Court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs have made the future of the deal uncertain.</p><p>An EU commission spokesperson told journalists after the court’s ruling that the bloc is in “close contact” with the US administration to seek more clarity.</p><h3 id=\"mexico\">Mexico</h3><p><a href=\"/economy/2026/2/6/mexicos-tariffs-on-india-are-a-double-whammy-after-us-tariffs\">Mexico</a> was one of the first countries to be targeted by Trump’s tariffs last year. It was hit by a 25 percent tariff on some pharmaceuticals, and an additional 25 percent “fentanyl tariff” over what Trump said is the flow of drugs across the Mexican border into the US.</p><p>Approximately 85 percent of Mexican exports to the US were exempt from tariffs because of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into force in July 2020.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruling will reduce the tariffs on Mexico’s exports.</p><p>However, the USMCA is set to be reviewed again later this year, and it is uncertain whether products exempt from US tariffs under it will face levies if the agreement lapses.</p><p>Mexico’s Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard has said he will travel to the US in the near future to discuss the issue.</p><h3 id=\"canada\">Canada</h3><p><a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/canadas-carney-hails-new-trade-deals-expects-us-to-respect-sovereignty\">Canada</a> faces 35 percent tariffs on goods from certain sectors, like steel and aluminium, and most of its goods have also been impacted by a 50 percent levy on imported metals and a 25 percent duty on non-US cars.</p><p>Most of its goods are exempt under the existing USMCA.</p><p>Following the court verdict, Canada-US Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc told journalists that significant work remains as Washington-imposed tariffs on steel, aluminium, softwood lumber and automobiles remain in place.</p><p>Moreover, with the USMCA review coming up later this year, some Canadian leaders are also worried about what Trump could do next.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>Countries are waiting to hear how exactly the top court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs will play out.</p><p>Singh, the trade lawyer, said the US administration will likely use the 150-day period during which the 15 percent Section 122 global tariffs will be effective.</p><p>“During this period, the United States trade representative will swiftly conduct investigations under another legal authority – Section 301 – to make findings on unfair trade practices of its trade partners and try to reinstate the reciprocal tariff rates which were invalidated,” he said.</p><p>“The trade deals could then be adjusted to reflect this new reality.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

There have been several waves of migration in the century since.</p><p>In Colombia, one of the most significant came during Lebanon’s civil war in the 1970s. The conflict triggered an exodus of nearly one million Lebanese people that included many Muslims and Christians.</p><p>Some settled in cities like Maicao, where one of the largest mosques in Latin America was built and completed in 1997.</p><p>The continued migration into Colombia has contributed to the diversity of its Muslim community.</p><p>In Bogota, Sheikh Ahmad Qurtubi speaks proudly of the range of nationalities in his jamaat, or congregation, at the Qurtubi Islamic Centre in the west of the city.</p><p>“There are people of different nationalities, approximately 10 or 15 different countries, and we find great diversity in this centre,” Qurtubi explained after delivering the Taraweeh prayer marking the first night of Ramadan.</p><p>Though there are no official statistics on the origins of Colombia’s Muslim population, Qurtubi has noticed an increase in Muslim converts.</p><p>He estimates that roughly 100 to 200 worshippers in his jamaat are new to the religion. It can be a struggle, though, to build a sense of cohesion, given the different backgrounds of the worshippers.</p><p>“The biggest challenge in Colombia is maintaining a stable community that has an impact on society and a common identity,” he said.</p><p>“In a community where most people have converted due to different circumstances that led them to Islam, it can be a little more complicated to achieve.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4327434\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4327434\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4327434\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC01333-1771634209.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sheikh Ahmad Qurtubi leads prayers at the Al-Qurtubi Islamic Centre in Bogotá on the first night of Ramadan.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4327434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sheikh Ahmad Qurtubi leads prayers at the Qurtubi Islamic Centre in Bogota on the first night of Ramadan [Alfie Pannell/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>But Qurtubi said the diversity of his congregation has led to celebrations that embrace the spectrum of Colombia’s Muslim identity.</p><p>He described how, on each night of Ramadan, a different family volunteers to cook food for the Iftar, the breaking of the fast.</p><p>“The food options can be very varied. Why? Because it depends on each person’s culture and background,” he explained. “For example, I can offer Moroccan food, one person can offer Pakistani food, others Colombian food.”</p><p>He believes community events like Ramadan create an opportunity for Colombia’s Muslims to embrace their differences and build communal understanding.</p><p>“Knowledge is what allows a community to grow, to flourish … and to have the opportunity to prosper and put down roots here in Colombia,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I’m in shock,” said Andrey, a 30-year-old Muscovite.</p><p>“It’s just like Europe – everybody’s complaining about the prices there too. Even if you only buy some beer, cigs and chocolate, you still wind up spending at least 1,000 roubles [$13] at the store. But in Moscow, people’s purchasing power hasn’t obviously fallen much. Kids are crowded in lines at supermarket cafes. The whole city is full of taxi drivers and endless delivery drivers.”</p><p>Some things have changed.</p><p>“It became very problematic to find some brands that you used to buy before,” said Kirill F, a 39-year-old photographer from St Petersburg who requested that his full name not be disclosed.</p><p>“They can be found from resellers, but they’ve become more expensive, and they’re no longer sold in stores,” he said. Some South Korean brands have returned to Russia, he said. LG washing machines and refrigerators are now available again.</p><p>Chinese brands are also available, but they are “not as good quality as the tech we used to get from Germany or Poland”, Kirill said.</p><p>To get around overseas payment restrictions because of Western sanctions, for example on apps, Kirill opened a bank account in Kyrgyzstan. It’s not an insurmountable obstacle but an annoyance, he said.</p><p>But Kirill is less sanguine about the restrictions imposed by his own government. Since 2022, the Kremlin has introduced <a href=\"/news/2023/3/24/activists-everyday-russians-and-a-soldier-punished-for-war-talk\">strict laws</a> penalising what it calls “fake news” about the invasion. Additionally, the authorities have blocked social media such as Instagram and Facebook and made it harder to use WhatsApp, Telegram and YouTube, promoting state-backed alternatives such <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/03/28/nuum-we-hardly-knew-ye\">RuTube</a> and the messaging app <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/02/19/russia-s-national-messenger-was-billed-as-a-platform-for-the-people-it-s-dominated-by-state-run-channels\">Max</a> instead.</p><p>“At first, we were blocked from using Facebook, but we had few people using it and they just installed VPNs, and then YouTube was banned,” Kirill recounted.</p><p>“For ordinary citizens, this blockage just worsens life.

The Russian military now attracts <a href=\"/news/2025/8/26/despite-huge-manpower-losses-how-is-russia-replenishing-its-military\">plenty</a> of recruits through generous pay packets rather than relying on conscripts.</p><p>“At first, I thought [the war] was wrong, like what ‘denazification’ are you talking about?” Vladislav told Al Jazeera via Telegram before hastily deleting his messages. The Kremlin has described the Ukrainian leadership under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as pro-Nazi, and has insisted that its military operation is driven by a desire to “denazify” Ukraine.</p><p>“But then the Ukrainian side started posting photos of swastikas, SS skulls and other symbols of fascist ideology,” Vladislav said, referring to symbols that have appeared on some Ukrainian soldiers’ uniforms and unit flags. “… Both my grandparents were WWII veterans; may they rest in peace.”</p><p>Now, he said, he agrees with Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Zelenskyy and his entire fascist fraternity must be destroyed, no more prisons. … I hope my brother will make a huge contribution,” he added. “He’s a great guy, an excellent driver, and the fact that he spent so much time playing simulation games will help him defeat every Nazi scum in Ukraine.”</p><p>Kirill, too, had his doubts about the invasion, considering the outbreak of war a failure of Russian diplomacy, and still shakes his head when he sees Russian pro-war symbols in public.</p><p>But as time went on, his attitude towards both peace and liberals grew more jaded.</p><p>“We read both the foreign press and the liberal analysts, who told us the Russian economy had two weeks left, yet here we are four years later, and everything’s fine. What do you think our attitude will be towards the people who told us such things?” he asked rhetorically.</p><p>“I believe that since it’s already begun, we need to go all the way to victory,” Kirill added. “If you started a fight, you can’t just say ‘I’m sorry’ and stop. That is to say, I don’t support [the invasion], but I also don’t support reparations, all this nonsense. No one will go for it. Even among those who are against the war, they don’t want to lose completely because their lives will be adversely affected.”</p><p>Then there’s the question of apathy. Historically, many Russians have concerned themselves more with day-to-day survival than the machinations of power, a trend that has continued with the “special military operation”.</p><p>“Everyone’s in denial. Almost everyone in my circles is staunchly apolitical and tries to ignore the news,” Andrey observed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4329297\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4329297\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4329297\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP24222450478643-1771759053.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Emergency workers and soldiers push a damaged car after a Russian missile hit a supermarket in Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine, Friday, Aug. 9, 2024.

Having completed both his national service, a 12-month mandatory draft, and a previous deployment to Syria, the 38-year-old trucker from Kemerovo in Siberia was mobilised into the elite Ural Battalion, where he was assigned the post of machinegunner in a support platoon.</p><p>“We’d been told for years that everything in Ukraine was steeped in Nazism and hatred of Russia and Russians,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“At the time, I thought and assumed this was a punitive operation aimed at the regime in that country than at the Ukrainian people as a whole.”</p><p>By January 2023, Medvedev’s unit entered the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, setting up base in an abandoned mine. Medvedev considered himself lucky to have been assigned to a support platoon because the assault squads “suffered 60 or 70 percent casualties in an hour of combat”.</p><p>Travelling through war-torn Ukrainian villages and speaking with the locals, Medvedev began questioning his mission. “The realisation that I was fighting a war that no one needed, that would bring no good to anyone in this world but would only produce a mountain of corpses, widows, orphans and miserable mothers and fathers haunted me,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>On July 7, 2023, he went AWOL and tried to return to his hometown.</p><p>“For the first few months after returning, I didn’t understand what was going on around me at all. There was a war somewhere, but here in Siberia or the Urals, people were living as if nothing was happening.”</p><p>Facing criminal indictment for abandoning his post, Medvedev contacted the organisation <a href=\"https://iditelesom.org/en\">Get Lost</a>, which helps draft dodgers and deserters. With its help, he escaped abroad.</p><p>“I miss my homeland very much.

Among them were young men fearing they would be conscripted and sent to the front lines as well as those with deeply held anti-Putin convictions, such as 35-year-old Mike* from Russia’s fourth largest city.</p><p>Mike packed one small bag and decided “to get the hell out of Yekaterinburg”.</p><p>Mike has since settled in Berlin, where he’s involved in an activist community helping those still in the country. But he’s grown disillusioned with both the West and the liberal Russian opposition.</p><p>“The genocide in Gaza conducted in front of our very eyes with the clear complicity of Western elites shattered whatever illusions one could have about the Western powers helping Ukraine,” he sighed.</p><p>If the West isn’t ready to intervene more directly, Mike said, then a compromise seems more reasonable, even if that essentially means a defeat for Ukraine.</p><p>“After four years, the situation looks really bleak, and this winter in Ukraine, Putin’s regime showed its most cynical, completely inhumane nature by destroying civic infrastructure all across the country.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On February 16, a group of Palestinian footballers, clubs and advocacy groups referred the heads of FIFA and UEFA to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The 120-page filing accuses Gianni Infantino and Aleksander Čeferin of “aiding and abetting war crimes (specifically, the transfer of civilian population into occupied territories) and crimes against humanity (specifically, apartheid)”.</p><p>This historic case marks the first time sports leaders are being accused of these crimes and sends a warning to presidents of all other corporate entities in and beyond athletics. It offers a perfect opportunity to challenge the impunity of Israeli apartheid, occupation and genocide.</p><p>Football is the world’s most popular form of cultural expression, with some five billion fans across the planet. Therefore, the stakes of this charge are immense in terms of the spectacle of accountability and legal precedent.</p><p>In the course of its campaign in Gaza, of genocide generally and “athleticide” particularly, Israel has killed 1,007 Palestinian sportspeople and destroyed 184 sports facilities, while damaging 81 others.</p><p>Although this “athleticide” cannot be directly attributed to the Israel Football Association (IFA), its activities linked to clubs from illegal Israeli settlements located on the occupied Palestinian territory and their participation in domestic and international tournaments can be seen as abetting Israeli crimes of occupation and apartheid.</p><p>Despite facing demands for the suspension of these clubs or the IFA, UEFA and FIFA leadership have taken no action. In a recent <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/fifa-president-sorry-for-british-football-fan-remarks-and-criticises-football-bans-and-boycotts-13502326\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interview</a>, FIFA chief Infantino said he opposed a ban on Israeli teams from participation in global football, calling it “a defeat”. He went on to add that he was in favour of enshrining in FIFA statutes that no country should ever be banned from “playing football because of the acts of their political leaders”.</p><p>Ironic, when you consider he is the very person who oversaw the <a href=\"/news/2022/2/28/russia-expelled-from-world-cup-clubs-banned-from-competitions\">suspension of Russia</a> from FIFA in 2022 and the banning of Crimean clubs from playing in the Russian league, linked to UEFA, after the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014.</p><p>The complaint is filed against Infantino and Čeferin because private organisations cannot be defendants before the ICC, but those individuals responsible for their policies can be.</p><p>The focus of the complaint is the fact that the IFA has been permitted to materially support, recognise, and include in domestic and international competitions clubs that are based in the stolen settlement land of the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Article 64(2) of FIFA Statutes prohibits member associations and their clubs from playing on the territory of another member association without the latter’s approval.</p><p>The complaint alleges that by allowing the IFA to oversee clubs that operate on stolen land, Infantino and Čeferin are accountable for normalising illegal Israeli settlements, in direct contravention of a <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">2024 pronouncement</a> by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and a resolution from the United Nations General Assembly, which found the settlements to be “unlawful” and required Israel to “cease immediately all new settlement activities, and to evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.</p><p>The existence of sanctioned Israeli clubs in West Bank settlements, the referral argues, contributes to the transfer of the civilian population into the occupied territory, contrary to the Rome Statute Article 8(2)(b)(viii), by normalising colonisation.</p><p>Likewise, because Israeli clubs in the occupied territory prohibit Palestinians from spectating matches or playing for or managing these teams, the continued sanction of these organisations falls under the definition of aiding and abetting apartheid (a crime against humanity pursuant to Rome Statute Article 7(1)(j).</p><p>In continuing to allow the membership of these clubs and the IFA in global and European sport, the filing alleges that Infantino and Čeferin have acted in full knowledge that they have participated in the violation of international law based on the fact that they have deliberately ignored numerous reports and letters advising them to intervene.</p><p>Now that the complaint has been formally filed, the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC will conduct a preliminary examination to confirm that the elements of jurisdiction, admissibility, and the interests of justice have been satisfied. They will then have the option to either decline to open the investigation or proceed to investigate the legal issues raised in the complaint.</p><p>If an investigation does ensue, evidence-gathering will occur and arrest warrants or summonses may ultimately be issued. If that happens, this would set an important precedent and give momentum to the campaign for justice for Palestine.</p><p>It is notable that while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been able to dodge an ICC arrest warrant by cowering away from Rome Statute signatory states, it would be impossible for Infantino and Čeferin to do so while still fulfilling their roles, assuming it is enforced.</p><p>Football is, without question, one of the most popular sports on the planet. When such a cultural juggernaut is connected to business, what emerges is an industry like no other. FIFA and UEFA are global <a href=\"https://studentbriefs.law.gwu.edu/ilpb/2022/04/20/the-fifa-legal-monopoly-can-fifa-be-fixed/\">regulatory monopolies</a>, meaning their rules and regulations act the same way a country’s legislation acts on its population. They also preside over a huge, lucrative industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Given the amount of eyeballs and money at stake, the impact of a ban on participation is enormous, as Russia understands all too well after being subjected to suspension. This is no doubt exactly why the presidents of these organisations have refused to act against Israel under the guise of “political neutrality”.</p><p>As former UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Michael Lynk, told us: “When an occupying power is blatantly committing war crimes by creating civilian settlements in occupied territory, the rest of the world – including states, corporations and international sporting organisations – is required to ensure the enforcement of international law by doing everything in their power to bring the violations to a swift end. Yet, FIFA and UEFA are sportswashing the illegal Israeli occupation by allowing the Israeli Football Association to include clubs based in the illegal settlements to participate in their domestic leagues. Nothing could be further from the rules of fairness and equity.”</p><p>The bottom line is that sport is and has always been political. The veneer of “political neutrality” conceals the reality that politics is the name of the game for FIFA and UEFA.</p><p>Nobody is entitled to stand above international law. It is time for the ICC to prove it.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The agent who was hit by a car went to the hospital for ⁠a knee injury and was later released, according to the report.</p><p>“These records ⁠paint a deeply troubling picture of the violent methods used by ICE,” Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, said in a statement.</p><p>“In just the first months of this administration, ICE’s own data shows a dramatic spike of nearly 400 per cent in use-of-force incidents – with people hospitalised, bystanders swept up ‌in operations, and even the death of a US citizen.”</p><p>A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that Martinez “intentionally ran over” an agent with DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations, and another agent “fired defensive shots”.

Now, you know, India is not a small country. It has 1.4 billion people. India is enormously powerful, enormously popular,” he said.</p><p>But India’s ties with Israel were not always this cosy. Here is a timeline of how their relations have evolved — from hostility and suspicion, to secret weapons trade and now open embrace — and what that means for India’s relations with Palestine.</p><h2 id=\"1930s-and-40s-india-opposes-the-creation-of-israel\">1930s and 40s: India opposes the creation of Israel</h2><p>Under British colonialism, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.</p><p>Between 1920 and 1948, Palestine was under British administration, and the United Kingdom, through the Balfour Declaration of 1917, had promised Jews, who had been displaced from Europe due to Adolf Hitler’s oppression, a homeland in the British Mandate in Palestine.</p><p>This was opposed by many nations, including India, which were also fighting British colonialism at the time.</p><p>“Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English, or France to the French,” Mahatma Gandhi, India’s most prominent freedom fighter, revered as the Father of the Nation, wrote in an article in his weekly newspaper Harijan, on November 26, 1938.</p><p>While he also sympathised with the Jews in his article and said “the German persecution of the Jews seems to have no parallel in history”, Gandhi stressed that it would be “wrong and inhumane to impose the Jews on the Arabs”.</p><p>“It would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home,” he wrote.</p><p>In 1947, India became an independent nation, and that same year, it voted against the United Nations Partition Plan of Palestine into the Jewish state of Israel and the state of Palestine, comprising Palestinian Arabs. According to the book, Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Volume 5, the first Indian prime minister’s sister, Vijaylaxmi Pandit, who was India’s envoy to the UN, received death threats to pressure New Delhi to vote in favour of the division. But the Nehru government did not buckle.</p><p>Instead, India, erstwhile Yugoslavia and Iran advocated for a single federated state with — per Nehru — “the largest possible autonomy to respected regions where the Jews and Arabs are in majority”.</p><p>“We have maintained that Palestine should be independent and free from the control of any single power; that no solution can be lasting unless it is based on the consent of both Arabs and Jews; and no lasting solution is possible which is imposed and maintained by force,” Nehru said in 1948.</p><p>In 1949, India also voted against Israel’s UN membership.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"1950s-india-recognises-israel-but-refuses-to-set-up-diplomatic-ties\">1950s: India recognises Israel, but refuses to set up diplomatic ties</h2><p>But Israel was keen for recognition and sent many envoys to meet Indian officials.</p><p>Renowned scientist Albert Einstein was among those nudged by Israel to help convince India to recognise the Jewish nation.</p><p>In a letter to Nehru in June 1947, Einstein told him to end “the rivalries of power politics and the egotism of petty nationalist appetites” and support “the glorious renaissance which has begun in Palestine”.</p><p>At the time, Nehru was not convinced, but eventually, on September 17, 1950, India recognised Israel. “We would have [recognised] long ago, because Israel is a fact. We refrained because of our desire not to offend the sentiments of our friends in the Arab countries,” Nehru said, post recognition.</p><p>However, India steered clear of establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. For four decades to follow, India even forbade the use of its passport for travel to Israel.</p><h2 id=\"1960s-pro-palestinian-with-an-opening-for-israel\">1960s: Pro-Palestinian, with an opening for Israel</h2><p>India’s political and diplomatic sympathies continued to lie firmly behind the Palestinian cause. In May 1960, Nehru visited UN troops stationed in Gaza.</p><p>But when war broke out between India and China in 1962, then Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion wrote to Nehru, offering his sympathies and weapons.</p><p>India accepted Israeli weapons and munitions, but requested that the ships supplying them not bear Israeli flags, so as not to antagonise New Delhi’s Arab allies. These details have been revealed in documents held in archives in Jerusalem, and India has not disputed them. This marked the beginning of a decades-long covert relationship between India and Israel.</p><p>Israel again supplied India with munitions during its 1965 war against Pakistan.</p><h2 id=\"1970s-secret-israeli-weapons-and-a-historic-palestinian-recognition\">1970s: Secret Israeli weapons and a historic Palestinian recognition</h2><p>As tensions between India and Pakistan spiked in 1971, DN Chatterjee, India’s ambassador to France, wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs, advocating for New Delhi to seek Israeli assistance.</p><p>The then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, accepted the proposal, scholar Srinath Raghavan wrote in his book, 1971. Through India’s external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the country began the process of procuring Israeli arms via Liechtenstein.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir wrote to Indira, seeking diplomatic recognition for Israel in return, but India demurred.</p><p>Instead, despite the military help it had sought and received from Israel, India grew even closer to the Palestinian movement diplomatically through the 1970s. In 1974, it became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. The following year, the PLO opened an office in India. Thousands of Palestinian students came to India for their higher studies.</p><h2 id=\"1980s-my-sister-and-a-planned-attack-on-a-nuclear-facility\">1980s: ‘My sister’ and a planned attack on a nuclear facility</h2><p>By the 1980s, India’s relations with Palestine and Israel had fallen into a familiar pattern. New Delhi overtly, loudly declared its support for the Palestinian cause, and PLO leader Yasser Arafat made frequent visits to the country. But covertly, Israel and India had established security ties.</p><p>In 1983, when Arafat visited India for a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, he described Indira, the prime minister, as his “sister”, underscoring the personal and nation-to-nation affinity that existed at the time between India and Palestine.</p><p>But the early 1980s also saw Israel propose to India a joint operation to attack a Pakistani nuclear facility, which New Delhi turned down.</p><p>In 1988, India became among the world’s first non-Arab nations to recognise Palestinian statehood.</p><h2 id=\"1990s-india-and-israel-establish-diplomatic-ties\">1990s: India and Israel establish diplomatic ties</h2><p>With the Cold War over and a unipolar world emerging, India adjusted several of its diplomatic positions. Domestically, India opened up its economy starting in 1991. Externally, it reached out to the United States and, in January 1992, turned its long-hidden relationship with Israel into the establishment of formal diplomatic ties.</p><p>In a September 2022 report for the Indian think tank Observer Research Foundation, retired Indian diplomat Navdeep Suri wrote that New Delhi took decades to establish diplomatic ties with Israel because of India’s “support for anti-colonial movements and its close ties with Arab countries”.</p><p>In fact, India’s prime minister in 1992, PV Narasimha Rao, announced the decision to set up diplomatic ties with Israel just weeks after Arafat had visited New Delhi and said he would respect India’s decision on the matter.</p><p>India and Israel set up their embassies in Tel Aviv and New Delhi, respectively.</p><p>In 1999, Israel helped India during the <a href=\"/news/2019/7/26/20-years-of-kargil-war-india-pakistan-remain-tense-over-kashmir\">Kargil war</a> when its troops were trying to force out Pakistan’s military and Kashmiri rebels who had occupied strategic positions on the Indian side of the de facto border between them, known as the Line of Control or LoC. Israel aided India militarily by supplying laser-guided bomb kits and missiles.</p><h2 id=\"2014-onwards-an-open-embrace\">2014 onwards: An open embrace</h2><p>In the early 2000s, India became one of Israel’s largest buyers of defence equipment.</p><p>But in 2014, when Modi came to power, India’s ties with Israel witnessed a sharp upturn; the hesitancy of the past was shed once and for all.</p><p>Under the Modi government in 2015, India’s president at the time, Pranab Mukherjee, became the first Indian president to visit Israel, seeking to strengthen bilateral economic and defence ties.</p><p>In July 2017, Modi visited Israel, becoming the first Indian prime minister to visit the country. During that visit, according to Indian media reports, Modi and Netanyahu said they “visualised that the two countries will become close partners in development, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, defence and security”. A year later, in January 2018, Netanyahu also <a href=\"/features/2018/1/15/indias-modi-gives-warm-welcome-to-israels-netanyahu\">visited</a> New Delhi.</p><p>In 2021, under Modi, the Indian Air Force participated in a multilateral air force exercise called Blue Flag-2021 in Israel. Israeli defence companies like Elbit Systems and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems have also established partnerships with Indian firms, such as Adani Group and Tata Advanced Systems.</p><p>Trade relations between the two nations have also strengthened under the Modi government. India is currently Israel’s second-largest trading partner in Asia, after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.</p><p>India’s main exports to Israel include pearls, precious stones, automotive diesel, chemicals, machinery, and electrical equipment, among others, while imports include petroleum, chemical machinery and transport equipment, etc. The two countries also signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) last September.</p><p>At a time when many Western countries, including allies of Israel, have sanctioned far-right members of Netanyahu’s cabinet, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, these ministers have been welcomed in India.</p><p>Israeli companies have also sought to <a href=\"/features/2024/1/24/undeterred-by-gaza-war-thousands-of-indians-turn-up-for-jobs-in-israel\">hire</a> more employees from India in recent years. After Israel suspended work permits for thousands of Palestinians following the October 2023 attack by Hamas and other Palestinian groups, Israel hired thousands of Indians to work in their place.</p><p>Meanwhile, India has been a tourist destination for Israelis, with many of them holidaying in the country after serving their mandatory time in the Israeli army.</p><p>Kfir Tshuva, a lecturer in economics at the Ramat Gan Academic College in Israel, said, under Modi, India and Israel’s relationship has become more visible and politically open.</p><p>However, he noted that India’s approach in the Middle East was also one of strategic balancing — in which New Delhi maintains separate and independent relationships with multiple actors that may have conflicting interests, rather than framing its policy as a zero-sum choice.</p><p>“This allows India to deepen cooperation with Israel in areas such as defence, technology and economic integration, while also sustaining diplomatic engagement with the Palestinian leadership and strong ties with Arab states,” he said.</p><p>“Modi’s visit to Israel [next week] should therefore be understood within this broader strategic calculus. It reflects New Delhi’s effort to integrate stronger bilateral cooperation with Israel into its wider regional strategy without undermining its commitment to peace, its support for a two-state solution, or its substantive relationships with Arab partners,” he added.</p><p>Kadira Pethiyagoda, author and geopolitical strategist, told Al Jazeera that there are currently multiple countervailing forces at play.</p><p>“On one hand, India’s short-term interests are advanced by defence trade and investment, and remittances from Israel; on the other, India’s long-term goal of becoming a ‘great power’ with a strategic footprint in the Middle East, invariably involves reducing US regional hegemony,” he said.</p><p>“This requires that Israel is balanced by other regional powers, like Iran, which have closer ties to India than the US. India would not want to contribute to Israel achieving complete dominance in the Middle East,” he noted.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-india-s-relations-with-palestine\">What does this mean for India’s relations with Palestine?</h2><p>Under Modi, India has officially maintained its support for a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel — backing the two-state solution — even as he has embraced more publicly warm ties with Netanyahu.</p><p>But India has been cautious in criticising Israel’s actions on Gaza, even before the genocidal war that began in 2023.</p><p>In 2016, India abstained from a UN vote which sought to bring Israel before the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its alleged war crimes during its conflict with Gaza in 2014. When Israel began its genocidal war on Gaza, India condemned the humanitarian crisis in the enclave but repeatedly abstained from UN resolutions which called for a ceasefire. In 2024, India also abstained from a UN Human Rights Council resolution which called for an arms embargo on Israel.</p><p>India has, however, been critical of Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank. Last week, India joined more than 100 nations in condemning Israel’s recent plans to occupy more territory in the region.</p><p>A joint statement issued by the nations rejected “all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem”.</p><p>“Such measures violate international law, undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region, run counter to the Comprehensive Plan, and jeopardize the prospect of reaching a peace agreement ending the conflict,” the statement added.</p><p>But India joined that statement only a day after the first batch of 80 countries and organisations signed it, drawing criticism from the domestic opposition.</p><p>Modi’s visit to Israel, too, has drawn condemnation from the opposition Congress party and others, who have accused him of reversing decades of Indian support for the Palestinian cause.</p><p>In a post on X after India condemned Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank, Congress party’s general secretary in charge of communication and media, Jairam Ramesh, said: “This is sheer hypocrisy and cynicism since the PM will be going to Israel early next week. If he is really serious – which of course he is not – he should call out his good friend Mr Netanyahu, and publicly express India’s grave concern at what Israel is executing in the occupied West Bank.”</p><p>Analysts have told Al Jazeera that Modi will likely be “highly diplomatic” with respect to discussing the Palestine issue during his Israel trip.</p><p>According to Pethiyagoda, India has had a fairly unique position among large powers in maintaining cordial ties with both sides in most of the world’s major conflicts.</p><p>“But the timing of the [Israel] visit, when the US is likely to strike Iran, is not ideal in terms of maintaining this image,” he said, referring to soaring tensions between Washington and Tehran. The Trump administration has amassed warships and jets close to Iran, in preparation for a potential attack, even as the US and Iran also engage in diplomatic talks.</p><p>He added that during his visit, Modi will likely make reference to the Gaza conflict but “in a neutral, highly diplomatic way”.</p><p>Tshuva said beyond India’s engagement with the Palestinian leadership, its ties with Arab states remain strategically significant.</p><p>“Gulf countries are vital to India’s energy security, trade flows, investment partnerships and the welfare of millions of Indian nationals working in the region,” he said.</p><p>“These economic and geopolitical considerations form an essential part of New Delhi’s Middle East policy and shape its careful approach to the Israeli-Palestinian issue,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"
