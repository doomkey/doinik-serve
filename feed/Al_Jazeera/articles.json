The opposition, meanwhile, published evidence suggesting its candidate had won by a considerable margin.</p><p>That prompted a sweeping government crackdown on dissenters.</p><p>In December 2024, Armas was arrested. He said he was taken to a house where he was blindfolded, tied to a chair for days and suffocated with a plastic bag.</p><p>Later, he shared a dingy cell with dozens of other prisoners – and rats. Once he was transferred to El Helicoide, his friends and family had no contact with him for 10 months.</p><p>His release, however, has not meant freedom. The day he stepped out of prison, he celebrated by joining a motorcycle parade with Juan Pablo Guanipa, a prominent politician who had also been freed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325401\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325401\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325401\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26039811205752-1771525517.jpg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Juan Pablo Guanipa and Jesus Armas ride on the backs of motorcycles in a parade\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325401\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Opposition leader Juan Pablo Guanipa, right, and political activist Jesus Armas ride on the backs of motorbikes after their release [Cristian Hernandez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>There was a feeling of energy and optimism, Armas recalled, as they visited the families of other political prisoners. But within hours, Guanipa was abducted by masked individuals. No one knew where he had been taken.</p><p>\"I couldn’t sleep because I was scared,\" he said. His first night home was spent lying in bed, checking for news about Guanipa.</p><p>\"I had all this adrenaline, all these mixed emotions. I was happy because I was with my parents, but there was also fear.\"</p><p>Officials accused Guanipa of breaching the rules of his release, although it is not clear what those limits were. He was held incommunicado for hours before being fitted with an electronic ankle monitor and placed under house arrest.</p><p>Only after the passage of the amnesty bill on Thursday was Guanipa released from house arrest, according to a statement from his brother Tomas Guanipa.</p><p>Still, Guanipa himself warned that the amnesty law would not end the government's oppressive tactics. He highlighted its exclusions and loopholes.</p><p>\"What was approved today in the legislative palace is no amnesty,\" Guanipa <a href=\"https://x.com/JuanPGuanipa/status/2024710922296500571\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media after his second release in less than two weeks.</p><p>\"It is a flawed document intended to blackmail many innocent Venezuelans and excludes several brothers and sisters who remain unjustly behind bars.\"</p><p>For Tineo, cases of re-arrest like Guanipa's show that Venezuela is not sincere about ending government repression.</p><p>\"As long as judicial restrictions remain in place for those released and the 'revolving door' practice continues – new detentions following releases – it can’t be said that there is an end to the policy of persecution,\" she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

My husband is injured, and my children are injured. We want any support or reconstruction … any solution,” said the mother of eight, who had been displaced from the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya.</p><p>Addressing the meeting in Washington, DC, Trump announced that nine member nations have pledged $7bn to a reconstruction fund for the Gaza Strip, with five countries agreeing to deploy troops to an International Stabilisation Force for the Palestinian territory.</p><p>He said the US will also make a contribution of $10bn to the BoP, although he didn’t specify what the money will be used for.</p><p>The pledges, however, remain far below United Nations estimates of up to $70bn needed for <a href=\"/features/2026/2/8/how-reconstruction-became-israels-new-weapon-of-silent-transfer-in-gaza\">rebuilding the Palestinian territory,</a> destroyed by nonstop Israeli bombardment during more than two years of a genocidal war.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326495\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326495\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4326495 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A6000-copy-1771587428.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Awad al-Ghoul, displaced from Rafah in southern Gaza a year and a half ago to the al-Zawayda area in the Gaza Strip, sees the \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326495\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Awad al-Ghoul, displaced from Rafah in southern Gaza a year and a half ago to the az-Zawayda area in the Gaza Strip, sees the “Board of Peace” as nothing more than a “club of major powers” [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Very little has changed since the “ceasefire” agreement brokered by Trump went into effect in October last year.</p><p>Most Palestinians are still struggling to feed their families, while health, education and sanitary services are almost nonexistent.</p><p>Gaza’s Ministry of Health has said that more than 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire since the truce, which Palestinians had hoped would end more than two years of genocidal war that has killed more than 72,000 people, according to official statistics.</p><p>“Israel kills, bombs, violates the ceasefire agreement daily and expands the buffer zone without anyone stopping it,” said Awad al-Ghoul, a 70-year-old Palestinian displaced from Tal as-Sultan in Rafah and who now lives in a tent in the town of az-Zawayda.</p><p>“If a peace board of this size cannot force Israel to stop its attacks in a small place like Gaza, how will it fix conflicts across the world?” al-Ghoul says, referring to Trump’s stated intention that the board would not be limited to Gaza but would extend to intervening in resolving other international disputes.</p><h2 id=\"funds-allocated-genuine-support-or-rhetoric\">Funds allocated: Genuine support or rhetoric?</h2><p>Many people in Gaza who had pinned their hopes on international donor conferences in the past without any tangible results were sceptical about the figures.</p><p>Al-Ghoul said he does not believe these sums will entirely go to Gaza.</p><p>“A small part will go to Gaza, and the rest will be administrative expenses and luxurious salaries for top officials and presidents. A small portion will come to Gaza so they can say they supported Gaza and justify the continuation of their luxury club called the Board of Peace .”&lt;/ p&gt;</p><p>“So this project is a failure from the start and unclear in vision, like the failure of the aid distribution foundation established by America a year ago, which became death traps for thousands.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326497\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326497\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4326497 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A5988-copy-1771587431.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jamal Abu Mukhda from Deir al-Balah believes that the Peace Council and its decisions are merely lies for media consumption [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jamal Abu Mukhda from Deir el-Balah believes that the Board of Peace and its decisions are merely lies for media consumption [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Jamal Abu Makhdeh agrees.</p><p>“They won’t do anything for Gaza. It’s all lies,” the 66-year-old man says. “Anything Israel agrees to certainly won’t be in our interest,” he tells Al Jazeera in Deir el-Balah.</p><p>“Trump, together with Israel, wants to use the Board of Peace to impose their decisions on the world by force. This is about power, control, and domination, without regard for weaker nations like us,” he added.</p><p>Over the past two years, reconstruction plans have been discussed after every ceasefire deal in Gaza. However, Israeli restrictions on the entry of construction materials have hindered the full implementation of those pledges.</p><p>“Even if the board decides to rebuild Gaza, this is unlikely and won’t happen. We’ve heard this many times and nothing happened,” he adds.</p><p>“How can we trust a peace board in which Israel is a member? It is the one that killed us, destroyed us, and committed genocide.”</p><p>While Abu Makhdeh insists he is not optimistic about the board’s decisions, he also expresses concern about Trump and Israel’s insistence on disarming Hamas. Under the truce accord, Hamas is required to hand over its weapons.</p><p>“Their main goal is to disarm Hamas so that we drown in internal and civil disputes,” he adds.</p><p>He said he sees talk of peace as deceptive, pointing to ongoing violations in the occupied West Bank, including the destruction of Palestinian houses and property, settlement expansion, and restrictions on normal life, alongside the deepening tragedy in Gaza.</p><p>“There is no optimism in American decisions. This is just media talk.”</p><p>Al-Ghoul expressed cautious optimism over the idea of sending an international peacekeeping force to Gaza.</p><p>“Personally, I hope this force is sent, but it must act as a deterrent to Israel’s continued attacks, like UNIFIL in Lebanon. I don’t imagine Israel would attack a force imposed by a Board of Peace managed by Trump,” he says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326493\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326493\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4326493 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A6017-copy-1771587425.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Amal Jouda, displaced from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza to Deir al-Balah two years ago, says all she asks for is a dignified life for herself and her children, no matter which party delivers it [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326493\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amal Jouda, displaced from Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza to Deir el-Balah two years ago, says all she asks for is a dignified life for herself and her children, no matter which party delivers it [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"reconstruction-the-biggest-absence-in-the-speech\">Reconstruction: The biggest absence in the speech</h2><p>Despite talk of “stability” and “peace”, the board’s announcement did not include any concrete decision on reconstruction in Gaza or its infrastructure destroyed over two years of war.</p><p>For al-Ghoul, reconstruction is not the priority if Israel continues to violate the truce.</p><p>“Reconstruction has no value if Israel’s hand continues destroying and killing.

But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful,” Kavanaugh wrote in the dissent.</p><p>The majority did not address whether companies could get refunded for the billions they have collectively paid in tariffs. Many companies, including the big-box warehouse chain Costco, have already lined up for refunds in court, and Kavanaugh noted the process could be complicated.</p><p>“The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a ‘mess,’ as was acknowledged at oral argument,” he wrote.</p><p>Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Al Jazeera that the court ruling was “definitely a big repudiation of Trump’s tariff agenda and will force him to rely more on other tools, most of which require more public comment period and Congressional authorisation”.</p><p>Friday’s ruling will also, in particular, “rein in Trump’s ability to threaten tariffs against any country for any reason”, Ziemba told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"additional-tariffs\">Additional tariffs</h2><p>Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate, over the next decade, trillions of dollars in revenue for the US, which possesses the world’s largest economy.</p><p>Trump’s administration has not provided tariff collection data since December 14. But Penn Wharton Budget Model economists estimated on Friday that the amount collected in Trump’s tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) stood at more than $175bn. That amount likely would need to be refunded with a Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.</p><p>The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to impose taxes and tariffs. But Trump instead turned to a statutory authority by invoking IEEPA to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner without the approval of Congress, the first president to use that.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about a third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.</p><p>Ziemba said she expects Congress to support tariffs on China and perhaps approve secondary tariffs, but many other tariffs, like fentanyl tariffs on Canada and Mexico or broad reciprocal tariffs, “are unlikely to pass”.</p><p>Trump described the tariffs as vital for US economic security, predicting that the country would be defenceless and ruined without them. In November, he told reporters that without his tariffs, “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they’ve used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us.” Trump said the US was abused by other countries, including China, the second-largest economy.</p><p>After the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we’ll have to develop a ‘game two’ plan.”</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the US would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump’s tariffs as possible.</p><p>Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten US national security, and another that allows retaliatory actions, including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the US Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against US exporters.</p><p>None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and they may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Epstein <a href=\"/news/2019/8/10/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide-in-prison-say-us-media\">died by suicide</a> in a United States prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>In 2021, Giuffre sued Mountbatten-Windsor for sexual assault. She claimed she had been forced to have sex with him on multiple occasions when she was 17, a minor under US law. Giuffre <a href=\"/news/2025/4/26/epstein-prince-andrew-accuser-virginia-giuffre-dies-by-suicide-family\">died by suicide</a> in April last year after reaching a settlement in this case.</p><p>When he was still a prince, Mountbatten-Windsor served as the UK’s trade envoy from 2001 to 2011, only stepping down when controversy over his links to Epstein intensified. Throughout his time in the role, he faced persistent criticism over his “party prince” image, his conduct on overseas trips, and the cost of his lavish taxpayer‑funded trips and hospitality.</p><p>But Mountbatten-Windsor is far from the first British royal to be engulfed in scandal. In 1936, the monarchy was rocked when King Edward VIII abdicated to marry divorced American Wallis Simpson.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II largely kept the institution steady in the early decades of her reign, but as her children reached adulthood, a new wave of marital crises and personal controversies engulfed the family.</p><p>Here is a closer look at some of the major scandals to have roiled the royals and their reputation in recent decades.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"1992-queen-elizabeth-s-annus-horribilis\">1992: Queen Elizabeth’s ‘annus horribilis’</h2><p>During a speech to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession in November 1992, Queen Elizabeth II described the year as her “annus horribilis”, which is Latin for “horrible year”, following a series of scandals.</p><p>Three of her children’s marriages had failed: Then‑Prince of Wales – now King – Charles and Princess Diana separated, as did Mountbatten-Windsor and his wife, Sarah Ferguson. Princess Anne and Mark Phillips got divorced.</p><p>In August 1992, while separated but still married to Mountbatten-Windsor, Ferguson was photographed on holiday in the south of France with her American financial adviser John Bryan. Bryan was seen kissing her toes, much to the uproar of the general public.</p><p>The same year, a phone call between Diana and her friend, James Gilbey, was leaked and became tabloid fodder. It was believed that the call had been illegally recorded and sold to the media. The intimate and emotional nature of the call led to speculation that Gilbey and Diana were more than friends. On the call, Gilbey called Diana “Squidgy”, and hence the incident became known as “Squidgygate”.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4324805\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_RoyalFamily_UK-1771510381.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_RoyalFamily_UK-1771510381\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"1993-camillagate\">1993: Camillagate</h2><p>An end to the Queen’s “annus horribilis” was not to be.</p><p>Soon after Squidgygate came “Camillagate”. In 1993, the recording of a salacious phone call between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was leaked. The call was from 1989 when Charles and Diana were still married and revealed that Charles and Camilla were in an intimate relationship.</p><p>Public anger over the affair endured for years, but Charles and Camilla eventually married in 2005 and remain married today, with Camilla now serving as Queen.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326526\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326526\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326526\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-618251936-1771588406.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C611&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Charles and Camilla 2005\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326526\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Then-Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles attend a Royal Gala together in 2005, the year they finally married [File: Pool Photograph/Corbis via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1995-diana-s-panorama-interview\">1995: Diana’s Panorama interview</h2><p>Diana was interviewed by journalist Martin Bashir on the BBC programme Panorama that was broadcast on November 20, 1995.</p><p>During the interview, Diana commented on several controversies, including the relationship between Charles and Camilla. About the affair, she said: “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,” which garnered huge public sympathy. She also spoke openly about her mental health struggles – in particular with the condition bulimia nervosa.</p><p>Diana’s candid interview opened the lid on life in the royal family, and she was widely viewed as the “people’s princess” after it was aired.</p><p>Following the interview, Queen Elizabeth II recommended that the couple divorce quickly – the marriage was legally dissolved the following year.</p><p>The circumstances surrounding the interview came under scrutiny more than 20 years later when Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, alleged that Bashir had used false documents and other dishonest tactics to enlist him to persuade Diana to do the interview.</p><p>The BBC appointed a retired senior judge in 2020 to lead an investigation into the matter. A report from the inquiry said Bashir used “deceitful behaviour” and breached BBC rules by mocking up fake bank statements and showing them to Spencer to gain access to the princess.</p><p>In 2021, Princes William and Harry – Diana’s now-grown children – issued a strong criticism of the BBC and British media for what they called unethical practices after the investigation concluded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326503\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326503\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326503\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-52103891-1771587553.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C522&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"diana\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diana, Princess Of Wales, visits The National Children’s Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, in February 1995, the year she was interviewed on Panorama [Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"1997-death-of-diana\">1997: Death of Diana</h2><p>Two years after the Panorama interview, the princess died aged 36 in a Paris traffic accident as she and a companion were being pursued by paparazzi photographers.</p><p>On August 30, 1997, a group of paparazzi had camped outside the Ritz hotel in Paris in hopes of obtaining shots of Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed. The photographers pursued their car to the Pont de l’Alma tunnel, where their driver lost control and crashed. Both Diana and Fayed were killed.</p><p>The public outpouring of grief over Diana’s death contrasted sharply with what was seen as stony silence from the royal family in the immediate aftermath. The family, including the queen, was strongly criticised for not quickly appearing in public and failing to lower the flag over Buckingham Palace to half-staff.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4326520\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4326520\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4326520\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-534249928-1771588216.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C519&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"diana death\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4326520\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mourners left thousands of bouquets, cards and photographs outside Kensington Palace to mark the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 [File: Ralf-Finn Hestoft/Corbis via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"2002-princess-anne-s-criminal-conviction\">2002: Princess Anne’s criminal conviction</h2><p>In November 2002, Princess Anne, the Queen’s only daughter, pleaded guilty to losing control of her dog, an English bull terrier, who then proceeded to bite two children in Windsor Great Park.</p><p>Anne was fined and became the first working royal in modern times to have a criminal record.</p><h2 id=\"2005-prince-harry-s-nazi-costume\">2005: Prince Harry’s Nazi costume</h2><p>Photos of Prince Harry wearing a Nazi armband at a costume party in 2005 caused global outrage and forced him to issue a public apology.</p><p>In his 2023 memoir, Spare, Harry claimed that his older brother, the now-Prince of Wales William and his then-girlfriend (now wife) Kate Middleton had encouraged the choice of outfit and “howled” with laughter when they saw it.</p><h2 id=\"2020-megxit\">2020: Megxit</h2><p>After years of rising tensions with the media, Prince Harry and his wife, the former actor Meghan Markle – now styled the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – announced plans to quit their senior royal duties, move part-time to North America, seek financial independence and withdraw from regular media scrutiny.</p><p>The couple believed that Meghan’s lack of popularity in the UK was down to the mostly negative media coverage she received from the British press.

At least 14 people were killed and scores were injured in one of the darkest episodes of former president Yahya Jammeh’s 22-year rule.</p><p>Mbye survived, but the bullet that struck him caused permanent damage to his spinal cord, leaving him unable to walk.</p><p>“I am depressed at this stage of my life,” he told Al Jazeera, reflecting on how that single moment decades ago shapes and restricts his life.</p><p>“I cannot do anything for myself without the help of my family.”</p><p>Mbye’s father, who supported him for years, died in 2013. “My father wanted to see Jammeh face justice. He died without seeing that,” he said quietly.</p><p>Now, his ageing mother fears she too may pass away before the former government officials who are responsible for her son’s injuries are held accountable.</p><p>“As a mother, it is painful to see your son in this condition,” she said. “I am afraid I might die without him seeing justice.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4323735\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323735\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4323735\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yusuphas-photograph-hangs-on-the-wall-of-the-Victims-Centre.-1771481024.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Yusupha’s photograph hangs on the wall of the Victims’ Centre.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4323735\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yusupha Mbye’s photograph hangs on the wall of the Victims’ Centre [Kaddy Jawo/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-country-confronting-its-past\">A country confronting its past</h2><p>Yahya Jammeh ruled The Gambia from 1994 to 2017 after seizing power in a military coup. His government was later accused of widespread human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, sexual violence and enforced disappearances.</p><p>After Jammeh fled into exile in Equatorial Guinea in 2017, The Gambia established the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) to investigate crimes committed during his rule.</p><p>The commission documented thousands of violations, identified perpetrators and the crimes they committed, and issued far-reaching recommendations, including reparations for victims and criminal prosecutions.</p><p>While some perpetrators have since been prosecuted, others are in prison awaiting trial, while some, like Jammeh, are outside the country and out of the reach of local courts.</p><p>To implement the TRRC’s recommendations on compensating victims, the government created the Reparations Commission, which last month began making payments for abuses committed between 1994 and 2017.</p><p>Compensation is being issued in phases, starting with the earliest violations. The government has allocated 40 million dalasi (about $550,000) to fund the programme over five years.</p><p>Badara Loum, the chairperson of the Reparations Commission, told Al Jazeera that reparations are a core part of The Gambia’s transitional justice process.</p><p>But for many survivors, money alone is not justice.</p><p>“There can be no real justice while Jammeh lives comfortably abroad,” Mbye said.</p><p>Victims say what they need is for those responsible to answer for their crimes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4323737\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323737\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4323737\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8741-1771481025.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gambia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4323737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A photo of Cadet Amadou Sillah, top left, hangs beside others on a wall displaying victims of Jammeh-era abuses [Kaddy Jawo/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"families-living-with-loss\">Families living with loss</h2><p>Mamudou Sillah and his family have spent decades waiting for justice.</p><p>His brother, Cadet Amadou Sillah, was among nearly two dozen soldiers executed in November 1994 after being accused of plotting a coup against Jammeh. The TRRC eventually concluded that Amadou was not involved but had been made a scapegoat.</p><p>“Thirty-two years later, our wounds are as fresh as if it happened yesterday,” his brother told Al Jazeera, speaking at his home in Madiana, about 35km (21 miles) from Banjul.</p><p>Amadou, who was 26 when he died, was the family’s main breadwinner. Without his brother’s support, Sillah was forced to abandon school and take on work at 17 to support the family.</p><p>“He was our hero,” the now 53-year-old said. “He took care of everyone in the family.”</p><p>After Amadou’s execution, Sillah said his family faced harassment and social isolation from their community, forcing them to leave their village and relocate to Madiana.</p><p>As part of the TRRC reparations process, the family has received 600,000 dalasi ($8,170) in payments and are among the first beneficiaries of the programme. But Sillah says the money does not replace accountability.</p><p>“Yes, money is important,” he said. “But what we really want is justice.

Ten years later, we have heard nothing,” Mbye said.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the Gambian government to ask about the reparations and medical care for survivors, but they did not respond.</p><p>Though Mbye returned his initial payment, he has since submitted his details to the Reparations Commission and is awaiting new compensation.

Though deaths in custody were not systematically documented, some prisoners – like prominent opposition figure <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/02/witness-beaten-death-gambia\">Ebrima Solo Sandeng</a> – were killed. For those who were released, and their families, it has been a journey of recovery and a search for accountability.</p><p>Femi Peters was a political activist jailed for organising a 2009 pro-democracy rally calling for electoral reforms under Jammeh’s rule. At the time, Amnesty International campaigned for his release, warning that he was at risk of human rights abuses.</p><p>Peters was released in 2010 and spent years after that awaiting justice. But he eventually died in 2018, under the new administration, still waiting. His son, Olufemi Peters, said the loss still shapes their lives.</p><p>“No amount of reparations will bring my father back,” he told Al Jazeera. “The only closure is seeing those responsible held accountable.”</p><p>Similarly, Nogoi Njie was arrested, tortured and imprisoned in 2016 after attending a peaceful protest against Jammeh’s rule.

Not much is known about his life there, although he occasionally sends WhatsApp audio messages to his supporters at home.</p><p>His political party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC), continues to enjoy significant support. Although the former president does not have much political influence in The Gambia, a segment of society, especially in his home region, maintains that he committed no crimes and should be allowed to live freely.</p><p>Still, momentum is slowly building to hold him to account.</p><p>In 2024, The Gambia passed laws creating a Special Prosecutor’s Office and Special Accountability Mechanisms. It aims to prosecute crimes identified by the TRRC and hold the main perpetrators to account, including Jammeh; Sanna Manjang, one of his enforcers responsible for much of the killing; Yankuba Touray, a former Jammeh ally who is already serving a life sentence; and others who remain at large in The Gambia, like the former vice president, Isatou Njie Saidy.</p><p>With support from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the country is also establishing a hybrid Special Tribunal involving Gambian and international judges, which intends to try perpetrators of rights violations, including Jammeh, if he ever returns to The Gambia.</p><p>Separately, international courts have acted. Switzerland sentenced former interior minister Ousman Sonko to 20 years in prison for torture and other crimes in 2023. Courts in Germany and the United States have also convicted former members of Jammeh’s paramilitary unit, “the Junglers”, such as Bai Lowe, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2022.</p><p>Kebba Jome, head of The Gambia Center for Victims of Human Rights Violations, which provides psychosocial support and legal advocacy to victims, said the tribunal has renewed hope among survivors.</p><p>“We are grateful ECOWAS supported this initiative,” he told Al Jazeera. “Victims must remain at the heart of the justice process.”</p><p>Founded in 2017, the centre has registered more than 1,500 victims. Photographs of many of them line its walls, a stark reminder of the country’s past.</p><p>Yet, Jome acknowledged that justice had already come too late for some.</p><p>“The deaths of victims waiting for accountability show how delayed justice can fail survivors,” he said.</p><p>Human rights lawyer Imran Darboe also welcomed the start of reparations but warned they cannot replace justice.</p><p>“Compensation is welcome,” he told Al Jazeera. “But without transparency, engagement and dignity, reparations risk becoming a transaction rather than a path to healing.”</p><p>Darboe said accountability efforts are growing at home and abroad.</p><p>“Justice may be slow,” he said, “but Jammeh is surrounded by accountability mechanisms. Exile is not impunity.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4323770\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323770\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4323770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Picture-1771481445.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gambia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4323770\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Gambia is still recovering from 22 years of Yahya Jammeh’s rule [Kaddy Jawo/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"still-waiting\">Still waiting</h2><p>According to the Reparations Commission, the TRRC identified 1,009 victims eligible for reparations.

But the remains are still being held in a Banjul morgue, pending use as evidence in future tribunal cases.</p><p>“We want to bury our brother properly,” Sillah told Al Jazeera, lamenting that even their mother died in 2024, still waiting. “We want closure,” he said.</p><p>As The Gambia continues its fragile transition from dictatorship to democracy, survivors say the nation’s struggle now is to confront its past before time runs out.</p><p>Mbye sits quietly as his mother prepares to wheel him back inside as the cool evening sets in.</p><p>“People keep saying justice is coming,” he said softly. “But will it ever arrive?”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"352\" data-end=\"801\">It is no longer possible to interpret the Yemeni landscape solely through the lens of politics. The developments witnessed in the southern Yemeni governorates under government control in recent months clearly indicate that security and military affairs have become the decisive factor in determining the course of power on the ground. Any governmental or political arrangements will be unsustainable unless the issue of security control and the unification of military command are resolved.</p><p data-start=\"803\" data-end=\"1029\">Nor can the escalating Saudi–Emirati rift between two allies who have militarily, politically and economically shaped southern Yemen in recent years be overlooked, given its direct impact on the balance of power and stability.</p><p data-start=\"1031\" data-end=\"1868\">Over the past years, a complex security structure has taken shape across the southern governorates, comprising official units and others that emerged during the war. Some of these units are linked to state institutions, while others were established with Emirati support, such as the Southern Transitional Council’s forces, which number in the tens of thousands, or through local arrangements shaped by the circumstances of the conflict.</p><p data-start=\"1031\" data-end=\"1868\">Although recent months have seen moves to restructure this landscape following the defeat of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which declared its dissolution in Hadhramaut and al-Mahra on January 3, 2026, security control remains uneven from one governorate to another. Furthermore, the STC’s security and military formations have not disappeared entirely; some have been redeployed, while the fate of others remains unknown.</p><p data-start=\"1387\" data-end=\"1846\">In Aden, the temporary capital, security agencies operate within a complex structure. Some units formerly affiliated with the STC have seen their personnel and weapons disappear, while others have been renamed or redeployed. However, longstanding networks of influence remain, and the transfer of leadership or redeployment of camps reflects attempts to rebalance power rather than a definitive resolution of the situation.</p><p data-start=\"1848\" data-end=\"2118\">The same applies, to varying degrees, to Lahij, Abyan, Dhale, Shabwah and Hadhramaut, where the state’s ability to assert effective authority varies, as does the level of coordination between official security forces and the formations that emerged during the war.</p><p data-start=\"1231\" data-end=\"1826\">The most sensitive issue at this stage is the integration of military and security formations into the Ministries of Defence and Interior. The state seeks to end parallel security authority, but the process faces complex challenges, including differing sources of funding for some units, varying political loyalties, fears among some commanders of losing local influence, and considerations related to the composition of these forces. As a result, integration appears gradual, relying more on redeployment and restructuring than on decisive measures that could risk triggering confrontation.</p><p data-start=\"1258\" data-end=\"1451\">The government now based in Aden, southern Yemen, finds itself facing a delicate equation: it must impose its security authority without plunging the country into renewed internal conflict.</p><p data-start=\"1453\" data-end=\"1828\">The transition from multiple armed groups to a state monopoly on the use of force requires political consensus, regional support and international backing. Any hasty move could reignite internal clashes, particularly given existing political and regional sensitivities, as well as fears that the Saudi–Emirati dispute could once again trigger confrontation on the ground.</p><p data-start=\"1830\" data-end=\"1934\">For this reason, government efforts are focused first on establishing a stable security environment.</p><p data-start=\"1225\" data-end=\"1457\">This trajectory cannot be understood without considering the regional dimension. Saudi Arabia views Yemen as a direct strategic depth for its national security and seeks the emergence of a stable state along its southern border.</p><p data-start=\"1459\" data-end=\"1807\">The dispute between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, particularly after Yemen requested the withdrawal of Emirati forces from its territory, has become a significant factor shaping the course of the crisis, especially amid Saudi accusations that Abu Dhabi continues to support the STC and consolidate its influence on the ground.</p><p data-start=\"4345\" data-end=\"4884\">Yemen today is part of a broader regional landscape, intertwined with Red Sea dynamics and maritime routes, competition for influence in the Horn of Africa, and tensions stretching from Sudan to Somalia to the Gulf. For this reason, international actors — particularly the United States — are keen to keep the situation in Yemen under control, fearing that a security collapse could trigger intra-Gulf conflict, threaten international shipping, create space for a new wave of armed groups, or allow the Houthis to exploit the situation.</p><p data-start=\"1051\" data-end=\"1347\">In the next phase, the government is likely to continue efforts to consolidate security control in Aden and other southern governorates, including Hadhramaut, which borders Saudi Arabia, while gradually integrating military units and maintaining political balances to prevent renewed conflict.</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\">The success of these efforts will determine whether the country is moving towards gradual stability or another round of reshaping power centres. Given this reality, the central question remains: who truly possesses the ability to impose security on the ground, particularly as some actors continue to push the Southern Transitional Council towards escalation that could reignite the conflict?</p><p data-start=\"1349\" data-end=\"1743\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
