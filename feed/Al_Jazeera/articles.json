Trump has since backed down from this threat.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"china-s-renewed-sales-pitch\">China’s renewed sales pitch</h2><p>While China has long sought to present itself as a viable alternative to the post-war US-led international order, its sales pitch took on renewed energy at the <a href=\"/economy/2017/1/17/chinas-xi-defends-free-trade-in-speech-at-davos\">World Economic Forum</a>‘s (WEF) annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this month.</p><p>As Trump told world leaders that the US had become “the hottest country, anywhere in the world” thanks to surging investment and tariff revenues, and Europe would “do much better” to follow the US lead, Chinese Vice Premier Li Hefeng’s speech emphasised China’s ongoing support for multilateralism and free trade.</p><p>“While economic globalisation is not perfect and may cause some problems, we cannot completely reject it and retreat to self-imposed isolation,” Li said.</p><p>“The right approach should be, and can only be, to find solutions together through dialogue.”</p><p>Li also criticised the “unilateral acts and trade deals of certain countries” – a reference to Trump’s trade war – that “clearly violate the fundamental principles and principles of the [World Trade Organization] and severely impact the global economic and trade order”.</p><p>Li also told the WEF that “every country is entitled to defend its legitimate rights and interests”, a point that could be understood to apply as much to China’s claims over places like Taiwan as to Denmark’s dominion over Greenland.</p><p>“In many ways, China has chosen to cast itself in the role of a stable and responsible global actor in the midst of the disruption that we are seeing from the US. Reiterating its support for the United Nations system and global rules has often been quite enough to bolster China’s standing, especially among countries of the Global South,” Bjorn Cappelin, an analyst at the Swedish National China Centre, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"the-west-is-listening\">The West is listening</h2><p>John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, told Al Jazeera that the recent series of trips by European leaders to China shows that the Global North is listening, too. Other notable signs include the UK’s approval of a Chinese “mega embassy” in London, Gong said, and progress in a years-long trade <a href=\"/economy/2024/10/30/eu-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-prompting-rebuke-from-beijing\">dispute</a> over Chinese exports of electric vehicles (EVs) to Europe.</p><p>Starmer is also expected to pursue more trade and investment deals with Beijing this week, according to UK media.</p><p>“A series of events happening in Europe seems to suggest an adjustment of Europe’s China policy – for the better, of course – against the backdrop of what is emanating from Washington against Europe,” Gong told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The shifting diplomatic calculations are also clear in Canada, which has shown a renewed willingness to deepen economic ties with China after several spats with Trump over the past year.</p><p>Carney’s is the first visit to Beijing by a Canadian prime minister since Justin Trudeau went in 2017, and he came away with a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/16/canada-china-strike-trade-deals-to-slash-tariffs-on-evs-canola\">deal</a> that saw Beijing agree to ease tariffs on Canadian agricultural exports and Ottawa to ease tariffs on Chinese EVs.</p><p>Trump lashed out at news of the deal, threatening 100 percent trade tariffs on Canada if the deal goes ahead.</p><p>In a statement last weekend on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that Carney was “sorely mistaken” if he thought Canada could become a “‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States”.</p><p>The meeting between Carney and Xi this month also thawed years of frosty relations after Canada arrested Huawei executive <a href=\"/news/2018/12/7/anger-in-china-over-arrest-of-huaweis-meng-wanzhou-in-canada\">Meng Wanzhou</a> in late 2018 at the behest of the US. Beijing subsequently arrested two Canadians in a move that was widely seen as retaliation. They were released in 2021 after Meng reached a deferred agreement with prosecutors in New York.</p><p>In Davos, Carney told world leaders that there had been a “rupture in the world order” in a clear reference to Trump, followed by remarks this week to the Canadian House of Commons that “almost nothing was normal now” in the US, according to the CBC.</p><p>Carney also said this week in a call with Trump that Ottawa should continue to diversify its trade deals with countries beyond the US, although it had no plans in place yet for a free-trade agreement with China.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271260\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271260\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271260\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-24T161140Z_1324184165_RC212JA8ZUQ0_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TARIFFS-CANADA-1769601253.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C550&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Carney Beijing\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Canadian PM Carney, left, meets President Xi in Beijing, China, on January 16, 2026 [Sean Kilpatrick/Pool via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"filling-the-void\">Filling the void</h2><p>Hanscom Smith, a former US diplomat and senior fellow at Yale’s Jackson School of International Affairs, told Al Jazeera that Beijing’s appeal could be tempered by other factors, however.</p><p>“When the United States becomes more transactional, that creates a vacuum, and it’s not clear the extent to which China or Russia, or any other power, is going to be able to fill the void. It’s not necessarily a zero-sum game,” he told Al Jazeera. “Many countries want to have a good relationship with both the United States and China, and don’t want to choose.”</p><p>One glaring concern with China, despite its offer of more reliable business dealings, is its <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/how-did-chinas-trade-surplus-hit-1-trillion\">massive global trade surplus</a>, which surged to $1.2 trillion last year.</p><p>Much of this was gained in the fallout from Trump’s trade war as China’s manufacturers – facing a slew of tariffs from the US and declining demand at home – expanded their supply chains into places like Southeast Asia and found new markets beyond the US.</p><p>China’s record trade surplus has alarmed some European leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, who, in Davos, called for more foreign direct investment from China but not its “massive excess capacities and distortive practices” in the form of export dumping.</p><p>Li tried to address such concerns head-on in his Davos speech. “We never seek trade surplus; on top of being the world’s factory, we hope to be the world’s market too. However, in many cases, when China wants to buy, others don’t want to sell. Trade issues often become security hurdles,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on January 11.</p><p>“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,” Trump added.</p><p>Trump did not elaborate on his suggested deal, but US officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks.</p><p>However, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has rejected talks. “We have always been willing to maintain serious and responsible dialogue with the various US administrations, including the current one, on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect and the principles of international law,” Diaz-Canel said.</p><h2 id=\"what-to-know-about-trump-s-growing-rhetoric-against-cuba\">What to know about Trump’s growing rhetoric against Cuba</h2><p>Following the US attack on Venezuela, the Trump administration has escalated its rhetoric against Cuba, which has been under strict US economic sanctions for decades.</p><p>Last week, the US-based Wall Street Journal reported that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/trump-seeking-regime-change-in-cuba-by-end-of-the-year-us-media-report\">Trump aims to remove Cuba’s leadership</a> and is actively seeking government insiders in Havana who are willing to make a deal with Washington to “push out the Communist regime”.</p><p>Trump on Tuesday said that Cuba is on the brink of collapse. “Cuba is really a nation that’s very close to failing,” he said during a visit to the US state of Iowa.</p><p>The US president said that Cuba no longer receives oil and money from Venezuela, a close ally of Havana since the days of former socialist President Hugo Chavez.</p><p>Last week, a Cuban diplomat based in Bogota<a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/cuban-official-accuses-us-of-piracy-against-sanctioned-caribbean-island\"> accused the US of “international piracy”</a> over Washington’s blockade of Venezuelan oil.</p><p>“The US is carrying out international piracy in the Caribbean Sea that is restricting and blocking the arrival of oil to Cuba,” Carlos de Cespedes, Cuba’s ambassador to Colombia, told Al Jazeera on Saturday, adding that Havana is facing more powerful US threats than it has in the 67 years since the revolution.</p><p>Earlier, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is of Cuban descent and is believed to orchestrate policies towards Venezuela and Cuba, has described the government in Havana as a “huge problem”.</p><p>About a week after Maduro’s abduction, Trump urged Cuba to make a deal “before it is too late,” without specifying what kind of agreement he was referring to.</p><p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump suggested Rubio could become the president of Cuba. “Sounds good to me!” he said.</p><p>Relations between Havana and Washington have been tense for decades. The ties were normalised in 2014 under former President Barack Obama, in a major foreign policy shift. But Trump, who succeeded Obama, reversed the decision and reimposed sanctions during his first term.</p><p>In 2019, Trump banned cruise ships from visiting Cuba, one of the most popular forms of travel to the island, which earns much-needed revenue from tourism.</p><p>Mexico faces its own pressure from Washington, as Trump has threatened to take military action against Mexican drug cartels. Last week, the country transferred dozens of suspected cartel members to the US amid pressure from the Trump administration.</p><p>Since Trump’s return to power in January last year, the war on drugs has been at the top of his administration’s agenda. The US said its action against Maduro was justified, based on claims that Venezuela sent drugs to the US. But Caracas is not the main source of drugs coming into US territory.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-us-policy-affected-cuba\">How has the US policy affected Cuba?</h2><p>Cuba is enduring its worst economic crisis since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, as fuel shortages have caused prolonged power cuts, water and food supply disruptions.</p><p>Analysts say the Cuban economy could collapse completely as Mexican and Venezuelan oil supplies dry up.</p><p>A total blockade on oil imports to Cuba is part of possible new tactics by the Trump administration to drive leadership change in the Caribbean country, according to the US-based Politico site.</p><p>Al Jazeera could not confirm Politico’s report.</p><p>Rising geopolitical tensions with the US have also driven tourists away from Cuba, with the number of visitors dropping by nearly 70 percent since 2018.</p><p>For decades, tourism – a source of livelihood for millions of Cubans – generated up to $3bn a year for Cuba. Some 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba last year, significantly lower than the 4.8 million in 2018 and the 4.2 million in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p><p>Havana classic car driver Aldama recalled that he would sometimes work until 9pm. Nowadays, he’s lucky if he takes one or two tourists for a spin in a day.</p><p>He used to charge $50 for a drive around the capital. Now, given the lack of demand, he has lowered his price to $25 and even $20 if a tourist insists on bartering.</p><p>“The day that we run out of fuel, we’ll stop driving and look for another job,” Aldama told The Associated Press. “There’s no other choice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The analysis identifies an area of about 1.3sq km (half a square mile) that has undergone systematic levelling.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"9\">According to the investigation, the operations went beyond mere debris removal and involved the flattening of land previously devastated by Israeli air strikes.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"9\">The cleared zone is located adjacent to two Israeli military posts, suggesting the new camp will be under direct and immediate military supervision. The satellite evidence aligns with reports that the facility is to act as a controlled “holding pen” rather than a humanitarian shelter.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271184\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271184\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271184\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Area-After-26-01-2026-1769599457.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Recent satellite images reveal that Israel has been conducting rubble removal operations in the south of the Gaza Strip, especially in western Rafah.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on full “security control”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"14\">For Palestinians hoping to return to Gaza, this means submitting to what Afifa describes as “human sorting stations”.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"15\">“This mechanism is designed to deter return,” Afifa said. “Palestinians will face interrogation, humiliation and the risk of arrest at these Israeli-run checkpoints just to go home.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"16\">By leveraging facial recognition technology confirmed by Avivi, Israel is creating a high-risk ordeal for returnees, he said. Afifa argued it will force many Palestinians to choose exile over the risk of the “sorting station”, serving Israel’s longstanding goal of depopulating the Strip.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4021265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4021265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4021265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/INTERACTIVE-Gaza-map-Israels-withdrawal-in-Trumps-20-point-plan-yellow-line-map-1760017243.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Gaza map Israel’s withdrawal in Trump’s 20-point plan yellow line map-1760017243\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4021265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"permanent-occupation-within-the-yellow-line\">Permanent occupation within the ‘yellow line’</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"18\">The Rafah camp is just one piece of a larger puzzle. Israel in effect occupies all of Gaza with a physical military presence in 58 percent of the Gaza Strip. Its forces directly occupy an area within the “yellow line”, a self-proclaimed Israeli military buffer zone established by an October ceasefire.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"19\">“We are witnessing the re-engineering of Gaza’s geography and demography,” Afifa said. “About 70 percent of the Strip is now under direct Israeli military management.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"20\">This assessment of a permanent foothold is reinforced by Netanyahu’s own remarks to the Knesset on Monday. By declaring that “the next phase is demilitarisation”, or disarming Hamas, rather than reconstruction, Netanyahu signalled that the military occupation has no end date.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"21\">“The talk of ‘reconstruction’ starting in Rafah under Israeli security specifications suggests they are building a permanent security infrastructure, not a sovereign Palestinian state,” Afifa added.</p><h2 id=\"a-show-of-peace\">A ‘show’ of peace</h2><p data-path-to-node=\"23\">For the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza, the hope that the return of the last Israeli captive would bring relief has turned into frustration.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"24\">“There is a deep sense of betrayal,” Afifa said. “The world celebrated the release of one Israeli body as a triumph while two million Palestinians remain hostages in their own land.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"25\">Afifa warned that the international silence regarding these “sorting stations” risks normalising them. If the Rafah model succeeds, it would transform Gaza from a besieged territory into a high-tech prison where the simple act of travel becomes a tool of subjugation, he said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"26\">“Israel is behaving as if it is staying forever,” Afifa concluded. “And the world is watching the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/map-shows-what-would-happen-to-gaza-under-the-us-master-plan\">show</a> of peace while the prison walls are being reinforced.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The conflict between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which erupted in April 2023, has placed immense pressure on infrastructure across all Sudanese states.</p><p>Elsewhere in the region, the situation is equally dire. In the Gaza Strip, internal displacement affects nearly two million people—the vast majority of the population. Many have been displaced multiple times due to the Israeli offensive that began in October 2023.</p><p>Adnan Abu Hasna, media adviser for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), describes the situation in Gaza as unique. With 90 percent of homes, schools and infrastructure destroyed, Abu Hasna notes that 2.5 million Palestinians are, in effect, homeless, making a return to normalcy “almost impossible” amid total destruction.</p><p>Meanwhile, protracted conflicts continue to drive displacement figures in Syria, where 12 million remain displaced, and in Yemen, where the number exceeds five million.</p><h2 id=\"the-khartoum-experiment\">The Khartoum experiment</h2><p>Khartoum presents a unique case study in the dynamics of return. The recent resumption of government operations from the capital has sent a signal of potential stability.</p><p>Adel El-Baz, director-general of the African Centre for Consulting, views the government’s return as a “direct invitation” for citizens to follow suit. Major-General Osama Abdel Salam, former director of the Centre for Strategic Studies and Research, argues that the return of civilians naturally enhances security.</p><p>“The filling of abandoned neighbourhoods with residents reduces the risk of negative phenomena, prevents theft and spreads an atmosphere of reassurance,” Abdel Salam explained.</p><p>However, the infrastructure challenge is monumental. Saad El-Din El-Tayeb, spokesperson for Khartoum State, told Al Jazeera that the government has spent more than a year attempting to clear the debris of war.</p><p>“We began by cleaning the cities of bodies and burnt vehicles, restarting water stations, and rehabilitating power distribution lines,” El-Tayeb said.</p><p>He highlighted that Khartoum suffered the “largest looting operation” of its electrical infrastructure in history. Approximately 15,000 electrical transformers were stripped, with looters targeting the copper in underground cables and motors. Despite this, El-Tayeb noted that authorities are diverting available electricity to critical facilities like hospitals and water stations, while encouraging the use of solar energy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"nostalgia-amid-the-ruins\">‘Nostalgia’ amid the ruins</h2><p>For the displaced, the decision to return is often emotional rather than practical. Rimah Hamed, a dentist and journalist, fled Khartoum for Gezira State and later Egypt when hospitals closed and security collapsed.</p><p>She recently returned to her family home in Khartoum. “The primary motivation was nostalgia,” Hamed told Al Jazeera. “The Sudanese character is sentimental. People returned because they missed their homes.”</p><p>Hamed found her neighbourhood transformed. Her house was empty, stripped of essential items, with no running water or electricity.</p><p>“There was only one water source in the neighbourhood where everyone went to fill up,” she recalled. “But gradually, neighbours started coming back. The neighbourhood began to regain its social features, and life returned little by little.”</p><p>Hamed observed that the community had developed a “psychological immunity” to the harsh conditions, adapting to shortages through grassroots initiatives.</p><h2 id=\"prerequisites-for-peace\">Prerequisites for peace</h2><p>While emotional ties drive some to return, sustainable reintegration requires tangible resources. Tom Ndahiro, a Rwandan genocide researcher, suggests that “relative peace” is the baseline requirement – a sense that the situation has improved enough to survive the night.</p><p>Experts interviewed by Al Jazeera outlined a hierarchy of needs for a sustainable return:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> A trusted leadership to organise resettlement and prevent chaos.</li>\n<li><strong>Shelter:</strong> Even temporary structures like tents, provided they offer safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Essentials:</strong> Food security and access to clean water are non-negotiable.</li>\n<li><strong>Power:</strong> Electricity is viewed as the decisive factor for economic stability.</li>\n</ul><p>Rami Mahkar, a journalist, emphasised that security must come first. “Without security, the displaced are forced to move again,” he said, adding that the presence of functioning shops for food and supplies is critical for those trying to rebuild their lives.</p><p>As Sudan attempts to turn the tide on the world’s largest displacement crisis, the durability of this return remains untested. As Hamed noted, the returnees are currently fuelled by resilience and longing, hoping to rebuild what the war has destroyed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Many of those threats have been from strangers, but Omar has also been the repeated target of United States President Donald Trump’s ire.</p><p>And in recent weeks, Trump has extended hostile rhetoric to all <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-plans-crackdown-on-somali-communities-in-minnesota-what-we-know\">Somali Americans</a> and Somalia while his administration has launched its most severe crackdown on immigrants yet in the state of Minnesota, centred on the city of Minneapolis, which Omar represents in the US House of Representatives. In the past three weeks, federal officers have shot dead two US citizens who were protesting against the crackdown, which in turn further inflamed tensions in the state.</p><p>So what happened on Tuesday, and what’s behind Trump’s fixation with Omar, Somalis and Minnesota?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-at-omar-s-event\">What happened at Omar’s event?</h2><p>Omar was attacked in Minneapolis on Tuesday when a man rushed towards the stage during her town hall and sprayed her with an unknown liquid using a syringe, according to police and video footage.</p><p>The incident occurred as Omar was criticising federal immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, singling out the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and the head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p><p>“ICE cannot be reformed. It cannot be rehabilitated. We must abolish ICE for good, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must resign or face impeachment,” Omar said to applause shortly before the attack.</p><p>The man, identified as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak, was sitting in the front row when he stood up and ran towards the podium. Omar took a few steps towards him with her hand raised before he was tackled, restrained by security and arrested.</p><p>In a statement, Omar’s office said she continued the event after the disruption. “During her town hall, an agitator tried to attack the congresswoman by spraying an unknown substance with a syringe,” the statement said. “She continued with her town hall, because she doesn’t let bullies win.”</p><p></p><p>The crowd cheered as the man was pinned to the floor and his hands were tied behind his back. In video footage, someone in the audience can be heard saying, “Oh, my God, he sprayed something on her.”</p><p>Authorities have not publicly identified the substance, but witnesses described a strong, unpleasant odour.</p><p>The incident took place within an hour of Trump, a Republican, mentioning the Democrat during a speech in Iowa.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-ilhan-omar\">Who is Ilhan Omar?</h2><p>Omar came to the US as a child refugee from Somalia.</p><p>She <a href=\"/features/2016/11/15/ilhan-omar-first-female-somali-american-lawmaker\">was born in Mogadishu</a> and her family fled the country in 1991 when Somalia descended into prolonged cycles of clan-based violence, famine and attacks by the armed group al-Shabab, all of which continue to destabilise the Horn of Africa.</p><p>After spending four years in a refugee camp in Kenya, her family was granted resettlement in the US state of Virginia. They later moved to Minneapolis, home to the largest Somali communities in the country.</p><p>Minnesota has an <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-plans-crackdown-on-somali-communities-in-minnesota-what-we-know\">estimated 80,000 people</a> of Somali origin. A majority of them were born in the US. Of those who were born outside the country, 87 percent are naturalised citizens.</p><p>Since November, Trump has repeatedly attacked Somalia and its diaspora while also keeping a focus on Omar.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-has-trump-targeted-somalis\" data-start=\"118\" data-end=\"172\">How has Trump targeted Somalis?</h2><p>On November 21, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was “immediately” terminating temporary protected status (TPS) for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, referring to a programme designed to provide emergency refuge for people whose countries are in crisis. About 705 Somalis were on that programme.</p><p>Without providing evidence, Trump claimed that “Somali gangs are terrorising the people of that great State” and accused Governor Tim Walz, without proof, of overseeing a state that had become a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.</p><p>“Send them back to where they came from,” Trump said. “It’s OVER!”</p><p>In early December, Trump told reporters that he did not want Somali immigrants in the US, claiming that residents of the East African country “contributed nothing” to the US while relying on aid. Trump did not provide any evidence to support these claims.</p><p>He called Somali immigrants “<a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ilhan-omar-denounces-donald-trump-for-calling-somali-immigrants-garbage\">garbage</a>“.</p><p>His language against Somalis has been widely criticised as racist, including by some members of his Republican Party. But that hasn’t stopped Trump.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in December, he said Somalia “isn’t even a country” and the nation “doesn’t function”.</p><p>At the start of January, the Trump administration froze childcare payments in Minnesota during an investigation into alleged fraud that the president has insisted revolves around benefits for Somali immigrants.</p><p>Trump also took his attacks against Somalis to the <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/20/world-economic-forum-at-davos-2026-dates-location-and-what-to-expect\">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos, Switzerland, where he spoke last week.</p><p>“We’re cracking down on more than $19bn in fraud that was stolen by Somalian bandits,” he said. “Can you believe that? Somalia – they turned out to be higher IQ than we thought. I always say these are low-IQ people. How did they go into Minnesota and steal all that money?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-is-trump-targeting-minnesota-and-why\">How is Trump targeting Minnesota and why?</h2><p>Officially, Trump has justified his administration’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/minnesota-sues-trump-administration-over-immigration-crackdown\">crackdown in Minnesota</a> as aimed at undocumented immigrants whom he has blamed, without evidence, for disproportionately contributing to crime and fraud.</p><p>But even by the standards of ICE operations in multiple cities and states across the country, the nature and duration of the violence unleashed by its officers and the officers of other federal agencies, such as Border Patrol, on the streets of Minnesota appear unmatched, according to several observers.</p><p>On January 7, Renee Nicole Good, a 34-year-old woman, was shot dead by an ICE agent in Minneapolis while she was trying to drive her car away from officers. The Trump administration claimed the officer fired in self-defence, but video evidence has raised questions about that account.</p><p>Then, on Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, was shot dead by federal agents while he was helping a woman pushed down on the street by officers. Trump administration officials claimed Pretti had brandished a handgun and was threatening officers, but video footage showed that he did not have a weapon in his hand at the time when he was shot.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On January 13 after Good had been killed, Trump lashed out at Minnesota’s Democratic leadership. While referring to the “GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA” in a Truth Social post, he also issued a blunt warning: “THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION &amp; RECKONING IS COMING.”</p><p>Governor Walz was quick to pick up on Trump’s comments and accuse him of choosing to “punish” the state because it had voted against him in the past three presidential elections.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Illinois, Minnesota is the only Upper Midwestern state that Trump failed to win even once in his three bids for the presidency in 2016, 2020 and 2024.

It wasn’t planned – it just ended up like that. A routine deployment to Kenya saw me head to the Kenya-Somalia border in Mandera town for a drought story.</p><p>At the time, there was hardly any international news coverage on this drought in the Horn of Africa. I was not expecting anything dramatic. I was wrong. The drought is bad.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>As soon as we drove to really remote parts of Mandera County, I started seeing signs that something was wrong.</p><p>The team drove past several dry riverbeds. The camels were thin. Then, we saw the communal graveyards where dead livestock had been dumped and burned.</p><p>I spoke to a local chief in Mandera, Adan Molu Kike. He was a quiet, unassuming elderly man who went out of his way to explain to me how devastating the recent drought is.</p><p>“Our animals started dying in July last year, and they are still dying,” he told me. Then, he asked what country I had come from. I told him Zimbabwe.</p><p>“Have you seen a drought this bad in your country?” he asked me.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>We were moving with a team from the Kenya Red Cross Society. They were keen to show me more about how the drought was affecting communities.</p><p>Water was the biggest challenge. With several rivers dry, water had to be brought in every week from aid agencies. Some communities got water once a week. Others saw the water bowsers arrive twice a week.</p><p>There is usually a timetable. If you miss a delivery, that means no water until the next delivery. The water – brown in colour – also has to be shared with livestock.</p><p>I see pastoralist Mohamed Hussein dragging two containers of water he has just collected from the water bowser delivery truck. He looks tired and doesn’t look like he wants to chit-chat, but he indulges us.</p><p>“I had 100 animals, but now I have only 20 left … My crops in the field are dead,” he says.</p><p>We talk about the drought and water situation. He says three of his goats died the night before. He says it’s because of the drought.</p><p>Hussein insists on showing me the animals in his back yard. He drags one away and tosses the dead goat in a bush. I remember thinking that out here in the desert like Mandera, it’s survival of the fittest.</p><p>Yet, people can’t mourn for too long over dead livestock. He has to keep the few he has left alive or else his family goes hungry.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"from-extreme-drought-to-massive-floods\">From extreme drought to massive floods</h2><p>As journalists, we come into a country, file our reports and fly home. But some experiences stay with you. This drought story did.</p><p>I left Kenya and headed home, thinking my stint reporting on climate change stories was finished for at least a few months. I was wrong.</p><p>I got back home to learn that it’s been raining a lot. Some places in Harare, Zimbabwe, even had flash floods. I thought nothing of it – only that it was interesting coming from a very hot climate to a wet one.</p><p>Then, the next day, news started circulating about floods and very heavy rain in South Africa and Mozambique.</p><p>As journalists, we never really switch off, so I was keeping an eye on the floods in Southern Africa, but I didn’t expect to be deployed to another climate change crisis so soon.</p><p>A day or two later, the situation worsened, and I was heading to Mozambique.</p><p>Again, at the time, there wasn’t much in international media coverage about the floods in Mozambique. South Africa was getting more media attention at the time. So I had no idea of the scale of these floods.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>I landed in Mozambique and went to a neighbourhood in the capital, Maputo, that was affected by floods.</p><p>I put on my gumboots and waded through dirty, smelly floodwaters in between people’s submerged homes. I was shocked – but nothing prepared me for what I later saw elsewhere in the country.</p><p>In Marracuene, I saw a huge toll gate submerged and road signs sticking out on top of the water along a major highway. The highway was now metres deep underwater.</p><p>Then, we got Xai Xai, the capital of Gaza province in the south. Swaths of agricultural land were underwater. Parts of Xai Xai city were submerged. Restaurants, shops and businesses in the city centre sat in water.</p><p>“Now, the water must go down first, and then, we must start cleaning,” Richard Sequeira, the boat captain who was showing me the devastation, said. “There are a lot of snakes and animals around. Maybe 45 days to two months, we will be out of our houses and living like this.”</p><p>He is right. It could be weeks before the water recedes and disappears. But there could be more flooding in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>Authorities in neighbouring South Africa’s Mpumalanga province have ordered people to evacuate from flood-prone areas immediately. The dam there is full and could start releasing water.</p><p>Mozambique is downstream. That means all that water will make its way to already flooded communities. An Al Jazeera reporting team could be back here again.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He directed aid groups to leave within 48 hours.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">Koang told The Associated Press news agency on Monday that the operation aims to recapture towns recently seized by opposition forces and “re-establish law and order”.</p><p>“The country is not at war,” Information Minister Ateny Wek Ateny told reporters in Juba on Tuesday. “We are only stopping the advancement” of the opposition forces, he said.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, this came days after a senior army commander was filmed urging his troops to kill civilians and destroy property in the Jonglei offensive, drawing rebuke from the <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2026/01/1166831\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Nations</a> and others.</p><p class=\"p1\">“It is now indisputable: South Sudan has returned to war,” said Alan Boswell, the International Crisis Group’s project director for the Horn of Africa. “It is incredibly tragic for a country that only grows weaker and poorer.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Here’s what to know about the resurgence of violence in South Sudan:</p><h2 id=\"government-s-battlefield-losses\" class=\"p1\">Government’s battlefield losses</h2><p class=\"p1\">Beginning in December, a coalition of opposition forces seized a string of government outposts in central Jonglei, a region that is the homeland of the Nuer ethnic group and an opposition stronghold.</p><p class=\"p1\">Some of those forces are loyal to opposition leader <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/why-riek-machars-trial-brings-existentially-high-stakes-for-south-sudan\">Riek Machar</a>, while others consider themselves part of an ethnic Nuer militia called the White Army. White Army fighters have historically fought alongside Machar but consider themselves a distinct group.</p><p class=\"p1\">Machar, an ethnic Nuer, was made the most senior of five vice presidents under a <a href=\"/news/2025/3/7/fighting-flares-in-south-sudan-is-the-2018-peace-deal-in-danger\">2018 peace agreement</a> that ended fighting between his forces and those loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, the country’s largest group.</p><p class=\"p1\">That five-year civil war was waged largely along ethnic lines, killing an estimated 400,000 people.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3953257\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3953257\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3953257\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/reuters_68c943e3-1758020579.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C510&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3953257\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Sudan President Salva Kiir [File: Tiksa Negeri/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"suspension-of-government-s-number-two\" class=\"p1\">Suspension of government’s number two</h2><p class=\"p1\">There has been a resurgence of violence in the past year, with sporadic fighting.</p><p class=\"p1\">Machar was suspended last year as South Sudan’s number two after White Army fighters overran a military garrison in the town of Nasir. He now faces <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/south-sudan-charges-vp-machar-with-treason-murder-over-military-attack\">treason</a> and other charges over that attack, which authorities allege Machar helped orchestrate. But Machar’s allies and some international observers say the charges are politically motivated. He remains under house arrest while his trial unfolds slowly in the capital, Juba.</p><p class=\"p1\">Machar’s trial is widely seen as a violation of the 2018 peace agreement. Yet Kiir and his allies say the agreement is still being implemented, pointing to a faction of the opposition still in the unity government.</p><p class=\"p1\">Forces loyal to Machar have declared the agreement dead, and have since ratcheted up pressure on the army by seizing armouries and launching hit-and-run attacks on government positions. The government has relied largely on aerial bombardments to beat back a rebellion that analysts say is gaining momentum across multiple states.</p><p class=\"p1\">After seizing the government outpost of Pajut in Jonglei on January 16, opposition forces threatened to advance towards Juba. The government has responded by amassing fighters in nearby Poktap, while several thousand Ugandan soldiers defend Juba.</p><p class=\"p1\">Army chief Paul Nang gave his troops one week to “crush the rebellion” in Jonglei.</p><h2 id=\"spare-no-lives\" class=\"p1\">‘Spare no lives’</h2><p class=\"p1\">On Saturday, a day before the army announced its offensive, a senior military commander was filmed urging his forces to kill all civilians and destroy property during operations in Jonglei. It was not clear who took the video, which has been shared on social media.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Spare no lives,” General Johnson Olony told forces in Duk county, not far from Pajut. “When we arrive there, don’t spare an elderly, don’t spare a chicken, don’t spare a house or anything.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Armed groups in South Sudan, including the military, have repeatedly been implicated in civilian abuses, including sexual violence and forced recruitment.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olony’s comments were particularly aggressive and drew concern. “We are shocked, we are disturbed, we are surprised,” said Edmund Yakani, a prominent civic leader.</p><p class=\"p1\">His words showed that government troops were being “empowered to commit atrocities, to commit crimes against humanity, and, potentially, even to commit a genocide,” Yakani said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_801042\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-801042\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-801042\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3aa08f3fbdf34c5b8e682e2c0c4281aa_18.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C431&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"South Sudan's Vice President Riek Machar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-801042\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Sudan’s suspended First Vice President Riek Machar [File: Samir Bol/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p class=\"p1\">The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan expressed “grave alarm” at developments that it said “significantly heighten the risk of mass violence against civilians”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Machar’s political group said in a statement that Olony’s words were an “early indicator of genocidal intent”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Speaking to the AP, government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny called Olony’s comments “uncalled for” and “a slip of the tongue”.</p><p class=\"p1\">But he also said while it was possible that Olony was “trying to boost the morale of his forces”, his words are not indicative of government policy.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olony, appointed assistant chief of defence forces for mobilisation and disarmament a year ago, also leads a militia, known as the Agwelek, from his Shilluk tribe that agreed to integrate into the army last year.</p><p class=\"p1\">The deployment of forces to Nuer communities by Olony is contentious because of a separate rivalry between the Shilluk and Nuer communities. In 2022, White Army fighters razed Shilluk villages and displaced thousands of civilians before the government intervened with attack helicopters.</p><p class=\"p1\">Olony’s forces were also involved in military operations in other Nuer communities last year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Deploying him to Jonglei “is incendiary”, said Joshua Craze, an independent analyst and writer on South Sudan. “His presence in the state is a propaganda gift to the opposition in its mobilisation efforts.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The players involved are Facundo Garces, Rodrigo Holgado, Imanol Machuca, Joao Figueiredo, Gabriel Palmero, Jon Irazabal and Hector Hevel, all of whom have featured for the Harimau Malaya national team.</p><p>“This means that the 12-month suspension from all football activities imposed by FIFA on the seven players has been temporarily lifted,” the federation said in a statement. “They are now allowed to continue their careers and participate in football-related activities until CAS makes a final ruling.”</p><p>It did not say when a final ruling is expected.</p><p>Last month, FIFA overturned the results of three Malaysia matches over player ineligibility.</p><p>In its latest decision, FIFA’s disciplinary committee also changed the results of three friendlies the players had appeared in – against Cape Verde on May 29, Singapore on September 4 and Palestine on September 8, the FAM said.</p><p>“All three matches were declared lost by forfeit [score of 3-0], and FAM was sanctioned with a fine of 10,000 Swiss Francs [$13,060]. The decision remains subject to appeal,” a FIFA spokesperson said.</p><p>Malaysia had drawn 1-1 with Cape Verde and earned 2-1 and 1-0 wins over Singapore and Palestine, respectively.</p><p>The scandal had led to uproar in Malaysia, with fans and some lawmakers calling for action against the FAM and government agencies responsible for granting the players’ citizenship.</p></div></div></body></html>"
