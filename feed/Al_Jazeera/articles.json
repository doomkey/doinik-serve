The rescued bed is used by one of her sons after getting new slats and a new lease on life.</p>\n<p>“These are the most important pieces of furniture in the house,” she said, gently running her hand over one of the damaged surfaces.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3847473\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3847473\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3847473\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0603_131038002-1753003803.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Fatima Kandeel holds a bag of recovered items from her previous home, destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in Hay El Selom, southern Beirut, including a stuffed SpongeBob toy which belonged to her son Hassan [João Sousa/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3847473\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fatima Kandeel stands in front of a salvaged wardrobe, holding a bag of items her sons salvaged from the rubble of their home in Hay el-Selom, which Israel destroyed.

I was so happy we got them back.”</p>\n<p>Hassan and Hussein found more in the rubble of their home: a stuffed toy that Hassan used to play with and a few of the books from their mother’s library.</p>\n<p>As she spoke, Fatima held the stuffed toy in her hands, smiling and looking at it. Hussein was quietly observing his mother as she shared her thoughts.</p>\n<p>“He used to sleep with it beside him every night,” Fatima recalled. “I couldn’t save much from their childhood after my divorce, but I kept this, and now it survived the war too.”</p>\n<p>In her bedroom, a small table holds a stack of books about history, religion and culture – a fragment of what she once owned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scars-visible-and-invisible\">Scars, visible and invisible</h2>\n<p>From the living room balcony, the scars of war are visible. The top floors of a neighbouring building have been destroyed, the lower floors still standing – a daily reminder of what was lost.</p>\n<p>Yet Fatima holds Dahiyeh dear and is determined to stay.</p>\n<p>“I love the people here,” she said. “Everyone is kind. … Dahiyeh is home.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hussein agreed that he feels most at home in Dahiyeh with its strong sense of community and friends and neighbours all around.</p>\n<p>During the war, he struggled emotionally, constantly stressed and getting into fights. He has seen two therapists but hasn’t felt much improvement.</p>\n<p>Unlike his mother, Hussein is open to the idea of leaving Dahiyeh, but he pointed out practicalities – rents and the overall cost of living outside Dahiyeh are much higher if they could find a place to rent.</p>\n<p>And, he said, they could face sectarian discrimination if they relocate.</p>\n<p>The family had to leave Dahiyeh briefly during Israel’s war on Lebanon and sought shelter in the nearby coastal Beirut suburb of Jnah. Fatima still carries a painful memory from that time.</p>\n<p>A Jnah grocery store owner snidely remarked: “Look at those trashy Shia people,” as he looked at newly arrived families dressed in the slippers and pyjamas they fled in.</p>\n<p>The comment left a scar, and she refuses to leave Dahiyeh again.</p>\n<p>“If war comes again, what do you teach the next generation?” she asked. “That it’s OK to give up your home? Or that you stand your ground?”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3847484\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3847484\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3847484\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0603_13502900-1-1753003833.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A busy street in Hay El Selom, decorated by posters of Hezbollah martyrs, including the late leader of the organisation, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, where Fatima and her two sons used to live before their home was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in 2024 [João Sousa/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3847484\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A street in Hay El Selom is decorated with posters of Hezbollah martyrs, including late leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.

Its history has been shaped by the 1975-1990 Lebanese Civil War and Israeli assaults, including the devastating 2006 war.</p>\n<p>It’s a cycle, Iman said – another war, another wave of fear and displacement. During Israel’s most recent war on Lebanon, the family fled multiple times.</p>\n<p>They first went to Kayfoun village in the Mount Lebanon governorate in late September, but tensions there were high, and a local man spread rumours of imminent Israeli strikes, trying to scare displaced families away.</p>\n<p>They left Kayfoun after a week and fled to Tripoli in the north, where life was quieter and the presence of nearby relatives offered some comfort, but mistrust lingered.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Iman was often judged by her hijab, which marked her as “resistance-aligned” to people who blamed Hezbollah for Israel’s attacks on Lebanon.</p>\n<p>“We all became introverts,” Hassan recalled. “We stayed home most of the time, but we had relatives nearby and met some good friends. We’d sit together, play cards. It helped.”</p>\n<p>In early October, they followed friends to Iraq’s capital, Baghdad, where they were welcomed warmly – more warmly, they said, than in parts of Lebanon.</p>\n<p>After the ceasefire, they returned. “There’s no place better than our country,” Iman insisted, but Dahiyeh does not feel safe to her any more despite her deep ties to the neighbourhood, so she is searching for a new home – anywhere that’s safer.</p>\n<p>“If it were just me, I’d stay,” she said. “But I have kids. I have to protect them.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"they-don-t-rent-to-shia-families\">‘They don’t rent to Shia families’</h2>\n<p>Iman’s son Hassan recalls the first time Israel bombed near their apartment – on April 1 in breach of the November ceasefire.</p>\n<p>“I just wanted out,” he said. “I don’t care where we go. Just somewhere that isn’t a target.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3847593\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3847593\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3847593\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_0604_161735002-1-1753006743.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iman Kandeel and some members of her family gather in their living room in Hadath, Beirut, a home they are contemplating leaving if the war between Israel and Lebanon escalates again [João Sousa/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3847593\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Iman Kandeel in her living room.

It is close to Dahiyeh but not part of it, making it relatively safer. And it would be closer to Iman’s sister Mariam, who lives there.</p>\n<p>But Iman said: “In Hazmieh, most of them don’t rent to Shia families, or they would double the price.”</p>\n<p>Despite the mounting fear, the family does not want to leave Lebanon, and Hassan has turned down a job offer abroad. They’re exhausted, they said, but not ready to abandon their country.</p>\n<p>Even in the midst of war, Hassan said, his parents did not want to leave Dahiyeh. He had to work on convincing them to go first to Kayfoun, then eventually Iraq.</p>\n<p>It was the same after the ceasefire with long discussions about whether to leave, and it was his mother’s fear for her children that made her eventually agree.</p>\n<p>But more than a month after they spoke to Al Jazeera in early June, they’re still searching for a place that will take them and that they can afford.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

With 2024 the hottest year on record and 2025 not far behind, air conditioning is no longer a luxury for many – it’s a lifeline.</p>\n<p>Al Jazeera breaks down how air conditioners work, traces the history of cooling, and offers practical tips on protecting your AC and reducing energy costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-air-conditioning-work\">How does air conditioning work?</h2>\n<p>Air conditioners cool indoor spaces by moving heat from inside your home to the outside using a chemical fluid called a refrigerant. The process starts when the indoor unit draws in warm air from the room and passes it over evaporator coils filled with cold, low-pressure liquid refrigerant. As the air moves across the coils, the refrigerant absorbs the heat and evaporates into a gas, cooling the air in the process. A fan then blows the cooled air back into the room.</p>\n<p>The now-warm refrigerant travels to the outdoor unit, where a compressor increases its pressure and temperature. In the condenser coils, the refrigerant releases heat to the outside air, turning back into a liquid. The cycle then repeats.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852493\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852493\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852493\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/interactive-How-does-an-Air-conditioner-work-june8-2025-copy-4-1753275607.png?quality=80\" alt=\"interactive-How does an Air conditioner work-june8-2025 copy 4-1753275607\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852493\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-long-have-air-conditioners-been-around\">How long have air conditioners been around?</h2>\n<p>In 1820, British scientist Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and evaporating ammonia could chill air. It was an early breakthrough that laid the foundation for modern refrigeration and cooling systems.</p>\n<p>In the 1830s, American physician John Gorrie took a practical approach to the idea. He built a machine in Florida which created ice and used it to cool hospital rooms, aiming to treat patients suffering from tropical diseases.</p>\n<p>The modern era of air conditioning began in 1902, when Willis Carrier, an American engineer, designed a system to control humidity and temperature at a New York printing press. Though intended to remove humidity, which causes paper to expand and contract and can change ink colours, Carrier’s invention is considered the first true air conditioner.</p>\n<p>By 1914, the first residential air conditioner was installed in a Minneapolis mansion. It was huge – roughly the size of an entire room – and far from affordable for the average household.</p>\n<p>In 1931, engineers HH Schultz and JQ Sherman developed the first window-mounted unit, making cooling more accessible for individual rooms. This innovation paved the way for household adoption in urban areas.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852502\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852502\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852502\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-515176272-1753275835.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C594&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"GettyImages-515176272-1753275835\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr Willis H Carrier holds a thermometer inside an igloo display that demonstrates air conditioning at the New York World’s Fair.

After World War II, economic growth, mass production and suburban housing booms brought AC into homes and offices. During this time, Freon (a chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC) replaced toxic refrigerants like ammonia and propane, making systems safer, more compact and easier to install.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852513\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852513\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852513\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock-1753276285.png?w=748&amp;resize=748%2C935&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"The 1963 General Electric Porta-cart air conditioner [Everett Collection/Shutterstock]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The 1963 General Electric Porta-cart air conditioner [Everett Collection/Shutterstock]</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852498\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852498\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852498\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-3229435-1753275798.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C599&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An air conditioner is mounted in the window of an offic\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852498\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An air conditioner is mounted in the window of an office, circa 1955 [Lambert/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The mini-split system was first developed in Japan in the late 1950s as a more efficient alternative to bulky window units and centralised HVAC systems. Its key innovation was a ductless design, which delivers air directly from an outdoor compressor to an indoor air handler – minimising energy loss typically caused by ductwork.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852500\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852500\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852500\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-81615627-1753275814.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C531&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"GettyImages-81615627-1753275814\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852500\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sign outside a US restaurant points to the use of air conditioning – as well as ‘White Rest Rooms’, in a clear indication of racial segregation – circa 1960 [Joan Sydlow/FPG/Hulton Archive/Getty Images] (Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>By the 1970s and 1980s, mini-splits were being used across Asia and parts of Europe, and later expanded into North America. Their flexible installation and energy efficiency made them ideal for older buildings where retrofitting ducts was costly or impractical, as well as for homeowners seeking precise, room-by-room climate control. This is also when inverter technology, which adjusts the speed of the compressor to help save energy, was developed.</p>\n<p>In the 1990s, rising energy costs and growing environmental concerns led governments to adopt energy efficiency standards for cooling systems. In response, manufacturers introduced more efficient compressors, thermostats and system designs to reduce electricity consumption. During this period, the United States’ Clean Air Act was amended to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Their replacement, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), like R-134a, gained popularity. But while HFCs don’t harm the ozone layer, they are potent greenhouse gases which contribute significantly to global warming.</p>\n<p>The 2000s brought a new wave of innovation, with air conditioners beginning to integrate digital controls, motion sensors and smart thermostats. Wi-Fi connectivity allowed users to adjust temperature settings remotely, while automation made systems more adaptive and efficient.</p>\n<p>By the 2010s, concerns over global warming and the environmental effects of refrigerants triggered a transition away from hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Newer refrigerants like R-32 and R-290 (propane), already being used in parts of Asia and Europe, marked a shift towards low-emission, climate-friendly cooling.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852491\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852491\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852491\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/interactive-History-of-air-conditioning-june8-2025-copy-6-1753275600.png?quality=80\" alt=\"interactive-History of air conditioning-june8-2025 copy 6-1753275600\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852491\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-choose-the-right-air-conditioner\">How to choose the right air conditioner</h2>\n<p>Choosing the best-sized air conditioner is essential for keeping your home comfortable and your energy bills under control.

That’s about 7 percent of total global electricity use, which was roughly 29,000 TWh. When looking specifically at buildings, cooling accounts for nearly 20 percent of electricity consumption.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852488\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852488\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852488\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/interactive-Global-electricity-use-for-air-conditioning0D-june8-2025-copy-3-1753275593.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"interactive-Global electricity use for air conditioning-june8-2025 copy 3-1753275593\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852488\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This enormous energy demand comes with a climate cost.

In contrast, ownership remained low in heat-exposed but lower-income nations such as India and South Africa, where access is limited despite intensifying heatwaves.</p>\n<p>Countries with both hot climates and higher incomes – like Saudi Arabia, where 63 percent of households have an AC unit, and South Korea (86 percent) – have widespread adoption.

Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, disputed that characterisation.</p>\n<p>“There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in,” Cheung <a href=\"https://x.com/StevenCheung/status/1841242913302327506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media. “They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented.”</p>\n<p>The back-and-forth escalated when 60 Minutes aired two different cuts from its interview with Harris.</p>\n<p>One version, which aired on a sister programme, Face The Nation, featured more of Harris’s answer about her stance towards Israel. The other version, which aired on the 60 Minutes broadcast, was shorter.</p>\n<p>Trump called the different edits evidence of deceptive reporting tactics and filed a lawsuit against Paramount, CBS’s parent company.</p>\n<p>“CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” his court filing alleged.</p>\n<p>“That is false,” 60 Minutes responded in a statement on its website.</p>\n<p>“When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.”</p>\n<p>While many media experts expected Paramount to prevail on the merits of the case, the company instead sought to negotiate an end to the matter. Earlier this month, it agreed to pay $16m to Trump to go towards his future presidential library.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, another top CBS show, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, revealed it had been cancelled, allegedly for financial reasons.</p>\n<p>But the timing and unexpected nature of the cancellation drew speculation that it might have been an attempt to appease Trump and streamline the merger, given the fact that Colbert frequently lambasted the Republican president on his show.</p>\n<p>Trump himself <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114874422468516376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on Truth Social, “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.”</p>\n<p>The Late Show was consistently the top-rated late-night comedy show, and it had won a Peabody Award and multiple Emmy nods.</p>\n<p>Days later, on July 22, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114897600777919524\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> for more comedians to be ousted, writing, “It’s really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!”</p>\n<p>That same day, he confirmed he received the $16m for his 60 Minutes settlement, adding that he <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114898229237459086\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expected</a> to be receive an additional $20m in free advertising and programming from the “new owners”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-park-tv-show-takes-aim\">South Park TV show takes aim</h2>\n<p>Within weeks of both the 60 Minutes lawsuit settlement and the cancellation of The Late Show, the FCC gave its blessing to the merger between Paramount and Skydance.</p>\n<p>Under the merger, Skydance founder David Ellison, the son of Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison, is slated to helm operations.</p>\n<p>Upon the merger’s approval, Trump’s appointee to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, released a <a href=\"https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1948503402213671247/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> echoing some of the president’s criticisms of major news outlets.</p>\n<p>He also hinted that the merger would result in changes to CBS’s news output.</p>\n<p>“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” he wrote. “It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcasting network.”</p>\n<p>“In particular, Skydance has made written commitments to ensure that the new company’s programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.”</p>\n<p>To ensure compliance with that commitment, Carr said an ombudsman would be appointed to the media giant for a period of at least two years.</p>\n<p>Carr added that the merger between Skydance and Paramount would also bar the new mega-company from implementing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, which are designed to create an equal playing field for people regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion or ability.</p>\n<p>But the merger did not put an end to the scrutiny of Trump on Paramount platforms.</p>\n<p>Hours after the FCC granted its approval, the TV channel Comedy Central aired an episode of the animated series South Park that mocked President Trump and satirised its parent company’s $16m settlement.</p>\n<p>In one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI34iAvKyVQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scene</a>, an animated Jesus attempts to warn the show’s characters about Trump.</p>\n<p>“The guy can do whatever he wants now that someone backed down, OK?” the animated Jesus says. “You guys saw what happened to CBS? Yeah, well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert?”</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has since blasted the show as irrelevant.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Now at 1.6 percent, the monthly rate is among the lowest since April 2020.</p>\n<p>Back in 2023, high inflation put a great strain on Argentina’s population, with prices of basic goods – such as food, services and rent — escalating month on month while salaries stayed stagnant.</p>\n<p>Argentina has a history of high inflation going back to the 1940s, including several cycles of hyperinflation, the most recent in the late 1980s, pointed out Mariana Heredia, a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Conicet).</p>\n<p>“Inflation is a global phenomenon, but in Argentina, it has been such a constant that people tend to think that all their problems are related to inflation. For people here, stability is very important,” Heredia told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why the promise to tackle inflation helped Milei garner significant support on his way to the presidency. He now says achieving the lower rate is evidence of the success of his economic programme, which made radical cuts to public spending, including in healthcare, <a href=\"/news/2024/10/3/defying-protesters-argentinas-milei-shoots-down-university-funding-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">education</a>, social services and public infrastructure works, to achieve a fiscal surplus.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857228\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857228\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-2.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468217.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857228\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-2.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468217.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857228\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Despite a drastic cut in inflation, Argentina continues to be one of the most expensive countries on the continent [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But his programme has also involved an early nominal devaluation, which then saw the Argentian peso appreciate, making the country more expensive in dollars. This, combined with a sharp fall in real wages, has delivered a significant blow to the purchasing power of large sections of the population.</p>\n<p>Argentina is now among the most expensive countries in Latin America, but it also has some of the lowest salaries.</p>\n<p>While tackling inflation was essential to start fixing Argentina’s ailing economy, it’s proving not to be enough, experts say.</p>\n<p>“Inflation isn’t everything,” Guido Zack, economy director at Fundar, a national think tank, told Al Jazeera. “Having a low inflation rate is important, but [in Argentina] the economic recovery has been very mixed among sectors of the economy and of the population. The majority of the population still has a low purchasing power, the rate of informal work has risen, and the poverty rate is still very high. There’s still a long way to go.”</p>\n<p>Other analysts have criticised aspects of the methodology used to calculate inflation in Argentina. They say the basket of goods and services used to measure it, developed in 2004 and updated in 2016, does not accurately reflect current consumption patterns. This includes the share of income that goes into paying for housing, which rose in the renter-dense greater Buenos Aires area by 4.5 percent in June alone. According to a September poll from Inquilinos Agrupados (Organised Renters), which surveys tenants twice a year, renters spend an average of 44.5 percent of their income on rent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"economic-stress\">‘Economic Stress’</h2>\n<p>The mismatch between some economic indicators and what people are experiencing in their daily lives is what the Observatory of Social Debt of the Catholic University of Argentina has called “economic stress” — the increased perception, or reality, that most salaries are not enough to cover basic living expenses.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857236\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857236\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-3.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468571.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857236\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shop-in-Buenos-Aires-3.-Patricio-A-Cabezas-1753468571.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C616&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Shop in Buenos Aires, Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Argentinians are taking loans to pay for food [Patricio A Cabezas/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This is particularly evident in the country’s increasing rate of personal borrowing. According to a recent report by the Social and Economic Statistics and Tendencies Institute (Instituto de Estadísticas y Tendencias Sociales y Economicas – IETSE), 91 percent of homes in Argentina have some form of debt, and 58 percent of those loans were taken to buy food in 2024.</p>\n<p>“Sales have slowed right down in recent months,” Martinez, the butcher, said. “People are always looking for discounts, buy smaller quantities, maybe for the day, and tend to pay with credit card; it’s hard to find anyone paying in cash.”</p>\n<p>People’s frustration at the economy is also evident on the streets of Buenos Aires, where protests against inflation and cuts to public funding – mostly led by pensioners – have increased.</p>\n<p>Every Wednesday, pensioners gather in front of Congress in Buenos Aires to demand a rise in their state pensions. The current pension for five million people stands at $300 a month, below the minimum living wage. Milei has promised to veto a bill approved by Congress for a rise in pensions.</p>\n<p>Raul Maldonado, 68, retired in 2020 after working as a lathe operator in a factory for 35 years. He now makes just more than the minimum pension.</p>\n<p>“The money I earn lasts 15 days. If it wasn’t for the help of my family, I would not be able to survive,” he says.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857253\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857253\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pensioners-protesting-in-Argentina-Josefina-Salomon-1753468818.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857253\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pensioners-protesting-in-Argentina-Josefina-Salomon-1753468818.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C475&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pensioners protesting in Argentina\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857253\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pensioners protesting in Buenos Aires in Argentina [Josefina Salomon]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-long-game\">The long game</h2>\n<p>As Milei promises to continue pushing through with his current economic plan, the question is whether he can keep inflation down and adopt measures to improve other indicators.</p>\n<p>Heredia says that the type of anti-inflationary programme, focused on cuts to public spending and an appreciated currency, is similar to others implemented in Argentina in the past, but which failed to work in the long run.</p>\n<p>“At first, these kinds of programmes can bring people some initial relief – they generate some economic bounce back and, to a certain extent, an increased income to some high-earning sectors. But in the midterm, the costs start to show when it comes to the public spending cuts, the opening of the economy to imports that affect local production and its impact on the job market.”</p>\n<p>For Zack, the key to the long-term economic recovery is the adoption of measures aimed at improving some of the structural challenges Argentina faces, which have a negative impact on the economy.</p>\n<p>Among them, he lists the country’s complex tax system, high levels of bureaucracy, the current lack of investment in public infrastructure, such as roads to connect the country, as well as the low exchange rate and openness to imports.</p>\n<p>“Even if Argentina manages to sustain low inflation, that’s a complicated cocktail” to tackle, Zack said.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

And so what’s been done here has really been remarkable.”</p>\n<p>A representative for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Garrett Ripa, also confirmed that “two or three removal flights” had already been conducted from the Alligator Alcatraz facility and that more were planned.</p>\n<p>He indicated that those flights contained “ up to a hundred individuals who were illegally present in the state of Florida”.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857188\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857188\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857188\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25193643742990-1753464253.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C542&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A person waves a US flag in front of a sign for Alligator Alcatraz.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857188\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rana Mourer waves a vintage-style US flag outside of the migrant detention facility dubbed Alligator Alcatraz on July 12 [Alexandra Rodriguez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"delegating-resources\">Delegating resources</h2>\n<p>President Trump campaigned for re-election last November on the promise that he would undertake the “largest deportation operation in American history”.</p>\n<p>But with more than 11 million undocumented people believed to be living in the United States, critics have pointed out that his ambitions may outstrip the amount of detention space and resources the government has available.</p>\n<p>That has led the Trump administration to seek additional resources from state and local authorities, as well as assistance from foreign governments.</p>\n<p>He has also deployed the military to assist in immigration enforcement operations, a task traditionally outside its scope.</p>\n<p>Part of Trump’s toolkit has been deputising state and local leaders through Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n<p>While the federal government is solely responsible for immigration enforcement, Section 287(g) creates a loophole that allows ICE to enter into written agreements with state and local authorities to perform specific immigration-related functions.</p>\n<p>Speaking alongside DeSantis on Friday, Larry Keefe, the head of Florida’s newly established State Board of Immigration Enforcement, said his team has already taken advantage of such arrangements.</p>\n<p>“Just within the last couple of days, the federal government has issued credentials to over 1,200 Florida sheriff’s deputies and over 650 FDLE [Florida Department of Law Enforcement] agents and other state and local law enforcement agencies,” Keefe said.</p>\n<p>“We have more than doubled our capability and capacity to effect arrests.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"florida-at-the-forefront\">Florida at the forefront</h2>\n<p>Florida, however, has been testing the limits of what it is able to do independently in terms of cracking down on undocumented immigration within its state lines.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, for instance, the Florida’s Republican-led government passed a law, known as SB 4-C (<a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025C/4C/BillText/er/PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PDF</a>), that imposes stiff criminal penalties on adult undocumented immigrants who knowingly enter the state.</p>\n<p>But federal courts placed an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect, on the basis that it preempts the federal government’s authority over all things immigration.</p>\n<p>Still, President Trump has hailed the aggressive immigration efforts in Florida, his adopted home state, where he maintains a residence, Mar-a-Lago, as well as golf courses.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, he visited Alligator Alcatraz, applauding its fast-paced construction. “This is what you need,” Trump said at the time. “A lot of bodyguards and a lot of cops in the form of alligators.”</p>\n<p>Critics have <a href=\"/video/quotable/2025/7/13/alligator-alcatraz-is-aninternment-camp-for-detained-migrants\">denounced</a> the facility as an exercise in cruelty, with reports emerging of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/21/less-than-human-report-details-trump-immigration-detention-centre-abuses\">poor conditions</a> inside Alligator Alcatraz. Some immigrants have said they faced floodwater, poor sanitation, clogged toilets and clouds of mosquitoes as they stayed in fenced-in units where the lights were never dimmed.</p>\n<p>Environmental groups and Indigenous members of the local Seminole and Miccosukee tribes have also criticised the facility for its location in the middle of the Everglades wetlands, a sensitive ecosystem prone to seasonal flooding.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"utilising-an-old-airfield\">Utilising an old airfield</h2>\n<p>Built across eight days in June, Alligator Alcatraz sits atop the site of the former Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida.</p>\n<p>That set-up has been a benefit for plans to also use the facility for deportation flights, DeSantis said on Friday. He described transferring immigrants from their detention cells to planes with relative ease.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons why this was a sensible spot is because you have this runway that’s right here,” DeSantis explained.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to drive them an hour to an airport. You go a couple thousand feet, and they can be on a plane and out of here.”</p>\n<p>He added that the site already has runway lighting and 18,927 litres — or 5,000 gallons — of jet fuel on site. That, he hopes, will help pave the way for the number of deportation flights to increase in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>“ The cadence is increasing,” DeSantis said. “We’ve already had a number of flights in the last few days.”</p>\n<p>Alligator Alcatraz — named for a forbidding island prison in the San Francisco Bay that closed in the 1960s — has the capacity to hold up to 3,000 people, according to Florida officials.</p>\n<p>DeSantis has long positioned Florida as the “blueprint” for what Republican leadership in the US could look like, and in 2023, he launched a <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/ron-desantis-files-paperwork-for-us-presidential-campaign\">short-lived presidential campaign</a> to challenge Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"increasing-the-pace\">Increasing the pace</h2>\n<p>In his remarks on Friday, DeSantis briefly acknowledged the shortcomings in Trump’s mass-deportation plans, playing up the efficiency of the Alligator Alcatraz system.</p>\n<p>“ICE has been understaffed — you know, is not scratching the surface of what would need to be done to get to where you have the largest mass deportation in history,” he said.</p>\n<p>“So you’ve got to increase that tempo. You have a limited amount of time to do it. I think we’ve got to assume we’ve got these four years under the Trump administration to really get the job done.”</p>\n<p>DeSantis also brushed aside concerns that the isolated facility cuts immigrants off from their legal representation and their right to be heard before a court.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that he plans to have immigration judges on site. But he also questioned whether undocumented people should be allowed the same due process rights as US citizens and immigrants with legal status.</p>\n<p>“To me, it’s like, if you are subjected to a traditional criminal process, there’s a whole a bunch of due process that goes into that,” DeSantis said.</p>\n<p>By contrast, DeSantis argued that the immigration process “should be a pretty simple process. You either have a right to be here or you don’t.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population.”</p>\n<p>Macron’s announcement drew the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/25/us-israel-condemn-frances-move-to-recognise-palestinian-state\">ire of Israeli leaders</a>, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said the move “rewards terror”.</p>\n<p>But Netanyahu has faced widespread condemnation for Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 59,000 Palestinians since it began in October 2023.</p>\n<p>Israel’s blockade of the enclave has caused a deepening humanitarian crisis, with the United Nations and top human rights groups reporting that many Palestinian children are now suffering from severe malnutrition and at risk of death.</p>\n<p>In a statement on Friday, Starmer said “the appalling scenes in Gaza are unrelenting”.</p>\n<p>“The continued captivity of hostages, the starvation and denial of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people, the increasing violence from extremist settler groups, and Israel’s disproportionate military escalation in Gaza are all indefensible,” he said.</p>\n<p>But Starmer stopped short of announcing plans to recognise a Palestinian state, instead saying he was working “on a pathway to peace in the region”.</p>\n<p>“That pathway will set out the concrete steps needed to turn the ceasefire so desperately needed, into a lasting peace,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Recognition of a Palestinian state has to be one of those steps. I am unequivocal about that. But it must be part of a wider plan which ultimately results in a two-state solution and lasting security for Palestinians and Israelis.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Reporting from a protest outside Starmer’s residence in London on Friday afternoon, Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic said demonstrators expressed “outrage” at the British government’s stance amid the dire situation in Gaza.</p>\n<p>“Many of them feel powerless, so one of the only things they can do is gather here, make as much noise as they can, and hope that it will be noticed by the people in power,” she said.</p>\n<p>“They want Keir Starmer to do more with the power that he has, and with the influence that he has, to put an end to this.”</p>\n<p>In addition to recognising a Palestinian state, the British government has faced growing calls to sanction Israel and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/4/pro-palestine-protesters-in-uk-call-for-israel-arms-embargo-sanctions\">impose an arms embargo</a> against the country.</p>\n<p>Veselinovic said Starmer is in “a difficult diplomatic situation” as he prepares to meet United States President <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/us-doctors-veterans-urge-trump-to-end-israel-support-as-hunger-grips-gaza\">Donald Trump</a>, who was travelling to Scotland on Friday.</p>\n<p>She explained that Macron’s announcement added pressure on the UK, which is a close ally of both France and the US, to also recognise a Palestinian state, but noted that Trump has criticised the French president’s move.</p>\n<p>“It does seem like a gulf is emerging here over what the European stance is overall, which is much more aligned with what UN aid agencies are saying is going on on the ground in Gaza, and the American position, which seems to nearly 100 percent back whatever is the Israeli government’s version of events is,” she said.</p>\n<p>“And in the middle of that is Keir Starmer, who wants to maintain good relations with both sides.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
