Those trips appeared to happen before Trump has said the pair had a falling out.</p><p>The recent releases also contain images showing prominent individuals like tech billionaire Bill Gates, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, director Woody Allen and former US President Bill Clinton socialising with Epstein, sometimes on his private island.</p><p>To date, none of the individuals depicted in the releases have been charged with any crimes, outside of Maxwell.</p><p>Following her conviction in 2021, she is serving a 20-year prison sentence, though she has continued to deny any wrongdoing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Epstein died from apparent suicide in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.</p><p>He had previously been convicted of state sex-offender charges in Florida in 2008 as part of a plea deal that was widely slammed for its leniency. He spent a total of 13 months in custody.</p><p>One of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, also filed lawsuits against him, accusing him of arranging sexual encounters with politicians, business titans, academics and other influential figures while she was underage.</p><p>All of the men identified by Giuffre, who died in April 2025 in Australia, have denied the allegations.</p><p>Among the people she accused was Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, who <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/the-uks-prince-andrew-gives-up-royal-title-amid-epstein-allegations\">denied the claims</a> but settled a lawsuit filed by Giuffre for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>In October, his brother, King Charles III of the United Kingdom, stripped Mountbatten-Windsor of his royal titles as a result of the controversy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Gulfstream is owned by General Dynamics.</p><p>That threat, if carried out, would have a drastic impact on US carriers like American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which rely on Canadian-made aeroplanes for many of their regional services.

Vonn then skied slowly to the finish line, stopping a couple of times on the way down and clutching her left knee.</p><p>“I crashed today in the Downhill race in Switzerland and injured my left knee. I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams,” Vonn wrote in her Instagram post. “Thank you for all of the love and support. I will give more information when I have it.”</p><p>The race, which was held in difficult conditions with low visibility, was cancelled after Vonn’s crash.</p><p>The American, who was expected to be one of the biggest stars of the Games, limped into a tent for medical attention before being airlifted away by helicopter, dangling from a hoist cable with two people attending her.</p><p>Before she entered the tent, Vonn had an anxious expression on her face, and her eyes were closed during a long embrace with teammate Jacqueline Wiles, who was leading the race when it was cancelled.</p><p>“I know she hurt her knee, I talked to her,” International Ski and Snowboard Federation CEO Urs Lehmann told reporters in the finish area. “I don’t know if it’s really heavy and [if] she won’t miss the Olympics. Let’s wait for what the doctors are saying.”</p><p>Vonn made a stunning comeback last season at age 40 after nearly six years away from ski racing. Skiing with a partial titanium implant in her right knee, she has been the circuit’s leading downhiller this season with two victories and three other podium finishes in the five races.</p><p>Including super-G, Vonn had completed eight World Cup races this season and finished on the podium in seven of them. Her worst finish was fourth.</p><p>The crash occurred exactly a week before the Milan Cortina opening ceremony.</p><p>Vonn’s first Olympic race is the women’s downhill on February 8. She was also planning on competing in the super-G and the new team combined event at the Games.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4276478\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4276478\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4276478\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26030288221744-1769790650.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"United States' Lindsey Vonn ahead of an alpine ski, women's World Cup downhill, in Crans Montana , Switzerland,\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4276478\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">United States’ Lindsey Vonn before an alpine ski, women’s World Cup downhill, in Crans Montana, where competitors complained of poor conditions [Pier Marco Tacca/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Women’s skiing at the Olympics will be held in Cortina d’Ampezzo, where Vonn holds the record of 12 World Cup wins.</p><p>Vonn was also planning on racing a super-G in Crans-Montana on Saturday in what would have been her final race before the Games.</p><p>Vonn was the sixth racer in Friday’s downhill and had registered the fastest time at the first checkpoint before landing a jump off-balance. She lifted her left arm and pole high into the air in an attempt to regain her balance. As she tried to brake, she got spun around and ended up in the nets.</p><p>Two other skiers had also crashed before her: Nina Ortlieb of Austria and Marte Monsen of Norway.</p><p>Ortlieb crashed on top in the same area as Vonn and Monsen hit the nets just before the finish area and had to be taken away in a sledge. The race was delayed after both of those crashes. But then two racers – Wiles and Corinne Suter, the Olympic champion, completed their runs.</p><p>Wiles barely could make the tight final left-hand turn that had tricked Monsen.</p><p>Romane Miradoli of France, who did complete her run as the second to start, said visibility was an issue, with snow falling.</p><p>“You can’t see,” Miradoli said, “and it’s bumpy everywhere.”</p><p>Asked if it was dangerous, Miradoli added, “We just couldn’t see well.”</p><p>Vonn has had numerous crashes in her career. One of her worst was at the 2013 world championships in Schladming, Austria, during a super-G that was also held in difficult conditions. Vonn then had to be airlifted off the course and tore apart her right knee. She returned the following season, got hurt again and missed the 2014 Sochi Olympics.</p><p>The race started Friday in a subdued mood in Crans-Montana, which is coping with the trauma of a devastating fire in a bar in the early hours of New Year’s Day that killed 40 people and injured more than 100. A minute’s silence was observed before racing.</p><p>The finish area stripped of colour and the usual sponsor adverts. Instead, it was dressed with white and black banners featuring a ribbon with the words “Our thoughts are with you” written in French, German, Italian and English.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At the same time, Trump says that he is not necessarily a supporter of regime change, but leaves the door open for it.</p><p>Trump actively cultivates an image that may – in a more disparaging way – be called the “madman theory” of foreign policy. Said to have originally been coined by former US President Richard Nixon in the late 1960s, the idea is for the enemy to question just how far you are willing to go, even if it seems irrational.</p><p>The US assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in 2020 was one of the major examples of Trump acting this way during his first term. The unexpected killing of a senior state official of another country risked direct war and went against the opinions of many foreign policy experts. And yet Trump saw it as an act of deterrence and strength, and felt vindicated once it became clear the Iranians would not respond in kind.</p><p>In his second term, Trump has doubled down on this style of foreign policy, most notably in the abduction of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/rubio-testifies-before-us-senate-on-abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro\">Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro</a>. It now serves to give added heft to his current threats towards Iran.</p><p>The tactic serves two separate instincts within Trump and those around him – a desire to appear to be different from the neoconservatives who took the US into the 2003 war and subsequent disastrous occupation of Iraq, while simultaneously weakening any force in the region deemed to be a threat to the US or its chief Middle Eastern ally, Israel.</p><p>In essence, Trump wants to use the threat of force – and the occasional attack – to get short-term “wins” that make US enemies weaker, while steering clear of any protracted engagements.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"can-trump-be-successful\">Can Trump be successful?</h2><p>How long that can work for depends on the size of the goal. When limited concessions are acceptable to both the US and the adversary, Trump’s threats can potentially lead to results in his favour.</p><p>The US president’s current threat to “no longer help” Iraq if the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/trump-says-us-will-end-support-for-iraq-if-al-maliki-reinstated-as-pm\">pro-Iranian politician Nouri al-Maliki</a> becomes prime minister is a case in point.</p><p>Trump may be imposing his will on Iraq, but it is a threat backed not by war, but by potential economic consequences, therefore reducing the sense that Iraqi sovereignty is under attack. It also leaves the door open to other politicians the US deems acceptable to be prime minister, including the man currently in the job, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.</p><p>Al-Sudani is within the same wider Shia political alliance as al-Maliki, but is considered not to be as close to Iran and does not have the latter’s baggage. Keeping al-Sudani in power instead of al-Maliki, if that does indeed happen, is a relatively easy deal to make in return for avoiding any US economic wrath – and allows Trump to secure another “win”.</p><p>In Syria, US policy appears to be more focused on gradual withdrawal, because Trump feels like he has a partner in the group that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trump-praises-syrian-president-al-sharaa-after-offensive-against-sdf\">he can work with</a> in President Ahmed al-Sharaa. US policy in Syria is fixated on two goals: ensuring that ISIL (ISIS) does not strengthen, and guaranteeing no threat towards Israel from Syria.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has no qualms in abandoning the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, a US ally now deemed surplus to requirements.</p><p>Instead, Gulf powers, led by Saudi Arabia, have said that they can vouch for the Syrian government and al-Sharaa, and for Trump, this is a way to largely wash his hands of at least one problem in a region he has long maintained is prone to endless wars.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"increasing-complications\">Increasing complications</h2><p>In Lebanon and Gaza, Trump has attempted to use the threat of military force to achieve two goals: an end to all-out war and for anti-US and anti-Israel forces to agree to disarm.</p><p>Trump’s policy goals in Lebanon and Gaza are less maximalist than in Iran, but achieving them will be more complex than the relatively moderate concessions demanded of Iraq.</p><p>In both Lebanon and Gaza, the US has stepped in after devastating Israeli wars and positioned itself as a peacemaker, despite backing Israel in both of the conflicts.</p><p>And yet peace is conditional on armed groups – <a href=\"/features/2026/1/29/aouns-tightrope-daily-israeli-attacks-and-hezbollahs-refusal-to-disarm\">Hezbollah in Lebanon</a> and Hamas in Gaza – disarming completely. During the gradual negotiations in both instances, the US has presented itself as a restraining force on Israel, preventing a return to all-out war, but allowed Israel to carry out regular small-scale attacks that serve as reminders of what Israel and the US could carry out if their demands are not met.</p><p>But full disarmament is a bitter pill to swallow for both Hezbollah and Hamas.</p><p>In Syria, Hezbollah and its supporters would see this as accepting defeat in the fight against the US and Israel – a catastrophic blow for an organisation that sees itself as a resistance movement to those two powers.</p><p>Trump’s “<a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/27/trumps-board-of-peace-puts-rights-abusers-in-charge-of-global-order\">Board of Peace</a>“, the body established to oversee the administration of Gaza, is more palatable to Hamas to a point, but similarly, the full disarmament being demanded of the group will take away one of the central elements of its self-identity, even as Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land continues with no end in sight.</p><p>It is therefore likely that both Hezbollah and Hamas believe that agreeing to the demand to fully disarm is an existential matter, opening the door to a future breakdown of negotiations.</p><h2 id=\"long-term-consequences\">Long-term consequences</h2><p>Iran’s past experience with Trump and perception of its own existential threat may test the limits of Trump’s approach to foreign policy.</p><p>Trump insists that he wants a deal, but the Iranian government is signalling that it simply does not believe him, based on what it believes to be his duplicitous previous attacks during negotiations, and his willingness to abduct foreign leaders as a means of projecting US power.</p><p>The Iranians appear to see few off-ramps, and based on their experience in the past year, now regard concessions as merely inviting further pressure.</p><p>The Islamic Republic – or at least elements within it – sees that its own survival is at stake. So now, for the US and Trump, it is the other side that may have nothing to lose. In these circumstances, can the “madman” foreign policy approach work?</p><p>Ultimately, Trump’s approach of projecting the US’s military might can compel the other side to provide concessions – but only up to a point if they feel that they are marked for elimination.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The 55-year-old is known to be in Trump’s orbit and has recently called for lower interest rates, although he is expected to stop short of the more aggressive easing associated with some other potential candidates for the job.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Still, he is expected to face a punishing Senate confirmation hearing, with US lawmakers likely to be particularly critical given Trump’s public comments and the Department of Justice’s decision earlier this month to open a criminal probe into Powell.</p><p>Critics, including Powell, have said Trump’s actions seek to undermine the Federal Reserve’s independence and pressure the agency to set monetary policy aligned with the president’s wishes.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-federal-reserve-do\">What does the Federal Reserve do?</h2><p>The Federal Reserve has long been seen as a stabilising force in global financial markets, due in part to its perceived independence from politics.</p><p>It is tasked with combating inflation in the US while also supporting maximum employment. It is also the nation’s top banking regulator.</p><p>The agency’s rate decisions over time influence borrowing costs throughout the economy, including for mortgages, car loans and credit cards.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In a statement, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the US Senate Banking Committee, said, “This nomination is the latest step in Trump’s attempt to seize control of the Fed.”</p><p>She pointed to the investigation into Powell, as well as Trump’s effort to push out Fed Governor Lisa Cook, which is currently being challenged before the US Supreme Court.</p><p>“No Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination until Trump drops his witch-hunt,” Warren said.</p><p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis, meanwhile, said he would not vote to confirm any nominee until the Department of Justice probe into Powell is ended.</p><p>“Protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable,” he said in a statement.</p><p>Still, some Republicans welcomed the nomination.</p><p>“No one is better suited to steer the Fed and refocus our central bank on its core statutory mandate,” Republican Senator Bill Hagerty said in a statement.</p><p>If Warsh is confirmed, it remains unclear whether Powell would immediately step down or finish out his term. Traditionally, Federal Reserve chairs step aside as soon as their replacement is appointed, but the political situation has led to speculation Powell could stay on as long as possible.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-warsh\">Who is Warsh?</h2><p>Warsh is currently a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p><p>He was a member of the Federal Reserve’s board from 2006 to 2011 and became the youngest Federal Reserve governor in history when he was appointed at age 35.</p><p>He was an economic aide in George W Bush’s Republican administration and was an investment banker at Morgan Stanley. His father-in-law is Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics fortune and a longtime donor and confidant of Trump’s.</p><p>Warsh has historically supported higher interest rates to control inflation, but has more recently argued for lower rates.</p><p>He has been a vocal critic of current Federal Reserve leadership, calling for “regime change” and criticising Powell for engaging on issues like climate change, which Warsh has said are outside the role’s mandate.</p><p>Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said Warsh’s experience means his appointment will likely be well received by the markets.</p><p>“The consensus is that in the short term, yes, this is a nominee who will do what the president has asked,” she said.</p><p>“But what he could do long term as chair of the board is very similar, ironically, to what Jerome Powell, the current board chair, is doing right now,” she said.</p><p>“That is having independence – making decisions based on economic data and not necessarily on political whims of a president.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US fleet of warships includes the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>US Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed in a post on X on Monday that the USS Abraham Lincoln had been sent to the Middle East to “promote regional security and stability”.</p><p>The vessel, which departed its home port of San Diego, California in November and had been operating in the South China Sea until last week, is one of the US Navy’s largest warships.</p><p>Trump first issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/what-are-trumps-military-options-for-an-attack-on-iran\">threat</a> to militarily intervene in Iran earlier this month during protests against the country’s government. The <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\">protests</a> had begun in late December 2025 over the country’s worsening economic conditions. They escalated into a broader challenge to the country’s clerical leadership, which has been in power since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p><p>Trump initially backed down from his threat to attack Iran after receiving assurances that protesters would not be executed, he said. But he has since renewed them.</p><p>Tehran has stated that it is not willing to negotiate under the threat of attack and has signalled its readiness to defend Iran.</p><p>“Tehran’s priority is currently not to negotiate with the US, but to have 200 percent readiness to defend our country,” Kazem Gharibabadi, a senior member of the Iranian negotiating team, told Iranian state media on Wednesday.</p><p>He said messages had been passed to the US through intermediaries, but stated that even if conditions became suitable for talks, Iran would remain fully prepared to defend itself. He pointed out that the US launched an assault on its nuclear facilities in June last year – just as negotiations were about to begin to end its 12-day war with Israel.</p><p>During that conflict, there were few Israeli casualties, but Iranian missiles did manage to breach Israel’s much-vaunted “Iron Dome” defence system, causing alarm in Tel Aviv and Washington.</p><p>On Thursday, the Iranian army announced it had added 1,000 new “strategic” drones to its forces, including one-way attack drones and combat, reconnaissance and cyber-capable systems designed to strike fixed or mobile targets on land, in the air and at sea.</p><p>“Proportionate to the threats facing us, the agenda of the army includes maintaining and improving strategic advantages for fast combat and a decisive response to any aggression,” army commander Amir Hamati said in a short statement.</p><p>At the same time, however, Iran is pursuing diplomatic channels in a bid to de-escalate the situation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-diplomatic-efforts-are-taking-place\">What diplomatic efforts are taking place?</h2><h3>Turkiye</h3><p>Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, arrived in Istanbul to hold high-level talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday.</p><p>While announcing Araghchi’s meetings with the Turkish leaders, Esmaeil Baghaei, Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, said that Tehran aims to “constantly strengthen ties with neighbours based on shared interests”.</p><p>While the exact agenda for these discussions has not been revealed, the talks come amid Trump’s threats of military intervention in Iran.</p><p>Araghchi’s meeting will take place while similar discussions between Iran’s leadership and representatives of other countries continue.</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>On Thursday, Araghchi spoke with Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on a phone call.</p><p>According to a news release by the Iranian government, Dar reiterated Islamabad’s position on respecting state sovereignty, rejecting interference in other countries’ internal affairs and condemning “terrorism”.</p><p>On the same day, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Sharif wrote in an X post that the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening ties between Pakistan and Iran.</p><p></p><h3>Egypt</h3><p>Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday that its top diplomat, Badr Abdelatty, had spoken with Araghchi and US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff separately in a bid to “work toward achieving calm, in order to avoid the region slipping into new cycles of instability”.</p><h3>Saudi Arabia and Gulf nations</h3><p>On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman held a call with Iran’s President Pezeshkian and said the kingdom would “not allow its airspace or territory to be used for any military actions against Iran or for any attacks from any party, regardless of their origin”.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has made similar pledges not to allow a US strike on Iran from its territories or airspace.</p><h3><strong>India</strong></h3><p>On Wednesday, India’s deputy national security adviser, Pavan Kapoor, travelled to Tehran for meetings with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani and Deputy for International Affairs Ali Bagheri Kani.</p><p></p><p>Last week, India voted against a United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution condemning Iran for its crackdown on protesters.</p><p>Twenty-five members of the council voted in favour of the resolution, while 14 abstained. Seven, including India, China, Vietnam and Cuba, opposed it.</p><h3 id=\"china\">China</h3><p>Besides also voting against the UNHRC resolution last week, China made a show of support for Iran at the UN on Wednesday this week.</p><p>Fu Cong, China’s permanent representative to the United Nations, told an open debate on the Middle East: “The use of force cannot solve problems. Any acts of military adventurism will only push the region into an abyss of unpredictability.” He urged all countries to abide by the United Nations Charter and to oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries.</p><p>“China hopes that the United States and other relevant parties will heed the call of the international community and regional countries, do more things that are conducive to peace and stability in the Middle East, and avoid exacerbating tensions and adding fuel to the fire,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Russia</h3><p>On Thursday, Russia said there was room for negotiation between the US and Iran.</p><p>“We continue to call on all parties to exercise restraint and to renounce any use of force to resolve issues. Clearly, the potential for negotiations is far from exhausted … We must focus primarily on negotiating mechanisms,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</p><p>“Any forceful actions can only create chaos in the region and lead to very dangerous consequences in terms of destabilising the security system throughout the region.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-about-the-west\">What about the West?</h2><p>Western leaders have largely focused on condemning Iran’s crackdown on protesters this month and have mostly held back from making any major pronouncements on an impending war between Iran and the US.</p><p>On January 25, French armed forces minister Alice Rufo told local media that while France wants to support the Iranian people, “a military intervention is not the preferred option.”</p><p>She added that it was “up to the Iranian people to rid themselves of this regime”.</p><p id=\"meanwhile-on-thursday-eu-introduced-sanctions-against-the-irgc-kaja-kallas-hypocrisy-of-the-eu-calling-the-irgc-vs-the-idf\">But that was perhaps the closest a European nation has come to opposing Trump’s military plans. Instead, while Iranian authorities were engaged in diplomatic outreach with regional neighbours on Thursday, the European Council adopted new sanctions against 15 Iranian individuals and six entities.</p><p>The Council said in a statement that these restrictions had been imposed in response to “serious human rights violations in Iran, following the violent repression of peaceful protests, including the use of violence, arbitrary detention, and intimidation tactics by security forces against demonstrators”.</p><p>The European Union also designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “terrorist organisation”.</p><p>The US, Canada and Australia also listed the IRGC as a terrorist organisation in 2019, 2024 and 2025, respectively.</p><p>Kaja Kallas, vice president of the European Commission, wrote in an X post on Thursday: “Any regime that kills thousands of its own people is working toward its own demise.”</p><p>On Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote in an X post that “France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations.”</p><p>This marked a policy reversal from Paris, which had previously argued that legal and procedural obstacles prevented the EU from designating the IRGC as a terrorist organisation.</p><p>The Iranian leadership strongly criticised the EU decisions.</p><p>“Putting aside the blatant hypocrisy of its selective outrage – taking zero action in response to Israel’s Genocide in Gaza and yet rushing to ‘defend human rights’ in Iran – Europe’s PR stunt mainly seeks to cloak that it is an actor in severe decline,” Araghchi wrote on social media.</p><p>As Trump renewed his threats of military intervention in Iran on Wednesday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that the Iranian government’s “days are numbered”.</p><p>“A regime that can only hold onto power through sheer violence and terror against its own population: its days are numbered,” Merz said at a news conference with Romanian Prime Minister Ilie Bolojan.</p><p>“It could be a matter of weeks, but this regime has no legitimacy to govern the country”.</p><h2 id=\"could-diplomacy-work\">Could diplomacy work?</h2><p>Experts say diplomacy will likely have only a limited impact when it comes to defusing military tensions between the US and Iran.</p><p>Adnan Hayajneh, a professor of international relations at Qatar University, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/make-deal-or-face-far-worse-attack-trump-tells-iran-in-new-threat\">said</a> the calls for de-escalation from regional actors were unlikely to play a major role in influencing US decisions on whether it would strike Iran.</p><p>“[Trump] doesn’t really care about regional actors,” he said. “At the end of the day, he listens to himself.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

For instance, the way apartheid South Africa was no longer the same entity after 1994, or that East Germany was the same entity after unification [in 1990].”</p><p>The argument is that Israel, as it stands now, is unsustainable. And it is not so much about the way Israel treats Palestinians, but about division within Israel. Many secular Israelis are leaving the country – including entrepreneurs who have made Israel’s tech industry one of the best in the world. At the same time, the religious Zionist and ultra-Orthodox segment of society is growing rapidly, even as it comparatively brings in less money to the economy.</p><p>The loss of Israelis leaving the country will therefore potentially take much of the revenue and investment needed to sustain the expansionist aims of a hard-right government, while subsidising a benefits-reliant community of ultra-Orthodox adherents.</p><p>One of the major push factors for secular Israelis is the country’s deep political polarisation, exacerbated by war, the attempted weakening of the judiciary, and the endless machinations of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>Hever isn’t alone in his diagnosis. Perhaps most notable was the 2024 pronouncement from Eugene Kandel, the former head of Israel’s National Economic Council and an ally of Netanyahu, and Ron Tzur, the director of Israel’s Strategic Futures Institute, that Israel was unlikely to reach the centenary of its 1948 establishment if it continues on the same path.</p><p>The two based their conclusion on the divisions within Israeli society, outlining three groupings: a liberal Jewish secular group, a group that wants a religious Jewish state, and a group that advocates for a state with equal rights for Jews and Palestinians.</p><p>Kandel and Tzur see the main divide as being between the first two groups. “A war over the home, over everyone’s identity and values against everyone else, creates an existential threat to the country, because such a war cannot be stopped without a dramatic change in the feelings of all parties,” the two wrote.</p><p>For others, such as American political scientist Ian Lustick, that end has already been reached.</p><p>“[Israel] is no longer a ‘Jewish state’ in the sense that most Israeli Jews mean it, namely a state that privileges Jews over non-Jews but successfully fronts itself as a liberal democracy,” he told Al Jazeera. “Israel is now an apartheidist state which includes all the people living between the [Jordan] river and the [Mediterranean] sea.”</p><p>According to Hever, Israel cannot afford what he referred to as “the luxury of decline”. That is, to remain as it is, Israel must maintain its core workforce of educated middle-class innovators, such as those currently responsible for driving its technology sector, or maintaining its medical system.</p><p>Likewise, to fuel its continued expansion into Palestinian territory, Israel must maintain the industrial, infrastructure and technology to maintain its military strength, and a standard of living to prevent its people from leaving.</p><p>At present, none of those indicators are in good shape, analysts say.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"emigration\">Emigration</h2><p>Israel’s leaders have long regarded population growth as a strategic priority. From the moment the state was formed following the <a href=\"/news/2022/5/15/nakba-mapping-palestinian-villages-destroyed-by-israel-in-1948\">expulsion of some 750,000 Palestinians</a> in 1948, maintaining a clear demographic advantage over Palestinians was seen as vital to the Zionist project, as well as to the ability of the new state to field enough soldiers to secure its borders.</p><p>However, according to analysts, the period of political polarisation that preceded Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has already resulted in the departure of many of the young graduate class that Israel needs to safeguard its future, even before Netanyahu’s government introduced reforms that would weaken the independence of the judiciary in early 2023.</p><p>At the time, <a href=\"/news/2023/2/20/what-are-israels-judicial-changes-causing-uproar\">Netanyahu’s plan</a> to rob the country’s Supreme Court of much of its powers of government oversight divided Israel to a degree that its later genocide in Gaza failed to match. Protesting what they saw as the government’s power grab, more than 200,000 – roughly 2 percent of the country’s population – took to the streets in protest.</p><p>The outcome has been stark. While government laws blurring legal and physical residency make accurate numbers hard to gauge, the Israeli parliament’s own figures and those of think tanks show that increased emigration, particularly among secular Israelis, has significantly slowed the growth of Israel’s population. In all, driven by war and an increasingly polarised society, more than 150,000 people have left Israel in the past two years, and more than 200,000 since the current government took office in December 2022.</p><p>“The educated upper-class are also more able to leave,” Hever said. “They’re educated, so they can find jobs, and they speak English. They’re also more exposed to international, rather than Hebrew, media, so they have a better idea of what’s going on and how Israel is perceived. However, increasingly, we’re seeing families with children leave, suggesting this is a more fundamental shift.”</p><p>“[Israeli economist] Dan Ben-David estimates that Israel relies on around 300,000 members of a core elite to sustain it,” Hever added. “So if a significant number leave, it stops being a developed economy and becomes a developing economy … which it can’t really afford. It just doesn’t have the luxury of losing its economic power or its standard of living. For a colonial state to exist, it relies on occupying land – and that costs money.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"economic-burden\">Economic burden</h2><p>Investor confidence has also been damaged as a result of both the judicial reforms and war, undermining the economic growth that Israel relies upon to support its military spending, expansion and increasing numbers of ultra-Orthodox citizens who often rely on state benefits to support their religious studies.</p><p>In 2018, according to Kandel and Tzur, the average Israeli family paid about 20,000 shekels ($6,450)  to support Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community. However, according to demographers, the size of that community is expected to triple by 2065, pushing the burden on non-Orthodox Israeli households to the equivalent of 60,000 shekels ($19,370) a year.</p><p>Add to that an increase in defence spending if Israel continues on its current war posture, and analysts warn that the strain on Israel’s main tax-paying sector could become unsustainable, while investors are also moving money out of the country.</p><p>“Even before the judicial reforms, institutional investors were moving money out of the country, and had been doing so since the 2008 financial crisis,” Hever said. “Around 50 percent of internal investment is now abroad.”</p><p>“Foreign investment is also down. Israel’s typical target for investment was its tech sector, but that sector is primarily military: Elbit, for instance, which is now under pressure from BDS [the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions movement],” Hever added. “There’s also been a sharp reduction since the 2023 judicial overhaul, with investors unsure whether conflicts over, for example, copyright or tax will now be ruled upon by a nationalist or extremist government-appointed judge.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-future\">What future?</h2><p>At present, Israel remains relatively secure.</p><p>Though its renewal remains uncertain, the 10-year, $38bn arms deal signed by the <a href=\"/news/2016/9/15/us-and-israel-sign-record-38bn-military-aid-deal\">United States in 2016 </a>continues to underpin much of the country’s arms and tech industry. Its economy continues to grow, and some of its more optimistic forecasters are now looking forward to the first full year with no external shocks since the COVID pandemic of 2019.</p><p>However, few can avoid the fact that, while its economy may be growing, it is doing so at a reduced rate compared with other developed countries.</p><p>Likewise, with the US threatening war against regional nemesis Iran, political deadlock over the recruitment of the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/ultra-orthodox-fury-over-military-enlistment-turns-deadly-in-israel\">ultra-Orthodox</a> at home, and the far-right apparently ascendant, predictions that the economy may get through 2026 unscathed may be wishful thinking.</p><p>Meanwhile, the long, slow exodus of the young and the talented continues and, with it, the prospect of a secure future withers.</p><p>Some observers, such as Chatham House’s Yossi Mekelberg, were philosophical over the future of the country, or if it might collapse, saying: “When dictatorships come to an end, they break into pieces. Democracies are chipped away bit by bit until they change beyond recognition.”</p><p>“If Netanyahu and the ultra-right and ultra-Orthodox stay in power, this is the direction,” he said, “with the more liberal minded and socially mobile leaving the country”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But a leaked military report in August 2025 concluded that more than 80 percent of those Israel had killed in Gaza were civilians.</p><p>An April 2024 <a href=\"https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/\">investigation</a> carried out by the independent magazine +972, which reports on news from Israel and Palestine, revealed that an Israeli army artificial intelligence targeting system codenamed Lavender had marked tens of thousands of people in Gaza as potential fighters and eligible to be killed, according to Israeli intelligence sources.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-israel-say-about-the-death-toll-during-the-gaza-war\">What did Israel say about the death toll during the Gaza war?</h2><p>Throughout the war, Israel’s military released its own death toll figures, refuting the Gaza Health Ministry’s figures. But it kept changing its figures.</p><p>On October 7, Israeli authorities initially said Hamas-led fighters killed 1,400 people in their attack on southern Israel, apart from taking more than 200 people captive. However, later, Israel reduced its death toll to fewer than 1,150. Meanwhile, reports in Israeli publications like Haaretz suggested that at least some of those killed in Israel that day might have been shot dead by the Israeli military themselves, as part of a controversial policy known as the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/7/israeli-army-used-hannibal-directive-during-october-7-hamas-attack-report\">Hannibal Directive</a>, aimed at preventing the enemy from taking captives.</p><p>In November 2023, a senior Israeli security official suggested that Israel had killed 20,000 people in Gaza, most of them fighters. The following month, that number had fallen to 7,860 fighters. In August 2024, Israel said it had killed 17,000 fighters but changed that to 14,000 two months later.</p><p>Separately, Israel’s allies in the West – as well as Western media – have systematically cast doubt on the death toll compiled by Gaza’s Health Ministry during the war.</p><p>In October 2023, some two weeks into the war, after the Health Ministry in Gaza had released a list documenting the deaths of more than 7,000 Palestinians, including nearly 3,000 children, then-US President Joe Biden <a href=\"/news/2023/10/26/appalling-why-has-biden-cast-doubt-on-the-palestinian-death-count\">said</a> that he had “no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using”.</p><p>“I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed,” Biden had said.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-israel-acknowledging-the-death-toll-now\">Why is Israel acknowledging the death toll now?</h2><p>Thursday’s announcement from Israel acknowledging the 70,000 death toll in Gaza follows more than two years of repeatedly trying to deny or undermine the number of deaths in the enclave.</p><p>Sultan Barakat, senior professor in public policy at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Doha, told Al Jazeera that it was important to understand why Israel might be now acknowledging the scale of deaths in Gaza.</p><p>“As always, the devil is in the details,” he said. “Internationally, increased access to the field by the UN and other humanitarian agencies – including those from some Israeli allied states [the US, United Kingdom, France, and others] – along with the beginning of rubble removal [in Gaza], made continued outright rejection untenable [for Israel],” he said.</p><p id=\"at-this-stage-partial-acceptance-can-help-preserve-institutional-credibility-and-signal-seriousness-to-key-partners-particularly-the-us-and-european-governments-he-added\">“At this stage, partial acceptance can help preserve institutional credibility and signal seriousness to key partners, particularly the US and European governments,” he added.</p><p>Barakat noted that there might also be a strategic recalibration under way.</p><p>“Accepting the figures allows Israel to reposition its argument in the international arena, especially as recent developments around the “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/28/trumps-board-of-peace-an-effort-to-curtail-middle-powers-says-expert\">Board of Peace”</a> have shifted global attention away from the question of whether genocide and mass death occurred and toward reconstruction – reframing the debate around responsibility and the circumstances of those deaths,” he said.</p><p>He added that this includes placing an emphasis on Hamas’s conduct, the conditions of urban warfare, or the use of civilian infrastructure.</p><p>“Lastly, this acceptance may serve a defensive legal purpose. Acknowledging the scale of harm does not necessarily imply acceptance of wrongdoing, but it can form part of constructing a more coherent record in anticipation of future investigations, inquiries or legal proceedings,” he added.</p><p>This shift – from outright denial to changing numbers to acceptance of some facts – is part of a pattern.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-record-of-denialism\">Israel’s record of denialism</h2><p>Besides denying the death toll during its war on Gaza in the past, Israel has also denied accusations by the media and human rights groups that it has killed children and journalists in both Gaza and the <a href=\"/tag/occupied-west-bank/\">occupied West Bank</a>.</p><h3>Hind Rajab, five-year-old child</h3><p>On January 29, 2024, after five-year-old Hind Rajab was killed when an Israeli tank targeted her family’s car in Gaza, Israel denied its soldiers were in the area. After the rest of her family had been killed, Hind pleaded with rescue workers on the phone for three hours for help, before she, too, was shot dead. During her phone call, she described a “tank” drawing up next to the car.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">When rescuers found the remains of Hind and her family on February 10, the car was riddled with bullet holes likely coming from more than one direction. It was later determined that more than 300 bullets had been fired into the car.</p><p>But a statement from the Israeli army read, “It appears that … troops were not present near the vehicle or within firing range of the described vehicle in which the girl was found,” according to a Times of Israel report.</p><p>In February 2024, Sanad, Al Jazeera’s investigations unit, however, <a href=\"/news/2024/2/26/hind-rajab-were-israeli-troops-in-the-area-where-6-year-old-was-killed\">analysed</a> phone records and satellite imagery to determine whether Israeli troops had, in fact, been near the car.</p><p>The vehicle, the investigation found, had been stopped by the Israeli military near a petrol station in Tal al-Hawa in the early afternoon on January 29.</p><p>Other investigative media outlets also questioned Israel’s claims regarding Hind’s death, and the US, Israel’s number-one ally, called for probes into the killing of Hind, her family, and the medics who were sent to try and save them.</p><p>The Israeli army has since told the BBC that Hind’s case is still being reviewed by Israel’s Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism (FFAM) — in effect, pulling back from its initial full-throated rejection of the possibility of an Israeli tank having fired at the car.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2718192\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2718192\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2718192\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024-02-10T153232Z_492768313_RC2RZ5AJXM4Q_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-CHILD-1708349566.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinian girl Hind Rajab poses for a photograph, in this undated handout picture\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2718192\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, 5, poses for a photograph [File: Palestine Red Crescent Society/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p> </p><h3>Shireen Abu Akleh, Al Jazeera journalist</h3><p>Israel issued similar denials when Al Jazeera’s journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a US and Palestinian citizen, was <a href=\"/news/2022/9/6/israels-shifting-narratives-on-the-killing-of-shireen-abu-akleh\">killed</a> while reporting from Jenin in the occupied West Bank on May 11, 2022. Shireen had been wearing her “press” jacket. Autopsy results later showed she was shot at medium range in the head by a sniper, just below the rim of her helmet.</p><p>Witnesses, including Al Jazeera journalists, said Israeli forces had carried out the shooting, a claim that was later backed up by numerous investigations by media outlets, human rights organisations, and the United Nations.</p><p>But Israel sought to evade responsibility, initially claiming that she had been caught in crossfire from Palestinian fighters. However, video footage from the incident shows the street Abu Akleh was standing on was mostly quiet, and no such fighters were in her near vicinity.</p><p>In September that year, following a military investigation, Israel changed its stance, acknowledging that it was “highly possible” that one of its soldiers had fired the bullet that killed Abu Akleh. However, the military ruled out any further investigation, saying they found no evidence of a criminal offence.</p><p>In June 2022, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also said Shireen was killed by Israel, but Israel called the UN report biased.</p><p>On May 11, 2023, however, an Israeli army spokesperson was asked by CNN whether the military was “ready” to apologise for her murder.</p><p>“I think it’s an opportunity for me to say here that we are very sorry of the death of the late Shireen Abu Akleh,” the spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, responded.</p><p>Shireen’s family say they are still seeking accountability.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2196013\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2196013\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2196013\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/youtube-1683744655.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"shireen-memorial\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2196013\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A portrait of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh is framed with flowers with a cross in the foreground during a memorial mass held at a church in Beit Hanina in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h3>Ambulance workers in Gaza</h3><p>On March 30, 2025, the bodies of five Palestinian Civil Defence responders, a UN employee and eight Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) workers were discovered in a shallow grave in Gaza. A ninth PRCS ambulance driver, Assaad al-Nassasra, was being held by Israel, the PRCS confirmed later. In total, <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/4/9/know-their-names-the-gaza-red-crescent-paramedics-israel-attacked\">15 emergency workers</a> had been killed – with one body found a few days earlier.</p><p>It was later determined that at about 4am (01:00 GMT) on March 23, a Palestinian ambulance had been dispatched to join an earlier one helping people injured in an Israeli air strike in Rafah’s al-Hashaashin area.</p><p>Contact with the ambulance was lost and, at 5am, the first ambulance went back out to find it. Paramedics radioed back that they could see casualties on the ground on the way to Tal as-Sultan, another area in southern Gaza.</p><p>Two more ambulances were dispatched along with a fire truck and other emergency vehicles. They came under Israeli gunfire for more than five minutes. Minutes later, soldiers also fired at a United Nations car that had stopped at the scene. The PRCS lost contact with its team.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2025/4/5/unprecedented-video-shows-last-moments-of-gaza-medics-killed-by-israel\">video later found on the phone of slain paramedic Rifaat Radwan</a> showed the team’s final moments. Filmed from inside one of the last two ambulances to head out, it shows a fire truck and ambulances driving ahead through the night.</p><p>All vehicles were clearly identified with emergency lights flashing.</p><p>The vehicles stopped when they reached an ambulance and bodies by the roadside, and first responders in reflective uniforms exited the vehicles. Moments later, intense gunfire erupted.</p><p>However, Israel initially claimed its soldiers opened fire because the convoy approached “suspiciously” in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said the movement of the vehicles had not been previously coordinated or agreed with the army. The video footage clearly shows the ambulances with their lights on.</p><p>The day after the attack on the ambulance, Israeli forces blocked all entry to the site where it occurred. But a few days later, UN and Palestinian officials gained limited access to the area, and managed to recover buried vehicles and the body of a Gaza civil defence member.</p><p>Then, they discovered a shallow grave with 14 bodies of emergency workers. It later transpired that Israeli troops had bulldozed over the bodies and their vehicles.</p><p>In April, the Israeli military appeared to climb down from its claims, and described the killings – as well as the burial of victims and their vehicles – as a “professional error” and a “misunderstanding”.</p><p>An investigative report from Israel found that the soldiers failed to recognise the ambulances due to “poor night visibility” and because flashing lights are less visible on night-vision drones and goggles.</p><p>It also blamed a now-dismissed deputy commander, saying he mistakenly thought an ambulance was being used by Hamas and opened fire first.</p><p>It denied that burying vehicles and bodies was an attempt to conceal the attack.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-point-of-denying-such-incidents\">What is the point of denying such incidents?</h2><p>Barakat told Al Jazeera this pattern of denial in the first instance by Israel is not unique, as information warfare is a “real consideration” in every conflict.</p><p>“The United States employed similar practices in both Afghanistan and Iraq,” he said “However, based on Israel’s wars in Gaza, Lebanon and elsewhere, this behaviour appears to follow a recurring pattern of obfuscation and deceive, aimed at creating confusion while restricting opportunities for independent verification, particularly by international media.”</p><p>He noted that Israel, like the US and other militaries conducting offensive operations, also tends to be extremely cautious in the early stages of reporting during active conflict.</p><p>“Initial denials or non-acceptance are often framed as the result of a need for internal intelligence verification, particularly when figures originate from adversarial authorities such as the Gaza Health Ministry,” he said.</p><p>He added that there are also legal and diplomatic dimensions to Israel’s behaviour.</p><p>“Early acceptance of responsibility or casualty figures [in Israel’s war on Gaza] could have had consequences for cases brought against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Court (ICC),” he said.</p><p>“Delaying acknowledgement allowed Israel time to assess its legal exposure and coordinate messaging with allies.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
