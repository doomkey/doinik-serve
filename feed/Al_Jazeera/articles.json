That same month, Bosnian Serb forces, supported by the Yugoslav People’s Army and paramilitaries, launched coordinated attacks within the country to seize territory and expel non-Serb communities.</p><p>On April 5, the capital city of Sarajevo came under siege by Bosnian Serb forces, in what became the longest blockade of a city in modern European history. For nearly 43 months, the attacking forces shelled residential areas, cut electricity and water and tightened their grip on the capital, killing about 11,000 people.</p><p data-start=\"1671\" data-end=\"2017\">Soon after that assault began, the United Nations Security Council imposed sweeping sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro for supporting efforts to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovina. In October 1992, Croat forces also attacked Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) areas around Prozor in southwest Bosnia, marking the start of a separate Croat-Bosniak conflict that brought its own campaigns of ethnic cleansing.</p><p data-start=\"1671\" data-end=\"2017\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4120150\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-BOSNIA-INFO-CARD-1763656911.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-BOSNIA-INFO-CARD-1763656911\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-many-people-were-killed-and-displaced\">How many people were killed and displaced?</h2><p>A post-war research project commissioned by the Bosnian authorities estimated that about 104,000 people were killed, most of them civilians. Roughly two-thirds of those killed were Bosniaks.</p><p data-start=\"3212\" data-end=\"3437\">International and Bosnian sources estimate that about 2.2 million people, more than half of the pre-war population, were forced from their homes as refugees or internally displaced. Most have never been able to return.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"which-atrocities-led-up-to-the-genocide-in-srebrenica\">Which atrocities led up to the genocide in Srebrenica?</h2><p>From the start, the war was characterised by systematic ethnic cleansing – particularly of Bosniaks – killings, mass rape, forced displacement and the destruction of cultural and religious sites. Here are some of the key events during the war.</p><h3>1992 – Ethnic cleansing and the siege of Sarajevo</h3><p data-start=\"616\" data-end=\"978\"><strong>Prijedor and the camps: </strong>In the northwestern region of Prijedor, Bosnian Serb authorities set up detention camps, including Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje, where thousands of Bosniak and Bosnian Croat civilians were beaten, tortured, raped and killed.</p><p>Research by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) described the crimes as “widespread and systematic”, targeting non-Serb citizens of the country.</p><p><strong>Foca and Visegrad: </strong>In eastern Bosnia, Bosniaks were killed or expelled, and women and young girls were subjected to organised rape. The ICTY’s Foca case established rape and sexual enslavement as crimes against humanity.</p><p><strong>Siege of Sarajevo:</strong> The capital, a multiethnic city, was surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces who shelled residential areas and used snipers to target civilians on the streets, in markets and at water queues. The siege lasted from April 1992 to February 1996 and killed an estimated 11,000 people, including more than 1,000 children.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4175074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4175074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4175074\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-bosnia-timeline-1765785381.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-bosnia-timeline-1765785381\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4175074\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h3>1993 – ‘Safe areas’ established but massacres continue</h3><p data-start=\"1551\" data-end=\"1728\">With peace efforts failing, the UN declared Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia a “safe area” in April 1993, followed by Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde and Bihac a month later. But atrocities continued.</p><p><strong>Ahmici massacre:</strong> In April 1993, Croat forces killed more than 100 Bosniak civilians in the village of Ahmici, central Bosnia, and burned homes and mosques. ICTY judgements called it one of the worst acts of ethnic cleansing in the area.</p><p><strong>Rape camps:</strong> The ICTY and rights groups also documented that rape was used as an instrument of terror, particularly in Foca – now located in Republika Srpska in the southeast of the country – where women and girls were held in “rape camps”.</p><h3>1994-1995 – Market attacks and pressure for intervention</h3><p data-start=\"2196\" data-end=\"2543\">Sarajevo remained under siege. In February 1994, a mortar attack on the Markale market killed 68 civilians and wounded many more. A second strike at the same market in August 1995 killed 43 people. ICTY judgements and UN investigators have blamed Bosnian Serb forces for these attacks.</p><p>These and other attacks on so-called “safe areas” raised pressure on NATO and Western governments to act, setting the stage for heavier air attacks against the Bosnian Serb leadership later in 1995.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Sniper ‘safaris’ during the siege of Sarajevo</h3><p>During the siege of Sarajevo, citizens were subjected to “sniper safaris” – so named as a grotesque reference to hunting expeditions – in which foreigners paid Bosnian Serb units to join them and shoot civilians from positions overlooking the city.</p><p>Following a recent <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/italy-probes-sarajevo-sniper-safaris-what-were-they-who-was-involved\">Italian investigation</a>, prosecutors in Milan are examining whether wealthy visitors from Italy and other countries travelled to Sarajevo on organised “tours” to shoot at civilians for sport.</p><p>No one has yet been convicted for organising or taking part in these “safaris”, but the allegations highlight the extreme dehumanisation that accompanied the siege of the city.</p><p>It is believed that citizens from multiple countries took part. In 2022, Bosnian film director Miran Zupanic’s documentary, Sarajevo Safari, investigated wealthy foreigners who had participated, including some from the United States and Russia.</p><p>Moreover, in 2007, former US Marine John Jordan testified to the ICTY that “tourist shooters” had come to Sarajevo.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-did-the-1995-srebrenica-genocide-happen\">How did the 1995 Srebrenica genocide happen?</h2><p>By 1995, Srebrenica, a town in eastern Bosnia, had become a refuge for tens of thousands of Bosniaks fleeing surrounding villages, which had been raided and ransacked by Bosnian Serb forces hunting them. The enclave was overcrowded and had become dependent on irregular UN aid convoys, and Bosnian Serb forces controlled the surrounding areas.</p><p>Although the UN had declared Srebrenica a protected zone and stationed a small Dutch peacekeeping unit there, the enclave was under siege. In March 1995, Bosnian Serb leader <a href=\"/news/2021/5/12/bosnian-serb-ex-leader-karadzic-to-spend-life-in-uk-prison\">Radovan Karadzic</a> issued a directive ordering that Srebrenica be completely cut off.</p><p>In early July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces advanced on the enclave. On July 9, Karadzic’s forces were ordered to seize Srebrenica and, on July 11, <a href=\"/news/2017/11/22/ratko-mladic-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-genocide\">Ratko Mladic</a>, a Bosnian Serb military leader known as the “Butcher of Bosnia”, entered the town.</p><p>Over the following days, Bosnian Serb units separated men and boys from women and younger children. More than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were executed at sites in and around Srebrenica and their bodies dumped in mass graves, while about 20,000 women, children and elderly people were forcibly expelled.</p><p>The ICTY and the International Court of Justice later ruled that these killings constituted genocide.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-and-when-did-the-bosnian-war-end\">How and when did the Bosnian war end?</h2><p>Western governments had been reluctant to intervene decisively earlier in the war, but the genocide at Srebrenica forced a shift in approach. In August and September 1995, NATO launched a sustained air campaign against Bosnian Serb forces – a turning point that paved the way for the Dayton Peace Agreement, which formally ended the war.</p><p>US-brokered talks brought the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and the then-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to an airbase near Dayton, Ohio, in the US.</p><p>On November 21, 1995, they agreed to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, better known as the Dayton Peace Agreement, which preserved Bosnia as a single state divided into two main entities – the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska entity.</p><p>The agreement was formally signed in Paris on December 14.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-were-the-dayton-accords\">What were the Dayton Accords?</h2><p data-start=\"12225\" data-end=\"12716\">The Dayton Peace Agreement was meant to do more than just end active fighting, and it reshaped the post-war political system.</p><p>Bosnia today has a highly decentralised structure of government, with two political entities as well as the third, self-governing Brcko District, shared between the other two, and layers of state-level institutions.</p><p>An entire section of the Dayton Agreement is devoted to refugees and those displaced during the war. It explicitly states that “all refugees and displaced persons have the right freely to return to their homes of origin” and to have property restored or be compensated if that is not possible.</p><p>But many experts describe the agreement as flawed in practice, as implementation has been partial at best. While many people did return to their homes and hundreds of thousands of property claims were processed, significant numbers of Bosniaks were never able to return to their pre-war homes.</p><p>There were many reasons for this, including the presence of minefields, the fact that their housing had been destroyed, fear, economic hardship, and lingering, deep-rooted ethnic tensions.</p><p data-start=\"515\" data-end=\"835\">Today, entire communities, particularly survivors of the Srebrenica genocide, remain in exile or have simply had to resettle elsewhere in countries such as the US and Australia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-anyone-been-held-to-account-for-the-atrocities-committed-during-the-war\">Has anyone been held to account for the atrocities committed during the war?</h2><p data-start=\"10551\" data-end=\"10888\">In 1993, the UN created the ICTY to prosecute serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the Balkans. The tribunal lasted 24 years, from 1993 to 2017.</p><p>Over more than two decades, witnesses and survivors gave evidence about the atrocities and 161 individuals were indicted. Ninety of those were sentenced, 19 were acquitted, 20 had their indictments withdrawn, 17 died before conviction, 13 were referred to other courts, and two were retried.</p><p>Four types of crime were recorded at the tribunal – genocide, crimes against humanity, violations of laws/customs of war and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.</p><p>Among the people tried by the tribunal were:</p><p><strong>Radovan Karadzic</strong> – the wartime leader of the Bosnian Serbs. In 2016, he received a life sentence for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, including his role in Srebrenica and the siege of Sarajevo. In 2021, he was transferred to the high-security prison, HMP Parkhurst, on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, UK.</p><p><strong>Ratko Mladic</strong> – the Bosnian Serb military commander. In 2017, he was also sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide and other crimes. He is being held in the UN Detention Unit in The Hague, Netherlands.</p><p><strong>Bosnian Croat leaders</strong> – several were convicted for crimes against Bosniaks during the Croat-Bosniak conflict.</p><p data-start=\"11951\" data-end=\"12144\">Dozens of officials have also received long prison sentences for crimes linked to the Srebrenica genocide, though many survivors say justice remains far from being done.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The father died in a shootout with police, while the son is currently being treated at a local hospital.</p><p>Hanukkah is sometimes called the Festival of Lights, and in Monday’s news conference, Albanese encouraged Australians to participate in a show of solidarity with the country’s Jewish community.</p><p>“I would urge and join with others who have urged Australians across the country to light a candle, put it in their front window tonight at 6:47pm [19:47 GMT] to show that light will indeed defeat darkness – part of what Hanukkah celebrates, of course,” he said. “We are stronger than the cowards who did this.”</p><p>But while Albanese and other officials urged calm, critics questioned whether the government had done enough to curtail both anti-Semitism and gun violence.</p><h2 id=\"netanyahu-spurs-scrutiny\">Netanyahu spurs scrutiny</h2><p>One of Albanese’s highest-profile critics in the wake of the attack was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>The right-wing Israeli leader blamed Albanese’s centre-left government for failing to protect Australia’s Jewish community. He also linked the shooting to Australia’s recent decision to <a href=\"/news/2025/9/21/canada-australia-join-uk-in-recognising-palestinian-statehood\">recognise Palestinian statehood</a>.</p><p>“Your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the anti-Semitic fire,” Netanyahu said in remarks directed at Albanese, voicing sentiments he later repeated in a social media post.</p><p>“It emboldens those who menace Australian Jews and encourages the Jew hatred now stalking your streets.”</p><p>Those remarks fuelled outrage and accusations that Netanyahu was leveraging the tragedy for political aims.</p><p>In a post on social media, UN special rapporteur Ben Saul also criticised Netanyahu for linking Australia’s recognition of Palestinian statehood to Sunday’s shootings.</p><p>“I am disgusted that the Israeli PM links Australia’s principled support for a Palestinian State with yesterday’s terrorist attack in Bondi,” said Saul, who also serves as an international law chair at the University of Sydney.</p><p>“Australia has taken extensive measures to prevent anti-semitism,” Saul added.</p><p>When asked on Monday morning about Netanyahu’s remarks, Albanese said his focus was on bringing people together.</p><p class=\"paragraph_paragraph__iYReA\">“This is a moment for national unity,” the Australian prime minister told reporters in Sydney. “This is a moment for Australians to come together. That’s precisely what we’ll be doing.”</p><p>He also said his government would beef up funding and support to protect Jewish community members, including covering the costs of guard services.</p><p>“We’re extending the funding for the National Council for Jewish Community Security and its state-based community security groups, to provide overall security cover to the Jewish community,” Albanese said.</p><p>“We’re also working with Jewish community organisations to see how we can best support charity efforts, including through tax-deductible status for donations.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4174737\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4174737\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4174737\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/afp_693f855e2adc-1765770590.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mourners gather by floral tributes at the Bondi Pavillion in memory of the victims of a shooting at Bondi Beach, in Sydney on December 15, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4174737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mourners gather by floral tributes at the Bondi Pavilion in Sydney on December 15, 2025 [Saeed Khan/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"australia-s-gun-reforms-under-scrutiny\">Australia’s gun reforms under scrutiny</h2><p>Albanese also told reporters on Monday afternoon that he would be convening a meeting of state premiers to discuss “tougher gun laws, including limits on the number of guns that can be used or licensed by individuals”.</p><p>“People’s circumstances change. People can be radicalised over a period of time. Licences should not be in perpetuity,” said Albanese.</p><p>His remarks follow questions about the six guns recovered from the scene of the shooting and the revelation that the 24-year-old suspect had previously come under police scrutiny.</p><p>Officials have repeatedly said the 50-year-old suspect had “met the eligibility criteria for a firearms licence”, and that the 24-year-old was previously not deemed to be a threat.</p><p>Australia introduced some of the world’s strictest gun laws, including bans on automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, after a shooter killed 35 people in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur in 1996.</p><p>The 1996 reforms, introduced under former Prime Minister John Howard, were hailed as a success after Australia saw no mass shootings occur for close to two decades.</p><p>However, according to a recent report from the Australia Institute, the implementation of the laws has lapsed in recent years, with more guns now in the country than before 1996.</p><p>On Monday, Albanese said the reforms had “made an enormous difference” and were a “proud moment” of bipartisan action, but that reviews were now needed to ensure better coordination between states.</p><p>Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales, where the shooting took place, also told reporters on Monday he would be reviewing gun laws.</p><p>“We want to make sure that prospective reform and change in New South Wales has a lasting impact,” Minns said. “It’s not the last time I’ll be mentioning it, and you can expect action soon.”</p><p>Sunday’s shooting at Bondi Beach follows several other mass shootings in recent years, including a 2022 attack in Wieambilla, Queensland, linked to Christian fundamentalist ideology that left six people dead.</p><p>An Australian man was also responsible for the attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at a mosque in <a href=\"/features/2024/3/15/australian-efforts-on-islamophobia-flag-despite-christchurch-wake-up-call\">Christchurch, New Zealand</a>, where semiautomatic weapons are still sold.</p></div></div></body></html>"

These brokers, in turn, resell the vessels to dismantling yards in South Asia, where the final act of a ship’s life unfolds.</p><p>In Alang, ships are driven ashore at high tide — a process called beaching. Once grounded, hundreds of workers cut them apart piece by piece, salvaging steel, pipes, and machinery. Almost everything — from cables to cupboards — is resold for use by construction and manufacturing industries.</p><p>However, over the past decade, the number of ships arriving on Alang’s coast has dwindled. Once a skyline of giant hulls that looked like high-rise buildings against the town’s asbestos roofs, only a few cruise ships and cargo carriers dot the horizon today.</p><p>“Earlier, there was plenty of work for everyone,” Chintan Kalthia, who runs one of the few yards still open, tells Al Jazeera. “Now, most of the workers have left. Only when a new ship beaches do a few come back to Alang. My own business is down to barely 30-40 percent of what it used to be.”</p><p>According to data from India’s Ship Recycling Industries Association, 2011-12 marked Alang’s busiest financial year since it began operations in 1983, with a record 415 ships dismantled. Since then, the yard has faced a steep decline — of the 153 plots developed along the 10km (6-mile) coastline, only about 20 remain functional, and even they are operating at barely 25 percent capacity.</p><p>“But what’s going wrong in Alang has multiple reasons,” says Haresh Parmar, secretary of the Ship Recycling Industries Association (India). “The biggest is that globally, shipowners are not retiring their old vessels. Post-COVID, a surge in demand led to record profits in shipping. With freight rates soaring, owners are pushing ships beyond their usual operational life instead of sending them for dismantling.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4159904\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4159904\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4159904\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/From-cables-to-cupboards-almost-all-materials-are-reclaimed-and-repurposed-fuelling-Indias-construction-and-manufacturing-markets_-1765196925.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alang Gujarat India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4159904\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">From cables to cupboards, almost all materials are reclaimed and repurposed for construction and manufacturing markets [Anuj Behal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>A key factor behind the surge in freight rates is global disruptions. Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza has had a ripple effect on global trade routes, with Yemen’s Houthi rebels repeatedly attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea in solidarity with the Palestinians. The resulting security crisis has forced ships to bypass the Suez Canal and instead take the longer Cape of Good Hope route, sending freight rates soaring and delaying cargo worldwide.</p><p>Similarly, an analysis by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) conducted in June 2022 found that the Russia-Ukraine war and other Middle East tensions had pushed up marine fuel costs by more than 60 percent, adding to operational expenses and shipping delays.</p><p>Together, these factors have sharply reduced the supply of end-of-life ships heading to Alang. “When owners are earning well, they don’t scrap their vessels,” says Parmar. “That’s why our yards are standing empty.”</p><h2 id=\"compliance-raising-costs\">Compliance raising costs</h2><p>But that is not the only reason why Alang is struggling.</p><p>India’s ship recycling industry has undergone a significant transformation since the country acceded to the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (HKC) in November 2019, becoming one of the first top ship-breaking nations to do so. Under the HKC and the 2019 Recycling of Ships Act, yards at Alang upgraded their infrastructure, installed pollution control systems, lined hazardous waste storage pits, trained workers, and maintained detailed inventories of toxic materials used in vessels.</p><p>These measures made Alang-Sosiya Ship Recycling Yards (ASSRY) one of the most compliant ship-recycling clusters in the developing world, with 106 of ASSRY yards having received HKC Statements of Compliance (SoC). Sosiya is a village located right next to Alang on the Gulf of Khambhat coast in Gujarat. Together, Alang and Sosiya form the entire stretch of beach where ship-breaking plots operate.</p><p>But achieving these standards came at a high cost: each yard had to invest between $0.56m and $1.2m to meet compliance norms, raising operational costs at a time when competition from neighbouring countries remains fierce.</p><p>“Think of it like a roadside eatery versus a global burger chain — the chain has shinier rules, cleaner kitchens, and safer gear, but you pay extra for the sparkle. The Hong Kong Convention works the same way,” said Kalthia, whose company, RL Kalthia Ship Breaking Private Limited, became the first ship recycling facility in India to receive HKC compliance certification from ClassNK in 2015, as their website shows. ClassNK is a leading Japanese ship classification society that audits and certifies international maritime safety and environmental standards.</p><p>“Compliance makes things safer and brings us up to international standards — it gives us an edge only on paper,” says Chetan Patel, a yard owner at Alang. “But it has also raised costs significantly.”</p><p>That, in turn, has made it hard for Alang’s ship-breakers to offer prices comparable to those of competitors.</p><p>“When neighbouring markets can pay more, shipowners go there,” Patel said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4159913\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4159913\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4159913\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Unused-ships-quickly-become-a-financial-drain-forcing-owners-to-offload-them-even-if-that-means-dismantling-them-long-before-their-intended-lifespan_-1-1765196938.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alang Gujarat India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4159913\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unused ships quickly become a financial drain, forcing owners to offload them, even if that means dismantling them long before their intended lifespan [Anuj Behal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Competing ship-recycling yards are thriving. In Bangladesh’s Chattogram port and Pakistan’s Gadani yard, shipowners are being offered $540-550 per LDT and $525-530 per LDT, respectively, compared with $500-510 per LDT at Alang.</p><p>“We can’t match the rates offered by Bangladesh and Pakistan,” says Parmar. “If we tried, we’d be running at a loss.”</p><p>This is reflected clearly in the data: the number of ships decommissioned in India dropped from 166 in 2023 to 124 in 2024. In contrast, Turkiye’s figures nearly doubled to 94 from 50, and Pakistan’s rose from 15 to 24 during the same period.</p><h2 id=\"supporting-industries-struggle\">Supporting industries struggle</h2><p>Alang is not just a ship-breaking yard, but a vast recycling ecosystem that sustains the surrounding region’s economy.</p><p>From the coastal town of Trapaj — the last big settlement before Alang — an 11km (7-mile) stretch of road is lined with sprawling, makeshift shops selling remnants of decommissioned ships. Everything that used to be part of life at sea eventually finds its way here: rusted chains, rescue boats, refrigerators, ceramic crockery, martini glasses, treadmills from shipboard gyms, air conditioners from cabins, and chandeliers from officers’ quarters.</p><p>“Whatever is there on the ship, we own it,” says Parmar. “Before the cutting begins, all valuable items are auctioned and reach these stores.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4159900\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4159900\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4159900\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/All-remnants-of-life-on-the-ocean-wind-up-here_-corroded-chains-rescue-boats-ceramic-crockery-martini-glasses-and-treadmills-from-ship-gyms_-1765196919.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alang Gujarat India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4159900\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">All remnants of life on the ocean wind up here – corroded chains, rescue boats, ceramic crockery, martini glasses, and treadmills from ship gyms [Anuj Behal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Ram Vilas, who runs a ceramic shop selling salvaged crockery by the kilo, says most of his customers used to come from commercial establishments across Gujarat. “Now, business has gone dead,” he tells Al Jazeera. “This stretch you see doesn’t even have one-tenth of the crowd it used to. With fewer ships coming in, we don’t have enough stock to fill our shops.”</p><p>The ripple effects of Alang’s decline extend to other industries as well. Waste is handled by specialised facilities, while reusable steel is supplied to more than 60 induction furnaces and 80 rerolling mills, some 50km (30 miles) away in Bhavnagar, converting it into TMT bars – reinforced steel rods – and other construction materials.</p><p>But with fewer ships arriving, the supply of scrap steel has dropped sharply, disrupting operations of furnaces, mills, and hundreds of small businesses that depend on ship-derived goods. More than 200 retail and wholesale shops that once bustled with activity now face dwindling sales.</p><p>“Gas plants, rolling mills, furnace units, transporters, drivers — everyone connected to this chain has lost their livelihood,” says Parmar.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4159906\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4159906\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4159906\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Most-shops-along-the-lane-are-stacked-with-whatever-the-ship-breaking-yards-have-yielded-that-day_-1765196931.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Alang Gujarat India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4159906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Most shops are stacked with whatever the ship-breaking yards have yielded that day [Anuj Behal/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>In Bhavnagar, 29-year-old Jigar Patel, who runs a flange manufacturing unit, says his business has suffered.</p><p>“I opened my unit in 2017, seeing the opportunity with steel sheets easily available from Alang,” he says. “But in the past two years, the slowdown has hit hard. Now, I have to buy sheets from Jharkhand. It’s not just expensive, but the raw steel is harder to cut and process. The Alang sheets were more malleable and ductile — they were made for work and of international standard.”</p><p>Workers at Alang, most of them migrants from poorer Indian states in the north and east, including Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, have also begun to leave. “They only show up when ships arrive at the docks,” Vidyadhar Rane, president of the Alang-Sosiya Ship Recycling and General Workers’ Association, tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Yard owners call them when there is work. The rest of the time, they find other jobs in nearby towns,” he says.</p><p>At its peak, Alang employed more than 60,000 workers. Today, that number has shrunk to fewer than 15,000, according to the union.</p><p>Ramakant, who first arrived in Alang at the age of 35, recalls working for seven straight years before the slowdown began. “Now, I only return when my employer calls,” he says, adding that he spends the rest of his time working in the industrial town of Surat.</p><p>The work at the yard, he admits, has become far safer than it once was. “This was once the deadliest job — we would see workers dying every other day. Now there’s training, safety gear, and order,” Ramakant says, looking towards the silent coast.</p><p>“But what’s the point of safety when there’s no work? Everything now depends on whether the next [ship] arrives at the yard or not.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He has been in detention since December 2020, when he was arrested in the midst of a series of antigovernment protests that gripped Hong Kong.</p><p>The case has been seen as a test of Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” principle, which was established after the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.</p><p>The principle affirmed that Hong Kong was part of China, but in theory, it allowed the territory to retain its own governance and administrative structure, separate from Beijing.</p><p>But activists say that autonomy has been threatened in recent years, as China seeks to assert greater control over Hong Kong. The territory, once seen as a beacon of free speech in Southeast Asia, has seen its protesters, journalists and publishers targeted for arrest and prosecution in recent years.</p><p>On Monday, Judge Esther Toh accused Lai of making “constant invitations” to the United States to take action against the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its ruling Communist Party.</p><p>She and her fellow judges, Alex Lee and Susana D’Almada Remedios, issued an 855-page verdict in the case, which described Lai as the “mastermind” of a criminal conspiracy.</p><p>“There is no doubt that the first defendant had harboured his resentment and hatred of the PRC for many of his adult years,” Toh told Monday’s packed courtroom.</p><p>Human rights groups and media advocacy organisations quickly slammed the verdict as a miscarriage of justice.</p><p>“We are outraged that Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong’s symbol of press freedom, has been found guilty on trumped-up national security charges,” Thibaut Bruttin, the general director of Reporters Without Borders, said in a statement.</p><p>“This unlawful conviction only demonstrates the alarming deterioration of media freedom in the territory,” he added.</p><p>“Make no mistake: it is not an individual who has been on trial – it is press freedom itself, and with this verdict, that has been shattered.”</p><p>Another free-speech organisation, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), also denounced Lai’s conviction, calling it an act of “persecution”.</p><p>“The ruling underscores Hong Kong’s utter contempt for press freedom, which is supposed to be protected under the city’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law,” Beh Lih Yi, the group’s Asia-Pacific director, said.</p><p>“Jimmy Lai’s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy.”</p><p>Lai is set to reappear in court on January 12 for a pre-sentencing hearing. It is not yet clear whether he will seek to appeal Monday’s verdict.</p><p>The trial against him stretched for 156 days. Lai himself testified for 52 days, arguing that he had not called on the US to impose sanctions or other economic penalties on China, as the prosecution alleged.</p><p>The charges he faced came under the 2020 Hong Kong National Security Law, a far-reaching piece of legislation enacted in the midst of the pro-democracy protests of 2019 and 2020.</p><p>The law imposed steep penalties for actions deemed to be “subversion” or “secession”, effectively criminalising Hong Kong’s pro-independence movement, as well as any criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>As an outspoken critic of the government in Beijing, Lai was quickly charged under the newly imposed law.</p><p>His publication, the Apple Daily, published its first edition in 1995, and it became known as Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy newspaper.</p><p>During Lai’s trial, prosecutors presented 161 articles from the newspaper as evidence.</p><p>In August 2020, less than two months after the national security law came into effect, Lai was arrested for the first time, then released. He was arrested again in December, only to be released and re-arrested a third time. He has remained in custody ever since.</p><p>By May 2021, authorities had frozen Apple Daily’s assets. And in June of that year, five Apple Daily executives, including its editor-in-chief, were taken into custody amid a police raid on the newspaper’s headquarters.</p><p>The newspaper printed its final edition that month.</p><p>Lai’s defence team and family have repeatedly petitioned Hong Kong’s High Court for leniency, citing Lai’s age and health conditions, including diabetes and high blood pressure.</p><p>World leaders like US President Donald Trump have previously called for Lai’s release.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Together and standing strong, as we always have.”</p><p>Kast, meanwhile, hailed the election results as a “broad mandate” to carry out his political agenda in a victory speech to supporters.</p><p>“This is not a personal achievement, nor is it a party achievement,” he told the crowd. “Chile won here, with the hope of no longer living in fear, of a Chile that works.”</p><p>The result marks the latest victory for the far right in Latin America, which has seen a streak of right-wing leaders once considered political outsiders rise to power in countries like Argentina and Ecuador.</p><h2 id=\"a-hardline-platform\">A hardline platform</h2><p>The tally also marks a significant comeback for Kast himself, the 59-year-old leader of the Republican Party. The 2025 election marks his third attempt to win the presidency — and his first successful bid.</p><p>During the last election, in 2021, he was trounced by outgoing President Gabriel Boric, who won by nearly a 10-point margin.</p><p>But Boric, a former student leader who became Chile’s youngest president, had seen his popularity slump to about 30 percent by the end of his four-year term. He was also ineligible to run for a second term under Chilean law.</p><p>In public opinion polls, voters also expressed frustration with recent spikes in crime and immigration, as well as a softening of Chile’s economy.</p><p>Kast, meanwhile, campaigned on the promise of change. He said he would address voter concerns by carrying out crackdowns on crime and immigration, including through a campaign of mass deportation, similar to what United States President Donald Trump has done in North America.</p><p>His security platform — dubbed the “Implacable Plan” — also proposes stiffer mandatory minimum sentencing, incarcerating more criminals in maximum security facilities, and putting cartel leaders in “total isolation” to cut them off from any communication with the outside world.</p><p>“Today, while criminals and drug traffickers walk freely through the streets, committing crimes and intimidating people, honest Chileans are locked in their homes, paralyzed by fear,” Kast writes in his security plan.</p><p>Informed by his socially conservative Catholic background, Kast has also taken a hard-right stance towards social and health issues, including abortion, which he opposes even in cases of rape.</p><h2 id=\"a-historic-post-pinochet-win\">A historic post-Pinochet win</h2><p>But those hardline policies earned Kast criticism on the campaign trail. Critics have also seized upon his own sympathetic comments about Chile’s former dictator, military leader Augusto Pinochet.</p><p>In 1973, Pinochet oversaw a right-wing military coup that ousted the democratically elected leader, Salvador Allende. He proceeded to rule the country until 1990. His government became known for its widespread human rights abuses and brutal oppression of political dissent, with thousands executed and tens of thousands tortured.</p><p>While Kast has rejected the label “far right”, he has repeatedly defended Pinochet’s government. Of Pinochet, Kast famously quipped, “If he were alive, he would vote for me.”</p><p>Opponents also sought to draw attention to Kast’s family ties: His father, Michael Martin Kast, was born in Germany and had been a member of the Nazi Party. The elder Kast immigrated to Chile in 1950.</p><p>Reporting from a polling site in the capital of Santiago, Al Jazeera correspondent Lucia Newman noted that Sunday’s victory was a historic one for Chile’s far right. But, she noted, Kast has sought to moderate his platform to better appeal to voters in the current election cycle.</p><p>“This is the first time since 1990 — since the military dictatorship before 1990, when Chile returned to democracy — that such a conservative government will be in power,” Newman explained.</p><p>“It’s really not certain just how conservative it will be. Jose Antonio Kast was a supporter of former dictator General Augusto Pinochet. He has shirked away from that in recent years, and certainly in this campaign.”</p><h2 id=\"latin-america-s-right-reacts\">Latin America’s right reacts</h2><p>In the wake of Kast’s election victory, right-wing leaders from across the Americas offered their congratulations in statements on social media.</p><p>“Congratulations to Chilean President-Elect [Jose Antonio Kast] on his victory,” Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=\"http://x.com/SecRubio/status/2000347698726330735\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>. “The United States looks forward to partnering with his administration to strengthen regional security and revitalize our trade relationship.”</p><p>Argentina’s libertarian leader Javier Milei likewise chimed in, hailing Kast’s election as a major win for Latin America’s conservative political movement.</p><p>“FREEDOM IS ADVANCING,” Milei <a href=\"https://x.com/JMilei/status/2000336711511863505\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, echoing his own campaign rallying cry.</p><p>“Enormous joy at the overwhelming victory of my friend [Jose Antonio Kast] in the Chilean presidential elections! One more step for our region in defense of life, liberty, and private property. I am sure that we will work together so that America embraces the ideas of freedom and we can free ourselves from the oppressive yoke of 21st-century socialism…!!!”</p><p>Ecuador’s right-wing President Daniel Noboa, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://x.com/DanielNoboaOk/status/2000356612356333636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> that “a new era is beginning for Chile and for the region”.</p><p>This year’s presidential race was the first time since 2012 that voting had been compulsory in the country. There are approximately 15.7 million eligible voters in the South American country.</p><p>Kast originally came in second place during the first round of voting on November 16. He scored about 23.9 percent of the vote, compared with Jara’s 26.8 percent.</p><p>But polls had widely favoured him to win in the run-off. While Chile’s left wing held a primary in June and coalesced around its victor, Jara, right-wing parties did not hold a primary to choose a coalition nominee.</p><p>The result was a fractured right in the first round of voting. But in the final contest, Kast was able to sweep up votes that had previously gone to his right-leaning adversaries, earning him a comfortable win.</p><p>Still, Kast faces a divided National Congress, which is expected to blunt some of his more hardline proposals. Kast will be sworn in on March 11.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Could this spark an all-out war?</p><p>This week on UpFront, Marc Lamont Hill speaks to Alan McPherson, an author and history professor at Temple University who specialises in US-Latin American relations.</p><p>The US is continuing the largest military build-up in Latin America in decades and has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. US President Donald Trump has also threatened to attack Venezuela by land “very soon”, while the Pentagon continues to strike alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. At least 87 people have been killed in what human rights groups have called extrajudicial killings and murder.</p><p>The Trump administration has made clear that it wants Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power, and has thrown its support behind opposition figure and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado. She supports foreign intervention and wants to privatise Venezuelan oil, leaving many to question how much the ideologies of US politicians and the interests of oil companies are driving the push for regime change inside Venezuela.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 14 Dec 2025</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">14 Dec 2025</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” Zelenskyy said in response to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat.</p><p data-start=\"1404\" data-end=\"1805\">“Thus, today, bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US, and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries – Canada, Japan – are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"1404\" data-end=\"1805\">“And it is already a compromise from our part,” Zelenskyy added, stressing that such guarantees must be legally binding.</p><p data-start=\"1807\" data-end=\"2082\">The shift would mark a significant change for Ukraine, which has long sought NATO membership despite Moscow viewing the alliance’s expansion as a threat.</p><p data-start=\"1807\" data-end=\"2082\">While the move aligns with one of Russia’s stated war objectives, Kyiv has continued to reject demands to cede territory.</p><p data-start=\"2084\" data-end=\"2418\">Zelenskyy said he was seeking a “dignified” peace and firm assurances that Russia would not launch another attack, as diplomats gathered to discuss what could become Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. He also accused Moscow of prolonging the war through sustained attacks on Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure.</p><p>After Sunday’s talks, Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made”.</p><p>Zelenskyy’s adviser Dmytro Lytvyn said the president would comment on the talks on Monday once they were completed. Officials, Lytvyn said, were considering the draft documents.</p><p>“They went on for more than five hours and ended for today with an agreement to resume tomorrow morning,” Lytvyn told reporters in a WhatsApp chat.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"pressure-to-reach-a-settlement\" data-start=\"2084\" data-end=\"2418\">Pressure to reach a settlement</h2><p data-start=\"2420\" data-end=\"2876\">The decision to send Witkoff, who has previously led negotiations with both Kyiv and Moscow, suggested Washington saw scope for progress.</p><p>Germany’s Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it was a “good sign” Trump had sent his envoys while fielding questions in an interview with the ZDF broadcaster on the suitability of Witkoff and Kushner, two businessmen, as negotiators.</p><p>“It’s certainly anything but an ideal setup for such negotiations. That much is clear. But as they say, you can only dance with the people on the dance floor,” Pistorius said.</p><p>On the issue of Ukraine’s offer to give up its NATO aspirations in exchange for security guarantees, Pistorius said Ukraine had bitter prior experience of relying on security assurances. Kyiv had in 1994 agreed to give up its Soviet-era nuclear arsenal in exchange for territorial guarantees from the US, Russia and Britain.</p><p>“Therefore, it remains to be seen to what extent this statement Zelenskyy has now made will actually hold true, and what preconditions must be met,” Pistorius said.</p><p>“This concerns territorial issues, commitments from Russia and others,” he said, adding mere security guarantees, especially without significant US  involvement, “wouldn’t be worth much.”</p><p data-start=\"2878\" data-end=\"3269\">Zelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US were also reviewing a 20-point plan that could culminate in a ceasefire, though he reiterated that Kyiv was not holding direct talks with Russia. He said a truce along current front lines could be considered fair, while noting that Russia continues to demand a Ukrainian withdrawal from parts of Donetsk and Luhansk still under Kyiv’s control.</p><h2 id=\"fighting-on-ground-continues\" data-start=\"2878\" data-end=\"3269\">Fighting on ground continues</h2><p data-start=\"3271\" data-end=\"3513\">Despite diplomatic efforts, Russian attacks have continued, leaving thousands without <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/russian-attacks-cut-power-for-thousands-in-ukraine-as-peace-talks-press-on\">electricity</a> in recent strikes. Ukrainian officials say Moscow is deliberately targeting the power grid to deprive civilians of heat and water during winter.</p><p data-start=\"3515\" data-end=\"3844\">Fighting has also intensified in the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/russia-damages-turkish-owned-vessels-in-attack-on-ukrainian-ports\">Black Sea</a>. Russian forces recently struck Ukrainian ports, damaging Turkish-owned vessels, including a ship carrying food supplies. An attack on Odesa set grain silos ablaze, according to Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba. Zelenskyy said the strikes “had no … military purpose whatsoever”.</p><p data-start=\"3846\" data-end=\"4223\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned against further escalation, saying the Black Sea should not become an “area of confrontation”.</p><p data-start=\"3846\" data-end=\"4223\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">“Everyone needs safe navigation in the Black Sea,” Erdogan said, calling for a “limited ceasefire” covering ports and energy facilities. Turkiye controls the Bosphorus Strait, a vital route for Ukrainian grain and Russian oil exports.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The bystander then tackles the suspect, wrestles the rifle away from him and points the weapon back at him.</p><p>The disarmed gunman loses his footing and appears to back away towards a bridge, where the second attacker was located. The video ends by showing the bystander placing the gun down on the ground, propping it up against a tree.</p><p>On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed media reports that Ahmed al-Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner, was the bystander who intervened.</p><p>“Ahmed al-Ahmed took the gun off that perpetrator at great risk to himself and suffered serious injury as a result of that, and is currently going through an operation today in hospital,” Albanese told reporters.</p><p>Albanese said the actions of the two attackers were “completely out of place with the way that Australia functions as a society”, contrasting them with al-Ahmed’s response.</p><p>“At the best of times, what we see is Australians coming together. And what I want is for Australians to come together, for this to be reinforcing the need for us to promote national unity, and that is critical. There is no place in Australia for anti-Semitism. There is no place for hatred,” Albanese said.</p><p>A relative of al-Ahmed, who identified himself as Mustafa Asad, told the Australian television news service 7News that al-Ahmed was shot twice during the incident.</p><p>“He’s in hospital, and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” Asad told the outlet. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero, 100 percent.”</p><p>In a separate interview with the Al Araby television network, Asad explained that al-Ahmed “is an Australian citizen of Syrian origin, from Idlib in Syria, from the village of Nayrab”.</p><p>He described al-Ahmed as someone who would not hesitate to step in to stop death and suffering.</p><p>“He couldn’t bear to see people dying,” Asad told the television station. “It was a humanitarian action.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>As a video of al-Ahmed went viral, social media users praised his quick thinking and heroic actions.</p><p>“Australian hero (random civilian) wrestles gun off attacker and disarms him. Some people are brave and then some people are … whatever this is,” one person said in a post on the platform X.</p><p>“This Australian man saved countless lives by stripping the gun off one of the terrorists at Bondi beach. HERO,” another said.</p><p>Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state, where Sydney is located, said it was the “most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen”.</p><p>“That man is a genuine hero, and I’ve got no doubt that there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.”</p><p>Al-Ahmed’s actions have even gained international plaudits. New York City comptroller Brad Lander praised al-Ahmed’s “extraordinary courage”.</p><p>“A Muslim, 43-year-old father of two, who bravely risked his life to save his neighbors celebrating Hanukkah,” Lander wrote on social media. “Praying for his full and speedy recovery. And so deeply inspired by his example.”</p><p>New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani likewise held al-Ahmed up as an example of courage against hate.</p><p>“On Bondi Beach today, as men with long guns targeted innocents, another man ran towards the gunfire and disarmed a shooter,” Mamdani wrote.</p><p>“Tonight, as Jewish New Yorkers light menorahs and usher in a first night of Hanukkah clouded by grief, let us look to his example and confront hatred with the urgency and action it demands.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Winter came to Gaza last month with a violent storm. I woke up at night to a disaster. Our tent was flooded with water which had transformed our “floor” into a shallow pool. The mattresses and pillows were completely soaked, cooking pots were submerged, the clothes were drenched, and even our bags— which function as our “closets”—were filled with water. Nothing inside remained dry.</p><p>As I tried to understand what was happening, I suddenly heard children crying at the entrance of our tent. I opened it quickly and found three children from the neighbouring tents, their lips blue from the cold, with their mother trembling behind them saying, “We are completely soaked… the rain leaked inside and the water reached everywhere.”</p><p>The same tragic scene was repeated all around us: women, children, and elderly people sitting in the street under the rain, their bedding drenched and their belongings scattered, while confusion and cries filled the air.</p><p>All 1.4 million displaced Palestinians who lack proper shelter suffered that day—people with no protection against the weather or its sudden storms.</p><p>For us, it took two full days for our belongings to dry because the sun barely appeared; everything stayed cold and damp. We didn’t move to another place—we stayed where we were, trying to salvage whatever we could, because there was simply nowhere else to go.</p><p>Only a week later, an even stronger winter storm arrived with severe rainfall. Tents were flooded again; little children froze in the rain again.</p><p>This week, when Storm Byron hit, we were flooded once again. Despite all our efforts to reinforce the tents, secure them tightly, and bring in stronger tarps, nothing worked. The winds were fiercer, the rain heavier, and the water pushed its way inside from every direction. The ground no longer absorbed anything. The water began rising rapidly beneath our feet, turning the entire area into a swamp.</p><p>According to the authorities, the strong winds destroyed at least 27,000 tents. These are 27,000 families who already struggled and now have nothing, no shelter, nowhere to hide from the rain and cold.</p><p>The rain also brought down damaged homes where people had been sheltering. Every time there is a storm or strong wind, we hear the sound of falling debris and concrete pillars from badly damaged buildings near us. This time, the situation was so bad that 11 people were killed by collapsed buildings.</p><p>It is clear that after everything we have endured, we – like other displaced Palestinians – cannot survive a third winter in these harsh conditions. We survived two winters in displacement, living in tents that protected neither from cold nor rain, waiting with exhausted patience for a ceasefire that would end our suffering. The ceasefire finally came, but relief did not. We remain in the same place, with bodies drained by malnutrition and illness, under tents worn out by the sun and wind.</p><p>We are a family of seven living in a tent that is four by four metres (13 feet by 13 feet). Among us are two children aged five and 10 and our grandmother, aged 80. We, the adults, can push through the cold and hardship. But how can the elderly and children bear what we live every day?</p><p>We sleep on mattresses pressed directly against the ground, with cold seeping in from below and above, with only two blankets that can’t shield us from the freezing nights. Everyone in the tent has two blankets each, barely enough to offer temporary warmth. There is no source of heating—no electricity, no heater—just tired bodies trying to share whatever warmth remains.</p><p>My grandmother cannot tolerate the cold at all. I watch her shiver through the night, her hand on her chest as if trying to hold herself together. All we can do is pile every blanket we have on top of her and watch anxiously until she is able to fall asleep.</p><p>Many people in Gaza live in conditions far worse than ours.</p><p>Most families who just want a modest tent over their heads cannot afford one. The price of tents can go as high as $1,000; the rent one has to pay to pitch a tent on a piece of land can be as much as $500. Those who cannot pay live in the street in makeshift shelters.</p><p>Salah al-Din Street, for example, is crowded with them. Most are simply blankets hung and wrapped around small spaces for minimal privacy, offering no protection from rain or cold. With any strong gust of wind, they burst open.</p><p>There are also children living directly in the streets, sleeping on the cold ground. Many have lost their mothers or fathers during the war. When you pass by, you see them—sometimes silent, sometimes crying, sometimes searching for something to eat.</p><p>Despite repeated promises of aid and reconstruction, the trickle of supplies that entered Gaza has made almost no difference on the ground. Earlier this month, the United Nations announced it had managed to distribute only 300 tents during November; 230,000 families received a single food parcel each.</p><p>We did not receive any food parcel—there are simply too many people in need, and the quantities are far too small for everyone to access. Even if we had received one, its contents wouldn’t have lasted us longer than a week or two.</p><p>Food prices continue to be high. Nutritious items like meat and eggs are either unavailable or cost too much. Most families have not eaten a proper protein meal in months.</p><p>There is no mass campaign to remove rubble or level the ground so people can pitch their tents due to an equipment shortage. No steps have been taken to provide permanent housing for families.</p><p>All of this means we now face a terrifying possibility: that life in a tent—one that can be flooded or ripped apart by the wind at any moment—may become our long-term reality. This is an unbearable thought.</p><p>During the bombardment, we lived with the constant fear of death, and perhaps the intensity of the war overshadowed everything else—the cold, the rain, the tents shaking above our heads. But now, after the mass bombing has stopped, we are facing the full ugliness of Gaza’s “new normal”.</p><p>I fear this winter will be much worse for Gaza. With no heating, no real shelter, and the weather getting worse each day, we are likely to see many deaths among the children, the elderly and the chronically ill. Already, the first deaths from hypothermia were reported – babies <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/baby-dies-of-exposure-in-flooded-tent-as-storm-byron-batters-gaza\">Rahaf Abu Jazar</a>  and Taim al-Khawaja and nine-year-old Hadeel al-Masri. If the world is really committed to ending the genocide in Gaza, it needs to take real, urgent action and ensure that we have at least the basic conditions for survival: food, housing and medical care.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
