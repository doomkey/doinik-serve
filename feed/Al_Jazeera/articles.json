Later, as people in Gaza starved, he refused to scan or sell Israeli-grown produce.</p><p>He could not, he said, “have that on my conscience”.</p><p>Within weeks, Tesco supermarket suspended him.</p><p>He requested anonymity following advice from his trade union.</p><p>In Newcastle, County Down, a town better known for its summer tourists than political protest, customers protested outside the store.</p><p>The local dispute became a test case: Can individual employees turn their moral outrage into workplace action?</p><p>Facing mounting backlash, Tesco reinstated him in January, moving him to a role where he no longer has to handle Israeli goods.</p><p>“I would encourage them to do it,” he said about other workers. “They have the backing of the unions and there’s a precedent set. They didn’t sack me; they shouldn’t be able to sack anyone else.</p><p>“And then, if we get enough people to do it, they can’t sell Israeli goods.”</p><p>“A genocide is still going on, they are slowly killing and starving people – we still need to be out, doing what we can.”</p><h2 id=\"from-shop-floors-to-state-policy\">From shop floors to state policy</h2><p>Across Europe, there is labour-led pressure to cease trade with Israel.</p><p>Unions in Ireland, the UK and Norway have passed motions stating that workers should not be compelled to handle Israeli goods.</p><p>Retail cooperatives, including Co-op UK and Italy’s Coop Alleanza 3.0, have removed some Israeli products in protest against the war in Gaza.</p><p>The campaigns raise questions about whether worker-led refusals can lead to state-level boycotts.</p><p>Activists say the strategy is rooted in history.</p><p>In 1984, workers at the Dunnes Stores retail chain in Ireland refused to handle goods from apartheid South Africa. The action lasted nearly three years and contributed to Ireland becoming the first country in Western Europe to ban trade with South Africa.</p><p>“The same can be done against the apartheid, genocidal state of Israel today,” said Damian Quinn, 33, of BDS Belfast.</p><p>The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is a Palestinian-led campaign launched in 2005 that calls for economic and cultural boycotts of Israel until it complies with international law, including ending its occupation of Palestine.</p><p>“Where the state has failed in its obligation to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, citizens and workers across the world must refuse Israel and apply pressure on their governments to introduce legislation,” said Quinn.</p><p>That pressure, he said, takes the form of boycotting “complicit Israeli sporting, academic and cultural institutions”, as well as Israeli and international companies “engaged in violations of Palestinian human rights”.</p><p>The movement also seeks to “apply pressure on banks, local councils, universities, churches, pension funds and governments to do the same through divestment and sanctions”, he added.</p><p>Supporters argue that such pressure is beginning to shape state policy across Europe.</p><p>Spain and Slovenia have moved to restrict trade with Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank following sustained public protests and mounting political pressure. In August 2025, Slovenia’s government banned imports of goods produced in Israeli-occupied territories, becoming one of the first European states to adopt such a measure.</p><p>Spain followed suit later that year, with a decree banning the import of products from illegal Israeli settlements. The measure was formally enforced at the start of 2026.</p><p>Both countries’ centre-left governments have been outspoken critics of Israel’s conduct during the war, helping create the political conditions for legislative action.</p><p>In the Netherlands, a wave of pro-Palestinian campus protests and public demonstrations in 2025 shifted political discourse. Student demands for academic and trade disengagement became part of broader calls for national policy change.</p><p>Later that year, members of the Dutch parliament urged the government to ban imports from illegal Israeli settlements.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ireland is attempting to advance its Occupied Territories Bill, first introduced in 2018, which would prohibit trade in goods and services from illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, including the West Bank.</p><p>Progress, however, has stalled despite unanimous backing in the lower house of Ireland’s parliament, the Dail.</p><p>Paul Murphy, an Irish pro-Palestine member of parliament who, in June, attempted to cross into Gaza, told Al Jazeera the delay amounts to “indirect pressure from Israel routed through the US”. He accused the government of “kicking the can down the road” as it seeks further legal advice.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Pro-Israel organisations are working to oppose initiatives that aim to pressure Israel economically.</p><p>B’nai B’rith International, a US-based group that says it strengthens “global Jewish life”, combats anti-Semitism and stands “unequivocally with the State of Israel”, decries the BDS movement. In July 2025, it submitted an 18-page memorandum to Irish lawmakers, warning the bill could pose risks for US companies operating in Ireland.</p><p>The memorandum argued that, if enacted, the bill could create conflicts with US federal anti-boycott laws, which prohibit US companies from participating in certain foreign-led boycotts – particularly those targeting Israel.</p><p>B’nai B’rith International also “vehemently condemns” the United Kingdom’s recognition of Palestinian statehood and has donated 200 softshell jackets to Israeli military personnel.</p><p>Critics say interventions of this kind go beyond advocacy and reflect coordinated efforts to influence European policymaking on Israel and Palestine from abroad.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>While lobby groups publicly press their case, leaked documents, based on material from whistleblower site Distributed Denial of Secrets, suggest the Israeli state has also been directly involved in countering BDS campaigns across Europe.</p><p>A covert programme, jointly funded by the Israeli Ministries of Justice and of Strategic Affairs, reportedly hired law firms for <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/investigations/israel-may-breach-foreign-interference-laws-anti-bds-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">130,000 euros</a> ($154,200) on assignments aimed at monitoring boycott-related movements.</p><p>Former Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson, who supports the BDS movement, previously accused Israeli advocacy organisations of attempting to silence critics of Israel through legal and political pressure.</p><p>According to the leaked documents cited by <a href=\"https://www.ontheditch.com/israeli-government-paid-law-firm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Ditch</a>, an Irish outlet, Israel hired a law firm to “investigate the steps open to Israel against Martina Anderson”.</p><p>She told Al Jazeera she stood by her criticism.</p><p>“As the chair of the Palestinian delegation in the European Parliament, I did my work diligently, as people who know me would expect me to do.</p><p>“I am proud to have been a thorn in the side of the Israeli state and its extensive lobbying machine, which works relentlessly to undermine Palestinian voices and to justify a brutal and oppressive rogue state.”</p><h2 id=\"pushback-across-europe\">Pushback across Europe</h2><p>In 2019, Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, adopted a non-binding resolution condemning the BDS movement as anti-Semitic, calling for the withdrawal of public funding from groups that support it.</p><p>Observers say the vote has since been used to conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.</p><p>The European Leadership Network (ELNET), a prominent pro-Israel advocacy organisation active across the continent, welcomed the move and said its German branch had urged further legislative steps.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the UK, ELNET has funded trips to Israel for Labour politicians and their staff.</p><p>Bridget Phillipson, now secretary of state for education, declared a <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/240415/phillipson_bridget.htm#:~:text=Estimate%20of%20the%20probable%20value,A%2DZ%20index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3,000-pound ($4,087)</a> visit funded by ELNET for a member of her team.</p><p>A coworker of Wes Streeting named Anna Wilson also accepted a trip <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmsecret/240216/sponsor-05.htm#:~:text=Overseas%20Visit:%2016%2D20%20March,)%20(registered%20July%202023).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funded by ELNET</a>. Streeting himself has visited Israel on a mission organised by the Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) group.</p><p>ELNET’s UK branch is directed by Joan Ryan, an ex-Labour MP and former LFI chair.</p><p>During the passage of a bill designed to prevent public bodies from pursuing their own boycotts, divestment or sanctions policies – the Labour Party imposed a three-line whip instructing MPs to vote against it. Phillipson and Streeting abstained.</p><p>The Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill was widely seen as an attempt to block local councils and public institutions from adopting BDS-style measures.</p><p>A vocal supporter of the legislation was Luke Akehurst, then director of the pro-Israel advocacy group, We Believe in Israel. In a statement carried by ELNET, he said it was “absurd” that local councils could “undermine the excellent relationship between the UK and Israel” through boycotts or divestment.</p><p>“We need the law changed to close this loophole,” he said, arguing that BDS initiatives by local authorities risked “importing the conflict into communities in the UK”.</p><p>The legislation was ultimately shelved when a general election was called in 2024. It formed part of broader legislative efforts in parts of Europe to limit BDS-linked boycotts.</p><p>Akehurst has since been elected as Labour MP for North Durham, having previously served on the party’s National Executive Committee.</p></div></div></body></html>"

As a consequence, about 70 percent of the West Bank is “completely unregistered”, Braier said, making it “very hard to determine who actually owns the land”.</p><p>Even for those whose land was registered, “the legal bar for proving land ownership is very, very high, in a way that most Palestinians won’t have the proper documents to prove it”, said Braier.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4055187\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/INTERACTIVE-Israels-parliament-advances-bill-to-annex-occupied-West-Bank-1761225148.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Israel’s parliament advances bill to annex occupied West Bank-1761225148\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"full-annexation\">‘Full annexation’</h2><p>In 1968, Israeli occupation authorities froze most land settlement procedures in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, making transfer of ownership down the family line hard to prove for Palestinians.</p><p>Additionally, legal documents could have been lost or stored in homes that are now out of reach to Palestinian refugees displaced by the Arab–Israeli war (1948-49) – when the newly-founded Israel <a href=\"/features/2017/5/23/the-nakba-did-not-start-or-end-in-1948\">seized control of 77 percent of Palestine</a> – and in the Six Day War of 1967, which ended with Israel capturing the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria, while occupying the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.</p><p>The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the newly reinstated process of land registration amounts to a “full annexation” of Palestinian land.</p><p>“This is a way for Israel to take control over the West Bank,” Hagit Ofran, a Peace Now member, told Al Jazeera. “The government is asking for papers that are dating back to the British mandate or to the Jordanian time 100 years ago.”</p><p>“This is something that, very rarely, Palestinians will be able to prove, and therefore, by default, the land will be registered under [Israel’s] name,” she added.</p><p>Israel’s Supreme Court last month rejected a petition opposing the resumption of the land registration process, filed by local human rights groups Bimkom, Yesh Din, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and HaMoked.

Omar, a high school student, was the youngest among his seven siblings.</p><p>“Every child is precious to his family, but my son is a part of me,” she adds, tears streaming down her cheeks as she walks toward the morgue.</p><p>The family contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and several human rights organisations to try to find out what happened to Omar and his cousin, but to no avail.</p><p>Hanaa says the wait has been heartbreaking.</p><p>“We do not know whether they are prisoners, or whether they [the Israelis] killed them and took their bodies or detained their bodies along with those bodies they release in batches.”</p><p>“We are running as if in a mirage and we do not know anything,” says Hanaa, falling silent as if trying to catch her breath.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4316220\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Death-toll-tracker-1771169520.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-Feb 15, 2026_Death toll tracker-1765554400\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"endless-search\"><strong><br>\n</strong>Endless search</h2><p>Since Israel began returning Palestinian bodies to Gaza through the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing, Hanaa has become one of hundreds of family members moving between hospitals and reception points seeking any clues to the fate of their loved ones.</p><p>The latest batch of bodies came on February 4. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 54 bodies and 66 boxes containing human remains, released by Israel via the ICRC, had been received.</p><p>The remains arrived at <a href=\"/opinions/2025/1/1/al-shifa-was-a-dream-and-a-nightmare\">al-Shifa Hospital</a> in Gaza City, where medical and technical teams began initial examinations and documentation before presenting them to families for possible identification.</p><p>Human rights organisations say handovers occur through the Red Cross in accordance with international rules, but these procedures do not always include detailed documentation or the circumstances of death, increasing the burden on Gaza authorities to classify bodies and attempt identification amid limited capacity to conduct DNA testing.</p><p>Since the latest handover, Hanaa has gone to the hospital several times to review lists and photographs of the bodies.</p><p>“I have not left any place without going to it. I even went to Khan Younis in the south of the Strip to check the photos,” she says.</p><p>The bodies were returned under the United States-brokered October 2025 truce agreement between Israel and Hamas, which stipulated that the remains of 15 Palestinians would be exchanged for the bodies of every Israeli held in Gaza.</p><p>As of last month, Israeli authorities continue to hold the bodies of more than 770 Palestinians in what is known as the “<a href=\"/features/2017/8/10/why-does-israel-keep-the-bodies-of-palestinians\">cemeteries of numbers and morgues</a>“, according to the National Campaign for the Recovery of Martyrs’ Bodies and Disclosing the Fate of the Missing.</p><p>Hanaa’s suffering does not stop at reviewing Palestinian bodies. She also checks the lists of prisoners released by Israel from time to time, contacting the ICRC to try to confirm if her son’s name appears.</p><p>“By God, the Red Cross has memorised me and my voice from how much I call and ask. They tell me: ‘Sister, aren’t you the one who called last time?’ I tell him: ‘Yes, my brother. Forgive me, it is not in my hands.’ He sympathises with me,” she says.</p><p>Despite the gruelling effort, there is still no decisive answer about her son’s fate.</p><p>“My heart as a mother wishes that my son is alive. But I prepare myself for the worst possibilities, and even this psychological preparation has brought no result,” Hanaa says.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-do-they-leave-us-lost\">‘Why do they leave us lost?’</h2><p>Hanaa says the hardest part is not only the loss, but the state of confusion and disorientation she lives through, along with hundreds of members of other families still searching for their relatives.</p><p>“Why do they leave us lost like this? We don’t know where they went or what their fate is,” she says.</p><p>Another grim aspect is witnessing the “pitiful condition” in which the bodies are returned by Israel’s military. “All the features are completely buried, and I cannot even distinguish my son’s features.”</p><p>Hanaa says she believes the mutilation is “deliberate” to increase the pain of Palestinian families. “It is as if they want to leave us in grief for a lifetime … to mourn our children without end,” she says, tears unceasing.</p><p>“My son was in the prime of his youth, like a flower, when he was lost. He was preparing to sit for his high school exams with his cousin. What did they do to disappear like this and for us not to know their fate until now?”</p><p>Since the war began in October 2023, <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/families-inconsolable-in-gaza-as-israel-returns-more-unidentified-bodies\">the fate of bodies</a> held by Israel has emerged as a central humanitarian and legal issue in the conflict. Israel does not publish a unified list of named bodies it holds.</p><p>According to a statement by the Red Cross, it has “facilitated the transfer of 360 Palestinian bodies to Gaza since October 2023”, supported the handover of 195 Israeli captives, including 35 deceased, and the return of 3,472 Palestinian prisoners alive.</p><p>Only 99 returned Palestinian bodies have been definitively identified, according to the Health Ministry. The rest remain unidentified or are still undergoing identification procedures.</p><p>The ministry said some corpses show gunshot wounds to the head and chest, shrapnel injuries, fractures to the skull and limbs, in addition to advanced decomposition – greatly complicating forensic identification.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4315815\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4315815\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4315815\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/873A9714-1771164810.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='\"Every child is precious to his family, but my son is a piece of me,\" Hanaa Al-Mabhuh said' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4315815\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Every child is precious to his family, but my son is a part of me,’ says grieving mother Hanaa al-Mabhuh [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Appeal for international help</strong></h2><p>Hanaa called on international organisations to intervene to assist grieving families such as hers to determine the fate of their children.</p><p>“We cannot calm down or stabilise psychologically or socially. We are under enormous psychological pressure,” she says.</p><p>“They plowed the earth completely and exhumed graves searching for Israeli bodies with equipment and tests. But our children, no one asks about them. By what logic does this happen?”</p><p>At Gaza’s forensic department, a small team handles this heavy burden under conditions that exclude tools of “definitive confirmation”, leaving staff and families in a wide space of doubt.</p><p>Ahmed Abu Taha, head of the bodies and missing persons files at the Health Ministry, tells Al Jazeera that 120 corpses recently arrived in Gaza via the ICRC. S<span>ome came complete, while others were simply bone fragments and other human remains.</span></p><p>Out of the 120, only two bodies were identified, and even those were not scientifically conclusive.</p><p>“Confirmatory” tests such as DNA analysis, forensic anthropology, and forensic odontology are unavailable in Gaza’s destroyed healthcare system, meaning only “presumptive” testing can be conducted, which is less precise, says Abu Taha.</p><p>“The steps begin with presumptive testing – looking at distinguishing marks, clothes, whether male or female, estimating age, identifying distinguishing features such as amputations or tattoos… Then you move to confirmatory testing. But unfortunately, in Gaza we only have presumptive testing.”</p><p>This type of testing “is prone to many errors” including misidentification, he adds.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4285584\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-GAZA-HEALTHCARE-SYSTEM-FEB-3-2026-1770124823.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - GAZA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM - FEB 3 2026-1770124823\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2><strong>When error becomes tragedy</strong></h2><p>The most painful aspect, Abu Taha says, is the impact an “error” has on families waiting desperately to find the body of a missing child. Repeated misidentifications have been recorded, causing shock and reopening wounds for many Palestinians.</p><p>Abu Taha recounts one story that deeply affected him and illustrates the psychological and emotional damage inflicted on families amid the absence of accurate DNA tests.</p><p>“On one occasion, members of a family came and identified a body as their son. They presented evidence that closely matched the body. The forensic team examined it and found similarities, and indeed the body was handed over to that family.”</p><p>Grieving relatives completed the formal procedures for receiving the body, obtained a death certificate, then proceeded with funeral rites and burial. They announced a wake to receive mourners.</p><p>But a shock came when, only two days after the burial, another family presented more conclusive evidence that showed the deceased person belonged to them.</p><p>Abu Taha says the harrowing incident has been repeated inside Gaza’s beleaguered hospitals.</p><p>He is calling for international intervention to pressure Israel to allow the entry of identification equipment and DNA testing tools as an ethical and humanitarian matter to end the suffering of families struggling to identify loved ones and give them a proper burial.</p><p>“The file of the bodies is not merely a numerical issue,” Abu Taha says.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Israel has continued curb the supply of aid into Gaza in violation of the ICJ interim order.</p><p>Under the 1948 Genocide Convention, countries that are party to the treaty have a binding obligation to prevent and punish genocide. Countries can investigate and prosecute individuals who may have committed or been complicit in this crime.</p><p>In March last year, the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) announced the “Global 195” campaign to hold Israeli and dual-national individuals accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.</p><p>The coalition aims to work simultaneously within multiple jurisdictions to apply for private arrest warrants and initiate legal proceedings against those implicated, including the Israeli military members and the entire Israeli military and political command in its scope.</p><p>For countries that are parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), there is an additional layer, where the ICC can assert its jurisdiction.

It has been using those pieces of evidence to pursue the trail of the accused for war crimes.</p><p>“We are in possession of many more profiles of dual nationals beyond the 1,000 soldiers named in our complaint to the ICC. We will be pursuing legal action against all of them in the national courts of their respective countries,” the foundation had said in October 2024. “Impunity must end, everywhere.”</p><p>The Hind Rajab Foundation says it pursues criminal accountability for Israeli war criminals, from those who planned and ordered operations to those who executed them, including foreign nationals who have participated in or financed these crimes.</p><p>Its founder, Dyab Abou Jahjah, was also threatened by Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli, who told him to “watch your pager” in a post on X, an allusion to deadly attacks on Hezbollah members’ communication systems in September 2024. At least 12 people were killed and more than 3,000 people were wounded when thousands of pagers were detonated by Israeli operatives during those attacks.</p><p>In January last year, a complaint filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation led to a Brazilian judge ordering an investigation into an Israeli soldier vacationing in the country. The soldier had to flee, prompting the Israeli military to order all troops who participated in combat to conceal their identities.</p><p>“Criminal liability under international law cannot be dissolved by time bars. It extends forever, and no statute of limitations is applicable,” said Bantekas of Hamad Bin Khalifa University.</p><p>However, prosecuting Israeli military members “is practically difficult for two reasons”, he said, noting the difficulty of obtaining firsthand evidence and the wariness of national prosecutors who may fear political or other repercussions.</p><p>“If public opinion and political opinion in Europe shifts far more in favour of Palestine than it is now, then national prosecutions will feel more at ease to initiate prosecutions,” he told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div></body></html>"

His health has declined sharply.”</p><h2 id=\"chased-like-locusts\">‘Chased like locusts’</h2><p>Despite the Sudanese army asserting control over access routes, the security situation in Dilling remains precarious. Authorities said the city is subjected to almost daily drone strikes launched by the RSF and SPLM-N, targeting infrastructure and residential areas.</p><p>For Maryam, a mother displaced multiple times by the conflict, the breaking of the siege has not brought peace. She described the terror of the unmanned aerial vehicles that hover over their homes.</p><p>“Now the drones bombard and chase us. They chase us like locusts,” Maryam said. “When they come, we just run to hide. When they hover over us, they burn the thatch [roofs], start fires and force you to leave your home.”</p><p>She added that the constant threat of aerial bombardment makes normal life impossible: “If you are having a meal, like porridge, … the moment you see them, you leave it.”</p><p>Uweit said that while the lifting of the siege is a “glimmer of hope” and a first step towards recovery, the dual challenge of rebuilding a shattered health system and fending off persistent military attacks means Dilling’s ordeal is far from over.</p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"/news/2021/3/3/irans-fatf-debate-heats-up-as-nuclear-deal-remains-in-limbo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">domestic opponents</a>.</p><p>The statement by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Iran’s Ministry of Economic Affairs on Sunday came two days after the Paris-based <span>Financial Action Task Force (FATF) renewed its years-long blacklisting of Iran, according to a report by the official IRNA news agency.</span></p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p><span>The FATF </span><span>also ramped up measures aimed at isolating Iran from global financial markets with a particular focus on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and cryptocurrencies.</span></p><p>It recommended member states and financial institutions around the world to:</p><ul>\n<li>Refuse to establish representative offices of Iranian financial institutions and VASPs or consider the noncompliance risks involved.</li>\n<li>Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing offices in Iran.</li>\n<li>On a risk basis, limit business relationships or financial transactions, including virtual asset transactions, with Iran or people inside the country.</li>\n<li>Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing new correspondent banking relationships and require them to undertake a risk-based review of existing ties.</li>\n</ul><p>Even the flow of <a href=\"/economy/2020/10/9/fears-rise-over-human-toll-after\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">funds involving humanitarian assistance</a>, food and health supplies as well as diplomatic operating costs and personal remittances are recommended to be handled “on a risk basis considering the “terrorist” financing or proliferation financing risks emanating from Iran”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-does-the-fatf-move-mean\">What does the FATF move mean?</h2><p>Iran has been <a href=\"/news/2020/12/14/contentious-fatf-legislation-revived-in-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blacklisted by the FATF for years</a> and is currently on the list in the company of just two other countries: North Korea and Myanmar.</p><p>Since October 2019, Iran has had “heightened measures” like supervisory examination and external audit requirements recommended against it and has been subject to “effective countermeasures” since February 2020.</p><p>This contributed to making access to international transactions increasingly difficult or impossible for Iranian banks and nationals and made the country more dependent on costlier shadowy third-party intermediaries for transactions.</p><p>The new countermeasures emphasise existing frameworks but also specifically cite virtual assets, signalling an increased focus.</p><p>The fact that the FATF also urges countries and global institutions to remain wary of risks of having any dealings with Iran may mean even more <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/political-infighting-as-iran-navigates-sanctions-lingering-threat-of-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">limited transaction opportunities</a> for Iranian entities and nationals.</p><p>Small banks maintaining old correspondent relations with Iranian counterparts may also reconsider after being recommended to re-evaluate existing links.</p><p>The isolation has hobbled state-run or private income streams and contributed to the continuous depreciation of the Iranian rial over the years.</p><h2 id=\"links-with-iran-s-nuclear-dilemmas\">Links with Iran’s nuclear dilemmas</h2><p>The FATF, formerly known by its French name, was established by the Group of Seven (G7) countries in 1989 to combat money laundering but later had its mandate expanded to countering financing of “terrorism” and weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>It has been formally raising concerns about Iran since the late 2000s, which is also when it started calling for countermeasures as international tensions grew over Iran’s nuclear programme and the country was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.</p><p>But a year after Iran signed a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that lifted the sanctions, the FATF also acknowledged a “high-level political commitment” from Iran and agreed to an action plan for the country to address its compliance requirements.</p><p>The centrist government of President Hassan Rouhani, who had clinched the deals, pressed ahead with ratifying several laws needed to fulfil the action plan despite opposition from hardliners who were firmly against the increased financial transparency and international supervision.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But United States President Donald Trump unilaterally reneged on the nuclear deal in 2018, imposing a <a href=\"/economy/2022/2/2/irans-economy-reveals-power-and-limits-of-us-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“maximum pressure” campaign</a> that has remained in effect until today. The move empowered the argument from the hardliners in Tehran, who succeeded in blocking the ratification of the rest of the FATF-linked legislation, leaving the issue dormant for years.</p><p>Washington has retained the sanctions over the years with some of the latest – including the blacklisting in January of two United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchanges – allegedly connected to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p><p>The UN Security Council sanctions were also reinstated against Iran in September when Western powers triggered the <a href=\"/news/2025/9/28/iranians-fear-more-economic-pain-war-as-un-sanctions-snapback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“snapback” mechanism of the nuclear accord</a>. They include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel bans as well as nuclear, missile and banking sanctions that are binding for all UN member states.</p><h2 id=\"support-for-axis-of-resistance\">Support for ‘axis of resistance’</h2><p>The Iranian hardliners railing against any progress on FATF-related legislation have presented two main concerns.</p><p>They assert that fully adhering to the watchdog’s guidelines would curb Tehran’s ability to back its “axis of resistance” of aligned armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine. The axis lost its base in Syria with the <a href=\"/news/2024/12/21/the-iran-led-axis-of-resistance-in-the-aftermath-of-syrias-upheaval\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fall of President Bashar al-Assad</a> in December 2024.</p><p>Hardliners have also suggested that Iran’s ability to circumvent US sanctions may be significantly compromised by disclosing all the information required by the FATF.</p><p>Iran has been selling most of its oil to China at hefty discounts, using a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/us-imposes-sanctions-on-shadow-fleet-accused-of-transporting-iranian-oil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shadow fleet of ships</a> that turn their transponders off to avoid detection in international waters. The country has also for years been forced to rely on a capillary network of currency exchanges and intermediaries, some of them based in neighbouring countries, such as Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>To assuage some of the domestic concerns, two FATF-related laws ratified by Iran in 2025 were passed with special “conditions” and reservations infused in the text.</p><p>One of the main conditions was that the ratified regulations must not “prejudice the legitimate right of peoples or groups under colonial domination and/or foreign occupation to fight against aggression and occupation and to exercise their right to self-determination” and “shall not be construed in any manner as recognition of the Zionist occupying regime”, a reference to Israel.</p><p>Iran also said it would not accept any referral to the International Court of Justice and asserted that its own Supreme National Security Council would determine which groups qualify as “terrorist” outfits.</p><p>Those conditions were rejected by the FATF, leading to the increased countermeasures.</p><p>The watchdog also said it expects Iran to identify and freeze “terrorist assets” in line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Some of Iran’s nuclear and military authorities are among individuals sanctioned by those resolutions.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, our friends in the region [the Gulf] are far more effective and helpful than an empty-handed and peripheral E3.”</p><p>The E3 – which included France, the United Kingdom and Germany – were key players in the previous round of nuclear negotiations between world powers and Iran. That process culminated in 2015 with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a landmark agreement aimed at limiting the scope of Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p></p><p>The US under the first administration of President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and ramped up sanctions on Iran. Since then, the process has largely stalled. Still, the E3 maintained a role as a go-between with Tehran and Washington.</p><p>But since negotiations resumed last year, Gulf countries, such as Oman and Qatar, have taken the lead in facilitating talks between the US and Iran.</p><p>Araghchi made the remarks before leaving Tehran to lead a diplomatic and technical delegation to Geneva for a new round of nuclear talks with the US. The talks follow last week’s indirect negotiations in Oman, which is mediating the process, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p><p>During his visit, Araghchi is expected to meet his Swiss and Omani counterparts, as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials.</p><p>Abas Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, said Araghchi’s comments “indicate a policy shift from the Iranian side that the E3 mechanism … is no longer a valid channel for resolution”.</p><p>“This nuclear mediation has moved from Europe to the region, and now the heavy lifting in diplomacy is done by regional players,” he said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Oman is to host talks between the US and Iran in Geneva after previous indirect negotiations in Muscat on February 6. Those talks were attended by US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.</p><p>US and Iranian officials previously held several rounds of talks in the Omani capital to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme last year. But that process was halted as Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined by bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>The new rounds of negotiations come as tensions in the region remain high, with Trump moving more US military assets to the Middle East. On Friday, the US president said he was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/13/trump-confirms-second-aircraft-carrier-headed-to-middle-east-very\">sending a second aircraft carrier</a> to the region while openly talking about a change in Iran’s government.</p><p>Despite the new push for diplomacy, the two sides have maintained their positions. Iran has shown flexibility in discussing its nuclear programme, but the US wants to widen the talks to include Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support for regional armed groups – two issues that Tehran says are nonnegotiable.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But after decades of occupation, the bar to prove Palestinian ownership is extremely high, and the move could dispossess thousands of Palestinians of their rights to their land.</p><p>The Palestinian presidency condemned the decision in a statement, calling it a “grave escalation and a flagrant violation of international law”, which amounts to “de facto annexation”.</p><p>It called on the international community, especially the United States and the United Nations Security Council, to intervene immediately.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"null-and-void\">‘Null and void’</h2><p>Hamas also denounced the Israeli move, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.</p><p>The group, which led the October 2023 attacks on southern Israel and fought against Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, called the approval “a null and void decision issued by an illegitimate occupying power”.</p><p>“It is an attempt to forcibly impose settlement and Judaisation on the ground, in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions,” it added.</p><p>The Israeli decision is the latest step to deepen its control over the occupied West Bank. In recent months, Israel has greatly expanded construction in illegal settlements, legalised outposts and made significant bureaucratic changes to its policies in the territory to strengthen its hold and weaken the Palestinian Authority.</p><p>The move will apply to an area known as Area C in the West Bank. It is one of three areas the territory was divided into when the Oslo Accords were signed in the 1990s.</p><p>The area is under full Israeli military control.</p><p>More than 300,000 Palestinians are estimated to live in Area C, with many more in surrounding communities dependent on its agricultural and grazing lands.</p><p>Most Palestinian land there was not officially registered due to long and expensive legal processes, including requirements for decades-old documents that may have been lost or destroyed during times of war or occupation.</p><p>Israel can now challenge the ownership of lands it previously denied Palestinians access to.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the process likely amounts to a “mega land grab” from Palestinians.</p><p>“This move is very dramatic and allows the state to gain control of almost all of Area C,” said Hagit Ofran, the director of Peace Now’s Settlement Watch programme.</p><p>“Palestinians will be sent to prove ownership in a way that they will never be able to do,” Ofran told The Associated Press news agency. “And this way, Israel might take over 83 percent of the Area C, which is about half of the West Bank.”</p><p>The registration process could start as soon as this year, she said.</p><h2 id=\"regional-outcry\">Regional outcry</h2><p>Experts said the move also puts the Israeli government in blatant breach of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate or settle land in occupied territories.</p><p>Xavier Abu Eid, a political analyst based in the West Bank, also described the move as a de facto annexation of Palestinian territory, warning that it will profoundly reshape the civil and legal landscape by eliminating what Israeli ministers have called longstanding “legal obstacles” to illegal settlement expansion.</p><p>Speaking from Ramallah, Abu Eid told Al Jazeera that Israel is “packing annexation” into “a bureaucratic move”.</p><p>“People should understand this is not just a step towards annexation. We are experiencing annexation as we speak today. What the Israeli government is doing is implementing their political programme: a policy that has already been presented,” he said.</p><p>The Israeli move was also denounced by regional countries.</p><p>Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Israel’s decision “in the strongest terms”, describing it as a “flagrant violation of international law”.</p><p>Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also denounced the move, <a href=\"https://x.com/MofaQatar_EN/status/2023086095852802085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">saying</a> it considered it “an extension of its illegal plans to deprive the Palestinian people of their rights”. In a statement, the ministry stressed the need for international solidarity to pressure Israel to halt the plan “to avoid its serious repercussions”.</p><p>Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said such actions constitute a “flagrant violation” of international law and international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as relevant UNSC resolutions, notably Resolution 2334 of 2016.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Turkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also condemned the move, saying it was aimed at imposing Israel’s authority over the West Bank and expanding settlement activities.</p><p>The ministry called the step “null and void”, stressing that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory. It added that the Israeli government’s expansionist policies in the West Bank undermine ongoing peace efforts in the region and damage the prospects for a two-state solution.</p><p>There was no immediate comment from the US.</p><p>Previous US administrations have sharply condemned an expansion of Israeli activity and control in the West Bank, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a particularly close relationship with President Donald Trump.</p><p>The two met last week in Washington, DC, for the seventh time in the past year.</p><p>While Trump has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank, ‌his administration has not sought to curb Israel’s accelerated settlement building.</p><p>More than 700,000 Israelis live in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The UN’s highest court, meanwhile, said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory and ‌settlements in the West Bank are illegal and should be ended as soon as possible.</p></div></div></body></html>"
