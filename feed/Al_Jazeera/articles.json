Modi’s first trip to Israel was in 2017, when he was the first Indian leader to ever visit the country.</p><p>India was among the countries that opposed the creation of Israel in 1948, and for decades was one of the most forceful non-Arab critics of Israel’s policies towards Palestinians. It only established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992, but since 2014, when Modi came to power, relations between the two countries have flourished.</p><p>Here is more about what is on the agenda for Modi’s visit, and why it is significant.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-will-modi-meet-and-what-will-they-talk-about\">Who will Modi meet, and what will they talk about?</h2><p>Modi is expected to land at the Ben Gurion international airport outside Tel Aviv at 12:45pm local time (10:45 GMT).</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to welcome Modi at the airport, as he did during the Indian premier’s 2017 visit. The two leaders are scheduled to hold talks shortly after.</p><p>Then, at 4:30pm (14:30 GMT), Modi is scheduled to address the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in Jerusalem. He then returns to Tel Aviv for the night.</p><p>On the morning of February 26, Modi is scheduled to visit the Yad Vashem museum, a memorial to Holocaust victims, before meeting Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Modi and Netanyahu will then meet again and oversee the signing of agreements between the two countries, before Modi departs Israel in the afternoon.</p><p>Overall, Modi and Netanyahu aim to use this visit to bolster strategic economic and defence agreements between India and Israel, officials from both sides have said.</p><p>“We don’t compete, we rather complement each other,” JP Singh, India’s ambassador to Israel, told state broadcaster All India Radio on Monday, speaking <span>of relations with Israel. “Israel is really good at innovation, science and technology. Therefore, there will be a lot of discussion on AI, cybersecurity and quantum.”</span></p><p>The two countries signed a new Bilateral Investment Treaty in September last year, replacing the 1996 investment treaty, to provide “certainty and protection” to investors from both countries. They are also aiming to upgrade existing bilateral security agreements at this meeting.</p><p>In a video posted on the Israeli Embassy’s social media channels on Monday, Israel’s ambassador to India, Reuven Azar, said: “Our economic partnership is gaining real momentum. We signed a bilateral investment treaty, and we are moving forward to sign a free trade agreement, hopefully this year.”</p><p>Azar said that Israel wants to encourage Indian infrastructure companies to come to Israel to build and invest in the country.</p><p>He added: “We will deepen our defence relationship by updating our security agreements.”</p><p>In an X post of his own on Sunday, Netanyahu wrote that he is looking forward to greeting Modi in Jerusalem.</p><p>“We are partners in innovation, security, and a shared strategic vision. Together, we are building an axis of nations committed to stability and progress,” he wrote.</p><p>“From AI to regional cooperation, our partnership continues to reach new heights,” Netanyahu added.</p><h2 id=\"how-are-india-israel-relations\">How are India-Israel relations?</h2><p>Relations between India and Israel have <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/modis-israel-visit-timeline-of-indias-relations-with-israel-palestine\">improved exponentially</a> over the years. While still under British rule in the 1920s and 1930s, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.</p><p>In 1917, the United Kingdom signed the Balfour Declaration, promising Jews who had been displaced from Europe due to Adolf Hitler’s oppression a homeland in the British Mandate in Palestine. This was opposed by many nations, including India, which was fighting British colonialism at the time.</p><p>“Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English, or France to the French,” Mahatma Gandhi, India’s most prominent freedom fighter who is revered as the father of the nation, wrote in an article in his weekly newspaper Harijan on November 26, 1938.</p><p>India was among the nations opposed to the creation of Israel in 1948. In 1949, India also voted against Israel’s UN membership. While it recognised Israel as a state in 1950, it was not until 1992 that the two formalised diplomatic relations, and economic relations gradually grew over the following two decades.</p><p>Since Modi became India’s leader in 2014, there has been a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/modis-israel-visit-timeline-of-indias-relations-with-israel-palestine\">major shift</a> in the relationship between India and Israel. Nine years ago, Modi was the first Indian prime minister ever to visit Israel.</p><p>India is currently Israel’s second-largest trading partner in Asia, after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.</p><p>India’s main exports to Israel include pearls, precious stones, automotive diesel, chemicals, machinery, and electrical equipment; imports include petroleum, chemical machinery and transport equipment.</p><p>Azad Essa, a senior reporter at Middle East Eye and author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel, told Al Jazeera that Modi’s visit to Israel shows how far India’s relations with Israel have evolved over the past decade.</p><p>“Whereas a partnership existed, it was a lot more limited prior to Modi. [New] Delhi has now emerged as Israel’s strongest non-Western ally, so much so that it is now considered a ‘special relationship’, rooted in strategic cooperation and ideological convergence,” Essa said.</p><p>“This visit will be Netanyahu’s opportunity to offer appreciation to Modi, and will be used by him to show Israelis that he is a well-respected and popular leader in the Global South.”</p><p>Under Modi, India has become Israel’s top arms customer. And in 2024, during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, Indian arms firms supplied Israel with rockets and explosives, according to an <a href=\"/features/2024/6/26/india-exports-rockets-explosives-to-israel-amid-gaza-war-documents-reveal\">Al Jazeera investigation</a>.</p><p>Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) envisions India as a Hindu homeland, <a href=\"/features/2026/2/24/kashmir-spying-demolitions-how-modis-india-embraced-israel-model\">echoing Israel’s self-image</a> as a Jewish state. Both India and Israel frame “Islamic terrorism” as a key threat, a label critics say is used to justify wider anti-Muslim policies.</p><p>“The alliance between India and Israel is not just about weapon sales or trade. It is about India’s open embrace of authoritarianism and militarism in building a supremacist state in Israel’s image,” Essa said.</p><p>“It is also a story about how security, nationalism and democratic language can be used to justify and normalise increasingly illiberal policies, and this has implications for democracies everywhere.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-visit-significant\">Why is this visit significant?</h2><p>Modi’s visit comes at a time of rising and complex geopolitical tensions in and around the Middle East.</p><p>Despite the warm relations between the two countries in recent decades, Modi’s trip comes just a week after India joined more than 100 countries in condemning Israel’s de facto expansion in the occupied West Bank. New Delhi signed the statement on February 18 – a day later than most – after initially appearing hesitant.</p><p>This week, Netanyahu claimed that he plans to form a new regional bloc of countries, which he <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/whats-netanyahus-planned-hexagon-alliance-and-can-it-work\">termed a “hexagon” alliance</a>, to stand against “radical” Sunni and Shia-majority nations.</p><p>On Sunday, Netanyahu said this alliance would include Israel, India, Greece and Cyprus, along with other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states. None of these governments has officially endorsed this plan, including India.</p><p>Analysts said Modi’s visit will be viewed by many as an endorsement of Israeli policies, however.</p><p>“The timing of the visit is notable because it comes at a time when Netanyahu has lost immense credibility around the world, and to have the leader of the world’s so-called largest democracy visiting Israel and showing affection to Netanyahu, who has a warrant in his name from the International Criminal Court, is a ringing endorsement of him and Israel’s policies,” Essa said.</p><p>Modi’s visit also comes at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the United States.</p><p>India and Iran have long had a cooperative relationship. After Modi visited Iran in 2016, the two countries signed a major deal, allowing India to develop the strategically located port of Chabahar on Iran’s southeastern coast. However, after the US imposed additional sanctions on Iran last year and threatened to penalise all countries that do business with Tehran, India has reportedly started moving out of Chabahar.</p><p>In June 2025, India <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/why-india-refused-to-join-sco-condemnation-of-israels-attacks-on-iran\">did not join</a> the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO’s) condemnation of Israel’s attacks on Iran during the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a> between Iran and Israel. However, it did join a later condemnation by the BRICS grouping of major emerging economies of the Israeli and US attacks on Iran.</p><p>The US, which has been applying its own pressure on India over the past year in retaliation for its purchase of Russian oil, is <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">building up</a> a vast array of military assets in the Arabian Sea, close to Iran, as President Donald Trump increases pressure on Iran to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/iran-us-tensions-soar-what-do-both-sides-want\">agree to a deal</a> over its nuclear programme and stock of ballistic missiles.</p><p>Trump said last Friday that he was <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/20/trump-considering-limited-strikes-on-iran\">considering a limited strike</a> on Iran if Tehran does not reach a deal with the US. “I guess I can say I am considering that,” he told reporters.</p><p>Iran has said it is seeking a diplomatic solution, but will defend itself if Washington resorts to military action.</p><p>Israel will likely be a front-line participant in any escalation that might follow from US strikes or Iranian retaliation, analysts say.</p></div></div></body></html>"

the plan to ban them from working, and are seeking an urgent interim injunction from the court pending a full judicial review of the Israeli order.</p><p>Oxfam International said on Tuesday that the forced closure of aid operations in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory could begin as early as Saturday.</p><p>“The effect would be immediate, extending well beyond individual organisations to the wider humanitarian system,” Oxfam warned.</p><p>“In Gaza, families remain dependent on external assistance amid continuing restrictions on aid entry and renewed strikes in densely populated areas,” it said in a statement.</p><p>“In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, military incursions, demolitions, <a

added.</p><p></p><p>The court action comes as aid organisations – including Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE – were notified by Israeli authorities on December 30, 2025, that their Israeli work registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them and provide lists containing personal details on their Palestinian

Diplomatic relations were likewise suspended.</p><p>In turn, MAS received strong support from rural parts of Bolivia, where the cultivation of coca, the raw ingredient in cocaine, is a key economic driver.</p><p>Bolivia, along with other Andean countries like Colombia and Peru, is a key producer of coca, which has traditional uses, including as a remedy for altitude sickness. Morales himself led a union of coca growers, or cocaleros, before taking office.</p><p>Advocates have accused the US’s militaristic “war on drugs” of harming impoverished rural farmers through the forced eradication of coca crops. Such campaigns, they argue, can leave farmers without a means of supporting themselves and their families.</p><p>MAS remained in power from the start of Morales’s term in 2006 until 2025, when its coalition fractured amid economic instability and internal fighting.</p><h2 id=\"new-political-direction\">New political direction</h2><p>In October 2025, two right-wing candidates proceeded to a run-off for the presidency: centrist Rodrigo Paz of the Christian Democratic Party and a former right-wing president, Jorge Quiroga.</p><p>It was the first presidential run-off in modern times for Bolivia, and it marked a sharp turn away from two decades of socialist government.</p><p>Both candidates made improving the relationship with the US a central pillar of their campaigns, viewing it as essential to solving Bolivia’s severe economic crisis.</p><p>Paz, who was educated in Washington, DC, argued that normalising ties would attract the international investment needed to modernise the energy and lithium sectors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Quiroga, a conservative who studied at Texas A&amp;M University, campaigned on a more aggressive platform, including fiscal austerity and security partnerships with the US.</p><p>His vice presidential candidate, Juan Pablo Velasco, is credited with popularising the tagline “Make Bolivia Sexy Again”, a twist on US President Donald Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again”.</p><p>Paz ultimately emerged as the victor in the race, with nearly 54.9 percent of the vote. After his inauguration in November, Paz moved quickly to fulfil his promises by restoring diplomatic ties with the US.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, called Paz’s presidency a “<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/secretary-rubios-call-with-bolivian-president-elect-paz\">transformative opportunity</a>” for the region.</p><p>Earlier this month, both Bolivia and the US agreed to appoint ambassadors to one another’s countries for the first time in nearly 18 years.</p><h2 id=\"uncertainty-remains\">Uncertainty remains</h2><p>But it is unclear to what extent the DEA will be operating in Bolivia. Left-wing leaders like Morales continue to have strong pockets of support, particularly in highland and rural areas.</p><p>Bolivian Foreign Minister Fernando Aramayo has said negotiations are still under way to finalise the specific areas of cooperation between his country and the DEA, as well as operational limits for the US agency.</p><p>A full agreement outlining the scope of the agency’s activities is expected in the coming months.</p><p>Since returning to office on January 20, 2025, Trump has intensified the US campaign against drug trafficking in Latin America, including by designating several major cartels as “foreign terrorist organizations”.</p><p>Trump has also pressured Latin American governments to take more aggressive actions against the illicit drug trade, using economic sanctions and military threats as leverage.</p><p>Already, in late December and early January, Trump has authorised two strikes on Venezuela on the premise of combating drug trafficking.</p><p>One, on December 29, targeted a port that the Trump administration said was used for drug smuggling. The second, on January 3, resulted in multiple explosions, dozens dead and the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. He remains in custody in the US, where he faces drug trafficking and weapons possession charges.</p><p>Critics have argued that Trump’s anti-drug campaign has blurred the line between law enforcement and military activities.</p><p>The increasing use of military force against criminal suspects has raised concerns that human rights are being violated and legal processes circumvented, including through the use of extrajudicial killings.</p><p>One example has come as part of a military campaign called Operation Southern Spear.</p><p>On September 2, the US announced the first of nearly 44 “lethal kinetic strikes” against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.</p><p>As many as 150 people have been killed in the attacks. Operation Southern Spear has continued, despite international organisations like the United Nations questioning its legality and calling for its end.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel launched its genocidal military campaign against Gaza in 2023, after a Hamas-led attack left nearly 1,200 people dead in southern Israel.</p><p>Amid reports of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and starvation, student protesters held demonstrations on <a href=\"/news/2024/4/26/with-eyes-on-us-college-campuses-students-stress-gaza-is-why-were-here\">college campuses</a> across the US in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>Trump campaigned for re-election in 2024, during the height of the movement to erect solidarity encampments on school grounds. His campaign platform called for dismantling the protests as one of 20 national goals.</p><p>“Deport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again,” one of the platform’s bullet points reads.</p><p>Trump has long accused the pro-Palestinian movement of creating an unsafe learning environment.</p><p>But many protest organisers, some of whom were Jewish, have refuted allegations of anti-Semitism. Instead, they said their mission was to highlight the grave human rights abuses perpetuated by the Israeli government in Gaza.</p><p>Still, the student encampments faced crackdowns from university authorities and law enforcement. Thousands of students were taken into custody in 2024, though many were ultimately released without charge.</p><p>One encampment at UCLA that year <a href=\"/news/2024/5/2/activists-say-ucla-palestine-encampment-assault-followed-days-of-harassment\">was attacked</a> by a group of right-wing supporters of Israel, wielding pipes and spraying mace at pro-Palestine protesters. Activists argued that the police allowed the violence to happen, before forcibly <a href=\"/news/2024/5/2/ucla-students-arrested-amid-gaza-protests-all-you-need-to-know\">clearing the encampment</a> the next day.</p><p>UCLA agreed to pay a $6m settlement to three Jewish students and a professor last year, after they alleged harms during the protest movement.</p><p>The school has maintained it has taken multiple measures to address anti-Semitism on campus.</p><h2 id=\"tensions-with-universities\">Tensions with universities</h2><p>Since taking office for a second term in January 2025, Trump has sought to punish certain schools where protests were prominent, including Columbia University in New York City.</p><p>In March, the Trump administration froze federal funding to Columbia, starting a wave of uncertainty in the education sector, as other schools also saw their contracts and grants suspended.</p><p>Trump also deployed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest Columbia student leader Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent US resident, on the basis that his protests threatened US foreign policy.</p><p>Khalil and other foreign-born student protesters continue to fight deportation in the US court system.</p><p>In July, the Trump administration arrived at a $220m settlement with Columbia, which saw the prestigious university accede to a list of demands in exchange for its federal funding being restored. Other schools, including Brown University and Cornell University, have likewise struck deals.</p><p>But schools, including Harvard, have so far refused to accept demands and costly settlements. They face ongoing investigations and penalties.</p><p>Last year, for instance, the Trump administration pressured UCLA, a public university, to pay more than $1bn in settlement fees in a <a href=\"https://ucop.edu/communications/_files/confidential-rule-408-communication-ucla-08-08-25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a> that also demanded changes to its hiring and admissions processes.</p><p>At stake are more than $500m in frozen federal research grants to the school. The school has so far not agreed to pay the sum.</p><p>In July, the Justice Department also issued a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1409416/dl?inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notice of violation</a> against UCLA, saying that its investigation had found violations of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause as well as the Civil Rights Act.</p><p>Advocates of the protests argue that the Trump administration’s efforts are a threat to the First Amendment of the Constitution, which protects free speech, the right to protest and academic freedom.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Musk had described her as being beholden to the cartels.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Well, we are considering whether to take any legal action,” she began. “The lawyers are looking into it.”</p><p>She then proceeded to describe the allegations that she leads a “narco-government” as “absurd” and demonstrably false.</p><p>“It falls apart all on its own,” she said, dismissing the accusation as hackneyed. “They don’t even know what to invent any more, right? Honestly, it’s laughable.”</p><p>Sheinbaum has faced criticism for her national security policies following a spate of cross-country violence over the weekend.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"killing-of-el-mencho\">Killing of El Mencho</h2><p>The violence erupted after the death on Sunday of a top cartel leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known by the nickname El Mencho.</p><p>The Mexican military had tracked El Mencho to the town of Tapalpa in central Mexico. He died while en route to medical care after being shot by authorities.</p><p>Members of El Mencho’s criminal organisation, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, responded to the news of his death with road blocks, arson and clashes with security forces. Dozens of people were killed in the violence.</p><p>Musk was among the online commentators criticising Sheinbaum’s handling of Mexico’s security in the aftermath of the attacks.</p><p>His posts came in response to a video clip circulating on social media, showing Sheinbaum advocating for alternatives to the militaristic “war on drugs” approach.</p><p>“She’s just saying what her cartel bosses tell her to say,” Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2025965101501608226\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in response to the video.</p><p>“Let’s just say that their punishment for disobedience is a little worse than a ‘performance improvement plan’.”</p><p>A vocal critic of left-wing governments like Sheinbaum’s, Musk is closely aligned with United States President Donald Trump, who has likewise pushed for more military action against cartels.</p><p>In September, for instance, Trump’s State Department listed Mexico as an area of concern for drug-trafficking and outlined steps it expected to see to address the issue.</p><p>“Much more remains to be done by Mexico’s government to target cartel leadership, along with their clandestine drug labs, precursor chemical supply chains, and illicit finances,” the State Department wrote.</p><p>“Over the next year, the United States will expect to see additional, aggressive efforts by Mexico to hold cartel leaders accountable and disrupt the illicit networks engaged in drug production and trafficking.”</p><p>Trump himself has accused Sheinbaum of inefficacy in her campaign to crack down on illicit drug trafficking.</p><p>“She’s not running Mexico. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump told Fox News in the hours after launching a January 3 military operation to abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>“She’s very frightened of the cartels. They’re running Mexico. I’ve asked her numerous times, ‘Would you like us to take out the cartels?'”</p><p>Sheinbaum has repeatedly refused the prospect of unilateral US intervention, arguing it would violate Mexican sovereignty. Still, Trump has repeatedly warned that the US is considering military strikes on Mexican soil.</p><p>“Something’s going to have to be done with Mexico,” he told Fox News.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"upping-the-pressure\">Upping the pressure</h2><p>Sheinbaum, however, has defended her administration’s track record. Faced with US tariffs in February 2025, she deployed nearly 10,000 members of Mexico’s National Guard to the country’s northern border to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.</p><p>She has also taken targeted military actions against cartels, though she has argued that the process should be focused on prosecuting criminals, rather than killing them in law enforcement operations.</p><p>Her administration has also overseen the extradition of dozens of Mexican nationals suspected of crimes in the US. In January 2025, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/37-mexican-nationals-wanted-serious-crimes-transferred-united-states-mexico-including\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">37 people</a> were sent to the US. In April and August, groups of <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-department-justice-transfers-13-mexican-nationals-drug-convictions-mexico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">13</a> and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-department-justice-transfers-14-mexican-nationals-drug-convictions-mexico\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">14</a> suspects were transferred, respectively.</p><p>Sunday’s capture and killing of El Mencho was the fulfilment of a decades-long goal for the Mexican government, which has long sought his arrest.</p><p>Still, on Monday, Trump briefly posted a message on his Truth Social platform indicating that he expected Sheinbaum to do more.</p><p>“Mexico must step up their effort on Cartels and Drugs,” he wrote in a post that was later removed.</p><p>Sheinbaum, meanwhile, used Tuesday’s news conference to dismiss the criticism as out of touch with what was happening in Mexico. She added that what matters to her is the opinion of the Mexican people, not Musk.</p><p>“The vast majority of people recognise the work of the armed forces and the work we are doing every day, not only in security, but for the good of the country, for the wellbeing of all Mexicans,” she said. “That is what will guide us.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Paramount – which is run by David Ellison, son of United States President Donald Trump ally and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison – confirmed it had submitted the proposal, but neither company provided details about it. The company was widely expected to have raised its offer.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>A WBD buyout would reshape Hollywood and the wider media landscape, bringing HBO Max, cult-favourite titles like Harry Potter and, depending on who wins the Netflix vs Paramount tug-of-war, potentially even CNN under a new roof.</p><p>Paramount wants to acquire Warner Bros in its entirety, including networks like CNN and Discovery, and went straight to shareholders with an all-cash, $77.9bn hostile offer just days after the Netflix deal was announced in December. Accounting for debt, that bid offered Warner stakeholders $30 per share, amounting to an enterprise value of about $108bn.</p><p>Paramount maintained on Tuesday that its tender offer remains on the table while Warner evaluates its latest proposal.</p><p>Netflix wants to buy only Warner’s studio and streaming business for $72bn in cash, or about $83bn including debt. Warner’s board has repeatedly backed this deal and on Tuesday maintained that its agreement with Netflix still stands.</p><p>Warner shareholders are to vote on the Netflix proposal on March 20.</p><p>If Warner’s board changes course and considers Paramount’s latest offer superior, Netflix would have a chance to match or revise its proposal, potentially setting the stage for a new bidding war. It could also choose to walk away.</p><h2 id=\"further-consolidation\">Further consolidation</h2><p>Paramount, Warner and Netflix have spent the last couple of months in a heated back and forth over who has the stronger deal. But along the way, lawmakers and entertainment trade groups have sounded the alarm, warning that either buyout of all or parts of Warner’s business would only further consolidate power in an industry already run by just a few major players. Critics said that could result in job losses, less diversity in filmmaking and potentially more headaches for consumers who are facing rising costs of streaming subscriptions as is.</p><p>Combined, that raises tremendous antitrust concerns – and a Warner sale could come down to who gets the regulatory greenlight. The US Department of Justice has already initiated reviews, and other countries are expected to do so too.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Both Paramount and Netflix have argued that their proposals are good for consumers and the wider industry. And the companies have taken aim at each other publicly with regulatory arguments.</p><p>Paramount has pointed to Netflix’s much larger market value, and it has argued that if the streaming giant acquires Warner, it would only give it more dominance in the subscription video-on-demand space. But Netflix is trying to persuade regulators that it’s up against broader video libraries, particularly Google’s YouTube, America’s most-watched TV distributor.</p><p>Paramount’s bid will create a studio bigger than market leader Disney and fuse two major TV operators, which some Democratic senators said would control “almost everything Americans watch on TV”.</p><p>It will also hand control of CNN to the conservative-leaning Ellisons, soon after they acquired CBS News and installed as its editor-in-chief <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bari Weiss</a>, a right-leaning opinion editor who had no prior TV experience. The network settled for $16m a lawsuit that Trump had filed, accusing CBS’s 60 Minutes programme of editing an interview with Kamala Harris to his 2024 presidential election rival’s advantage. It also appointed Kenneth Weinstein, a former Trump administration official, as ombudsman to investigate allegations of bias.</p><p>In December, <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/paramounts-warner-bros-discovery-bid-faces-conflict-of-interest-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ellison visited</a> the White House, media reports said, and told Trump that Paramount would execute “sweeping changes” if it acquired CNN’s parent company.</p><p>More recently, Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/116111073840858395\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demanded that Netflix fire</a> former US National Security Adviser Susan Rice from its board. Rice, a Black woman, had served under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, both Democrats.</p><p>“This is a business deal. It’s not a political deal,” Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos told BBC Radio 4’s flagship Today programme on Monday. “This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the US and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.”</p><p>Trump previously made unprecedented suggestions about his involvement in seeing a deal through before walking back those statements and maintaining that regulatory approval will be up to the Justice Department.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It reveals a decades-old refugee story in which Arabic blends with Somali and the faces harbour memories of a different place, across the sea.</p><p>Residents know the area by several names, including “Yemen’s Mogadishu” and “the Somalis’ neighbourhood” – a reference to the demographic shift it has seen since the 1990s, when civil war in Somalia pushed thousands of families across the Gulf of Aden in search of safety.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Today, local sources estimate the district’s population at more than 40,000, with people of Somali origin making up the majority. They live in harsh conditions where economic vulnerability overlaps with an unresolved legal status.</p><p>Some arrived as children holding the hands of relatives, while others were born in Aden and have known no other home. But they all share one thing in common: the refugee label stamped on their official documents.</p><h2><strong>Harsh living conditions</strong></h2><p>As dawn breaks, dozens of men gather at the entrances of the area’s main streets, waiting to be picked up to do a day’s work in construction or manual labour. Many depend on this fragile pattern of employment to put <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/yemen-faces-worst-food-crisis-since-2022-aid-group-warns\">food on the table</a>.</p><p>Residents say the lack of regular work has become the defining feature of life in al-Basateen, as extreme poverty spreads and humanitarian aid declines.</p><p>Ashour Hassan, a resident in his mid-30s, waiting at a main road junction for someone to hire him to wash a car, told Al Jazeera that he earns between 3,000 and 4,000 Yemeni rials a day (less than $3). That amount is not enough to cover the needs of his family, which lives in a single room in a neighbourhood lacking basic services, surrounded by dirt roads and piles of rubbish.</p><p>In a voice mixed with fatigue and despair, Ashour summed up life in al-Basateen: “We live day to day. If we find work, we eat. If we don’t, we wait without food until tomorrow.”</p><p>Families in al-Basateen typically rely on both men and women to be breadwinners.</p><p>Some women work cleaning homes, while others run small businesses, such as selling bread and traditional foods that blend Yemeni and Somali flavours, and which become especially popular during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.</p><p>Many children also find themselves pushed into work despite their age. One of the main jobs for children involves sifting through waste for materials they can sell, such as plastic or scrap metal, to help support their families.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4335792\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4335792\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4335792\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_699df09cb5-1771958428.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ADEN, YEMEN - AUGUST 2010: Busy market scenes in the Al-Basateen urban refugee area, Aden, Yemen, August 11, 2010. Many of these people are part of the 80 000 refugees who arrive in Yemen on an annual basis from the failed state of Somalia. The Al-Basateen urban refugee area houses more than 40 000 people, most of whom are refugees.

A deeper feeling of what many here call “suspended belonging” hangs over them, with the first generation of refugees still carrying memories of a distant homeland and speaking its language, while the second and third generations know only Aden and speak Arabic in the local dialect, with Somalia only known through family stories.</p><p>Fatima Jame embodies this paradox. A mother of four, she was born in Aden to Somali parents. She told Al Jazeera: “We know no country other than Yemen. We studied here and got married here, but we do not have Yemeni identity, and in front of the law, we are still refugees.”</p><p>Fatima lives with her family in a modest two-room home. Her husband works as a porter in one of the city’s markets, while she helps support the family by preparing and selling traditional foods. Even so, she says their combined income “barely covers rent and food” because of the high cost of living and few job opportunities.</p><h2 id=\"a-bleak-reality\">A bleak reality</h2><p>Conditions in Yemen were never the best for migrants and refugees, but they have significantly worsened since a <a href=\"/gallery/2022/3/22/photos-yemen-7-years-of-war-7-things-that-changed-for-7-people\">civil war</a> began in 2014 between the Iranian-backed Houthis and the central government in Sanaa, in Yemen’s north.</p><p>The violence from that war, along with declining aid and shrinking job opportunities have increased pressure on both host communities and refugees.</p><p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that funding for support programmes in Yemen in 2025 met only 25 percent of the country’s actual needs, directly affecting the lives of thousands of families. Residents of al-Basateen say the aid they used to receive has sharply declined, and in many cases has stopped altogether.</p><p>Youssef Mohammed, 53, says he was one of the first Somali arrivals to the district in the 1990s, and now supports a family of seven.</p><p>“[We] have not received any support from organisations for years,” Youssef said, adding that some families “chose to return to Somalia rather than stay and die of hunger here”.</p><p>He believes the crisis affects everyone in Yemen, “but [that] the refugee remains the weakest link.”</p><p>Despite the bleak picture, a few have managed to improve their material conditions through education or by opening small businesses that have helped stimulate the local economy. But they remain an exception, and the flow of refugees continues.</p><p>Yemen is the poorest country in the Arabian Peninsula, but is also the region’s only signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, and therefore allows foreign arrivals to apply for asylum or refugee status. According to the United Nations refugee agency, Yemen hosted more than 61,000 asylum seekers and refugees as of July 2025, the vast majority from Somalia and Ethiopia.</p><p>Arrivals in recent years have typically travelled to Yemen <a href=\"/news/2025/8/3/more-than-50-refugees-and-migrants-die-in-boat-sinking-off-yemeni-coast\">via boats</a>, with many planning to use Yemen as a transit point before moving on to richer countries like Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Hussein Adel is one of those recent arrivals. He is 30, but leans on a crutch on a street corner in al-Basateen.</p><p>Hussein arrived in Aden only a few months ago, having made the dangerous journey on a small boat carrying African migrants.</p><p>He told Al Jazeera that he fled death and hunger, only to find himself facing a harsher reality. Hussein shelters on the rooftop of a relative’s home and spends his days searching the city for occasional work. His leg injury, he said, was caused by Omani border guards who shot him while he was crossing into Yemen.</p><p>As evening falls, the noise in al-Basateen’s alleyways quiets down. Men lean against the walls of worn-out homes, and children chase a ball through narrow passages barely wide enough for their dreams.</p><p>On the surface, life looks normal – like any working-class neighbourhood in a city exhausted by crises. But here, in “Yemen’s Mogadishu”, there is an extra trauma – the sense of a lack of belonging, the memory of refugees fleeing danger and poverty at home, and a lack of stability that will not go away.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
