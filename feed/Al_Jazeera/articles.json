The new deal, analysts noted, could give India an edge in several sectors, including textiles, pharmaceuticals, machinery, steel, petroleum products and electrical equipment.</p><p>Overall, the EU is giving India access to 144 services subsectors while India is opening 102 subsectors to the EU, including in the financial, maritime and telecommunications industries.</p><p>On Tuesday, Modi told Indian workers and industry leaders in sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery that “the agreement will prove very helpful for you,” adding that it will not only boost manufacturing in India but will also expand India’s services sector.</p><p>“This free trade agreement will strengthen confidence in India for every business and every investor in the world. India is working extensively on global partnerships in all sectors,” Modi said.</p><p>The final draft of the trade agreement must still pass legal scrutiny in Brussels and New Delhi and may only become operational next year, said Biswajit Dhar, a trade economist who has been involved with multiple Indian trade negotiations.</p><p>Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat who has dealt with regional trading blocs, described the trade deal as “excellent, providing professional market access while taking care of the bureaucratic labyrinth of the EU”.</p><p>“Unlike 20 years ago, today India has the capacity to work together with the Europeans and provides a good market for them,” Trigunayat said. “There will be much more to look into other than cheaper wines or BMWs, including trade investments.”</p><p>“It’s a very significant deal for both India and the EU,” Dhar told Al Jazeera, “and a major step towards consolidating India’s trade and economic relations with its largest trade partner.”</p><p>Crucially, Dhar said, this deal represents an opportunity for both sides to “diversify and look beyond the US and grow beyond their dependence on the American market”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4268474\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268474\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4268474\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-27T090700Z_25585653_RC2VWIA1A5UM_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-AUTO-STOCKS-1769506214.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C509&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"bmw india\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4268474\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cars made by Germany-based BMW, on sale in Mumbai, are now subject to high Indian tariffs, but those duties will fall dramatically under the trade pact [File: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-india-opening-its-much-protected-automobile-industry\">Is India opening its much-protected automobile industry?</h2><p>India has been criticised in the past for its protectionist approach to the automobile sector, including by Tesla owner Elon Musk.

Cars costing more than this will be divided into three categories, each with quotas and separate tariffs.</p><p>Electric vehicles, however, will be excluded from import duty reductions for the first five years to protect investments by domestic Indian electric car manufacturers.</p><p>After that, imports from the EU will be restricted to 160,000 internal combustion engines and 90,000 electric vehicles per year.</p><p>Despite these safeguards, shares in Indian carmakers dipped by about 1.6 percent after the announcement of the trade deal.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4268485\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268485\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4268485\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-26T074224Z_704819240_RC2T8JA45FXW_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-REPUBLICDAY-1769506351.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ursula von der Leyen\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4268485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Modi, von der Leyen and Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh attend the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on January 26, 2026 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-will-the-deal-benefit-the-eu\">How will the deal benefit the EU?</h2><p>Indian tariffs on 30 percent of goods imported from the EU will fall to zero immediately.</p><p>Overall, tariffs on 96.6 percent of EU goods exports to India will be eliminated or reduced, EU officials said.

Under the deal as it stands, India would be allowed to export 1.6 million tonnes of steel to the EU duty-free, but this is only about half what it exports annually at present.</p><p>The EU has not granted India an exemption from its carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which taxes “carbon-intensive” goods – those that require large amounts of energy to produce, such as steel, cement, fertiliser and electricity.</p><p>Only countries that are associated with the EU, such as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland are exempt from these due to their participation in the EU emissions trading system or related agreements. Countries whose emissions-trading systems are linked directly to the EU’s, such as Switzerland, are also exempt.</p><p>However, India will be able to negotiate this if the EU grants flexibility to another country.</p><h2 id=\"how-significant-is-india-eu-trade-now\">How significant is India-EU trade now?</h2><p>The US remains the biggest overall trading partner for both India and the EU.</p><p>However, over the past decade, goods trade between India and the EU has grown substantially, rising from about $74bn in 2020 to $136bn in 2024-2025, making the EU India’s largest goods trading partner.</p><p>India has a favourable trade surplus with the EU of more than $15bn as its exports of $75.85bn outpace imports of $60.68bn.</p><p>EU exports are heavy on machinery, transport equipment and chemicals while India mostly exports chemicals, base metals, mineral products and textiles.</p><p>The two sides hope to increase that to about $200bn by 2030.</p><p>From 2019 to 2024, India-EU trade in services also grew with Indian exports rising from $22.5bn to $44bn while EU exports increased from about $17bn to $34bn. The two mainly trade in business consulting and IT services.</p><p>India is the EU’s ninth largest trading partner, accounting for 2.4 percent of its total trade, compared with 17.3 percent for the US and 14.6 percent for China.</p><p>As of 2024, 931,607 Indians resided in the EU, according to the Indian government.

Half of that is punishment for India’s continued purchase of Russian crude oil, which White House officials said is financing the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>EU tensions with the Trump administration have been building as well, particularly over Trump’s insistence that the US be allowed to buy Greenland, which is a territory of EU member Denmark.</p><p>This month, Trump threatened additional tariffs of 10 percent – rising to 25 percent in June – against eight European countries that had objected to Trump’s demand to buy Greenland. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stated that the island, which is politically part of Europe but is geographically located in North America, is not for sale.</p><p>However, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Trump walked back this threat and said he would not impose tariffs. Instead, he said, constructive talks had laid the basis for a framework of an agreement over Greenland.</p><p>The EU is still subject to up to 15 percent tariffs by the US under an EU-US trade deal signed last year.</p><p>Experts said the finalisation of the India-EU trade agreement has been expedited, in part, in response to this pressure from the Trump administration.</p><p><span>“The global trade disruptions have become a norm, and there is an urgent necessity for both [India and the EU] to provide a certain degree of certainty to their businesses,” Dhar said. “The US is mired in uncertainty, and one just doesn’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”</span></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-will-the-us-react-to-the-india-eu-trade-deal\">How will the US react to the India-EU trade deal?</h2><p>The White House has already criticised the agreement.</p><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent lashed out at the EU over the pact with New Delhi. “We have put 25 percent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,” Bessent told ABC News on Sunday.</p><p>“They [the Europeans] are financing the war against themselves,” he added.</p><p>While the EU <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/28/eu-and-us-announce-deal-a-breakdown-of-the-trade-agreement\">signed a trade deal</a> with the US fairly quickly after Trump announced his <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\">trade war</a> last year, New Delhi is still trying to negotiate one with Washington. It is also seeking to diversify trade to other parts of the world.</p><p>“India has taken a policy of strategic patience [in dealing with Trump’s trade war],” Trigunayat said. “The deal with the EU is part of the same process to cushion the impact and find new partners.”</p><p>Harsh Pant, vice president of the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, told Al Jazeera: “You have two big economic players coming together, which is a signal to the US that they are willing to move forward with their own agenda.”</p><p>“There is a quite extraordinary geopolitical realignment between India and the EU,” Pant said. “The Trump effect has accelerated the process of this convergence, and we are going to see more strategic engagement between the two.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Now US President Donald Trump wants to create a new organisation, a “<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2026/01/21/the-world-needs-stronger-un-not-trump-led-board-of-peace\">Board of Peace</a>” with himself as lifetime chairman.  While many countries were invited, those signing up appear to be a rogues’ gallery of leaders and governments with human rights records ranging from questionable to appalling.</p><p>The United States played a central role in establishing the UN in 1945 to prevent a repeat of the crimes against humanity and genocide during World War II. Ever wary of perceived threats to its autonomy, the US has always had a love-hate relationship with the UN. But the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/16/how-save-un-trump\">emphasised</a> the hate and dispensed with the love, denouncing what it perceives as “anti-American” and “hostile agendas.”</p><p>The administration has <a href=\"https://x.com/loucharbon/status/2009336871902695752?s=20\">disregarded and defunded</a> dozens of lifesaving UN programs. It has also withheld much of the  assessed contributions, which member states are obligated to pay. The administration has pulled out of the UN World Health Organization, UN climate bodies, and international climate agreements, and stopped funding the UN population fund, which supports and protects women and girls in armed conflicts and crisis zones.</p><p>US negotiators have <a href=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20260118/p2g/00m/0op/018000c\">pushed</a> Trump’s ideological agenda in UN negotiations, demanding the removal of selected human rights language from resolutions and statements. According to UN diplomats, targeted language includes words like “gender,” “diversity” and “climate” because the Trump administration views them as “woke” or politically correct. While the administration has had some success with its ideological campaign in the UN Security Council thanks to its veto power, it has been less successful in the General Assembly, where the US is just one of 193 voting members and has no veto.</p><p>But it is the Security Council that the administration appears determined to recreate in a Trumpian form. The Board of Peace’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-board-of-peace-charter-full-text\">charter</a> describes it as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”</p><p>The charter doesn’t mention human rights, which is doubtless music to the ears of the Russian and Chinese governments, which have <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/06/un-needs-protect-its-vital-yet-underfunded-human-rights-work\">worked for years to de-emphasize human rights</a> at the UN.</p><p>Trump’s board appears to be a kind of pay-to-play, global club, judging from the $1 billion fee for permanent membership. With several notorious human rights abusers and leaders implicated in war crimes – and few countervailing voices – it is hard to imagine this body giving priority to ending suffering, hatred and bloodshed, as Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2026/01/president-trump-ratifies-board-of-peace-in-historic-ceremony-opening-path-to-hope-and-dignity-for-gazans/\">declared</a> at the launch event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. Among those Trump has invited to join are two who are subject to International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity – Russian President <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/trump-asks-putin-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-even-as-ukraine-war-rages\">Vladimir Putin</a> and Israeli <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. Trump has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">invited leaders of other countries</a> with appalling human rights records to join his board: From China and Belarus to Kazakhstan.</p><p>The charter makes clear that Trump as board chairman would have supreme authority “to adopt resolutions or other directives” as he sees fit.</p><p>So far, the only European Union members that agreed to join are Hungary and Bulgaria. Hungary’s far-right populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long been a Trump supporter. French President Emmanuel Macron is among those who turned down an offer to join – Trump responded with a threat to significantly increase tariffs on French wine and champagne.</p><p>Trump also offered Canada a permanent seat on the board. But he <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/trump-revokes-canadas-invitation-to-join-board-of-peace\">withdrew</a> the offer after  Prime Minister Mark Carney’s <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/davos-2026-special-address-by-mark-carney-prime-minister-of-canada/\">speech</a> in Davos. Without naming Trump or the US, Carney said the UN and other multilateral organisations are under threat, and sharply criticised great powers’ use of economic coercion against smaller countries. Carney urged middle powers to band together and resist great power bullying.</p><p>Originally the Board of Peace was meant to oversee the administration of Gaza following over two years of onslaught and destruction by Israeli forces that left at least 70,000 Palestinians dead, with which the US was complicit. The board’s charter doesn’t mention Gaza. But Gaza was the focus of a side event at Davos led by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kushner will be a member of the “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/trump-names-tony-blair-jared-kushner-to-gaza-board-of-peace\">Gaza Executive Board</a>,” a subsidiary body of the Board of Peace.</p><p>Kushner offered a surreal vision of a “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/imperial-agenda-whats-trumps-gaza-development-plan-unveiled-in-davos\">New Gaza</a>” complete with glistening office towers and pristine beaches packed with tourists. The Gaza Executive Board includes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vx7kn33elo\">no Palestinians</a> but has former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Trump negotiator Steve Witkoff, and senior officials from Türkiye and Qatar.</p><p>Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks, governments should work together to protect the UN and other institutions established to uphold international human rights and  humanitarian law, the global rule of law, and accountability. They should use all available resources to counter unjust US actions like Trump’s sanctions on ICC judges and prosecutors, a UN special rapporteur, and prominent Palestinian human rights groups. They should press for accountability for grave international crimes by all warring parties, whether in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, Myanmar, or elsewhere.</p><p>Anything less would hand Trump a dangerous victory and allow him and his board to sideline the UN and other vital international organizations. The UN has its problems, including when it comes to upholding human rights. But it’s worth strengthening, not replacing with a club of rights abusers and alleged war criminals.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks.</p><p>The plaintiff is a 19-year-old woman from California, identified as KGM, who said she became addicted to the companies’ platforms at a young age. Importantly, she claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits.</p><p>She alleges the apps fueled her depression and suicidal thoughts and is seeking to hold the companies liable. Her lawsuit is the first of several cases expected to go to trial this year that centre on what the plaintiffs call “social media addiction” among children.</p><p>“Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,” the lawsuit says.</p><p>Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions of dollars in healthcare costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.</p><p>This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies’ First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.</p><p>The tech companies have hired lawyers who have represented corporations in high-profile litigation involving addiction.</p><p>They dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevvy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.</p><p>Since at least 2018, Meta has sponsored parent workshops about teen online safety at dozens of high schools across the US. TikTok also sponsored similar gatherings and offered tutorials on features for parents, including the option to limit screen time at night.</p><p>Julie Scelfo, founder of Mothers Against Media Addiction – which supports smartphone bans in schools – told the news agency Reuters that the tech companies were “using every lever of influence that you can imagine”.</p><p>“It can be very confusing for parents who to trust,” she added.</p><p>France’s lower house on Monday voted in favour of banning children aged below 15 years from ‍social media. The legislation will now go to the Senate before a final vote in the lower house.</p><p>Australia in December became the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/australias-social-media-ban-for-young-people-takes-effect\">first country to ban children aged below 16</a> on social media platforms.

And yes, this is a general pattern that applies to other countries, too, though Japan has an especially high level of debt, making its position more vulnerable.”</p><p>Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio already exceeds 230 percent, following decades of deficit spending by governments aiming to reverse the country’s long-term economic stagnation.</p><p>The East Asian country’s debt burden stands far above that of peers such as the US, UK and France, whose debt-to-GDP ratios are about 125 percent, 115 percent and 101 percent, respectively.</p><p>At the same time, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been scaling back bond purchases as part of its move away from decades of ultra-low interest rates, limiting its options for interventions to bring yields down.</p><p>“Bond investors reacted because her headline package looks like large, near-term fiscal loosening at exactly the moment the BOJ is trying to normalise policy,” Sayuri Shirai, a professor of economics at Keio University in Tokyo, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-all-this-affect-the-rest-of-the-world\">How does all this affect the rest of the world?</h2><p>The sell-off in Japanese bonds reverberated through markets overseas, with yields on 30-year US Treasuries rising to their highest level since September.</p><p>As Japanese bond yields rise, local investors are able to earn higher interest payments at home.</p><p>That can incentivise investors to offload other bonds, such as US Treasuries.</p><p>As of November, Japanese investors held $1.2 trillion in US Treasuries, more than any other foreign group of buyers.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed concern about the impact of Japan’s bond market on US Treasury prices and said he anticipated that his Japanese counterparts would “begin saying the things that will calm the market down.”</p><p>Japan’s long-term bond yields fell on Monday amid the expectations that Japanese and US authorities would step in to prop up the yen.</p><p>On Friday, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had inquired about the cost of exchanging the Japanese currency for US dollars.</p><p>“Japan matters globally through flows. If Japanese government bond yields rise, Japanese investors can earn more at home, potentially reducing demand for foreign bonds; that can nudge global yields and risk pricing,” Shirai said.</p><p>“This is why global-market pieces have framed Japan’s bond move as a wider rates story.”</p><p>Higher bond yields in Japan, the US and elsewhere raise the cost of borrowing and servicing the national debt.</p><p>In a worst-case scenario, a sharp escalation in interest rates can lead to a country defaulting on its debts.</p><p>Masahiko Loo, a fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management in Tokyo, said that the reaction of international investors to Takaichi’s plans reflects growing sensitivity to fiscal credibility in highly indebted economies.</p><p>“Yes, Japan may be the spark, but the warning applies equally to the US and others with large structural deficits,” Loo told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"is-japan-on-the-verge-of-a-financial-crisis\">Is Japan on the verge of a financial crisis?</h2><p>Probably not.</p><p>While Japan is more indebted than its peers, its fiscal position is more sustainable than it might appear due to factors specific to the country – at least in the short to medium term – according to economists.</p><p>The vast majority of Japan’s debt is held by local institutions and denominated in yen, reducing the likelihood of a panic induced by foreign investors, while interest rates are far lower than in other economies.</p><p>“The debt situation is more manageable than a lot of people think,” Thomas Mathews, head of markets for Asia Pacific at Capital Economics, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Net debt-to-GDP is on a downward trajectory, and Japan’s budget deficit isn’t all that big by global standards.”</p><p>Loo of State Street Investment Management said that the turmoil surrounding Japan had more to do with a “communication gap around fiscal sustainability and policy coordination” than the country’s solvency.</p><p>“That said, markets are likely to continue testing the feasibility of the agenda, as even fiscally sanguine countries have, at times, been disciplined by market forces,” Loo said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He explained that approaching the cemetery was impossible, as tanks enforced a deadly perimeter, firing at anything that moved.</p><p>From his position near the “Yellow Line”, Israel’s self-proclaimed buffer zone inside Gaza, al-Rifi described a “wall of fire” created by artillery and helicopters to protect the engineering units. Inside this sealed zone, witnesses and video footage obtained later revealed that the forces spent two days churning up the earth.</p><p>“They dug up about 200 graves,” al-Rifi said. “They pulled the martyrs out, tested them one by one until they found the [Israeli] body.”</p><p>The disparity was most evident in the aftermath. Gvili’s remains were airlifted for dignified burial in Israel.

He highlighted the “fatal injustice” of an international community that mobilised resources for Israeli captives while blocking the entry of heavy civil defence equipment needed to recover Palestinian victims.</p><p>Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, told Al Jazeera on Monday that while he respects the right of any family to bury their dead, the contrast is inescapable. “The lack of equal treatment, the lack of respect to Palestinians as equal human beings, is really astonishing,” he noted.</p><h2 id=\"a-cost-paid-in-blood\">A cost paid in blood</h2><p>The dark irony of this Israeli mission is that it created new victims.

The conclusion of his protest brings an end to a rolling hunger strike that began in November.</p><p>Khalid is among eight remand prisoners affiliated with Palestine Action who participated in the protest, which is said to have been the largest coordinated hunger strike in the United Kingdom’s history since 1981, when Irish Republican inmates were led by Bobby Sands and 10 hunger strikers, including Sands, starved to death in protest against British policies towards political prisoners and Northern Ireland.</p><p>Palestine Action’s Khalid was the last to keep refusing food after the others ended their hunger strikes earlier this month, claiming <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/prison-rights-elbits-loss-how-the-palestine-action-hunger-strike-won\">victory.</a></p><p>“At the hospital … I was given a choice between treatment and likely death within the next 24 hours due to kidney failure, acute liver failure, and potential cardiac arrest,” said Khalid, in a statement shared by the Prisoners for Palestine group, which is supporting the collective. He said that he decided to end his protest because, “I am too strong, too loud, too powerful … and there is so much we can do to affect change.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4244170\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4244170\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4244170\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/s2-1768556877.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Jon Cink, Kamran Ahmed, Qesser Zuhrah, Lewie, Teuta Hoxha and Umer Khalid\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4244170\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Top row from left: Amu Gib, Heba Muraisi, Jon Cink and Kamran Ahmed.

There are also fears around refeeding, which can be fatal if mismanaged.</p><p>James Smith, an emergency doctor, said he was worried because Khalid was discharged from the critical care unit “rather promptly”.</p><p>“The heightened period of risk … is the moment you end a hunger strike,” said Smith. “Access to medical care in the prison system has been demonstrated to be substandard.”</p><p>Prisoners for Palestine said prison officials “managed his refeeding by giving him protein shakes and biscuits, which is highly dangerous”.</p><h2 id=\"we-were-fearful-for-umer-s-health-and-life\">‘We were fearful for Umer’s health and life’</h2><p>Khalid is among five activists accused of breaking into the United Kingdom’s largest airbase, RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, in June and spray-painting two Voyager refuelling and transport planes. They deny the charges against them.</p><p>The incident, which was claimed by Palestine Action, caused millions of pounds worth of damage, according to the British government, which later proscribed the protest group as a “terrorist” organisation.</p><p>Khalid had called for immediate bail; an end to alleged censorship in prison, with the authorities accused of withholding mails, calls and books and denying visitation rights; an inquiry into alleged involvement of the UK in Israeli military operations in Gaza; and the release of surveillance footage from Royal Air Force (RAF) spy flights that flew over Gaza on April 1, 2024, when British aid workers were killed in an Israeli attack.</p><p>A Prison Service spokesperson told Al Jazeera, “We do not recognise these claims. All prisoners are subject to the same national rules on post and communications, and legal visits and access to legal paperwork are never withheld from prisoners.”</p><p>But Prisoners for Palestine claimed that there were concessions, saying Khalid had met with the prison governor and has recently received previously withheld mail and clothes.</p><p>John McDonnell, a Labour MP, said the end of Khalid’s strike brought a sense of relief.</p><p class=\"p2\">“We were fearful for Umer’s health and life,” he said. “It demonstrated to me the absolute courage that he’s displayed along with others, based upon a commitment to the principles that he’s advocated in terms of peace and justice to the Palestinian people.</p><p class=\"p2\">“I pay tribute to them, but I fear for their ongoing health – being on hunger strike for this long can have permanent features.”</p><p>In recent days, dozens of demonstrators have gathered at the gates of Wormwood Scrubs, calling on the government to engage with Khalid’s demands.</p><p>On Saturday, police arrested 86 protesters, saying they allegedly blocked prison staff from entering and leaving the facility. Some “managed to get inside a staff entrance area of a prison building”, the police said.</p><p>Described by friends and family as gentle, determined and a devout Muslim, Khalid told Al Jazeera last week that his strike “reflects the severity of my demands”.</p><p>Khalid’s trial date is set for January 2027, by which time he would have spent a year and a half in prison – far beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p></div></div></body></html>"
