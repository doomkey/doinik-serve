He stressed that these children did not die merely from the cold but also because a “man-made shortage” of food and medicine has left them with zero resilience.</p><p>“Children aged two or three have severely weakened immune systems,” Elder told Al Jazeera, describing the situation as “extreme misery”.</p><p>“We are talking about layers upon layers of rejection [of aid],” he added, noting that Israel continues to block the entry of cooking gas and fuel needed for heating, leaving families defenceless against winds that weather experts said exceeded 100 kilometres per hour (60 miles per hour).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>‘Expendable lives’</strong></h2><p>When asked about the lack of humanitarian response and Israel’s move to cut ties with UN agencies during such a crisis, Albanese was blunt.</p><p>“Israel generally does not care about Palestinian lives. On the contrary, it finds them expendable and [believes they] can be destroyed,” she said.</p><p>She argued that the international community is complicit by focusing on other global conflicts while ignoring the “genocide” that has left Gaza’s population exposed to the elements without homes, electricity or drainage systems.</p><p>“What more do we need to see? What have we not seen yet?” she asked.</p><h2><strong>Call for arms embargo</strong></h2><p>Albanese insisted that sending aid, which is often blocked, is no longer a sufficient response to such catastrophes. She called for immediate punitive measures against Israel to force a change in its policy.</p><p>“States must cut trade ties, impose an embargo on arms exports and stop normal dealings with Israel,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She emphasised that the “starting point” for any solution must be the International Court of Justice advisory opinion ordering the dismantling of the occupation rather than political plans that ignore the reality on the ground.</p><h2><strong>‘Winds like a tropical storm’</strong></h2><p>The vulnerability of the population was highlighted by Khaled Saleh, a senior weather presenter at Al Jazeera.</p><p>He explained that the depression brought polar winds reaching speeds typically associated with tropical storms.</p><p>“These winds can uproot trees, … so imagine what they do to worn-out tents,” Saleh said, noting that the lack of infrastructure meant water had nowhere to go but into the shelters of displaced Palestinians.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But as many, many Jews are now saying, what the Israeli government is doing now, what has been perpetrated on the Palestinian people since <a href=\"/news/2022/5/15/nakba-mapping-palestinian-villages-destroyed-by-israel-in-1948\">1948</a>, was never a just or wise solution. The UK is <a href=\"https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2017/balfour-masterminds/index.html\">deeply implicated</a> in those historical events.</p><p>I read Edward Said and other Palestinian writers, and I read Israeli writers … I’m concerned with the safety and security of Israeli citizens, too. The brutality lashed out against Gaza and the occupied territories serves nobody in the region.</p><p>As for careers, my career – I honestly feel that if people don’t want to work with me because they don’t like what I’m saying about this, then I don’t think I want to work with them. And if they’re going to punish me for my belief system, then I probably don’t belong there. And most importantly, I don’t think my career is more important than the lives of Palestinian children. I really, really don’t.</p><p>And when I come to the end of my life, whenever that is, I want to be able to look back at my life and say I hope I did the right thing at the right time.</p><p>Of course, I want to go on working as an actor; I love the work. And I need my platform and my profile to be able to be effective – that’s important, too. But I haven’t yet felt that I’ve been penalised for activism – I’ve never worked as hard or as much as I did last year. So I’m optimistic that there are enough people in the industry who don’t want to punish me for this, and who feel the same.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: How do you characterise the muted response to the genocide in Gaza from usually outspoken characters in the arts or feminists who speak up about oppression in other regions of the world?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> I’m painfully disappointed by the silence in my industry, by the silence everywhere. I’m dismayed by how people are allowing the bullying into silence to be effective – by their yielding to that power. At this point in the genocide, silence is not a passive act. It’s active – it’s a decision to collude.</p><p>We look back at Germany at the time of the Holocaust, and we harshly judge those who didn’t speak out against that barbarism, and we admire those who did. But what about the current genocide? Why do we so often look back at history and assess it in that way, but we don’t bring those judgements to bear on the world we’re living in now?</p><p>I do wish more leading figures in the arts, and more arts and cultural institutions, would engage with what is happening in Palestine and use their voices and influence. It’s our job, isn’t it, to reflect the human condition, human experience? If we’re not doing that in relation to the genocide, then I don’t know what we are doing, really.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Several British actors over the years, yourself included and Vanessa Redgrave, have criticised Israeli policy that disregards Palestinian rights. Has the space for speaking up become more restrictive in recent years?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> I’d like to acknowledge Vanessa’s astonishing legacy of always speaking out and always fighting for human rights. She’s been a really inspiring person in our industry doing that. And I would also like to acknowledge the voice and the actions of many young people in my industry now – not famous or with high profile, but who are really engaged and tirelessly support the Stop the War movement, and who call for humanity and action. It takes bravery – as it does in <a href=\"/news/2024/3/11/hollywood-stars-wear-red-pin-badges-at-the-oscars-what-does-it-mean\">Hollywood</a>, where a few have stood up and spoken out. I’m so grateful that they found the courage. … But most people have not.</p><p>There was a great wave of public support that grew during last summer. My great fear now is that it’s subsiding again – the illusion of the <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/2/the-ceasefire-did-what-it-was-meant-to-do-make-gaza-invisible\">so-called “ceasefire”</a> has taken hold – when in fact there has been <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/israeli-quadcopter-kills-three-in-gazas-khan-younis-police-chief-slain\">no ceasefire</a> [and] much of the mainstream media colludes. There is, in addition, so much distraction in the news because of world events elsewhere …  and then of course there is the power of <a href=\"/video/money-works/2025/11/26/whats-the-price-tag-on-israels-propaganda-machine\">Israel’s propaganda machine</a>, which is immense and far-reaching.</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: What propels you to keep going?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> It’s vitally important to keep Palestine conscious in people’s minds – to sustain its presence in the media. To keep the movement for peace and justice alive and energised.</p><p>My values have shifted, my community of friendships has partly shifted, my work and general interests have shifted. Much has changed for me in relation to this. A lot of the people I spend time with now are people who are in this community, and who will not give up hope. My mantra in life is one that I adopted when I was very young – “Despair is a luxury we cannot afford.”</p><p><strong>Al Jazeera: Does your family join your activism?</strong></p><p><strong>Stevenson:</strong> My husband Hugh [Brody], though not religious, feels his Jewish identity very deeply. Our children identify as Jewish. And we have many Jewish friends, but all of them are appalled by what’s happening. Most of them would adhere strongly to those who are saying “<a href=\"/features/2023/10/23/not-in-my-name-the-european-jews-condemning-israels-war-on-gaza\">Not in my name</a>”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4235576\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4235576\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4235576\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8700-1768305299.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C434&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Courtesy Juliet Stevenson\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4235576\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Juliet Stevenson pictured with her husband, the writer and anthropologist Hugh Brody [Courtesy: Juliet Stevenson</figcaption></figure><p>This insistence by the government of Israel that to criticise Israel is anti-Semitic, this eliding of criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism, is not only ludicrous – what government in the world is beyond criticism? – but it’s very, very dangerous for Jewish people. Because if you say that criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, then it means that all Jews are somehow implicated in what Israel’s doing. Which is palpably very far from the truth – and feeds the real and abhorrent currents of genuine anti-Semitism in the world.</p><p>Hugh is a writer and an anthropologist, less inclined to be collective. But for a while now, he has gone on the Saturday marches and walked with the Holocaust group. He has committed to that community.</p><p>I am relieved and very strengthened by that and by the support of our children. It would be very painful and difficult if we were not of like mind in this.</p><p><em><strong>Note: This interview was lightly edited for brevity.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It’s very real. And it has no easy answers. Greenland’s autonomy, its future, hangs in the balance.</p><p>Greenland is a territory of Denmark. Since 2009, it’s been largely self-governing, and has the right to pursue independence at a time of its choosing. Independence is the wish of all its political parties. But with economic self-sufficiency some way off, it’s sticking with Denmark for now.</p><p>Not if United States President Donald Trump has his way. He wants Greenland for the US. Since the bombing of Venezuela and the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/how-the-us-attack-on-venezuela-abduction-of-maduro-unfolded\">abduction of President Nicolas Maduro</a>, realisation has dawned that he is deadly serious about this. The White House has pointedly <a href=\"/news/2026/1/10/what-are-potential-hard-ways-trump-could-try-to-take-greenland\">refused to take military force off</a> the table, although the real estate mogul-turned-president would likely prefer a simple cash deal.</p><p>Europe is in diplomatic crisis mode. Denmark is a NATO member. The idea of NATO’s chief guarantor – the US – annexing territory from a member state seemed preposterous until recently. No longer.</p><p>So what can Denmark’s friends do to stop it?</p><p>The uncomfortable truth is that if Donald Trump sends in troops, Greenland would likely fall in days, perhaps hours. Trump has mocked Denmark’s forces there as “two dogsleds”. And though this doesn’t meet any truth test, his point holds. Greenland is sparsely defended. Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command in Greenland consists of a handful of warships and search and rescue teams.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, already has a major base in northwestern Greenland, under a 1951 pact that also allows Washington to set up more bases on the island. Nearly 650 personnel are stationed at the base, including US Air Force and Space Force members.</p><p>Copenhagen is tooling up. It has announced $4.2bn in extra defence spending for the Arctic. And it is buying 16 more F-35 fighter jets (from, of course, the US). But even so, Denmark would have little chance against the full might of the US military.</p><p>So a diplomatic united front has been launched. As with other Trump-created crises, Europe’s leaders are adopting an approach that could be called transatlantic judo. Like judo wrestlers, they’re trying to redirect Trump’s energy – his strident, America First unilateralism – and persuade him that the best expression of this is collegiate, transatlantic multilaterism.</p><p>Essentially, they’re saying, “Yes, Donald. You’re absolutely right to raise Arctic security as a big problem. We totally agree. While we’re not sure that invading Greenland is the answer, NATO is the solution.”</p><p>We’ve heard this message from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in recent days. And the British and German governments have both suggested NATO forces be deployed to Greenland to boost Arctic security. A German delegation was in Washington, DC, before Wednesday’s meeting between State Secretary Marco Rubio and the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers.</p><p>While the Europeans try their judo, Donald Trump’s approach is more sumo. Wielding the great geopolitical heft of the US, the president is unyielding. To all entreaties from bewildered Europeans, he remains unmoved.</p><p>When they say he can have all the US military presence on Greenland that he wants under the 1951 treaty with Denmark, he says he wants more. When they say a unilateral annexation of Greenland would be the end of NATO, he shrugs as if that might be a price worth paying. When they question his claims that Russia and China are poised to take over Greenland themselves, he just repeats them.</p><p>Appeasement or capitulation is possible. If the Europeans were panicked enough, they could lean on Denmark to give Greenlanders the independence referendum that’s been talked about for years. If Greenlanders chose full sovereignty – as a majority ultimately want – Europe could claim Greenland’s fate wasn’t their problem any more. But we’re not in that place yet.</p><p>For now, European leaders are united behind Copenhagen and Nuuk. Denmark’s sovereignty is inviolable, they say. And <a href=\"/features/2026/1/13/we-do-not-want-to-be-americans-greenlanders-fear-us-threat-to-annex\">Greenland is not for sale</a>.</p><p>What we could be inching towards is a fudge. Something that everyone can take as satisfactory-ish. Maybe a resource deal for US access to <a href=\"/news/2025/3/11/mapping-greenlands-resources-population-centres-and-us-military-base\">Greenland’s abundant deposits</a> of metals and rare earth elements. And maybe a beefed-up US military presence. Enough for Trump to claim a win. And for Europe to breathe a sigh of relief that NATO still has a heartbeat.</p></div></div></body></html>"
