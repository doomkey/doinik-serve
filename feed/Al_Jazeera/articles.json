            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On December 16, Sudanese political parties, armed movements, civil society organisations, and prominent political figures signed a nine-point political roadmap in Nairobi, presenting it as a civilian-led initiative aimed at ending Sudan’s war and restoring a democratic transition.</p><p>Framed as an antiwar, pro-peace platform, it seeks to position civilians as a “third pole” against the two military actors in Sudan’s conflict: the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p><p>Its authors say it represents an attempt to reclaim political agency for civilians after months of marginalisation by armed actors and foreign mediators, even though the declaration does not outline any concrete steps towards military reform.</p><p>The roadmap reignited longstanding debates within Sudanese political and civic circles about representation, legitimacy, and the persistent dominance of elite-driven civilian politics.</p><h2 id=\"the-roadmap\">The roadmap</h2><p>The Nairobi declaration emerged after a statement released by the Quad – Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the United States – in September.</p><p>The Quad statement called for an immediate three-month truce to lead to a permanent ceasefire, humanitarian access to help civilians, and the creation of a political process for a civilian transition.</p><p>It also emphasised excluding remnants of former President Omar al-Bashir’s regime and reforming Sudan’s security forces under civilian oversight, all points that the Nairobi declaration echoed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Nairobi signatories included the National Umma Party, the Sudanese Congress Party, civil society organisations – including the Darfur Lawyers Association and the Coordination of Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees – and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-AW) led by Abdelwahid al-Nur.</p><p>Former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who led Sudan’s transitional civilian government from al-Bashir’s overthrow in 2019 until the October 2021 military coup by the SAF and the RSF working in concert, also signed the declaration.</p><p>It was likewise endorsed by al-Nur, longtime leader of the SLM-AW armed group that controls Jebel Marra in Darfur and has historically rejected what he describes as “elite-driven” political settlements.</p><h2 id=\"falling-short\">Falling short</h2><p>Sudanese researcher Hamid Khalafallah told Al Jazeera that despite the intent to present a civilian leadership, the declaration falls short of reflecting Sudan’s broader civic movement.</p><p>The Nairobi coalition, he argued, mirrors earlier civilian formations that failed to connect with Sudanese citizens, particularly those most affected by the war.</p><p>“It’s in many ways a reproduction of former groups that have … struggled to represent the Sudanese people,” he said. “It’s still very much an elite group that does politics in the same way they always have.”</p><p>Although resistance committees – neighbourhood groups that emerged from Sudan’s protest movement and helped topple al-Bashir in 2019 – were referenced in the declaration, no committees formally endorsed or signed it.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4187744\"

al-Nur met in 2019 in Khartoum [File: Embassy of France in Sudan/Facebook]</figcaption></figure><p>Drafts were reportedly shared with some grassroots groups, but the process advanced without waiting for collective deliberation – reinforcing concerns that civilians on the ground remain politically instrumentalised rather than empowered.</p><p>While al-Nur’s participation was hailed by some as a breakthrough, Khalafallah questioned the underlying motivation, arguing that his inclusion was intended to counterbalance rival military-aligned forces rather than transform civilian politics.</p><p>Before the Nairobi declaration, there were three main civilian coalitions in Sudan, each aligned with a warring party or accused of such an alliance.</p><p>Tasis is the coalition of political parties and armed movements that was founded in February 2025, before forming the RSF’s parallel government in July 2025, while the Democratic Bloc is a grouping of parties and armed groups aligned with the SAF.</p><p>Finally comes Hamdok’s Sumoud, comprising political parties and civil society organisations and accused by SAF of supporting the RSF.</p><h2 id=\"europe-s-one-track-civilian-strategy\">Europe’s one-track civilian strategy</h2><p>European officials have distanced themselves from the Nairobi initiative.</p><p>A senior European Union diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera that Brussels does not see the Nairobi roadmap as the foundation for a unified civilian process.</p><p>“We would like to see only one civilian process, that’s why we are helping the African Union [AU],” the source said. “Everything else is a distraction, like this Nairobi one.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to the EU official, the priority is not multiplying civilian platforms but consolidating them under a single credible framework, led by the AU and broadly accepted by Sudanese society.</p><p>“Our aim is to create a credible third pole – versus RSF and SAF,” the source said. “An inclusive one, supported by most Sudanese citizens.”</p><p>The EU plans to build a broad coalition that can take the lead after the Quad’s humanitarian truce and ceasefire proposals are accepted by the SAF and the RSF, including reforms placing security forces under civilian-led oversight.</p><p>The EU’s language reflects growing frustration among international actors with Sudan’s fragmented civilian landscape, while insisting that abandoning it would legitimise military rule by default.</p><p>“Of course, we are not naive that civilians will take over tomorrow,” the source said. “But we have to stand for our values.”</p><p>The EU official was blunt in assessing the conduct of Sudan’s warring parties, rejecting narratives that frame either side as a governing authority.</p><p>“I would not call what RSF does in Darfur ‘governing’, SAF is a bit better – but not much,” the source said.</p><p>“Look at the oil deal they did,” the official added. “Money is important; people are not.”</p><p>They referred to the latest agreement between the SAF and the RSF – under South Sudanese mediation – that both would withdraw from the Heglig oil facility, with <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/south-sudan-army-to-secure-critical-heglig-oilfield-in-sudan-war-spillover\">South Sudanese troops deployed to secure</a> the refinery following SAF’s pullout and the RSF’s capture of the site.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"warring-parties-as-spoilers\">Warring parties as spoilers?</h2><p>US-Africa policy expert Cameron Hudson told Al Jazeera that the Nairobi declaration appears to mimic the Quad’s recent statement, effectively presenting to the international community a roadmap that aligns with pre-existing objectives to gain Quad support.</p><p>“My sense is that the Nairobi declaration reverse engineers what the Quad has said,” Hudson said, suggesting that the initiative is designed more to attract international endorsement than to build genuine domestic consensus.</p><p>Hudson warned that this approach mishandles the sequencing of Sudan’s political transition, “prematurely” linking ceasefire efforts with reforms of the army or other political changes, arguing that these should remain on separate tracks until violence subsides.</p><p>“If what the Quad wants is an unconditional ceasefire, then it needs to pursue that, not create opportunities to trade a ceasefire for political assurances during a transition,” he said.</p><p>“For that reason, it is premature to be talking about reforming the army or other political reforms. These should remain in separate tracks for now.”</p><p>The tension is stark. The Quad and the European Union increasingly state that neither the SAF nor the RSF should have a political future and that remnants of the Bashir regime must be excluded entirely.</p><p>Yet both armed forces remain indispensable to any cessation of hostilities, creating an unresolved contradiction at the heart of international strategy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>In late November, hundreds of students and staff were kidnapped from St Mary’s co-educational boarding school in north-central Niger State.</p><p>The attack came amid a wave of mass abductions reminiscent of the 2014 Boko Haram kidnapping of schoolgirls in the town of Chibok.</p><p>The West African country suffers from multiple interlinked security concerns, from armed groups in the northeast to armed “bandit” gangs in the northwest.</p><p>The exact number of children taken from St Mary’s has been unclear throughout the ordeal.</p><p>Initially, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said that 315 students and staff were unaccounted for after the attack in the rural hamlet of Papiri.</p><p>About 50 of them escaped immediately afterwards, and on December 7, the government secured the release of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/8/nigeria-secures-release-of-100-kidnapped-children-reports-say\">about 100</a> people.</p><p>That would leave about 165 thought to be still in captivity before Sunday’s announcement that 130 were rescued.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>However, a UN source told the AFP news agency that all those taken appeared to have been released, as dozens thought to have been kidnapped had managed to run off during the attack and make their way home.</p><p>The accounting has been complicated because the children’s homes are scattered across swaths of rural Nigeria, sometimes requiring three or four hours of travel by motorbike to reach their remote villages, the source said.</p><p>The source told the AFP that “the remaining set of girls/secondary school students will be taken to Minna”, the capital of Niger State, on Monday.</p><p>“We’ll have to still do final verification,” Daniel Atori, a spokesman for CAN in Niger State, told the AFP.</p><h2 id=\"mass-kidnappings\">Mass kidnappings</h2><p>It has not been made public who seized the children from their boarding school, or how the government secured their release.</p><p>Kidnappings for ransom are a common way for criminals and armed groups to make quick cash in Nigeria.</p><p>But a spate of mass abductions in November put an uncomfortable spotlight on the country’s already grim security situation.</p><p>Assailants kidnapped two dozen Muslim schoolgirls, 38 church worshippers, and a bride and her bridesmaids, with farmers, women and children also taken hostage.</p><p>The kidnappings also come as Nigeria faces a diplomatic offensive from the United States, where President Donald Trump has alleged that there have been mass killings of Christians in Nigeria that amounted to a “genocide”, and he threatened military intervention.</p><p>Nigeria’s government and independent analysts <a href=\"/news/2025/11/2/nigeria-welcomes-us-assistance-to-fight-terrorism-after-trumps-threats\">reject that framing</a>, which has long been used by the Christian right in the US and Europe.</p><p>One of the first mass kidnappings that drew international attention was in 2014, when nearly 300 girls were seized from their boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok by the Boko Haram armed group.</p><p>A decade later, Nigeria’s kidnap-for-ransom crisis has “consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry” that raised some $1.66m between July 2024 and June 2025, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based consultancy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I’m not for blowing up these boats of unarmed people that are suspected of being drug dealers,” he added.</p><p>Analysts expressed concern over the rising tensions and the potential for rights violations in the US.</p><p>“The US is not under real threat from Venezuela in any way, not even from drug trafficking. But a lot of people in the White House think that it will be convenient for the US to declare war,” said Ernesto Castaneda, an expert on Latin American affairs at the American University in Washington, DC.</p><p>Such a move would allow the US to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, paving the way for mass deportations and even quell opposition from US citizens, he said.</p><p>The White House also believes that if the US were to go to war, there would be less attention to the ongoing furore over the government’s partial release of the files late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as the state of the economy.</p><p>“But I think those calculations are wrong,” he said.</p><p>Castaneda also noted that the US and Venezuela continue to trade, despite the tensions.</p><p>“Venezuelan economy depends to a large degree on the export of oil, most of it going to China. And these [seized] oil tankers, even though they indeed carry a lot of oil, there’s a lot of trade that is happening,” he said.</p><p>“And, funnily enough, the trade with the US, though the agreement with the [US oil company] Chevron continues. So, even though we have the third oil tanker that has been stopped, most of the tankers are regulated with permission to go into the US, and they continue to do so.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, that would likely be a lengthy process.</p><p>Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for the Epstein files, which could give Congress another avenue to force the release of more information to the committee. But that would require Republicans to join them in contempt-of-Congress proceedings against a Republican administration.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4169671\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4169671\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169671\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_083516_Redacted2-Copy-1765560353.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C612&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Trump with women whose face has been censored\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4169671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This undated photo released by the US House Oversight Committee from Epstein’s estate shows Trump surrounded by six women whose identities have been concealed [Handout/US House Oversight Committee]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

The second victim, 22-year-old Ahmad Zayoud, was killed in Silat al-Harithiya, west of Jenin.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Witnesses said Israeli troops had opened fire directly at Abdel Qader, the Wafa news agency reported on Sunday, and blocked emergency crews from reaching him, leaving him to bleed to death. Israeli forces then held his body, the Palestinian agency reported.</p><p>The Palestinian Health Ministry said Zayoud was shot in the chest.</p><p>A 15-year-old Palestinian boy also sustained injuries to his hand during the incident, the ministry said.</p><p>Zayoud’s killing comes about a week after Israeli forces killed a 16-year-old in the town.</p><p>Reporting from Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim said that surveillance footage showed Abdel Qader walking towards what locals said was his home when Israeli forces shot him “point-blank”.</p><p>“We don’t often have video surveillance to show how many of these killings have been done under what Palestinians call extrajudicial killings, which is Israeli forces killing Palestinians point-blank or under excuses that they say they’ve [Palestinians] been doing something that is seen as resisting Israeli forces,” she said.</p><p>“Not only that, they refused to let anyone come close to the body for 40 minutes, a practice we’ve been seeing a lot in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces kind of wait for the person to die,” Ibrahim said.</p><p>Al Jazeera spoke to Abdel Qader’s family, who said they had no idea what had happened.</p><p>“It’s really part of the pain that the families have to endure, seeing videos like that, showing how little regard the Israeli army has for Palestinian lives,” Ibrahim said.</p><h2 id=\"more-than-200-children-killed-since-2023\">More than 200 children killed since 2023</h2><p>The Israeli military said the deaths occurred after the victims hurled a block and an explosive at their forces. Such claims have turned out to be false most of the time. The military said that Abdel Qader had been shot after hurling a block towards its soldiers, who responded with fire, while Zayoud had thrown an explosive.</p><p>No Israeli troops were injured in the incidents, it said.</p><p>The latest deaths bring the toll from Israeli attacks in the occupied West Bank to 1,101, including 229 children, since October 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas-led attack on Israel. Israel’s response to the attack was a brutal assault against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p><p>Israeli authorities have arrested nearly 21,000 Palestinians during that period. As of December 1, some 9,300 Palestinian prisoners were in Israeli jails, more than a third of them detained without charges. Palestinian prisoners have routinely been tortured, sexually abused and even killed in custody. Israel has confirmed the identities of 86 Palestinian prisoners who died in its custody.</p><p>Attacks by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank have also surged amid the mainstreaming of the far-right in the country. On Sunday, the Israeli government approved the construction of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/israel-approves-19-new-west-bank-settlements-in-major-annexation-push\">19 new settlements</a> in the occupied West Bank in violation of international laws.</p><p>Numerous rights organisations have dubbed Israeli action in Gaza as an act of genocide, and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes.</p><p>The violence has played out in tandem with Israel’s ongoing deadly attacks on Gaza, in violation of the ceasefire signed on October 10. These violations have prompted warnings that diplomatic efforts to advance to the second phase of the US-brokered agreement could be in jeopardy. Israel has killed at least 400 Palestinians since the ceasefire pushed by US President Donald Trump came into effect.</p><h2 id=\"two-killed-in-gaza-city\">Two killed in Gaza City</h2><p>Meanwhile, a medical source at Gaza City’s al-Ahli Arab Hospital said that Israeli forces killed two Palestinians on Sunday in the Shujayea neighbourhood, in the east of the city.</p><p>The source said the killings took place near the so-called yellow line, demarcating territory under Israeli military control.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>An Al Jazeera team on the ground reported that Israeli artillery shelling and helicopter gunfire were also targeting areas near Israeli positions east of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.</p><p>The latest killings in Gaza came a day after Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/us-qatar-egypt-turkey-urge-gaza-restraint-as-israeli-strikes-continue\">Hakan Fidan told the Anadolu news agency</a> that Israel’s repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement were “creating major risks for transitioning to the second phase”.</p><p>Fidan’s comments came as he joined diplomats from the US, Egypt and Qatar in the US city of Miami to review the first phase of the ceasefire.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gaza’s Ministry of Interior and National Security said that four people were killed when a three-storey house collapsed in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood on Saturday night.</p><p>The latest deaths brought the total number of people killed in such circumstances to 18 since the ceasefire came into effect.</p><p>The Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza said on Sunday that it had successfully rescued five people, including a child and two women, from the building.</p></div></div></body></html>"
