In July, the agencies released a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1407001/dl?inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">joint memorandum</a> denying the existence of such a list.</p>\n<p>“This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list.’ There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,” it read.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"scrutiny-on-trump\">Scrutiny on Trump</h2>\n<p>That, however, did little to abate the outrage, and scrutiny has since turned to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/how-well-did-trump-and-epstein-really-know-each-other-a-timeline\">President Trump’s own relationship</a> with Epstein.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal this month published a report alleging that Trump had signed a birthday note to Epstein featuring a suggestive message, alongside a doodle of a naked woman. Trump denied ever writing or drawing such a birthday message, and he <a href=\"/news/2025/7/19/trump-sues-wall-street-journal-rupert-murdoch-for-10bn-over-epstein-story\">has since sued</a> the newspaper and its parent company.</p>\n<p>But on Wednesday, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/trump-administration-bars-wall-street-journal-from-trip-amid-epstein-spate\">The Wall Street Journal</a> continued its coverage of the Epstein scandal with an article that alleged the Justice Department knew Trump’s name appeared multiple times in files related to the sex offender.</p>\n<p>Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, called the latest report “another fake news story”.</p>\n<p>Trump has previously <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1946346621274317115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> for the Epstein grand jury transcripts to be released, dismissing the ongoing scandal as a “scam” and a “hoax”. He also repudiated any of his supporters who believed the rumours.</p>\n<p>“My PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bull****,’ hook, line, and sinker,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114863203348237352\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media on July 16. “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work.”</p>\n<p>While the Justice Department has argued there is “extensive public interest” in releasing the grand jury transcripts, experts say those testimonies are unlikely to contain the full extent of the evidence in the Epstein case.</p>\n<p>Federal grand jury testimonies are usually brief, supplying only enough information to secure an indictment.</p>\n<p>One former federal prosecutor, Sarah Krissoff, told The Associated Press the transcripts are likely to be a “distraction”.</p>\n<p>“The president is trying to present himself as if he’s doing something here, and it really is nothing,” Krissoff said in an interview published earlier this week.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"democrats-seek-advantage\">Democrats seek advantage</h2>\n<p>Democrats, meanwhile, have sought to highlight the lingering questions about Epstein in a bid to damage Trump’s reputation with his supporters.</p>\n<p>In the House of Representatives, for instance, Democrats on the Committee for Oversight launched a bid to subpoena the Justice Department for all its Epstein files.</p>\n<p>Rather than risk a vote to push for further Epstein records, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson adjourned the chamber early for its six-week August recess.</p>\n<p>Democrats like Representative Summer Lee seized upon that manouevre as evidence of complicity.</p>\n<p>“They’re fleeing our work, our job and sending us back home because they don’t want to vote to release these files,” Lee said.</p>\n<p>But Johnson defended the move this week, saying Trump officials were “already doing everything within their power to release them”.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

It will also promote production of new data centres around the US. It will scrap federal regulations that “hinder AI development”, although it is not clear which regulations are in question.</p>\n<p>In a statement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the plan will “ensure America sets the technological gold standard worldwide, and that the world continues to run on American technology”.</p>\n<p>The president is expected to announce a series of executive orders which will outline key parts of the plan around 5pm in New York (21:00 GMT).</p>\n<p>“We believe we’re in an AI race … and we want the United States to win that race,” White House AI czar David Sacks told reporters on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The White House says the plan will “counter Chinese influence in international governance bodies” and also will give the US more control over exports of AI technology.</p>\n<p>However, the administration did not offer any details on how it plans to do that.</p>\n<p>The plan outlined by the Trump administration will also include a framework to analyse models built by China to assess “alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship”.</p>\n<p><strong>Free speech in the spotlight </strong></p>\n<p>The plan says that it will also uphold free speech in models that will allow systems to be “objective and free from top-down ideological bias” for organisations wanting to do business with the federal government.</p>\n<p>A senior White House official said the main target was AI models that consider diversity and inclusion, according to The Wall Street Journal, which, experts say, signals the concern is the government’s perceived liberal bias as opposed to an overall bias.</p>\n<p>“The government should not be acting as a Ministry of AI Truth or insisting that AI models hew to its preferred interpretation of reality,” Samir Jain, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“The plan is highly unbalanced, focusing too much on promoting the technology while largely failing to address the ways in which it could potentially harm people.”</p>\n<p>Conservatives have long accused AI chatbots of having a liberal bias, comparable to their comments on legacy media for providing critical coverage of the administration. However, it comes as users of GrokAI, former Trump ally and right-wing tycoon Elon Musk’s AI platform, have accused it of having <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/11/as-millions-adopt-grok-to-fact-check-misinformation-abounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a right-wing lean</a>. Musk’s X AI is part of a $200m package with the Pentagon that has other AI companies, including OpenAI.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p><strong>Building out data centres</strong></p>\n<p>A key focus of the new plan will be to build out new data centers for AI technology as the industry rapidly expands. The administration said that will include streamlining permits for new centre development and the energy production facilities used to power these data centres.</p>\n<p>The plan sidesteps environmental concerns that have been a major criticism of the AI industry. AI “challenges America to build vastly greater energy generation than we have today”, the plan said.</p>\n<p>AI data centres have been tied to increased power consumption and, in turn, greenhouse gas emissions. According Google’s 2024 sustainability report, there was a 48 percent increase in power greenhouse gas emissions since 2019 which, it says, will only become more prevalent.</p>\n<p>“This result was primarily due to increases in data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions. As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,’ <a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2024-environmental-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the report said</a>.</p>\n<p>The streamlining of permits also comes as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to reverse its scientific determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. That change would remove the legal framework that climate regulations are based on, the Reuters news agency has reported, citing two unnamed sources.</p>\n<p>The reversal would remove the “endangerment finding”, making it easier for the EPA to undo legislation limiting greenhouse gas emissions on energy-producing facilities, including those used to power AI data centres.</p>\n<p>The administration has created environmental review exceptions for data centre construction and will allow expanding access to federal lands for AI development.</p>\n<p>“AI will improve the lives of Americans by complementing their work — not replacing it,” the plan says.</p>\n<p>It, however, comes as employers across the country scrap jobs because of AI. Earlier this month, Recruit Holdings, the parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor, cut 1300 jobs which it directly attributed to AI.</p>\n<p>In June, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that AI is doing 30 to 50 percent of the company’s workload. In February, the tech giant laid off 1,000 employees.</p>\n<p>Analysts say the plan looks promising for investors in the AI sector.</p>\n<p>“This is a watershed moment in the AI revolution, and Trump recognises this AI arms race between the US and China. A big step forward,” Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>As of 4pm in New York (20:00 GMT), stocks of AI-focused companies had mixed results. NVIDIA was up 2.1 percent; Palantir up 3.6 percent, Oracle up 1.5 percent and Microsoft was up 0.3 percent. On the other hand, Google’s parent company Alphabet was down 0.5 percent.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Ukrainian President <a href=\"/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/\">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> has promised to introduce new legislation amid continuing protests and international criticism over a law passed earlier this week that critics say undermines Ukraine’s fight against corruption.</p>\n<p>The controversial law, passed on Tuesday, places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) under the direct authority of the country’s prosecutor general – an official appointed by the president. Critics say the law strips the agencies of their independence and could allow political interference.</p>\n<p>While Zelenskyy has defended the law as a necessary response to suspected “Russian influence” within the agencies, European Union officials and rights groups say that it contains no specific provisions to target Kremlin-linked operatives and warn it could derail any Ukrainian accession bid to the European Union.</p>\n<p>“I have analysed all concerns,” Zelenskyy wrote on X following a meeting with top government and law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p>Writing about the proposal of the new bill, he said: “We will prepare and submit a bill to the Verkhovna Rada [parliament] that ensures the strength of the rule-of-law system. There will be no Russian influence or interference … and all the norms for the independence of anti-corruption institutions will be in place.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"public-anger-and-european-backlash\">Public anger and European backlash</h2>\n<p>On Tuesday night, thousands of Ukrainians rallied in Kyiv and other major cities in rare wartime protests. More than 1,000 demonstrators defied martial law, which bans large public gatherings, to express their anger at the government, while on Wednesday, more protests took place in the capital.</p>\n<p>“This is complete nonsense from the president’s office,” 20-year-old student Solomiia Telishevska told the news agency Reuters, referring to the law signed by Zelenskyy on Tuesday. “This contradicts what we are fighting for and what we are striving for, namely to [join] the European Union.”</p>\n<p>Cleaning up systemic corruption has long been a core requirement for Ukraine’s EU membership and for unlocking billions in foreign aid. The law’s passage risks alienating Kyiv’s Western allies as the war grinds on.</p>\n<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has demanded “explanations” from Zelenskyy, with a spokesperson confirming on Wednesday that she conveyed “strong concerns about the consequences of the amendments”. Germany’s Johann Wadephul, deputy leader of the Christian Democratic Union, warned on X that the restrictions were “hampering Ukraine’s path to the EU”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anticorruption-bodies-targeted\">Anticorruption bodies targeted</h2>\n<p>The storm erupted days after law enforcement raided NABU offices and arrested an employee on suspicion of spying for Russia. Another employee was accused of illegal business ties to Moscow. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) agency also carried out searches and arrests related to other alleged infractions, including a traffic incident.</p>\n<p>Zelenskyy suggested these incidents justified the law passed on Tuesday, but Ukrainian analysts have warned the changes could erode public trust in Zelenskyy’s leadership during a critical phase of the war.</p>\n<p>NABU was created in 2015 after Ukraine’s 2014 pro-European revolution to tackle deep-rooted government corruption. The agency has investigated multiple high-profile cases, including figures close to Zelenskyy’s administration.</p>\n<p>Transparency International Ukraine denounced the raids as “an attempt by the authorities to undermine the independence of Ukraine’s post-Revolution of Dignity anti-corruption institutions”.</p>\n<p>Some Ukrainians believe the government is protecting loyal insiders at the expense of transparency. “Those who swore to protect the laws and the constitution have instead chosen to shield their inner circle, even at the expense of Ukrainian democracy,” said veteran Oleh Symoroz, who lost both legs in 2022 fighting Russian forces.</p>\n<p>The political firestorm risks creating deeper rifts within Ukraine at a time when unity is vital in Kyiv’s war against Russia. Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties, warned the law could play directly into the Kremlin’s hands. “This is a gift to Putin,” she said.</p>\n<p>Russian officials have already seized on the controversy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov remarked there was “a lot of corruption” when asked about the protests in Kyiv.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

But as his trial date approached in August, he and his defence lawyers reached an agreement that would see his legal jeopardy lowered.</p>\n<p>In exchange for having Plasencia plead guilty to four counts of illegally distributing ketamine, prosecutors dropped three additional counts of illegal distribution and two counts of falsifying records.</p>\n<p>When questioned by Judge Garnett, Plasencia indicated his lawyers had exhausted all their options for pleas and sentencing: “They’ve considered everything.”</p>\n<p>In a statement afterwards, one of his lawyers, Debra White, conveyed Plasencia’s regrets and indicated the doctor would no longer practice medicine professionally.</p>\n<p>“Dr Plasencia is profoundly remorseful for the treatment decisions he made while providing ketamine to Matthew Perry,” White said.</p>\n<p>“He is fully accepting responsibility by pleading guilty to drug distribution. Dr Plasencia intends to voluntarily surrender his medical license, acknowledging his failure to protect Mr Perry, a patient who was especially vulnerable due to addiction.”</p>\n<p>Perry — best known for his role as Chandler Bing on the show Friends — <a href=\"/news/2023/10/29/friends-actor-matthew-perry-dies-at-54\">died on October 28, 2023</a>, in a hot tub at his home in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angeles, California. He was 54 years old.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"/news/2023/12/16/friends-star-matthew-perry-died-of-ketamine-overdose-autopsy-finds\">autopsy report</a> released in December of that year credited Perry’s death to the “acute effects” of ketamine, while acknowledging other factors. Perry’s coronary artery disease, for example, likely contributed to his death, as well as his long-term struggles with drug use.</p>\n<p>Perry had been legally using ketamine to treat his depression. But faced with limits to the amount he could be prescribed, Perry reportedly started to seek additional sources of the drug outside of legal channels.</p>\n<p>Plasencia did not supply Perry with the fatal dose of ketamine, according to prosecutors.</p>\n<p>But in court on Wednesday, he did acknowledge he provided Perry with ketamine in the month leading up to his death, including 20 vials that contained a total of 100 milligrammes of the drug.</p>\n<p>The doctor also admitted to administering one injection and watching Perry’s blood pressure spike. He also said he left some for Perry’s assistant to inject.</p>\n<p>In court filings from a separate case, fellow <a href=\"/news/2024/10/3/doctor-pleads-guilty-over-overdose-death-of-friends-star-matthew-perry\">doctor Mark Chavez</a> accused Plasencia of recruiting him to supply ketamine to sell to Perry.</p>\n<p>“I wonder how much this moron will pay,” Plasencia allegedly said in a text message to Chavez. Prosecutors said the ketamine sale netted $4,500.</p>\n<p>Plasencia is the fourth defendant to plead guilty to charges related to Perry’s death.</p>\n<p>A fifth defendant, Jasveen Sangha, has pleaded not guilty. Authorities have accused Sangha of giving Perry his fatal dose and say she was a drug dealer known as the “ketamine queen”. Her trial will begin in August.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Rubio suggested that the school’s “continued eligibility as a sponsor” would hang in the balance of Wednesday’s investigation.</p>\n<p>“To maintain their privilege to sponsor exchange visitors, sponsors must comply with all regulations, including conducting their programs in a manner that does not undermine the foreign policy objectives or compromise the national security interests of the United States,” Rubio wrote.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852826\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852826\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852826\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-21T174023Z_638325211_RC24RFA7EP7E_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-HARVARD-1753287312.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='A protester holds up a sign that reads: \"Hands off Harvard\"' fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852826\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The group Crimson Courage led a show of support for Harvard outside the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 21 [Brian Snyder/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"questions-of-national-security\">Questions of national security</h2>\n<p>Under President Trump’s second term, the US has repeatedly cited questions of national security and foreign policy in its attempts to expel foreign students, particularly those involved in pro-Palestinian and antiwar movements.</p>\n<p>Rubio himself has drawn on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 — a relatively obscure Cold War-era law — in his efforts to deport student protest leaders like Mahmoud Khalil.</p>\n<p>The law allows the secretary of state to expel foreign nationals “whose presence or activities” could pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”.</p>\n<p>The government’s use of such laws, however, is currently being challenged in court. Critics argue they violate the constitutional right to free speech and protest.</p>\n<p>It was President Trump’s opposition to the pro-Palestinian protests that led him to engage in a high-profile confrontation with Harvard, the country’s oldest university and a member of the much-vaunted Ivy League.</p>\n<p>Schools like Harvard in Massachusetts and Columbia University in New York were considered the epicentre of the protest movement. At Columbia, for instance, students erected a tent encampment that inspired similar demonstrations across the world.</p>\n<p>The schools’ crackdowns on those protests, however, were also emulated at other campuses. Columbia, for instance, called in police to clear pro-Palestinian demonstrators, and other schools took similar action, leading to more than 3,000 campus arrests across the country last year.</p>\n<p>Critics of the protests, including President Trump, have called the demonstrations anti-Semitic and warned they create an unsafe learning environment for Jewish students.</p>\n<p>Protest leaders, however, point out that most of the demonstrations were peaceful and have forcefully rejected anti-Jewish hate. Rather, they argue their protests are about shining a light on the abuses Israel has perpetrated in Gaza — and the crackdowns are aimed at stamping out views that run contrary to the US’s close relationship with Israel.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852828\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852828\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852828\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-21T173457Z_1882899708_RC24RFAJONGL_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-HARVARD-1753287327.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A drag performer dresses as Trump with a regal cape and sceptre.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852828\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Prum, parodying President Donald Trump, demonstrates against attempts to strip Harvard of its federal funding [Brian Snyder/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"pressure-on-schools\">Pressure on schools</h2>\n<p>Upon taking office in January, however, Trump pledged to take “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forceful and unprecedented steps</a>” to root out alleged anti-Semitism on campus.</p>\n<p>In early March, he began his broadside on Ivy League campuses like Columbia and Harvard. He began by stripping Columbia of $400m in federal contracts and grants and then by requesting compliance with a list of demands, including disciplinary reform and <a href=\"/news/2025/3/14/us-arrests-second-student-imposes-receivership-on-columbia-university\">external oversight</a> for certain academic departments.</p>\n<p>By March 22, Columbia <a href=\"/news/2025/3/22/how-columbia-gave-in-to-trumps-demands-to-get-its-400m-funding-back\">had agreed</a> to make concessions.</p>\n<p>But Trump encountered greater resistance at Harvard University. On April 11, the Trump administration likewise issued a list of demands that would have required Harvard to commit to “structural and personnel changes” to foster “viewpoint diversity”, eliminate its diversity programmes and agree to external audits.</p>\n<p>It refused. Instead, Harvard President Alan Garber said such requests would violate Harvard’s rights as a private institution committed to academic freedom.</p>\n<p>Since then, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/5/14/trump-administration-cuts-another-450m-in-harvard-grants-in-escalating-row\">has stripped</a> Harvard of <a href=\"/news/2025/3/31/trump-threatens-to-yank-billions-in-harvard-university-contracts-and-grants\">billions of dollars</a> in federal contracts, research funding and grants. A federal court in Boston began hearing a legal challenge against that decision this week.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-multi-pronged-attack\">A multipronged attack</h2>\n<p>But the Trump administration has also explored other avenues to pressure Harvard into compliance.</p>\n<p>Trump has <a href=\"/news/2025/5/2/donald-trump-renews-threats-against-harvard-universitys-tax-exempt-status\">threatened to revoke</a> Harvard’s tax-exempt status — though critics warn it would be illegal to do so — and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trump-blocks-harvards-ability-to-enroll-international-students-nyt-report\">blocked</a> Harvard from accessing the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP), a system that schools are required to use to enrol international students.</p>\n<p>Foreign students make up about a quarter of Harvard’s student body. Losing access to the SEVP system effectively meant those students were no longer able to attend the school.</p>\n<p>Harvard <a href=\"/news/2025/6/6/harvard-challenges-trumps-efforts-to-block-us-entry-for-foreign-students\">challenged</a> the Trump administration’s ban on its foreign students in court and received a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/23/blatant-violation-harvard-sues-trump-over-move-to-block-foreign-students\">preliminary injunction</a> that allows its international students to remain while the case plays out.</p>\n<p>But other hurdles have since emerged.

They captured Belaya Gora on Sunday and Novotoretskoye on Tuesday, both in Donetsk.</p>\n<p>While holding its front line, Ukraine has targeted Moscow with long-range weapons for the past two weeks.</p>\n<p>Russian air defences downed 13 drones approaching Moscow on Saturday, said its mayor, and Ukrainian drones disrupted traffic in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on Sunday, said Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation.</p>\n<p>Then, on Monday, Russia claimed to have shot down 74 Ukrainian drones, a third of them near Moscow. Others must have hit their targets, because a fire at Kamenolomny station in the Rostov region caused delays to train services in the Caucasus.</p>\n<p>Kovalenko also said that on June 11, Ukrainian drones attacked the Lukhovitsky Aviation Plant in the Moscow region, which produces MiG-29 and MiG-31 fighters. Ukraine’s General Staff said drones also hit the Shipunov Design Bureau – a manufacturer of anti-aircraft missiles.</p>\n<p>The following day, Ukraine reportedly blew up a gas pipeline in Khanty-Mansiysk, about 3,000km (1,900 miles) from Moscow. The pipeline reportedly supplied military production facilities.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"drone-air-defence\">Drone air defence</h2>\n<p>At Monday’s meeting of Ukraine’s allies, known as the Ramstein format, after the German town where the meetings began, the United Kingdom and Germany pledged to jointly provide Ukraine with an unspecified number of missiles to defend its skies.</p>\n<p>“Boris and I have agreed to jointly supply Ukraine with critically needed anti-aircraft missiles,” UK Defence Secretary John Healy said, referring to German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius.</p>\n<p>Ukraine uses the German-made IRIS-T and US-made NASAMS and SHORAD missile defence systems against <a href=\"/news/2025/6/11/whats-behind-russias-evolving-drone-warfare-in-ukraine\">drone attacks</a>, which have intensified in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>From July 17 to 22, Ukraine shot down or electronically suppressed 833 of 968 unmanned aerial vehicles targeting its cities and critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The largest attack came on Monday, when Russia <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/7/21/russia-launches-major-aerial-attacks-on-kyiv\">launched 426 drones overnight</a>, along with five Kh-47 M2 Kinzhal ballistic missiles, four Kalibr cruise missiles, one Iskander-K cruise missile and 14 Kh-101 cruise missiles.</p>\n<p>The largest attack of the war on July 9 used 728 drones, and the head of the German Planning and Command Staff, Major-General Christian Freuding, said on Saturday that Russia plans to further increase its drone production capacity with the goal of launching 2,000 drones in one overnight strike package.</p>\n<p>Ukraine has used a variety of methods to down or disable drones, including man-portable air defence kits, heavy machineguns and electronic warfare. But its most successful methods so far have proven the German radar-assisted Gepard anti-air 35mm gun and its domestically-developed interceptor drones, said Ukrainian drone warfare expert Olena Kryzhanivska.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made such domestically produced weapons a top priority.</p>\n<p>Inaugurating a new government headed by Yulia Svyrydenko on July 17, Zelenskyy said its top priority was to increase domestic arms production: “Currently, about 40 percent of the weapons in the hands of our warriors are made in Ukraine. In six months, it should be no less than 50 percent,” he said.</p>\n<p>The goal was “to push the war back onto Russia’s territory – back to where the war was brought from. So that they feel what they’ve done”, Zelenskyy said.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852704\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852704\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852704\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1753283439.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1753283439\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852702\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852702\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852702\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-EASTERN-UKRAINE-copy-1753283432.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN EASTERN UKRAINE copy-1753283432\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"ballistic-air-defence\">Ballistic air defence</h2>\n<p>Ukraine has no domestic solution for countering Russia’s deadliest long-range weapons, its ballistic missiles.</p>\n<p>The only effective defence it possesses is the US-made Patriot surface-to-air missile system.</p>\n<p>Pistorius revealed on Monday that “during my trip to Washington last week, I agreed with Pete Hegseth that Germany would contribute to the rapid provision of five much-needed Patriot systems.”</p>\n<p>A complete Patriot system consists of a central radar and antenna array, and at least six launch vehicles carrying four interceptor missiles each.</p>\n<p>It appeared that Germany would pay for these systems.

She also proposed doubling the Ukraine Assistance Fund to 100 billion euros ($117bn).</p>\n<p>On July 18, the EU succeeded in agreeing on an 18th <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/eu-hits-russian-oil-shadow-fleet-with-new-sanctions-over-ukraine-war\">raft of sanctions</a> against Russia.</p>\n<p>It bans the last remnants of Russian energy purchases from the EU, worth about 23 billion euros ($27bn), and lowers a price cap on oil carried to third parties on EU-insured tankers.</p>\n<p>The UK, where much of the world’s tanker fleet is insured, has coordinated with the EU to follow the price cap of $47.60 per barrel, down from the price cap imposed in December 2022 of $60.</p>\n<p>“The UK and EU are working in lockstep to combat those callously fuelling the fires of destruction in Ukraine,” said the UK Foreign Office.</p>\n<p>The new price cap will be dynamic, and is to be set 15 percent below market prices every six months.</p>\n<p>The EU forbade companies from transacting with the Russian-built Nordstream I and II pipelines, which were <a href=\"/news/2023/9/23/what-we-know-about-the-nord-stream-sabotage-one-year-on\">blown up</a> in 2022, ensuring they would never be repaired or rescued from bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>The EU also banned any refined oil products from entering the EU, and added 105 vessels to the Russian shadow fleet banned from entering EU ports or receiving services, bringing the total to 444.</p>\n<p>The EU increased the number of Russian banks banned from transacting with its financial sector from 23 to 45, and sanctioned dozens of entities and companies believed to be helping Russia circumvent sanctions to its defence industry, 11 of them non-Russian.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"diplomacy-versus-all-out-war\">Diplomacy versus all-out war</h2>\n<p>Amid this barrage of new measures from the EU and its slender mercantile collaboration with the US, diplomacy was not entirely given up.</p>\n<p>Ukraine proposed, and Russia accepted, a third round of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/russia-set-for-ukraine-talks-in-turkiye-says-progress-will-be-difficult\">direct talks</a> in Istanbul on Thursday. Putin would attend China’s 80th anniversary celebrations commemorating its defeat of Japan in World War II, the Kremlin said, and could meet with Trump if the latter accepted the invitation.</p>\n<p>Trump has spent most of his political career demonising China, however, and might resist casting it in the role of peace broker.</p>\n<p>US Air Force general Alexus Grynkewich told Bild last week that “the EU and the US have only 18 months to prepare for a global military conflict with China and Russia.</p>\n<p>“China and Russia are preparing for a simultaneous strike on Taiwan and Europe,” Grynkewich was quoted as saying.</p>\n<p>“The conflict could start with a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

The movement drew national attention before university administrators called NYPD officers to dismantle the camps, resulting in dozens of arrests.</p>\n<p>“Suspension from Columbia for protesting genocide is the highest honour,” said Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), an umbrella coalition of student groups, <a href=\"https://x.com/columbiabds?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a post on X</a>.</p>\n<p>“We reject that Columbia has any reputation worth upholding and we categorically state that we do not wish to uphold it,” the student body said.</p>\n<p>So, why has Columbia expelled these students? And why has the Trump administration clamped down on universities?</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-has-happened\">What has happened?</h2>\n<p>Columbia University has disciplined nearly 80 students for their participation in pro-Palestinian protests – to “separate them from the University”.</p>\n<p>The disciplinary action follows a series of demonstrations on campus, including a student-led occupation of Butler Library during final exams on May 7 earlier this year.</p>\n<p>The NYPD arrested 78 individuals that day. The protests are part of a call for the university to divest from companies linked to the Israeli military, cut all financial ties with Israel, and express solidarity with Palestinians amid the continuing war in Gaza.</p>\n<p>According to student organisers, the suspended students took part in a “peaceful teach-in” which included readings and discussions about Palestinian writer and activist <a href=\"/features/2017/3/7/basil-al-araj-was-a-beacon-for-palestinian-youth\">Basil al-Araj</a>, killed by Israeli forces in 2017.</p>\n<p>The mass disciplinary action, described as the biggest of its kind in Columbia’s history, has sparked backlash from civil liberties groups and fellow students.</p>\n<p>Organisers argue the crackdown is part of a broader effort to suppress pro-Palestinian activism on US campuses and have linked it to a pending agreement between Columbia and Trump administration officials.</p>\n<p>The University’s student newspaper, Columbia Spectator, reported that the majority of students received a two-year suspension. The students have reportedly been asked to apologise to the university before they can be allowed to return to campus.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced it would withhold approximately $400m in funding for Columbia University, citing the institution’s alleged failure to adequately address anti-Semitism amid pro-Palestinian protests on campus.</p>\n<p>That move prompted Columbia to concede to a list of demands laid down by the government in return for negotiations to reinstate its funding. Among other concessions, the university agreed to ban face masks and to empower 36 campus police officers with special powers to arrest students.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852414\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852414\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852414\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-05-08T021835Z_1645505848_RC2BDEA7FOE7_RTRMADP_3_USA-COLUMBIA-PROTESTS-1753273425.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852414\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pro-Palestinian protesters are loaded into NYPD buses after being detained by public safety officers, following a protest at Butler Library on the campus of Columbia University in New York, US, on May 7, 2025 [Ryan Murphy/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-has-columbia-said\">What has Columbia said?</h2>\n<p>In a statement published on Tuesday, the University stated that the disruption at Butler Library during reading period had affected hundreds of students and subsequently led to the interim suspension of Columbia participants.</p>\n<p>The University said sanctions would include probation, suspensions ranging from one year to three years, degree revocations, and expulsions.</p>\n<p>It did not state how many faced each of these sanctions, nor did it reveal any of the students’ identities, citing student privacy.</p>\n<p>“Our institution must focus on delivering on its academic mission for our community.

Hundreds of academics have been killed. Books and archives have been incinerated. Entire families have been erased from the civil registry. This is not a war. It is a campaign of erasure.”</p>\n<p>“We will not be deterred.

Bolsonaro, often dubbed the “Trump of the tropics”, is facing trial for allegedly attempting to orchestrate a coup to remain in power despite his 2022 election loss to Lula.</p>\n<p>Trump also erroneously claimed a trade deficit with Brazil. Brazil has a deficit of about $7.4bn with the US, and a surplus of about $31bn with China.</p>\n<p>The political nature of the tariffs marked a sharp departure from Trump’s usual rationale, drawing widespread condemnation across Brazil’s political spectrum, and from China.</p>\n<p>“Tariffs should not be a tool of coercion, intimidation, or interference,” a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>By using tariffs for political leverage rather than economic reasons, Trump risks tarnishing the US’s reputation as a reliable trade partner, experts say, making China appear more stable and predictable by comparison.</p>\n<p>“China, to date, has shown no indication of backtracking on decisions or making sudden changes,” said Mauricio Weiss, an economics professor at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"strengthening-chinese-ties\">Strengthening Chinese ties</h2>\n<p>The Asian country overtook the US as Brazil’s biggest export market in 2009, and the two countries’ trade and investment ties have only grown stronger since then.</p>\n<p>A notable signal of deepening ties came on Monday, when Brazil’s Ministry of Finance announced plans to establish a tax advisory office in Beijing. Brazil only has four other such offices globally – three in South America and one in the US.</p>\n<p>“The motivation is not politically driven, but rather justified by the growing importance of bilateral trade relations and the need to deepen cooperation on fiscal and customs matters,” Brazil’s ministry said in a statement to Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>China has sought to fuel its own domestic growth through access to natural resources and raw materials, such as oil, iron ore, copper, lithium and agricultural products.</p>\n<p>But since 2007, China has also invested more than $73bn in Brazil, according to CEBC. Much of those funds are pouring into strategic sectors such as energy, infrastructure, agribusiness and technology.</p>\n<p>“The United States still invests more heavily in Brazil, but China’s investments are more targeted and coordinated between governments,” said Weiss.</p>\n<p>Chinese products are also becoming increasingly common in Brazil. Electric cars made by Chinese manufacturer BYD are now a common sight, with seven out of 10 electric vehicles sold in Brazil coming from the company.</p>\n<p>Particularly symbolic of China’s growing presence to the detriment of the US was BYD’s purchase of a massive factory previously owned by Ford in Brazil’s northeastern state of Bahia.</p>\n<p>The two countries have also agreed to explore transportation integration. Those plans include a bi-oceanic rail corridor linking Brazil to the Chinese-built port of Chancay in Peru.</p>\n<p>Xi’s inauguration in November of the mega-port – where total investment is expected to top $3.5bn over the next decade – put China’s regional influence on stark display.</p>\n<p>Other Latin American nations, including Peru, Colombia, and Chile, have also signalled their rapprochement with China, amid fears of Trump’s intentions for the region. He has previously pledged to “take back” the Panama Canal, including by force.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>But some have pointed out the deepening relation between China and Brazil does not mean the South American country will start exporting the goods it currently sends to the US to China, as the two countries buy very different products from Brazilian companies.</p>\n<p>“Brazil isn’t going to export manufactured products to China. That doesn’t make much sense,” said Livio Ribeiro, a researcher at the Brazilian Institute of Economics at the Getulio Vargas Foundation and partner at economic consultancy BRCG.</p>\n<p>Even then, Chinese investments could play a crucial role in enabling Brazil to boost its industrial capacity and diversify its economy, according to Weiss.</p>\n<p>“Simply being able to produce more of these products domestically and for other South American partners will already be a significant growth opportunity,” Weiss said.</p>\n<p>Speaking during a state visit in China in May, Lula said Brazil and China will be “indispensable partners” because “China needs Brazil and Brazil needs China.”</p>\n<p>“Together, we can make the Global South respected in the world like never before,” Lula added.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The western state tallied 8,110 blazes in 2024 alone — more than any other part of the country.</p>\n<p>Just last week, the insurance company Gallagher Re <a href=\"https://www.ajg.com/gallagherre/-/media/files/gallagher/gallagherre/news-and-insights/2025/july/h1-2025-natural-catastrophe-and-climate-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> that two blazes this year in the Los Angeles area — the Eaton and Palisades fires — were responsible for nearly $40bn in insured losses alone. An estimated 30 people died in those fires.</p>\n<p>That toll has put California in the crosshairs of a nationwide debate about how best to deal with wildfires and what the state and federal roles should be.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, on the six-month anniversary of the deadly infernos, US Senator Alex Padilla called on the federal government to invest more in fire preparedness, rather than scale back, as President Donald Trump has suggested he may do.</p>\n<p>“We’re entering the next peak fire season. Fire season is year-round in California, but peak fire season is just beginning,” Padilla said.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that the Los Angeles conflagrations sparked in the relatively mild month of January: “These fires took place in wintertime, not in the hot dry months of summer.”</p>\n<p>That, experts say, is an indication of the potential scale of California’s wildfires, even under less-than-ideal circumstances.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"potential-for-a-fairly-severe-season\">Potential for a ‘fairly severe’ season</h2>\n<p>Scientists say that California’s wildfires have been fairly subdued so far this year, but they are expected to pick up as summer progresses into August, especially in parts of the state that have struggled with drought in recent months.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had a number of small-to-medium-sized fires, but nothing too startling so far,” Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), told Al Jazeera in a recent phone call.</p>\n<p>“But that’s kind of where we’d expect to be at this point in the season. And we’ve seen some factors that point to what could be a fairly severe fire season as we enter the drier months.”</p>\n<p>Scientists are quick to stress that wildfire seasons can be affected by a variety of factors and are difficult to predict.</p>\n<p>Events associated with wildfire, such as periods of high winds, extreme heat or lightning storms, are themselves mercurial. Acts of human error or negligence, like a downed power line or a failure to properly extinguish a campfire, can also set a landscape ablaze.</p>\n<p>Once a burn starts, elements like wind strength and firefighter access can make the difference between a fire that is quickly snuffed out and one that grows larger and more intense.</p>\n<p>“It’s really hard to come up with a single rationale for why some seasons are so much more intense than others,” said Scott Stephens, a professor of fire science and forest policy at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n<p>The fire seasons of 2020 and 2021 in California, for example, saw record-breaking fires that spread across enormous portions of land.</p>\n<p>The next several years were, by comparison, fairly tame, although scientists say that factors such as <a href=\"/news/2025/1/11/is-climate-change-to-blame-for-the-california-wildfires\">climate change</a> have contributed to fire seasons that see higher-than-average levels of activity.</p>\n<p>But there are some indicators that scientists and fire officials look to as clues, such as the prevalence of drought and the level of moisture present in soil and plant life. While many catalysts can spark a fire, how quickly it spreads and how unstoppable it becomes is largely a matter of fuel, in the form of thick, dry vegetation.</p>\n<p>Stephens says that southern California’s chaparral landscape — typified by low-lying shrubs like sage — is especially prone to fire, and it has had a “very dry” year.</p>\n<p>The US Drought Monitor says that about 23 percent of the state is currently experiencing conditions ranging from severe to exceptional drought, with many of those areas concentrated in southern California.</p>\n<p>California’s largest fire of the year thus far, the Madre Fire, took place in San Luis Obispo County in central California and reached about 80,000 acres (32,400 hectares), according to the state agency Cal Fire.</p>\n<p>That blaze is more than 95 percent contained, the term fire officials use to reference the portion of a fire effectively surrounded by protective lines built to stop it from spreading.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3573144\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3573144\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3573144\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-01-23T061857Z_760650648_RC28FCAK6XS4_RTRMADP_3_CALIFORNIA-WILDFIRES-1741739931.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A pair of firefighters stand silhouetted against a burning blaze at night: One points.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3573144\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Firefighters battle the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, north of Santa Clarita, California, on January 22 [Ringo Chiu/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"shifting-policies-for-emergency-management\">Shifting policies for emergency management</h2>\n<p>Political changes are also looming over this year’s fire season, as cuts to weather forecasting and emergency services under the Trump administration spark concern.</p>\n<p>Scientists argue that such services play an essential role in trying to understand each fire season.</p>\n<p>“We rely a lot on modelled forecasts for different weather events, and fire weather is certainly an example of that,” said Moritz. “If these services take a hit, we’re all at risk of worse outcomes.”</p>\n<p>Since returning to office for a second term, Trump has led an effort to downscale the federal government, including by reducing its emergency services and scientific research.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, for instance, the National Weather Service (NWS) lost nearly 600 workers as part of the Trump-led employee reduction. The president has since faced criticism after a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/as-deadly-storms-in-texas-subside-eyes-turn-to-govt-response-to-flooding\">series of floods</a> in the state of Texas killed nearly 135 people: Democratic lawmakers have blamed staffing cuts for hindering forecasting and emergency response efforts.</p>\n<p>The administration has also sought to overhaul the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees the federal response to disaster recovery.</p>\n<p>Trump had proposed redistributing FEMA’s responsibilities to state and local governments. In the meantime, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reportedly implemented a policy in June that required any FEMA expenses over $100,000 to be approved by her personally.</p>\n<p>That, critics say, has led to a slowdown in services. Just last Monday, CNN broke the news that Ken Pagurek, the head of FEMA’s search and rescue operations for urban areas, resigned in frustration over the bureaucratic hurdles.</p>\n<p>Trump himself has threatened to withhold disaster aid from states like California if they do not align with his policies on immigration and other issues. He and his allies have blamed Democrats for the Los Angeles wildfires.</p>\n<p>“This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113813952733064849\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in January.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"preventing-out-of-control-wildfires\">Preventing out-of-control wildfires</h2>\n<p>California, however, has sought to implement its own measures to address the challenges that come with longer and more intense fire seasons.</p>\n<p>Those tactics include a greater emphasis on fuel reduction efforts, including through prescribed burns, in which fire is intentionally introduced to a landscape under controlled circumstances to help thin excess vegetation.</p>\n<p>“Prescribed burns are something we’ve definitely encouraged. We’re doing a lot more of them than we used to,” said Jesse Torres, a spokesperson with Cal Fire.</p>\n<p>He says that such efforts typically take place in late spring, after periods of rainfall when wetter conditions reduce the risk of a prescribed burn spreading out of control.</p>\n<p>Fire scientists, however, say that the scale of those efforts has yet to reach the levels needed to have a serious impact on the state’s fire activity.</p>\n<p>While Cal Fire has a yearly goal of treating 500,000 acres (202,300 hectares) of land through fuel reduction efforts, Cal Fire says it has only covered about 156,000 acres (63,100 hectares) during the current fiscal year, although it expects that figure to increase.</p>\n<p>“There is still a lack of sufficient burning and thinning efforts,” said Stephens. “If forests were more resilient, the impact of these fires would be less extreme.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

They won’t let us in or out of Georgia. They keep telling us ‘tomorrow, tomorrow’. Some people have been here for more than a month and a half in terrible, unbearable conditions,” Lopata said.</p>\n<p>Originally from Dnipro in central Ukraine, Lopata said he had been living in Russia, where he has a Russian wife, two children and a sister, since 2005. But in 2010, he was convicted of murder. When he completed his sentence in 2024, he was sent to a deportation centre for another year. By then, the full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine was raging, so getting a one-way flight to Kyiv was impossible.</p>\n<p>“Last summer, they [the Russian authorities] promised to send me to Georgia. Then, in winter, they promised to send me to Ukraine through Belarus. Then, we were taken to the border of Georgia, which supposedly accepts us, but Georgia is not accepting,” Lopata said.</p>\n<p>Instead, when he reached the border on July 4, Lopata said, he was photographed, fingerprinted and had his documents confiscated by Georgian border officials before being taken to a cellar.</p>\n<p>“We don’t do anything. We sit in the basement,” Lopata continued, explaining that the men sleep in shifts because there are only 40 beds.</p>\n<p>The men are provided with very little and lack reliable medical assistance, instead having to rely on emergency care.</p>\n<p>“An ambulance comes almost every day, sometimes twice a day, because there are disabled people, there are sick people,” Lopata said, adding that there is someone with epilepsy, a person with HIV, and another with tuberculosis. “But they don’t offer anything besides immediate help. Yesterday, for example, they made an injection of painkiller, then said, ‘That’s it, we can’t help with anything else.’”</p>\n<p>Activists and volunteers try to bring essentials to the detainees each week.</p>\n<p>Food, household items and personal hygiene products are delivered by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMKVq3qIVHm/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volunteers Tbilisi</a>, an organisation helping Ukrainian refugees in Georgia.</p>\n<p>“There is no access to fresh air, there is a lot of heat and the cellars are closed,” organiser Maria Belkina told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“These are not conditions you can live in at all.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852453\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852453\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852453\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_20250722_031524_459-1753274221.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1027&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Russia deportees\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ukrainian deportees held at the Russia-Georgia borders are not allowed to cross the red barrier except under supervision [Courtesy of Nikolai Lopata]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"route-through-moldova-cancelled\">Route through Moldova cancelled</h2>\n<p>Anna Skripka, a lawyer for the NGO, Protection of Prisoners of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera that this problem has been mounting for the past two years of the war in Ukraine: “This humanitarian disaster started in 2023.”</p>\n<p>Skripka said some people have become so desperate they have tried to kill themselves. “They didn’t understand what was going on,” she said.</p>\n<p>“The conditions there are terrible.”</p>\n<p>According to Skripka, there are 84 men and seven women currently being detained, and while the women are held in a separate room, their conditions are also poor.</p>\n<p>“The women complain to me that they’re not being taken to the toilet,” Skripka said.</p>\n<p>“They asked us to buy them a bucket with a lid to go to the toilet.”</p>\n<p>Previously, deportees at this border crossing were transferred by bus to Tbilisi Airport to fly to Moldova and then on to Ukraine. That’s how Ukrainian activist Andriy Kolomiyets, considered a political prisoner by the Russian human rights group Memorial, returned home earlier this month after serving 10 years on drug and attempted murder charges.</p>\n<p>Skripka explained that 43 detainees managed to leave between early June and July, landing in Moldova and then getting a bus to Ukraine. But four of them got off the bus and stayed in Moldova, prompting the landlocked Eastern European country to halt cooperation.</p>\n<p>“They’re already back in Ukraine,” Skripka said about the missing four, which Al Jazeera could not confirm, “but Moldova said, ‘Stop, we do not want to risk it.’”</p>\n<p>As a result, since mid-July, Moldova has refused passage for Ukrainian deportees from Russia.</p>\n<p>While Georgia was cooperative at first, it has also begun refusing to allow deportees through on the basis that many are ex-convicts who have served prison time in Russia, seriously limiting the options for Ukrainians trying to return.</p>\n<p>“Most of these individuals have a serious criminal past and have been convicted numerous times for grave or particularly grave crimes,” the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p>\n<p>But Skripka said that it is unfair to smear them all as hardened criminals. Some were expelled from Russia for lacking proper paperwork. Others have had their Russian citizenship revoked.</p>\n<p>Their treatment, Skripka argues, goes beyond bureaucratic injustice; it raises serious legal and moral questions.</p>\n<p>“They were beaten, pushed from another country by the barrel of a machinegun … they are victims of war crimes,” Skripka said.</p>\n<p>Further complicating things, many of the deportees lack the proper documentation.</p>\n<p>Ukraine has been issuing “white passports” – emergency documents to allow citizens to travel home – but these only last for 30 days<b>.</b></p>\n<p>Some Ukrainian politicians have spoken out.</p>\n<p>Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha <a href=\"https://x.com/andrii_sybiha/status/1946526214425813071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> Russia of “weaponizing the deportation of Ukrainian citizens through Georgia”.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>“We are actively working with the Georgian and Moldovan sides to get the rest of our people transited to Ukraine,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>“To avoid further complications, we publicly offer Russia to send these categories of Ukrainian citizens directly to the Ukrainian border. We will be prepared to take them on from there. There are relevant parts of the border where this can be done.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-matter-of-national-security\">A matter of national security</h2>\n<p>Once detainees have returned to Ukraine, they must undergo a thorough security check.</p>\n<p>“They were in Russia for a long time.

He called the climate crisis “an existential problem of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life and the very health of our planet”.</p>\n<p>Notably, the court said a “clean, healthy and sustainable environment” is a human right. That paves the way for other legal actions, including states returning to the ICJ to hold each other to account as well as domestic lawsuits.</p>\n<p>While the ICJ’s ruling is not binding, it said that countries themselves have an obligation to take binding measures to comply with climate treaties. But crucially, the ICJ said industrialised nations have a legal obligation to take the lead in combating climate change, due to their greater historical responsibility for emissions.</p>\n<p>The judges also affirmed that countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement must ensure their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), their individual national climate plans, are “progressive” and reflect the “highest possible ambition,” in line with the treaty’s aim to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>\n<p>The opinion was immediately welcomed by environmental groups. Oxfam climate change policy lead Nafkote Dabi said: “This ruling elevates national climate commitments everywhere by confirming that countries must reduce emissions enough to protect the universal rights to life, food, health and a clean environment.</p>\n<p>“All countries, particularly rich ones, now have to cut their emissions faster and phase out fossil fuels. Rich countries have to increase their financing to Global South countries to help them reduce emissions and protect their people from past and future harm. This is not a wish list – it is international law.”</p>\n<p>Danilo Garrido, legal counsel at Greenpeace International, said the opinion marked the “start of a new era of climate accountability at a global level”.</p>\n<p>“The message of the court is clear: the production, consumption and granting of licences and subsidies for fossil fuels could be breaches of international law,” he said. “Polluters must stop emitting and must pay for the harms they have caused.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"two-fundamental-questions\">Two fundamental questions</h2>\n<p>After years of lobbying by vulnerable island nations fearing they could be submerged under rising sea waters, the United Nations General Assembly asked the ICJ in 2023 for an advisory opinion, a nonbinding but important basis for international obligations.</p>\n<p>The landmark opinion of the 15 judges of the ICJ – who all voted unanimously in favour of the opinion – will carry legal and political weight and is likely to determine the course of future climate action across the world, including whether polluters should be made to pay for their actions.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3852830\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852830\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852830\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/afp_68810b168d5f-1753287446.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Yuji Iwasawa (C) and members issue first Advisory Opinion (AO) on States' legal obligations to address climate change, in The Hague on July 23, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852830\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">President of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Yuji Iwasawa (centre) and members issue their first advisory opinion on states’ legal obligations to address climate change, The Hague, the Netherlands, July 23, 2025 [AFP]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Judges waded through tens of thousands of pages of written submissions and heard two weeks of <a href=\"/news/2024/12/14/icj-weighs-legal-responsibility-for-climate-change-future-of-our-planet\">oral arguments</a> during the ICJ’s biggest-ever case, as they sought to pull together different strands of environmental law into a definitive international standard.</p>\n<p>The UN asked the ICJ, a UN court that adjudicates disputes between nations, to address two key questions. What are states obliged to do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions now and for future generations? And what are the consequences for states whose emissions cause harm, particularly to vulnerable island states?</p>\n<p>The case was led by the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu and backed by more than 130 countries.</p>\n<p>Before the ruling, supporters of climate action gathered outside the court, chanting: “What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!”</p>\n<h2 id=\"paris-agreement\">Paris Agreement</h2>\n<p>In two weeks of hearings last December at the ICJ, the United States, the world’s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, along with other top polluters, told the judges that existing climate treaties like the 2015 Paris Agreement, which are largely nonbinding, should be the basis for determining their responsibilities.</p>\n<p>The Paris Agreement does not explicitly provide for direct compensation for past damage caused by pollution, although at UN talks in 2022, wealthy nations did agree to <a href=\"/news/2024/11/23/un-climate-talks-in-disarray-as-developing-nations-stage-walkout\">create a fund</a> to help vulnerable countries deal with current impacts caused by past pollution.</p>\n<p>The Paris Agreement saw more than 190 countries commit efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>\n<p>But it has failed to curb global greenhouse gas emissions, and last year, the UN warned in a report that current climate policies will result in global warming of more than 3C (5.4F) above preindustrial levels by 2100.</p>\n<p>Legal experts say the ruling is a victory for small island and low-lying states that had asked the court to clarify states’ responsibilities.</p>\n<p>“The ICJ rejected arguments by the likes of the US and UK that governments are bound only by climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement and did not have stronger obligations under international law,” Dabi said.</p>\n<p>“We now have a powerful tool for holding countries to account for their obligations, especially in protecting the world’s most marginalised people and future generations of humanity.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
