It is instead a purposefully slow and heavily conditioned pathway.</p><p>Official figures expose a stark gap between demand and reality.</p><p>Between May 8, 2024, and January 18, 2025, only 459 patients were evacuated through Karem Abu Salem. During a subsequent ceasefire period between January 19 and March 17, 2025, when Rafah was partially reopened, the number rose to 1,702 patients, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/we-just-sit-and-cry-gazas-cancer-patients-die-waiting-for-treatment\">including hundreds of children</a>, clearly indicating that evacuations improve only when additional movement routes were available.</p><p>Once that period ended and reliance on Karem Abu Salem resumed, evacuations again dropped sharply to just 352 patients between March 18 and July 16, 2025.</p><p>By contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO) today reports that more than 18,500 patients in Gaza remain in urgent, life-saving need of medical treatment outside the Strip.</p><p>The disparity between need and outcome shows that evacuations conducted over many months addressed only a tiny fraction of actual demand, leaving thousands trapped on open-ended waiting lists in war-battered Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"cruel-and-inhuman-treatment\">‘Cruel and inhuman treatment’</h2><p id=\"more-than-1-600-palestinians-have-died-while-waiting-for-healthcare-abroad-in-this\">More than 1,600 Palestinians have died while waiting for healthcare abroad. In this context, al-Hussaini said restrictions on movement amount to one of Israel’s gravest violations during the genocide.</p><p>“Thousands of wounded and ill Palestinians, including children and cancer patients, were denied the ability to travel outside Gaza for medical treatment, or were forced to wait for weeks or months under complex and opaque procedures. In many cases, their health deteriorated or they died before permission to leave was granted,” she said.</p><p>“Such practices cannot be justified on security grounds and constitute a direct violation of the right to life, amounting to cruel and inhuman treatment.”</p><p>When Rafah was partially reopened this month after the United States applied pressure on Israel’s leaders, the underlying reality did not fundamentally change. On February 2, the WHO announced the evacuation of just five patients and seven companions.</p><p>It was a tightly controlled border opening with Egypt governed by multiple layers of scrutiny: small numbers allowed to cross, prior Israeli security authorisation for returnees, European screening at Rafah, followed by a second identification and interrogation process in a corridor administered by the Israeli army.</p><p>Al-Hussaini said the restrictions imposed during the war, taken in totality, show that Israel uses freedom of movement in Gaza to regulate the daily life of Palestinians, determining who receives aid, who accesses health treatment, and who remains trapped in the Strip, placing these policies at the heart of legal debates around proportionality, the prohibition of collective punishment, and the obligations of an occupying power.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298933\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298933\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4298933\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/afp_6988f477719a-1770583159.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Etedal Rayyan (29), who recently returned back to Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah border crossing, looks out the window of her heavily-damaged house in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in the northern Gaza Strip on February 8, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4298933\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Etedal Rayyan, 29, recently returned to Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah border crossing [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"blockade-as-permanent-policy-since-2007\">Blockade as permanent policy since 2007</h2><p>Israeli restrictions on freedom of movement in Gaza did not begin with the current war. Since 2007, they have evolved from purportedly temporary security measures into a permanent policy structuring the lives of 2.4 million people.</p><p>Following Hamas’s rise to power in 2007 through democratic elections, Israel imposed a comprehensive land, sea and air blockade. The International Committee of the Red Cross has consistently stated that the comprehensive closure of Gaza targets the civilian population as a whole, infringes on fundamental rights, and constitutes a form of collective punishment prohibited under international humanitarian law.</p><p>UN agencies have similarly stressed that long-term restrictions, even during periods of relative calm, lack any legitimate legal justification.</p><p>Economically and socially, the World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) have documented how the blockade has paralysed Gaza’s economy, eroded its productive base and driven unprecedented levels of poverty and unemployment. Severe restrictions on goods, raw materials and exports have made any form of sustainable economic recovery impossible, entrenching chronic dependence on humanitarian aid.</p><p>Israel further reinforced the blockade by a policy of separating Gaza from the occupied West Bank, treating the Strip as a distinct territorial unit despite their status as a single territory under international law.</p><p>UN special rapporteurs and rights groups say this separation has fractured social and family ties, and obstructed access to education, work and healthcare.</p><p>For more than 15 years, these restrictions have been recalibrated after each escalation. The severe constraints imposed during the current war are merely an intensification of a system in place since 2007.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4298188\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gaza-death-count-1770566375.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-feb 4, 2026_Gaza death count-1765555845\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"controlling-food-water-medicine\">Controlling food, water, medicine</h2><p>In March 2024, OCHA reported that only 26 percent of aid missions were facilitated by Israel’s army, while 40 percent were denied, 20 percent delayed, 11 percent impeded and 3 percent withdrawn.</p><p>May 2024 marked a turning point, as crossing closures and restrictions led to a sharp reduction in aid and humanitarian personnel entry.</p><p>As security conditions on convoy routes deteriorated, aid increasingly failed to reach the intended destinations. This prompted the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to suspend aid entry through the Karem Abu Salem crossing on December 1, 2024, citing unsafe conditions and repeated looting incidents. In many cases, aid was unloaded on roads or seized before reaching warehouses.</p><p>In August 2025, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global hunger monitor, confirmed that <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/famine-confirmed-in-northern-gaza-global-hunger-monitor-says\">famine had taken hold</a> in northern Gaza.</p><p>Subsequent updates reiterated that famine risk would persist as long as Israeli military operations continued and humanitarian access remained restricted, noting that the vast majority of the population faced extreme levels of food deprivation.</p><p>“Restrictions on movement were among the gravest violations. Movement control was not incidental or administrative – it was used as a central tool to manage and pressure the civilian population,” said al-Hussaini.</p><p>She described Israel’s actions as “a clear violation of international humanitarian law, including the prohibition on the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare”.</p><p>Israeli restrictions fragmented humanitarian flows, increased risks along convoy routes, and at times forced aid agencies to suspend operations entirely.</p><p>“The population was left trapped in a cycle of hunger, driven not only by shortages but by the denial of access, freedom of movement, and ultimately the right to survive,” al-Hussaini said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298926\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298926\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4298926 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_6988f3c8e4625-1770582984.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Siham Omran, 54, recently returned from Egypt after completing medical treatment, cooks food over a fire beside her tent in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, Saturday, Feb. 7, 2026.

A key promise: If his party wins the country’s February 12 election, it would lay the ground for Bangladesh to quadruple its gross domestic product (GDP) to $2 trillion by 2040.</p><p>Addressing politicians and diplomats, the 67-year-old Rahman pledged investment in technology-driven agriculture, manufacturing, information technology, education and healthcare, alongside higher foreign investment and increased public spending.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Economists in Dhaka have cast doubt on whether sweeping promises can be financed, describing the manifesto as heavy on slogans but short on detail. But for Jamaat’s leadership, the manifesto is less about fiscal arithmetic than signalling intent, say analysts.</p><p>For years, critics have tried to portray Jamaat, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, as driven too much by religious doctrine to be able to govern a young, diverse, forward-looking population. The manifesto, by contrast, presents a party long excluded from power as a credible alternative – and as a force that sees no contradiction between its religious foundations and the modern future that Bangladeshis aspire to.</p><p>His audience was telling too.</p><p>Until recently, Bangladesh’s business elites and foreign diplomats either kept their distance from Jamaat or engaged with it discreetly. Now, they are doing so openly.</p><p>Over the past few months, European, Western, and even Indian diplomats have sought meetings with Rahman, a figure who, until not long ago, was seen by many internationally as almost politically untouchable.</p><p>For a leader whose party has been banned twice, including by ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s administration, the coming election is raising a question few would have dared to ask even a year ago: Could Shafiqur Rahman become Bangladesh’s next prime minister?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293577\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293577\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293577\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-01-14T133248Z_1708878016_RC2GRIA4B3YA_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-JAMAAT-1770410521.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Shafiqur  Rahman, Ameer (President) Jamaat-e-Islami, poses for a photograph after an interview with Reuters, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 31, 2025.

It upended the country’s political order, hollowing out the familiar duopoly that for decades defined Bangladeshi politics – the rivalry between Hasina’s Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).</p><p>With the Awami League effectively barred from the political field and the BNP the only big party left standing, a vacuum emerged. Many initially assumed it would be filled by the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP). Instead, Jamaat – long pushed to the margins – moved to occupy the space.</p><p>As Bangladesh heads towards a high-stakes election in less than two weeks, Jamaat has now emerged as one of the country’s two most prominent political forces. Some pre-election polls now place it in direct competition with the BNP.</p><p>At the centre of that transformation is Rahman, according to Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair, Jamaat’s assistant secretary-general and a longtime associate of the party chief.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Zubair, who worked closely with Rahman when he led Jamaat in the country’s Sylhet region, said the resurgence is the result of years of grassroots social work and political survival under repression.</p><p>Rahman, a soft-spoken former government doctor, took over as Jamaat’s chief in 2019, at a time when the party was banned under Hasina.

Everyone in the party trusts him,” said Lokman Hossain, a Jamaat supporter in Dhaka. He said that over the past year and a half, the party has reached far more people than before, with Rahman’s appeal beyond Jamaat’s traditional base playing a central role.</p><p>Rahman’s challenge, however, is no longer purely electoral – it is reputational.</p><p>As new supporters drift towards Jamaat, he is attempting to reframe how the party is seen: less as an Islamic force defined by doctrine and history, and more as a vehicle for clean governance, discipline and change.</p><p>Whether this reinvention is substantive or merely cosmetic will define both Rahman’s leadership and Jamaat’s future, say analysts.</p><p>Any attempt to recast Jamaat’s public image, however, runs up against the unresolved legacy of 1971. For decades, the party’s role during Bangladesh’s war of independence – when it sided with Pakistan – and the subsequent trials and executions of several senior leaders have shaped perceptions of Jamaat at home and abroad.</p><p>Rahman has approached that history with caution. He has avoided detailed admissions but has recently acknowledged what he calls Jamaat’s “past mistakes”, asking forgiveness if the party caused harm.</p><p>The language marks a subtle shift from outright denial, while stopping short of naming specific actions or responsibilities. Supporters say this reflects political realism rather than evasion – an attempt to move the party beyond its dark chapter. Critics, by contrast, see the ambiguity as deliberate, arguing it softens Jamaat’s image without confronting the substance of its past.</p><p>“He knows what those mistakes were,” said Saleh Uddin Ahmed, a United States-based Bangladeshi academic and political analyst. “But stating them explicitly would destabilise his leadership inside the party.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ahmed nonetheless considers Rahman more moderate than Jamaat’s previous leaders, noting his relative willingness to discuss unresolved historical questions and address issues such as women’s rights – topics the party long avoided. “This opening up is also happening because of increased public and media scrutiny,” Ahmed said. “People are asking questions now, and Jamaat has to respond.”</p><p>Jamaat’s effort to reach voters beyond its traditional base and reassure foreign audiences, while retaining the loyalty of its conservative supporters, has created a persistent tension – one that has often resulted in dual messaging.</p><p>That balancing act has been evident in public statements by senior leaders. Abdullah Md Taher, one of Rahman’s closest aides, in an interview with Al Jazeera, said Jamaat is a moderate party, adding that it would not impose or strictly adhere to Islamic law.</p><p>The party has also, for the first time in its history, <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/6/if-jamaat-comes-to-power-bangladeshi-hindus-will-be-safe-i-am-the-proof\">nominated a Hindu candidate</a>.</p><p>Yet when addressing conservative supporters, the party continues to emphasise its Islamic identity, with some backers encouraging votes for Jamaat as an act of religious merit – a practice the rival BNP has criticised as the misuse of religious sentiment.</p><p>The strategy appears to have helped Jamaat re-enter political conversations that were once closed to it. At the same time, it has sharpened doubts about how far Rahman is willing – or able – to go in reinterpreting the party’s past and ideology as he courts a broader electorate.</p><p>Those limits are most visible in Jamaat’s stance on women and leadership. They came into sharp focus during his Al Jazeera interview in which Shafiqur Rahman said it was not possible for a woman to hold the party’s top position – a remark that reignited longstanding criticism of Jamaat’s gender politics, despite its attempts to project a more inclusive image.</p><p>“Allah has made everyone with a distinct nature. A man cannot bear a child or breastfeed,” Rahman said. “There are physical limitations that cannot be denied. When a mother gives birth, how will she carry out these responsibilities? It is not possible.”</p><p>Critics argue that the stance exposes the limits of Jamaat’s claims of moderation.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, an adjunct researcher at the Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative at Western Sydney University in Australia and author of Narratives of Bangladesh, also questioned Jamaat’s internal culture, noting that even female leaders who publicly endorse such views operate within a male-dominated hierarchy. He was referring to the party’s large number of female supporters and members, including women within its Majlis-e-Shura, the highest decision-making body. “It reflects a structure where women follow what men say in that party,” he said.</p><p>The criticism carries particular weight given the movement that helped reopen political space for Jamaat itself. The July 2024 uprising against Hasina, analysts note, saw extensive participation by women, often at the front lines of protest. “Women were part of that movement as much as men, if not more,” Hasan said. “Undermining them now gives Jamaat a deeply problematic outlook.”</p><p>Political historians argue this is not a new contradiction but a longstanding one. Since contesting elections under its own symbol in 1986, Jamaat has never fielded a woman candidate for a general parliamentary seat, relying instead on reserved quotas.</p><p>“This isn’t a temporary position or a tactical lapse,” said political historian and author Mohiuddin Ahmad.“It reflects the party’s ideological structure, and that structure has not fundamentally changed.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293590\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293590\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293590\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26021348970837-1770411239.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Head of Bangladesh's interim government Muhammad Yunus, center, with Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Ameer Shafiqur Rahman, inaugurate the July Uprising Memorial Museum, once the official residence of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026.

White-bearded, soft-spoken and visibly attentive to supporters, Rahman fits the image.</p><p>“He connects with young people through his words,” said Abdullah Al Maruf, a Gen Z law student from Chattogram and a Jamaat supporter. “There is something about his recent work that feels like the relationship between a grandfather and his grandchildren. Where BNP leaders often belittle young people, Shafiqur speaks to them with respect.”</p><p>Maruf added that Rahman’s appeal extends beyond Jamaat’s traditional base. “Outside the usual Jamaat circle, he is more popular than previous Jamaat leaders,” he said.</p><p>Zubair, Jamaat’s assistant secretary-general, described the party’s outreach beyond traditional voters – such as the decision to nominate a Hindu candidate – not as a tactical move but one rooted in Jamaat’s constitutional framework rather than political expediency.</p><p>“Our constitution allows any Bangladeshi, regardless of religion, to be part of the party if they support our political, economic and social policies,” he said. “Supporting our religious doctrine is not a requirement for political participation.”</p><p>Jamaat leaders argue the move reflects a broader effort to shift the party’s public image – from one defined primarily by theology to one centred on governance and accountability. “We are emphasising corruption-free politics, discipline and public service,” Zubair said. “People have seen our leaders stand with them during floods, during COVID, and during the July uprising. That is why support is growing.”</p><p>Krishna Nandi, the party’s Hindu candidate from the city of Khulna, agrees. “When families fall into poverty, Jamaat-linked welfare networks step in without asking about religion or political loyalty. This culture of service explains why many citizens see Jamaat not as a party of slogans but as a party of discipline, structure and responsibility,” <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/6/if-jamaat-comes-to-power-bangladeshi-hindus-will-be-safe-i-am-the-proof\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nandi wrote for Al Jazeera</a>.</p><p>The Jamaat’s outreach has also extended well beyond domestic audiences. Zubair said the party’s leadership has held meetings with Indian diplomats in Dhaka who paid a courtesy visit to Shafiqur when he was ill. Jamaat figures were invited to India’s 77th Republic Day reception at the Indian High Commission last month – an unprecedented step.</p><p>European and Western diplomats, he added, have also sought engagements with Rahman in recent months. That shift has been mirrored in Washington. In a leaked audio recording reported by The Washington Post, a US diplomat was quoted as saying American officials wanted to “be friends” with the Jamaat, asking journalists whether members of the party’s influential student wing might be willing to appear in their programmes.</p><p>As Jamaat’s international engagement expands – and as it emerges as a serious electoral force alongside frontrunner BNP – many general supporters express confidence in Rahman’s leadership.</p><p>“He is a patriot,” said Abul Kalam, a voter in Rahman’s Dhaka constituency. “Whether as prime minister or opposition leader, he will lead us well.”</p><p>What lies next for the party is unclear. But analysts say that irrespective of the outcome of the elections, Rahman’s stature within Jamaat – and beyond, in Bangladesh – appears resolute.</p><p>“Shafiqur Rahman is an experienced politician and is frequently in the headlines,” Ahmad, the political historian, said. “His political thinking is not yet fully clear, but his grip over the party is evident.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Police raids, prosecutions and a freeze of its assets forced the newspaper’s closure in June 2021.</p><p>The final edition sold a million copies.</p><p>Lai’s daughter, Claire, told The Associated Press news agency that she hopes authorities see the wisdom in releasing her father, a Roman Catholic. She said their faith rests in God. “We will never stop fighting until he is free,” she said.</p><p>Ahead of the sentencing, Hong Kong Free Press reported that police detained a woman outside the West Kowloon court after finding an Apple Daily keychain in her possession. At least two other activists were also searched, including Tsang Kin-shing, a member of the now-disbanded League of Social Democrats.</p><p>The sentencing comes against the backdrop of heightened restrictions on Hong Kong media.</p><p>The Hong Kong Journalists Association said in 2024 that dozens of journalists faced “systematic and organised” harassment and intimidation, including leaked personal information and death threats.</p><p>According to Reporters Without Borders, at least 900 Hong Kong journalists lost their jobs in the four years following the enactment of the national security law in the city.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Local media reported another reformist figure, Feizollah Arab Sorkhi, was also summoned.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"deadly-crackdown\">Deadly crackdown</h2><p>The arrests come amid anger in Iran over the deaths of thousands of Iranians during the January unrest. The protests began in the capital, Tehran, over a worsening economic crisis, but quickly escalated into a nationwide antigovernment movement.</p><p>Iranian authorities labelled the protesters as “terrorists” and blamed the “riots” on foreign interference from Israel and the US.</p><p>The government later said <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">3,117 people were killed</a> during the unrest and rejected claims by the United Nations and international human rights organisations that state forces were behind the killings, most of which occurred on the nights of January 8 and 9.</p><p>The US-based <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">Human Rights Activists News Agency</a> (HRANA) said it has verified 6,961 deaths and is investigating 11,730 other cases. The organisation reports that at least 51,591 people have been arrested during and after the nationwide protests.</p><p>UN special rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, said more than 20,000 people may have been killed during the protests as information remains limited amid heavy internet filtering by the state.</p><p>Reacting to the protest killings in a statement in late January, the Reformist Front had said it grieved “the great catastrophe” alongside the Iranian people, and called for sweeping reforms and the formation of an independent fact-finding mission. It had also threatened to dissolve in case the “destructive methods of the past” persist.</p><p>Mir Hossein Mousavi, former leader of the Reformist Front, who has been under house arrest since the Green Movement of 2009, released his strongest statement to date last month, calling for a democratic transition away from the “Islamic Republic” and for holding a constitutional referendum.</p><p>“How many ways must people say that they do not want this system and do not believe your lies? Enough. The game is over,” he wrote last month. At least four people, including a reformist figure and three activists, were arrested for helping draft and publish the statement.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from Tehran, said the politicians arrested on Sunday and Monday face “serious allegations”.</p><p>He said Aminzadeh was a former deputy foreign minister during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, who governed from 1997 to 2005, and that Asgharzadeh is a former lawmaker who was a student leader “involved in the takeover of the US embassy” in 1979.</p><p>“These figures have a background of political activism and imprisonment,” Asadi said. “So this is not the first time that they are facing such allegations. And they are going through a trajectory that could pave the way for imprisonment for them,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Analysts say the crackdown is a sign the Iranian government is trying to send a message to any other dissidents who challenge it.</p><p>“These are the people who have been calling for more political liberalisation. Some of them have called for the end of the Islamic Republic,” said Sina Azodi, the director of the Middle East Studies programme at George Washington University in Washington, DC.</p><p>“This tells me the Islamic Republic has decided to close any avenues for political dissent and, rather, to rule with an iron fist, through crackdowns and more fear-mongering among any political dissidents.”</p><h2 id=\"talks-with-us\">Talks with US</h2><p>The Iranian clampdown has also ratcheted up tensions with Washington.</p><p>When the protests first broke out, US President Donald Trump – who is seeking to curb Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes – threatened Tehran with new attacks if it used force against the protesters. Trump, who had ordered the US military strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites last June, also deployed a naval “armada” to the Gulf region.</p><p>The move prompted Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to warn of a “regional war” if Iran is attacked, as well as a push by regional powers to ease the tensions.</p><p>The diplomacy resulted in Iran and the US holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday. President Masoud Pezeshkian described the discussions as “a step forward” in a social media post on Sunday and said his government favoured continued dialogue.</p><p>Another round of negotiations is scheduled for next week.</p><p>Phyllis Bennis, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that she does not expect the latest arrests in Iran to affect the ongoing nuclear negotiations.</p><p>“I am not sure that these arrests are going to be a specific focus of the talks as they continue,” she told Al Jazeera. However, she noted the arrests come amid the talks in Oman and a planned visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the US capital.</p><p>Netanyahu will probably demand Iran halt all uranium enrichment, end its missile programme, and stop supporting regional allies, Bennis said.</p><p>“It’s essentially a call for Iranian surrender,” she said.</p><p>“So there’ll be a big question as to whether the US is going to go along with the Israeli position or maintain its own position, which historically has been slightly different than Israel’s, particularly on the question of nuclear enrichment.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But both showed the flaws that have opened the door for Arsenal to potentially end their long wait to be crowned champions once again.</p><p class=\"p1\">Haaland has scored just once from open play in his last 13 games, and an uncharacteristic lack of confidence from the Norwegian showed with the best chance of the first half inside the opening two minutes.</p><p class=\"p1\">Silva’s clever pass split the Liverpool defence, but Haaland’s shot lacked conviction under pressure from Milos Kerkez, and Alisson Becker was able to save low to his left.</p><p class=\"p1\">Haaland hooked another effort straight at Alisson among 10 first-half City attempts without a breakthrough.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Second-half slumps have been a consistent feature of City’s season, and the visitors again faded in the second period until a late flurry saved their title challenge.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hugo Ekitike should have opened the scoring when he completely miscued his header just before the hour mark after a lightning-fast Liverpool break.</p><p class=\"p1\">Marc Guehi was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card when he dragged down Mo Salah just outside the box.</p><p class=\"p1\">But it was City who were left fuming at the award of the free kick that led to the opener when Ryan Gravenberch went down under minimal contact.</p><p class=\"p1\">Szoboszlai scored the only goal with an outrageous free kick when Arsenal visited Anfield in August and produced another stunning strike that clipped the inside of the post before finding the net.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, the Hungarian went from hero to villain when City levelled six minutes from time.</p><p class=\"p1\">Szoboszlai played Silva onside as he slid in to volley home Haaland’s header for City’s first second-half goal in the Premier League this year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Alisson then wiped out Matheus Nunes to concede a penalty and Haaland kept his cool from the spot to put City in front.</p><p class=\"p1\">Pep Guardiola’s men still needed a stunning save from Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip behind Alexis Mac Allister’s deflected shot.</p><p class=\"p1\">With Alisson remaining forward from the resulting corner, the Liverpool goal was open when Cherki took aim from the halfway line to roll the ball into an empty net.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, Haaland and Szoboszlai’s grappling as the ball trickled towards the goal saw the strike ruled out, with a free kick awarded to City instead, and the Liverpool player given his marching orders.</p><p>Silva, who was named player of the match, told Sky Sports that it was a vital win for City.</p><p>“I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over.

She arrived on a visitor’s visa, staying with her mother, a US citizen, in Paterson, New Jersey, home to one of the largest Arab communities in the country.</p><p>She later transitioned from a tourist visa to a student visa, according to her habeas corpus petition.</p><p>After her mother applied for Kordia to remain in the US as the relative of a citizen, her green card application was approved in 2021. However, she received incorrect advice from a teacher that led to her student visa expiring in 2022, according to her lawyers.</p><p>Before her arrest, Kordia worked as a server at a Middle Eastern restaurant on Palestine Way in New Jersey and helped to care for her autistic half-brother.</p><p>Kordia was moved to protest against Israel’s war due to personal loss. Since the start of the war in October 2023, Kordia said, more than 200 of her relatives have been killed.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 170,000 in a war that human rights groups, a United Nations commission and a growing number of scholars said amounts to genocide.

She has been held at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas.</p><p>A leader of the protests, Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student with Algerian citizenship and a US green card, and others have been released. Khalil, however, is still in a legal battle to remain in the US with his American wife and child.
