destructive foreign wars, President Donald Trump has initiated a full-scale offensive to topple the Iranian government just more than a year after returning to office.</p><p>The attacks on Iran, considered a violation of international law, mark the most aggressive escalation yet of Trump’s embrace of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-many-countries-has-trump-bombed-in-2025\">military power</a> to pummel foreign governments and extract concessions demanded by his administration.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Despite widespread scepticism among the US public about Trump’s military campaigns abroad, his administration has carried out brash attacks on the governments of Iran and Venezuela, while also stepping up US strikes in the name of counterterrorism in Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Here’s a quick look at Trump’s military actions abroad since returning to office in January 2025.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran\">Iran</h2><p>The joint US-Israeli <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/us-israel-bomb-iran-a-timeline-of-talks-and-threats-leading-up-to-attacks\">attacks on Iran</a> that began on Saturday morning Tehran time have so far killed at least 201 people, according to the Iranian Red Crescent, and fuelled fears about a widening war that could bring chaos and destruction to countries across the region.</p><p>The US strikes, which Trump said were “major combat operations” aimed at regime change in Tehran, appear far more extensive than a previous US attack on Iran in June 2025.</p><p>Those strikes, which, like the current attacks, took place as Iran was engaged in diplomatic talks with the US, targeted Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.</p><p>Trump said that the attacks, which took place during a 12-day war launched by Israel against Iran that killed more than 600 Iranians, had “<a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">obliterated” the country’s nuclear </a>capabilities.</p><p>Both US attacks on Iran are considered illegal under international law.</p><h2 id=\"venezuela\">Venezuela</h2><p>The Trump administration carried out an attack on Venezuela in January 2026, bombing the capital, Caracas, and abducting President Nicolas Maduro, a longtime figure of US ire.</p><p>The Venezuelan minister of defence said that 83 people were killed in the attack, including members of the Venezuelan and Cuban security services, as well as Venezuelan civilians.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"boat-strikes-in-latin-america\">Boat strikes in Latin America</h2><p>Since September, the US has carried out at least 45 strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in Latin America and the Caribbean, killing at least 151 people, according to a tally from the watchdog group Airwars.</p><p>Trump and his allies have framed the strikes as an effort to combat regional narcotics trafficking and have declared several criminal groups as foreign terrorist organisations, stating that drug trafficking is the equivalent of an armed attack on the US.</p><p>UN officials and international law experts have roundly rejected those arguments, stating that the strikes are a campaign of illegal <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/experts-say-us-boat-strikes-are-illegal-killings-can-they-be-stopped\">extrajudicial killings</a> that erase the distinction between criminal activity and armed conflict.</p><h2 id=\"nigeria\">Nigeria</h2><p>The Trump administration has also stepped up military operations in Africa, expanding collaboration with local governments and carrying out air strikes under the guise of counterterrorism.</p><p>In Nigeria, Trump has carried out a series of attacks and deployed <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/us-deploys-100-soldiers-to-nigeria-for-training-mission-nigerian-military\">100 US military personnel</a> to train Nigerian forces, threatening US strikes if the government does not do more to address what Trump says is a “genocide” of Christians in Nigeria by Muslim groups.</p><p>Nigerian officials say that the largely debunked claim miscasts widespread and violent civil conflict that has racked the country for years as a case of anti-Christian persecution.</p><p>Trump announced that the US had carried out “powerful and deadly” attacks targeting what he said were members of ISIL (ISIS) affiliates in northwestern Nigeria in December 2025, with the government’s cooperation.</p><p>Questions <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/us-bombs-target-isil-in-nigeria-whats-really-going-on\">have emerged</a> about whether the targets struck were in fact associated with ISIL, which is not known to operate in the region targeted in the strikes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"somalia\">Somalia</h2><p>The Trump administration has expanded US military engagement in Somalia, where it has long worked with the government to counter armed groups such as al-Shabab and a regional offshoot of ISIL.</p><p>The US has massively <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/us-dramatically-escalates-air-strikes-on-somalia-under-trump-this-year\">stepped up</a> air strikes in Somalia during Trump’s second term, with the New America Foundation finding that the US carried out at least 111 attacks in 2025. Monitors say the figure surpasses the total of attacks under the George W Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden administrations combined.</p><h2 id=\"yemen\">Yemen</h2><p>The US launched dozens of naval and air strikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebel group between March and May of 2025, destroying infrastructure and killing dozens of civilians.</p><p>The Houthis had carried out attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea as a form of pressure on Israel to end its genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>Human Rights Watch said in June that a US strike on the country’s Ras Isa port in Hodeidah in April 2025 killed more than 80 civilians and should be investigated as a war crime.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2025/5/6/trump-says-bombing-of-yemen-to-stop-as-oman-confirms-us-houthi-ceasefire\">ceasefire brokered by Oman</a> was announced in May.</p><h2 id=\"syria\">Syria</h2><p>The US conducted strikes on ISIL targets in Syria in December 2025, following <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/joint-syrian-us-patrol-comes-under-attack-near-palmyra-state-media\">an attack</a> that killed two US soldiers and a translator in the city of Palymra.</p><p>Trump said the US was “inflicting very serious retaliation” on those responsible for the attack, which the Syrian government said was carried out by an employee of the state security services who was set to be expelled due to his hardline views.</p><h2 id=\"iraq\">Iraq</h2><p>The US killed a high-profile ISIL commander in a strike in the al-Anbar province of Iraq in March 2025.</p><p>The group’s second-in-command, Abdallah “Abu Khadijah” Malli Muslih al-Rifai, and another unnamed operative were reported to have been killed in the strikes.</p><p>“His miserable life was terminated, along with another member of ISIS, in coordination with the Iraqi Government and the Kurdish Regional Government,” Trump said in a social media post at the time. “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The grinding conflict, coupled with a sense of isolation among many Iranians as Western countries backed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, deepened Khamenei’s distrust of the West generally and the United States, in particular, analysts say.</p><p>That sentiment would underpin his decades-long rule and cement the idea that Iran must remain in a constant state of defence against external and internal threats.</p><p>“People think [of Iran] as a theocracy, because he [Khamenei] wears the turban and the language of the state is the language of religion, but in reality, he was a wartime president that came out of war with the assumption that Iran is vulnerable and in need of security,” said Vali Nasr, Iranian affairs expert and author of Iran’s Grand Strategy: A Political History. “That the US is hostile to Iran; and that the revolution, the Islamic republic and nationalism, are not separated” and that so, they need to be protected.</p><p>Under this vision, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) evolved from a paramilitary force into a powerful security, political and economic institution that became central to broader Iran’s influence across the region. Khamenei also promoted a “resistance economy” to foster self-reliance in the face of punishing Western sanctions, maintained a strong scepticism of engagement with the West, and responded forcefully to critics who argued his focus on defence was blocking much-needed reforms.</p><p>But his rule was seriously tested over the years, including in 2009, when protesters who took to the streets over what they claimed was a rigged presidential election were met with a brutal crackdown, and in 2022 over women’s rights.</p><p>Possibly the biggest challenge to his rule came in January when protests triggered by economic hardship morphed into nationwide upheaval, with many protesters directly calling for the overthrow of the Islamic republic. The authorities’ response led to one of the most violent confrontations since the country’s 1979 revolution.</p><p>Critics saw him as being too out-of-touch with a young population seeking reforms and economic improvement over isolationism and forever shadow wars with the US and Israel.</p><p>“Iranians paid too high a cost for this degree of insistence on national independence – in the process, he lost the Iranian population because they no longer believed in the wisdom of this independence,” Nasr said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3859600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3859600\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3859600\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/afp_6885ea2da6df-1753606701.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - A demonstrator carries a portrait of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a rally in solidarity with Palestinians and in condemnation of Israel and the US, after Friday prayers in Tehran, on July 25, 2025.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3859600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A demonstrator carries a portrait of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a rally in solidarity with Palestinians and in condemnation of Israel and the United States, after Friday prayers in Tehran [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"education\">Education</h2><p>Born in 1939 in the holy Shia city of Mashhad in northeast Iran, Khamenei was the son of a renowned Muslim leader and ethnic Azerbaijani from neighbouring Iraq. The family first settled in Tabriz in northwestern Iran before moving to Mashhad, a place favoured by religious pilgrims, where Khamenei’s father led an Azerbaijani mosque.</p><p>Khamenei has described his mother, Khadijeh Mirdamadi, as an avid Quran and book reader who instilled in her son a love of literature and poetry, and later supported her son as he joined the movement against the Pahlavi dynasty’s rule.</p><p>Khamenei started his studies at age four, learning the Quran, and completed his primary education at the first Islamic school in Mashhad. He did not finish high school, instead attending theology schools and learning from renowned Islamic scholars of the time, like his father, and Sheikh Hashem Ghazvini. In the following years, he continued his studies at more prestigious Shia centres for higher education in Najaf and Qom.</p><p>In Qom, he learned from and became close to a number of other famous Muslim scholars, including Ayatollah Khomeini, who was popular among young seminarians for his defiance of the shah.</p><p>Khamenei taught jurisprudence courses and public theology interpretation classes, which also allowed him to gain access to a growing audience, especially young students who were beginning to become disillusioned with the monarchy.</p><p>The monarchy at the time had been reinstated to absolute power following an MI6 and CIA-orchestrated coup in 1953, which ousted democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh after he attempted to nationalise the Iranian oil industry.</p><p>As a political activist, Khamenei was repeatedly arrested by the shah’s secret police (SAVAK) and sentenced to exile in the remote city of Iranshahr in southeastern Iran, but returned to take part in the 1978 protests that led to the end of the Pahlavi rule.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4346258\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4346258\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4346258\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-20T084006Z_645212904_RC2CFN30PWGM_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-CRISIS-KHAMENEI-1772283540.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei (3rd from R) attends a memorial service for the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini alongside senior officials including Ayatollah Azari Ghomi and members of the Khomeini family in Tehran, Iran, June 7, 1989.

He served briefly as minister of defence in 1980 and later as the supervisor of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. A fiery orator, he also secured the influential post of Tehran’s Friday prayer leader.</p><p>1981 proved a momentous year for Khamenei. He lost the use of his right arm after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt by the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK), an opposition group that had started an <a href=\"/news/2018/3/29/meks-violent-past-looms-over-us-lobby-for-regime-change-in-iran\">armed uprising</a> against the newly established Iranian theocracy after falling out with Khomeini. In the same year, Khamenei won the presidency, becoming Iran’s first clerical president.</p><p>In 1989, the death of Khomeini was a turning point for the Islamic republic. Before his death, Khomeini had sidelined his long-time designated heir, Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, due to the latter’s criticism of the mass execution of prisoners in 1988.</p><p>A council that had been set up to revise the constitution appointed Khamenei instead. To make that happen, the council had to loosen the qualifications required to hold the country’s top job. Khamenei did not have the title of the hojatoleslam – a high-ranking Shia clerical title.</p><p>“I believe I do not deserve this position; perhaps you and I know this. This would be symbolic leadership, not real leadership,” Khamenei said at the time.</p><p>But his leadership has been anything but symbolic.</p><p>Khamenei’s early tenure as ayatollah was defined by efforts to rebuild a country shattered by eight years of war with Iraq. More than a million people were killed in the conflict, and the economy was left in ruins. The conflict had also fostered resentment towards the international community over its perceived inaction following Iraq’s use of <a href=\"/news/2021/4/29/visualising-chemical-weapon-attacks-in-the-middle-east\">chemical weapons</a> against Iranian forces and civilians. While still president, Khamenei would frequently visit the front lines, earning the loyalty of the IRGC and gaining a firsthand understanding of the realities of war.</p><p>“He is the leader whose formation was in the war with Iraq – that framed his outlook on domestic and foreign politics. Once he became the supreme leader, he focused on building the military and paramilitary apparatus for a siege, for constant resistance,” said Narges Bajoghli, an associate professor of anthropology and Middle East studies at John Hopkins University.</p><p>But the mood began to change in the 1990s. The country was in desperate need of investment, while the revolutionary fervour had begun to cool somewhat. Some, exhausted by the war, were eager to see Iran return to the international fold.</p><p>That sentiment translated into a landslide election victory for reformist Mohammad Khatami in 1997, an advocate for rapprochement with the West and promoter of a “dialogue among civilisations”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4346288\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4346288\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4346288\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2009-06-09T120000Z_893242440_GM1E56A02JT01_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-ELECTION-1772283787.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Supporters of Iran's presidential election candidate Mirhossein Mousavi carry posters with images of Mousavi (L) and former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami during a campaign rally in Tehran June 9, 2009.

He saw the vote for reform, including from within the ranks of the military and paramilitary apparatus, as a threat to the status quo. So he set off to create a stable voting bloc of loyal supporters against reformers, according to Bajoghli.</p><p>“Khamanei never had a natural base for himself compared to Khomeini,” said Bajoghli, also the author of Iran Framed. “So he put a lot of funding in redoing the education and training for the young generations [within the paramilitary system] that would then find their way up.”</p><p>That meant giving the IRGC a free hand to build a network of businesses that would allow them to dominate Iran’s economy while also intensifying training programmes, especially for younger members of its paramilitary volunteer force, the Basij. While it was a limited section of society, it was one that would grow in line with Khamenei’s posture of perpetual resistance against the West and one that was given great resources. More importantly, Bajoghli said, they were willing to fight and die.</p><p>These new ranks within the paramilitary force were the ones called upon to suppress the nationwide protests that erupted after the disputed presidential election victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a staunch opponent of the West, in 2009. By then, a new generation of Iranians – born after 1979 – were less attuned to the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial narrative that had inspired their parents’ revolution.</p><p>In what was then considered the strongest challenge to Khamenei’s leadership, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets under what the media dubbed the Green Movement to contest the election results and express support for the defeated reformist candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi. While protesters said the elections were rigged for Ahmadinejad to win, Khamenei endorsed the results. Thousands were arrested and dozens were killed, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/123/2009/en/\">according to Amnesty International</a>.</p><p>The Iranian leadership accused Western countries of stoking the unrest to topple the religious establishment. “You [the West] should be held accountable for your actions,” Ahmadinejad<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSHOS62783420090816/?sp=true\"> said</a>.</p><p>“The Iranian nation would … slap those with ill intentions so hard that they would lose their way home.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4346298\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4346298\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4346298\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2010-07-16T000000Z_634394359_GM1E67G1H0R01_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-1772283974.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1155&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An Iranian with his glasses decorated with photos of President Mohammad Khatami carries national flag during celebration in central Tehran June 9, 2001, a day after country's presidential elections.

And he believed the battle against the West had to be fought with different strategies: resisting but also negotiating, if that was necessary, observers said.</p><p>In 2015, the country was struggling under crippling international sanctions due to its nuclear programme. To maintain domestic stability and boost legitimacy, Khamenei recognised the need to ease economic pressure.</p><p>So he greenlit then-President Hassan Rouhani’s negotiations with the West that led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The landmark deal, signed by Iran and world powers, was designed to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>“It was a moment of pragmatism – sometimes protecting the state requires compromises,” Nasr said. “Khamenei favoured a policy of neither peace nor war with the US. He believed that Iran needed to pursue its independence against the US, which he believed is inherently against Iran.” Within this perspective, “the nuclear deal was not normalisation [with the US] but a narrow arms control deal like the one the US did with the Soviets,” Nasr said.</p><p>But three years after that accord was signed, President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement, bringing the rapprochement to an end. As Washington imposed a new set of sanctions on Iran, Khamenei returned to a more aggressive posture, ruling out negotiations with the US and backing a gradual breach of the deal. Over the following years, Iran resumed the enrichment of uranium to 60 percent, the level at which it becomes quicker to convert to 90 percent weapons-grade uranium. Iran has insisted — and continues to insist — that its nuclear programme is purely civilian in nature. In 2003, Khamenei issued a <a href=\"https://farsi.khamenei.ir/newspart-index?tid=1322&amp;p=4#44141\">fatwa</a> prohibiting the manufacture, use and storage of nuclear weapons.</p><p>With Western sanctions biting and inflation rising, <a href=\"/news/2019/11/20/irans-protests-all-you-need-to-know-in-600-words\">protests erupted across Iran in 2019</a> following the government’s decision to hike petrol prices. Security forces were accused of violently cracking down on demonstrations where, according to Amnesty International, more than 100 people were killed. Khamenei dismissed the protesters as “thugs” and accused counterrevolutionaries and foreign enemies of fuelling the unrest.</p><p>Amid internal turmoil and growing isolation, the presidential elections saw the victory of Ebrahim Raisi – a senior prosecutor who had drawn <a href=\"/news/2021/6/21/irans-president-elect-raisi-addresses-links-with-mass-executions\">criticism for his links</a> with the mass executions of the late 80s – and the lowest turnout in the Islamic republic’s history.</p><p>With a close ally such as Raisi at the presidency, Khamenei promoted the so-called “resistance economy” relying on Iran’s internal capabilities while also pivoting its business towards the East – an approach that failed to yield tangible results.</p><p>The 2022 nationwide <a href=\"/news/2022/9/28/what-we-know-after-11-days-of-protests-in-iran\">protests over Mahsa Amini’s death</a> in police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory hijab law marked another major challenge for Khamenei. The ayatollah drew criticism as the person responsible for social restrictions imposed on the population and the security forces’ <a href=\"/news/2022/9/20/iran-confirms-first-deaths-in-protests-over-mahsa-aminis-death\">brutal crackdown</a> on the ensuing demonstrations. More than 500 people were killed, according to Amnesty International.</p><p>Again, Khamenei saw the whole affair as a national security matter. He blamed Western and regional adversaries for fomenting the unrest, arguing that the protests were not about the death of Amini or the wearing of the hijab but rather the result of foreign intervention. “It is about Islamic Iran’s independence, resistance, strength and power,” he said. “That is what this is about.”</p><h2 id=\"axis-of-resistance\">‘Axis of resistance’</h2><p>Independence and power, in Khamenei’s view, were also required beyond the country’s borders to maintain a “forward defence” that would deter potential aggression or overreach by adversaries, including the US and Israel.</p><p>That translated into weaving a web of proxy relations and transfer of weapons knowledge and resources to a constellation of allies outside Iran – the so-called “<a href=\"/program/start-here/2024/11/11/irans-axis-of-resistance-explained-start-here\">axis of resistance”</a>, Khamenei’s most impactful strategic project.</p><p>The master architect of this strategy was <a href=\"/news/2020/1/3/who-was-qassem-soleimani-irans-irgcs-quds-force-leader\">Qassem Soleimani</a>, a staunch Khamenei supporter and commander of Iran’s Quds forces, the elite wing of the IRGC responsible primarily for its foreign operations. Soleimani was <a href=\"/news/2020/1/3/irans-qassem-soleimani-killed-in-us-air-raid-at-baghdad-airport\">assassinated</a> by the US in 2020.</p><p>The crown jewels of the alliance were Hezbollah in Lebanon, former President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Hamas in Palestine, the Houthis in Yemen, and armed groups in Iraq.</p><p>But the axis began unravelling following Hamas’s assault in southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Israel then unleashed a genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 70,000 people and turned most of the enclave into rubble. Many senior Hamas leaders have been killed in the war.</p><p>Israel also attacked Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing many figures in its senior leadership, including secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah. Then came the overthrow of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad regime in December 2024 by rebel forces. The corridor that Iran had been using to replenish Hezbollah — through Syria — ceased to be viable.</p><p>With Iran’s allies weakened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had been pushing for a strike on Iran’s nuclear programme <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/6/18/netanyahus-spent-33-years-warning-an-iran-nuke-is\">for decades</a>, seized the moment.</p><p>On June 13, 2025, the Israeli army – with the knowledge of the US – <a href=\"/tag/israel-iran-conflict/\">attacked Iran</a>, killing dozens of its senior commanders and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/13/israel-kills-nuclear-scientists-strikes-sites-in-iran-who-did-it-target\">top nuclear scientists</a>, striking several nuclear sites and civilian and military infrastructure. Israel maintained its attack was to prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, despite separate assessments by the US intelligence and the International Atomic Energy Agency that Tehran was not in the process of doing that. And that attack occurred just as Tehran was engaged in negotiations with Washington to reach an agreement about its nuclear programme.</p><p>Iran responded with a barrage of missiles striking Tel Aviv. A full-blown war ensued for nearly two weeks, culminating with the US dropping bunker busters on three key nuclear facilities.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4346314\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4346314\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4346314\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-06-22T114022Z_104271357_RC2N7FAQVOQZ_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-ISRAEL-MISSILES-1772284154.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Members of Israeli forces work at an impact site following a missile attack from Iran on Israel, amid the Iran-Israel conflict, in Tel Aviv, Israel, June 22, 2025.

Iranians defied calls by Israel to revolt against the Islamic republic.</p><p>But the rally around the flag effect did not last long.</p><p>Crippling sanctions weighed heavily on the country’s economy. In late December, protests over a currency collapse morphed into a nationwide upheaval calling for the end of Khamenei’s rule. That led to the most brutal crackdown in decades. Iranian authorities said more than 3,000 people were killed, but a US-based human rights group put that tally at more than 7,000. Al Jazeera is unable to independently verify those figures.</p><p>Following the upheaval, the country was at a crossroads. While during previous rounds of protests the state was able to either dispense some subsidies or loosen up social restrictions, this time it had few options for addressing the underlying economic grievances that sparked the demonstrations. Iran needed to make tough compromises to win sanctions relief and fix the economy – or face further upheaval, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/change-is-inevitable-what-is-next-for-iran\">experts said</a>.</p><p>That led to new rounds of negotiations between the US and Iran to limit Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Despite statements of “progress”, several rounds of talks in the United Arab Emirates and in Geneva failed to reach any breakthrough. The US said it wanted Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies. While Tehran has shown flexibility about discussing limitations on the enrichment of uranium for civilian use, it has so far treated missiles and proxies as non-negotiables.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p><p>On February 28, Trump announced that the US had begun a “major combat operation” in Iran. In his speech, the American president made it clear that the US was seeking regime change.</p><p>“The hour of your freedom is at hand,” Trump said, speaking to the Iranian people at the end of his Saturday morning address. “When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will probably be your only chance for generations.”</p><p>He said he was “willing to do” what no previous American president had done.</p><p>“So let’s see how you respond”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Baghaei said the country’s armed forces “are defending national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Iran against these barbaric acts of aggression”.</p><p>The US-Israeli attacks came after a third round of indirect negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme between the US and Iran ended on Friday.</p><p>“We were supposed to meet on Monday to talk about technical aspects of any possible deal on [the] nuclear issue,” Baghaei said. “And the Americans themselves acknowledged that these negotiations went quite well. The mediator, [the] foreign minister of Oman, qualified this round of negotiations as being of significant progress.”</p><p>It was the second time in less than a year that diplomacy had been scuttled by an attack on Iran, Baghaei noted. Iran and the US had engaged in several rounds of negotiations last year, when Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran in June, which the US briefly joined, despite Trump saying he was committed to a diplomatic resolution.</p><p>Baghaei said the US “launching an act of aggression against another member of the United Nations” also threatened the international body, as its main pillar, “the UN Charter, is the provision of the use of force.”</p><p>“So, I think what is at stake is not only the security and peace of the region and that of Iran, but also the whole fabric of international law. And the normative system that has been created by the United Nations Charter,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"friends-in-the-region\">Friends in the region</h2><p>Baghaei defended Iran’s retaliatory attacks in several countries across the region.</p><p>“Under international law, any place, any location, any logistical support that are given to the aggressor [is a] legitimate target for the victim state,” he said. “So, we are not attacking any country in the region. We are friendly with all countries of the region. What we are doing is just taking defensive actions.”</p><p>“We have proven that we trust our friends in the region,” Baghaei said. “That’s why we try to get together with the countries of the region in furtherance of this diplomatic process. The problem is that the United States is conducting this war of aggression at the cost of everyone, including the countries of the region.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

At the end of a third round of nuclear talks in Geneva on Thursday, Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Albusaidi, acting as a mediator, announced that “significant progress” had been achieved and said technical talks were expected to resume on Monday.</p><p>“Iran has agreed to give up its stockpile of enriched material – zero accumulation and allow for full verification by the IAEA of its nuclear programme,” CBS News reported, quoting Albusaidi as saying. “With zero stockpiling, it becomes impossible to build a bomb regardless of enrichment levels,” he added, according to CBS.</p><p>Tehran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, has repeatedly said its nuclear programme was intended for civilian purposes and it has no intention to build atomic weapons.</p><p>Netanyahu has been calling for military action to destroy Iran’s nuclear capabilities, saying that Tehran’s atomic facilities constitute an existential threat to Israel.</p><p>US and Israeli officials have said the attacks on Saturday targeted Iranian officials, missile storage and launching sites, and Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>Iranian media reported strikes on the Ministry of Intelligence, the Ministry of Defence, the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran and the Parchin military complex.</p><p>Iran responded with attacks on Israel, as well as on bases used by the US military across the Gulf region, including in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p><strong>Negotiations under threat</strong></p><p>Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history, has long built his career around an objective of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p><p>In 2015, he vehemently opposed a nuclear deal that then US President Barack Obama had reached, together with Western allies, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for easing of sanctions imposed on Tehran.</p><p>Trump officially withdrew from the agreement in 2018, calling it a horrible deal, and reimposed sanctions on Tehran as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign to force Iran to renegotiate the deal.</p><p>Netanyahu found his opportunity to move against Tehran after Trump won his second term in office. With Israel embroiled in its genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza following the October 7, 2023, raid on Israel, Netanyahu, with a green light from the United States, launched his attack on Iran on June 13, 2025. The US briefly joined in the campaign, bombing several nuclear facilities.</p><p>Although Trump had proclaimed that US strikes had destroyed Iran’s nuclear capabilities, he had pushed for Iran to completely dismantle its nuclear programme, a demand Tehran rejects.</p><p>The US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford.</p><p>Analysts say that while Trump had spoken about the need to ensure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon, Netanyahu was pushing for Tehran to agree to negotiate its missile capabilities, including reducing their range to a “300-kilometre (185-mile) red line”.</p><p>Netanyahu also demanded that the United States push Tehran to stop supporting proxy allies in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.</p><p>While Israel says it emerged from the 12-day war in June with a strategic victory, Iranian missiles also inflicted heavy damage on Israeli cities. Up to 33 people were killed in the attacks, compared with more than 600 Iranians, while more than 3,000 others were hospitalised.</p><p><strong>What’s next</strong></p><p>While it is clear that Iran’s military capabilities do not compare with those of the United States and Israel, it is too early to predict how this confrontation will end.</p><p>US officials have been wary of the possibility of being drawn into a prolonged conflict in the Middle East, like the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Trump had criticised as a “disastrous mistake”, while Iranian officials have said that the US would find itself in a quagmire if it attacked.</p><p>The Washington Post has reported that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine had warned him of <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/iran-says-ready-for-talks-but-will-defend-itself-against-us-aggression\">potential risks of attacking Iran</a>, including becoming entangled in a prolonged conflict and the possibility of US casualties.</p><p>On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance was quoted by The Washington Post as saying that there is “no chance” that US strikes on Iran would result in the United States becoming involved in a years-long, drawn-out war.</p><p class=\"speakable\">“The idea that we’re going to be in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight — there is no chance that will happen,” Vance said on Thursday, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/02/26/vance-no-chance-us-will-be-drawn-out-war-middle-east/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the outlet</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Once their engines are cut off, the missile follows a predetermined path, re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere in a steep descent before striking its target.</p><p>Ballistic missiles travel at extremely high speeds, allowing them to travel thousands of kilometres (miles) in just minutes.</p><p>The speed at which they travel is measured in Mach, a unit equivalent to the speed of sound; for example, Mach 5 means five times the speed of sound.</p><p>Some, usually shorter-range, ballistic missiles reach supersonic speeds (faster than Mach 1, or about 1,225 kilometres per hour or 761 miles per hour), while others, usually longer-range missiles, can travel at hypersonic speeds – greater than Mach 5 (6,125km/h or 3,806mph).</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4340132\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-how-do-ballistic-missiles-work-FEB25-2026-1772104766.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - how do ballistic missiles work - FEB25, 2026-1772104766\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>What makes ballistic missiles especially dangerous is their combination of long range, high speed, and how difficult they are to intercept.</p><p>Their fast, high-flight path gives defence systems little time to react, and when they re-enter the atmosphere, they descend even faster, making interception even more difficult. Some missiles also deploy decoys or other countermeasures to trick radar and missile defences, making them harder to intercept.</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-missile-arsenal\">Israel’s missile arsenal</h2><p>Israel has an advanced missile arsenal, including long-range and nuclear-capable systems, developed with decades of support from the US.

The David’s Sling intercepts missiles ranging between 40km (25 miles) and 300km (186 miles).

Israeli media have reported the killing of General Mohammad Pakpour, a commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Ali Shamkhani, adviser to the supreme leader, and Amir Nasirzadeh, Iran’s defence minister.</p><p>Israel is clearly trying to reassure its citizens that it has the capability of reaching deep into Iran’s top layer of leaders.</p><p>But there has been no confirmation of leadership deaths so far from Tehran. Iranian media have claimed that Khamenei and Pezeshkian are safe and has reported instead on an air strike on a girls’ school in the city of Minab, with a death toll of at least 80.</p><p>Unlike the 12-day war last June, when Iran’s retaliation was slow and measured, this time around, the Iranian armed forces retaliated almost immediately. Ballistic missiles were fired at US bases in Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, as well as Israeli cities like Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Eilat.</p><p>The speed of Iran’s retaliation indicates that it had anticipated these attacks and had its retaliation plans ready. The question now is whether Iran can outlast US resolve, which faces both domestic and international pressure.</p><h2 id=\"domestic-dangers\">Domestic dangers</h2><p>Trump launched the war on Iran amid little enthusiasm among Americans for another foreign conflict. A recent poll by YouGov and The Economist suggests that just 27 percent of the US public supports the US using military force against Iran. Another survey conducted by the University of Maryland registered even lower approval: 21 percent.</p><p>The war has significant domestic political ramifications for Trump. As the operation progresses, if Iran fails to surrender, the US president will be caught between getting bogged down in a protracted conflict by escalating, and being seen as weak if he backs down.</p><p>As the midterm elections approach, the war will become a litmus test for Trump’s presidency. If the conflict does not go as the president has envisioned, it could reflect poorly on the Republican Party in the polls. If the GOP loses control of Congress to the Democrats, it would prevent Trump from pursuing his political agenda. Democrats gaining control of Congress could pile more impeachment pressure on Trump.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-victory\">What is victory?</h2><p>No analyst thinks this war will be short. Unlike the 12-day war, which resulted in a ceasefire, this conflict already looks broader and deeper. Iran’s readiness to retaliate across the region suggests it is willing to wage a long war rather than compromise.</p><p>One problem Washington and Tel Aviv are facing is how to keep the pressure on Tehran without creating uncontrollable instability in the region. The other problem they have is that they put regime change as their ultimate goal.</p><p>In his speech announcing the attack on Iran, the US president appeared to suggest that the US army would stick to an aerial campaign and would not deploy troops on the ground. He appeared to put the responsibility for toppling the Iranian government in the hands of the Iranian people, saying “the hour of your freedom is at hand” and calling on them to rebel.</p><p>This call comes two months after Iran witnessed unprecedented mass protests across the country. The Iranian authorities, however, launched a brutal campaign of repression, killing thousands. At the moment, a similar wave of mass protests seems unlikely. That legacy of repression weighs heavily on society, and Iran appears resilient.</p><p>Meanwhile, leadership “decapitation strikes” by the US and Israel will likely continue, but even if successful, they would not produce regime change.</p><p>Eventually, Trump’s generals may advise that prolonged conflict is unsustainable, echoing the lessons of the 12-day war. For Trump, an unwinnable war would invite a familiar exit strategy: Declaring victory on Truth Social and shifting the narrative.</p><p>The challenge then would be how to negotiate a ceasefire. Having been misled twice by the smokescreen of negotiations, Tehran could use this double betrayal to harden its position. If the regime survives, it could exploit US desperation for renewed talks to extract concessions. In that sense, diplomacy’s collapse today may set the stage for Iran to negotiate from a position of strength tomorrow.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Not really because we’re greatly invested in the future of the Iranian people, but because, through the genocide on Gaza, we’ve devalued human life,” he said, referring to the Israeli attacks on the besieged territory since October 2023.</p><p>Returning to shelters around the country is now the stuff of everyday life for most Israelis, he said.</p><p>Israel has been on high alert since it launched a wave of attacks on Iran, the country that its leaders have consistently portrayed as its nemesis for decades.</p><p>Announcing the attack through a video post on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu framed the attack in characteristically apocalyptic terms, saying Israel and the US had launched attacks to “remove the existential threat posed [to Israel] by the terror regime in Iran”, and going on to call upon the Iranian people to rise against their own leaders in response to the US and Israeli unprovoked strikes upon their cities.</p><p>Iran has retaliated with its own waves of missiles and drones against Israel and US assets in the region. At least one person was reported wounded in northern Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But the latest strikes against Iran were met warmly by Israel’s political elite.</p><p>“I want to remind us all: The people of Israel are strong. The IDF [Israeli army] and the Air Force are strong. The strongest power in the world stands with us,” opposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on social media, referring to the US.</p><p>“In moments like these we stand together – and we win together. There is no coalition and no opposition, only one people and one IDF, with all of us behind them.”</p><p>In a subsequent post written in Farsi, he echoed the prime minister’s calls for Iran to enact regime change from within, a longstanding Israeli policy.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-crazy\">‘It’s crazy’</h2><p>Accounts of the relative calm in Israel stand in sharp contrast to previous escalations, when sources described panic and bulk buying before an anticipated Iranian response to the wave of strikes Israel launched against targets in Iran.</p><p>“People here are well trained,” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Palestinian member of the Israeli parliament representing the left-wing Hadash-Ta’al faction, which is almost alone in opposing the strikes, said from her apartment near Haifa, where she had just returned from her shelter.</p><p>“This is what they’re saying all the time in the media: How well-trained and ready we are. It’s crazy. I don’t think any country in the world has experienced more war than we have, so this is what they mean by ‘trained’,” she said, referencing the wars on Iran, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza that Israel has waged since the Hamas-led attack of October 2023.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>As Touma-Suleiman spoke, she was interrupted by an alarm on her phone. “That’s not the alert. That’s a warning on my phone telling me there’s going to be an alert and then I’ll have to return to the shelter,” she explained, laughing drily. “You see what I mean about being well trained?”</p><p>Texting from Israel, Ahron Bregman, a senior teaching fellow at the Department for War Studies at King’s College London, described the relative calm and almost relief felt by many within the country that the uncertainty over war with Iran was at an end.</p><p>“Both Israel and the US are after the Iranian leadership. They hope to weaken it substantially, though I doubt they could topple it from the air,” he said, raising the possibility of a prolonged conflict.</p><p>However, how ready Israel might be for a lengthy war, and to what degree that might be Israel’s choice, was far from certain, Touma-Suleiman said.</p><p>“It will be the United States that determines how long the war will be. They’ll continue until they’ve achieved whatever it is they want,” she said.</p><p>“I don’t think Israel is ready for that. People are exhausted. The army is exhausted. I don’t know if they even have the reserves to manage a long war, and this is what Netanyahu is willing to gamble with, just so he can say to the public before elections: ‘Here is at least one victory.'”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/trump-talks-of-annihilation-elimination-as-us-israel-attack-iran\">pledged to raze Iran’s missile industry</a> and destroy its navy, while urging the Iranian people to overthrow the government.</p><p><strong>Israel</strong></p><p>A senior Israeli defence official told the Reuters news agency the joint US-Israeli attacks had been planned for months, with a specific date set weeks ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the attacks aimed to remove an “existential threat” posed by Iran. He said the attacks would “create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Iran</strong></p><p>Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Israel and the US of violating the United Nations charter with their attacks and pledged a harsh response, as the country waged retaliatory attacks on Israel as well as in several Gulf states that host US military assets, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. “All American and Israeli assets and interests in the Middle East have become a legitimate target,” a senior Iranian official told Al Jazeera. “There are no red lines after this aggression.”</p><p><strong>Hezbollah </strong></p><p>Lebanon’s Hezbollah condemned the US-Israeli attacks as a “blatant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter”, saying it was an attempt to destabilise the region and force its people “to accept domination and occupation schemes”.</p><p>It declared solidarity with Iran and called on people in the region to “confront this aggressive plan and recognise its danger”.</p><p><strong>United Nations </strong></p><p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the “military escalation” and called for an “immediate cessation of hostilities”.</p><p>“The use of force by the United States and Israel against Iran, and the subsequent retaliation by Iran across the region, undermine international peace and security,” he said, warning of the risks of a wider regional conflict with “grave consequences for civilians and regional stability”.</p><p>The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Saturday.</p><p><strong>European Union</strong></p><p>European ⁠Commission President ⁠Ursula von der Leyen and European Council ⁠President Antonio Costa called the conflict “greatly concerning” and urged all parties “to exercise maximum restraint, to protect civilians, ‌and to fully respect international law”.</p><p><strong>Red Cross</strong></p><p>Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, called on countries to respect the rules of war and urged them to find the political will to prevent “further death and destruction”. She warned that “a dangerous chain reaction” of military escalation was under way across the Middle East, “with potentially devastating consequences for civilians”.</p><p><strong>Oman</strong></p><p>The main mediator in ongoing US-Iran negotiations, Oman expressed dismay at the outbreak of violence. Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the conflict would not serve US interests, nor the interests of global peace, and urged Washington “not to get sucked in” further.</p><p>The country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on “all parties to immediately cease military operations” and for “the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to impose a ceasefire”.</p><p><strong>Germany, France, the UK</strong></p><p>In a joint statement, the prime ministers of the three countries said they “condemn Iranian attacks on countries in the region in the strongest terms” and remain committed “to regional stability and to the protection of civilian ⁠life.” They also said they ‌want a resumption of US-Iran negotiations.</p><p>Separately, French President Emmanuel Macron ⁠called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council, ⁠saying the conflict carries “serious consequences” for international peace and security. “The current escalation is dangerous for everyone. It must stop,” he said.</p><p></p><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an address that UK forces “are active and British planes are in the sky today as part of coordinated regional defensive operations”.</p><p>“Iran can end this now,” he said, calling on them to “give up their weapons programmes, and cease the appalling violence and repression against the Iranian people”.</p><p><strong>Qatar</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned Iran for firing missiles at Qatari territory, which is home to the Al Udeid Air Base that hosts US troops. The ministry called the attacks a flagrant violation of Qatar’s national sovereignty and a direct assault on its security. It added that Qatar reserves the right to respond, as per international law.</p><p><strong>United Arab Emirates</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Defence condemned in the “strongest terms” Iran’s attacks on its territory, several of which it said its air defences intercepted. It called the attack “a dangerous escalation and a cowardly act that threatens the security and safety of civilians”, stressing that the UAE has the “full right” to respond.</p><p><strong>Bahrain</strong></p><p>Bahrain confirmed that an Iranian missile attack targeted the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet that it hosts, and called the attack “treacherous”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Kuwait</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the Iranian attack on its soil as a “flagrant violation” of international law and said it had the right to respond. It warned that any additional escalation would only deepen regional instability.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></p><p>Saudi Arabia condemned in the “strongest terms” the Iranian attacks on Gulf Arab states and warned of “dire consequences”.</p><p><strong>Turkiye</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on “all parties” to end the spiral of violence, which it stressed started with US-Israeli attacks on Iran. “The events that began with Israel and the US attacking Iran, and continued with Iran targeting third countries, are of a nature that risks the future of our region and global stability,” said the ministry.</p><p id=\"pakistan\"><strong>Pakistan</strong></p><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran and called for an immediate halt to escalation through urgent resumption of diplomacy to achieve a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis”.</p><p><strong>Russia</strong></p><p>Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, accused the US of having used its nuclear talks with Iran as a cover-up before military operations. The country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the international community to swiftly deliver an objective assessment of what it called irresponsible ⁠actions that risk ⁠further destabilising the region.</p><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged “an immediate halt to military actions” and appealed for “the resumption of dialogue and negotiations” to maintain regional peace and stability. It stressed that “Iran’s national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity should be respected.”</p><p><strong>India</strong></p><p>The Ministry of External Affairs called on all parties to “exercise restraint” and “avoid escalation”. It said “dialogue and diplomacy should be pursued” and that “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be respected.” The statement came several days after the country’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/indias-modi-addresses-israeli-parliament-on-first-day-of-visit\">Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Israel</a> and hailed their “vital” partnership.</p><p><strong>Ukraine</strong></p><p>The ⁠Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Iran of being responsible for the chain of events leading to the conflict, including its <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/what-we-know-about-the-protests-sweeping-iran\">crackdown on protests earlier this year</a>. “The cause of the current ⁠events is precisely ⁠the violence and impunity of the Iranian regime, ⁠in particular the killings and ⁠repression of ⁠peaceful protesters, which have become particularly widespread in recent ‌months,” said the Foreign Ministry.</p><p><strong>Norway</strong></p><p>Foreign Minister Espen Barth said the initial attack on Iran by Israel breached standards of international law. “The attack is ⁠described by Israel as a preventive strike, but ⁠it is not in line with international law,” said Barth. “Preventive attacks require an immediately imminent threat.”</p><p><strong>Belgium </strong></p><p>Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said the Iranian people “must not pay the price for their government’s choices. We deeply regret that diplomatic efforts could not lead earlier to a negotiated solution.”</p><p><strong>Canada</strong></p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the country stands with the Iranian people and “reaffirms Israel’s right to defend itself and to ensure the security of its people.” He said Canada supports the US “acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon”.</p><p><strong>Ireland</strong></p><p>Ireland’s prime minister, Michael Martin, strongly urged all parties to “exercise restraint” to avoid escalation and wider conflict.</p><p>“The protection of civilian life in Iran, in Israel and in all neighbouring countries must now be paramount,” he said.</p><p><strong>Venezuela</strong></p><p>The government of Venezuela said that it “condemns and regrets deeply that, in a context in which diplomatic efforts and ongoing negotiations are being developed, the military route was opted for, through attacks against Iran.” It also described Tehran’s response as “undue and condemnable”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
