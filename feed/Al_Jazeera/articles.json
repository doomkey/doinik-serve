Nearly 1,400 people were killed, and more than 20,000 were wounded, according to the country’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), which later found Hasina guilty of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/sheikh-hasina-convicted-of-crimes-against-humanity-what-we-know\">crimes against humanity</a> and sentenced her to death. She is currently in exile in India, where she fled after her ouster.</p><p>After Hasina went into exile, her Awami League party, which had been in power for 15 years under her leadership, was also <a href=\"/news/2025/5/11/bangladesh-bans-activities-of-awami-league-the-party-of-ousted-pm-hasina\">banned</a> from all political activities. The latest election was the first since the uprising.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-july-charter\">What is the July Charter?</h2><p>After Hasina was ousted, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took over as the country’s interim leader of a caretaker government in August 2024.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/bangladesh-election-2026-what-happens-when-and-whats-at-stake\">July National Charter 2025</a> was drafted by the caretaker government, outlining a roadmap for constitutional amendments, legal changes and the enactment of new laws.</p><p>It contains more than 80 proposals to overhaul Bangladesh’s system of governance, with key reforms being “increasing women’s political representation, imposing prime ministerial term limits, enhancing presidential powers, expanding fundamental rights, and protecting judicial independence”, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA).</p><p>The charter also recommends creating a 100-member upper chamber alongside Bangladesh’s current single parliamentary body, the 350-member Jatiya Sangsad.</p><p>The BNP was <a href=\"/features/2026/2/13/what-does-bnps-landslide-mean-for-bangladeshs-post-uprising-order\">sceptical</a> about the July National Charter referendum for months during the transitional government, at times signalling a “no”, until party leader Tarique Rahman publicly endorsed a “yes” vote on January 30 and the BNP said it would adopt the charter if approved in the referendum.</p><p>In particular, analysts say, the BNP appeared opposed to proposals to use proportional representation to fill the upper house, which, it has argued, could dilute large parliamentary majorities under the current electoral system.</p><p>Now that the charter has been approved, the new MPs must set up the Constitution Reform Council to enact the constitutional amendments in the charter. The implementation process is required to be completed within 180 days of forming the council.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-the-referendum-caused-division-in-bangladesh\">Has the referendum caused division in Bangladesh?</h2><p>On Tuesday, newly elected members of parliament were sworn in.</p><p>They were asked to take two oaths. The first was the standard pledge to uphold the Constitution of Bangladesh. The second bound them to respect and implement the July National Charter 2025.</p><p>But the newly elected MPs from the BNP did not take the second oath, prompting criticism from members of Jamaat and its ally, the National Citizen Party (NCP), a party formed by students who led the protests against Hasina in 2024.</p><p>Under an implementation order that sets out how the July National Charter will be turned into law, the Constitutional Reform Council is to be composed of MPs who, at the same ceremony, also take an oath as council members. This technically means only the Jamaat, the NCP and a small number of others who took the second oath are currently eligible to sit on the Council.</p><p>Because more than two-thirds of the MPs did not take the second oath, the Council has not yet been constituted. It is unclear what will happen next regarding the formation of the council.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-main-sticking-point-for-the-bnp\">What is the main sticking point for the BNP?</h2><p>Salahuddin Ahmed, a BNP standing committee member and MP, told local media after the ceremony that BNP lawmakers had refused to take the Charter oath because, in their view, the Constitution Reform Council, which will be charged with enacting the reforms, has not yet been approved by parliament.</p><p>“None of us have been elected as the members of this ‘Constitution Reform Council’. This council is not even a part of the constitution yet. It will be considered legitimate only when it is approved by the elected parliament,” Ahmed said, according to local media reports.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, he reaffirmed the BNP’s promise to enact the reforms: “We are committed and pledged to implement the July National Charter exactly as it was signed as a document of political consensus.”</p><p>The main concern the BNP is understood to have about the reforms relates to the formation of a second, 100-member upper chamber of parliament.</p><p>“Major parties appear to agree on almost all the core referendum issues. However, disagreements remain regarding specific details, particularly in regard to the formation of the proposed Upper House,” Asif Nazrul, a law professor at Dhaka University, told Al Jazeera earlier.</p><p>Bangladesh currently conducts all elections using the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system. Each voter picks one candidate, and whoever gets the most votes in a seat wins it.</p><p>This can create a large gap between a party’s overall vote share and its actual share of seats. Theoretically, one party could win 51 percent of the vote in every seat, while another could win 49 percent in every seat. The first party would receive 100 percent of the seats, however.</p><p>Any party that wins at least 151 of the 300 seats can form a government alone, while the runner-up in seat count becomes the official opposition.</p><p>In last week’s election, the BNP-led alliance won 212 seats, followed by 77 for the Jamaat-led alliance, out of the 297 parliamentary seats for which results were announced.</p><p>The BNP wishes to retain the system of FPTP, but the July Charter recommends that the upper house be filled with representatives elected according to the proportional representation electoral system, which would give parties a share of seats more in line with their share of overall votes.</p><p>Forming the upper house in line with the FPTP system, by contrast, would put the BNP at an advantage due to the large proportion of seats it won in parliament.</p><p>“The BNP favours forming it [the upper house] in proportion to parliamentary seats, while Jamaat and the NCP prefer a system of proportional representation. Resolving this dispute remains a key challenge,” Nazrul said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak frequently used the apartment for extended stays.</p><p>While the property was technically owned by a company linked to Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein, the disgraced financier essentially controlled it. The units in the building were frequently loaned to Epstein’s associates and used to house underage models, the report said.</p><p>Barak served as prime minister from 1999 to 2001. Under Israeli law, former prime ministers receive state-funded security after leaving office. The documents expose a direct operational relationship between Israel’s permanent mission to the United Nations and Epstein’s enterprise.</p><p>Rafi Shlomo, the former director of protective services at the Israeli mission and head of Barak’s security detail, personally controlled access to the apartment. Shlomo conducted background checks on Epstein’s employees and cleaning staff and held meetings with them to coordinate the installation of surveillance equipment.</p><h2 id=\"coordinated-surveillance\">Coordinated surveillance</h2><p>The structural modifications carried out by the Israeli government required permission from Epstein.</p><p>In a January 2016 email exchange, Barak’s wife, Nili Priell, discussed the installation of alarms and surveillance tools with Epstein’s longtime assistant Lesley Groff. Priell noted the system included sensors on the windows and remote access capabilities.</p><p>“They can neutralize the system from far, before you need somebody to enter the appartment [sic],” Priell <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00331291.pdf\">wrote</a>. “The only thing to do is call Rafi from the consulate and let him know who and when is entering.”</p><p>Groff later confirmed to Barak and Priell that Epstein had personally authorised the physical alterations to the property, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02062130.pdf\">writing</a>: “Jeffrey says he does not mind holes in the walls and this is all just fine!”</p><p>The correspondence between the Israeli mission and Epstein’s representatives continued regularly throughout 2016 and 2017 to manage access for maids and coordinate subsequent visits by Barak.</p><h2 id=\"state-ties-and-political-fallout\">State ties and political fallout</h2><p>After Epstein’s death in a New York jail in 2019 while he was awaiting a sex-trafficking trial, Barak tried to downplay his relationship with the financier, claiming that while they had met, Epstein never supported or paid him.</p><p>The political fallout from the relationship has been seized upon by Barak’s rivals in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently weaponised the newly released documents, arguing that the ties implicated Barak rather than Israel.</p><p>“Jeffrey Epstein’s unusual close relationship with Ehud Barak doesn’t suggest Epstein worked for Israel. It proves the opposite,” Netanyahu <a href=\"https://x.com/netanyahu/status/2019739136660222088\">stated</a>, accusing Barak of working with the “anti-Zionist radical left” to undermine Israel’s current government.</p><p>However, the emails released by the US Justice Department demonstrate that the entanglement extended beyond Barak to other active Israeli state officials.</p><p>Yoni Koren, a longtime aide to Barak who died in 2023, was also a frequent guest at the 66th Street apartment. Congressional investigations and leaked emails indicated Koren stayed at the Epstein-controlled residence multiple times, including in 2013 while he was serving as the bureau chief for the Israeli Ministry of Defence. Further records showed Koren continued to use the apartment while receiving medical treatment in New York until Epstein’s final arrest in 2019.</p><h2 id=\"intelligence-and-settler-funding\">Intelligence and settler funding</h2><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/what-were-jeffrey-epsteins-links-to-israel\">The ties between Epstein and Israel</a> have come into sharp focus since the release of millions of documents relating to the criminal investigations into Epstein. Beyond his interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak, the files document Epstein’s financial support for Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli army and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund as well as his connections to the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency.</p><p>Barak has expressed remorse over his ties to Epstein. Despite the financier pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008, which resulted in a prison sentence, Barak maintained a close personal and business relationship with him. The former Israeli leader claimed he remained unaware of the full scope of Epstein’s crimes until a wider federal inquiry was opened in 2019.</p></div></div></body></html>"

On Tuesday, the Gates Foundation’s India office posted on X that Gates would attend the summit and “deliver his keynote as scheduled”.</p><p>Then, on Thursday, hours before the scheduled speech, it released a statement saying that “After careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities, Mr Gates will not be delivering his keynote address.”</p><p>It added that Ankur Vora, president of the Gates Foundation’s Africa and India offices, would deliver the speech instead.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-alleged-links-between-epstein-and-gates\">What are the alleged links between Epstein and Gates?</h2><p>Bill Gates was named in documents related to Epstein released in January by the US Department of Justice.</p><p>In a draft email included among the documents, Epstein alleged Gates had engaged in extramarital affairs and sought his help in procuring drugs “to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls”.</p><p>It was unclear whether Epstein actually sent the email, and Gates denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>The Gates Foundation, in a statement to The New York Times, called the allegations “absolutely absurd and completely false”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-india-s-government-said\">What has India’s government said?</h2><p>Very little.</p><p>Despite criticism and calls from opposition figures to explain the invitation to Gates, the Indian government has not directly addressed the controversy that culminated in Gates’s withdrawal.</p><p>While unnamed government sources told local media he would not attend the summit, officials stopped short of explaining why.</p><p>Asked about Gates’s participation, Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw declined to give a clear answer to reporters, while Modi made no reference to the issue in his public remarks.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-are-the-epstein-files-a-sensitive-subject-for-india\">Why are the Epstein files a sensitive subject for India?</h2><p>The controversy surrounding Gates’s planned participation comes close on the heels of a series of disclosures in the Epstein files that have forced the Modi government on the backfoot.</p><p>In one email to an unidentified individual he referred to only as “Jabor Y”, Epstein referred to Modi’s historic visit – the first by an Indian prime minister – to Israel in July 2017.</p><p>Epstein wrote: “The Indian Prime minister modi took advice. and danced and sang in israel for the benefit of the US president. they had met a few weeks ago.. IT WORKED. !”</p><p>Modi’s visit to Israel – and his subsequent embrace of the Benjamin Netanyahu government, with military, intelligence and other ties strengthened over the past decade – had already drawn criticism from the opposition Congress party and others, who have accused him of reversing decades of Indian support for the Palestinian cause. India was the first non-Arab nation to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, and did not establish full diplomatic relations with Israel until 1992.</p><p>But the Epstein email turbocharged the opposition criticism of Modi’s Israel policy – with questions now also asked about whether it was influenced by Washington.</p><p>The Indian Ministry of External Affairs dismissed the Epstein email in an unusually sharply worded statement.</p><p>“Beyond the fact of the prime minister’s official visit to Israel in July 2017, the rest of the allusions in the email are little more than trashy ruminations by a convicted criminal, which deserve to be dismissed with the utmost contempt,” spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.</p><p>But the Epstein cloud continues to hover over India.</p><p>The files also show that India’s current oil minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, exchanged dozens of emails with Epstein after he joined Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014.</p><p>In many of them, Puti appears to be taking Epstein’s help in getting US investors, such as LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, to visit India. In others, he appears to suggest that he had a fairly comfortable personal relationship with Epstein.</p><p>“Please let me know when you are back from your exotic island,” Puri wrote in December 2014, for instance, asking to set up a meeting in which Puri could give Epstein some books to “excite an interest in India”.</p><p>Puri, in a new conference, has claimed that he only met Epstein “three or four times”, but the Congress party has argued that the emails suggest a much closer relationship.</p><h2 id=\"gates-s-work-in-india\">Gates’s work in India</h2><p>The Gates Foundation has long been a key partner in India’s public health and development sectors, backing major vaccination drives, disease prevention campaigns and sanitation programmes.</p><p>At the same time, he has had vocal critics, including environmental activist Vandana Shiva, who has argued that Gates’s brand of “philanthro-imperialism” uses wealth to control global food systems.</p><p>Gates also faced heavy criticism after a 2024 podcast in which he said India was “a kind of laboratory to try things … that then, when you prove them out in India, you can take to other places” when discussing development programmes and the foundation’s work there.</p><h2 id=\"orion-the-robodog-and-other-controversies\">‘Orion’ the robodog and other controversies</h2><p>Beyond the fallout over Bill Gates’s cancelled keynote, the AI Impact Summit has faced several controversies.</p><p>One incident involved a robotic dog named “Orion”, which Galgotias University, based in the New Delhi suburban town of Greater Noida, presented as its own innovation.</p><p>Online users quickly identified the machine as a commercially available Chinese-made model, prompting organisers to ask the institution to vacate its stall.</p><p>The event also drew criticism on its opening day after facing logistical issues, including long queues and confusion over entry procedures, according to local media.</p><p>On Wednesday, large crowds were seen walking for miles after police cordoned off roads for VIP access.</p><p>Dhananjay Yadav, the CEO of a company exhibiting high-tech wearables, made headlines after he reported on social media that devices had been stolen from the company’s stand.</p><p>The Times of India later reported that two maintenance workers at the event had been arrested for allegedly stealing the wearables.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This follows new data released by the Centre for Migration Control, suggesting that 752,000 migrants joined the GP register last year.</p><p>The Centre for Migration Control, a think tank focused on reducing immigration in the United Kingdom, based its claim on Flag-4 GP registrations, a category that counts anyone whose previous address was outside the UK for three months or more – a group that can include returning British residents as well as new arrivals. The figure of 752,000 Flag-4 registrations may seem large, but it accounted for just more than one in 10 of the roughly 6.5 million new GP registrations last year, a share that falls well short of the “unquenchable demand” Reform portrays. While the party continues to blame immigration for GP access pressures, it overlooks a central fact about the NHS workforce: More than 40 percent of doctors currently licensed to practise in the UK qualified overseas, and international graduates now make up the majority of new entrants to the medical register. The system Reform claims is being overwhelmed by migrants is, in reality, heavily sustained by them. Yet rhetoric tying GP shortages solely to migrant patients is becoming more frequent.</p><p>These claims echo across the UK’s wider far right. Tommy Robinson, the anti-Islam activist and former leader of the English Defence League, has repeatedly claimed the NHS is being “swamped by the rest of the world”, framing healthcare as another border to be defended. In this telling, the NHS becomes the last national institution under siege from migration. Yet the NHS is woven into Britain’s sense of itself. Almost every citizen has relied on it at some point in their lives, as it was designed to serve people from cradle to grave, and the emotional attachment to it remains strong despite its present strains. But unlike other parts of British life that politicians routinely blame migrants for reshaping, the NHS has always been intertwined with migration – just not for the reasons now being invoked.</p><p>The NHS was built on migrant labour, something that no politician has quite come to grips with since it was introduced. In 1948, an exodus of British doctors began at the formation of the health service, with many leaving for countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia, and Britain increasingly looking to its former colonies for a continued workforce supply. By 1971, about 31 percent of NHS doctors in England were born and qualified overseas. Even Enoch Powell, widely regarded as the chief architect of Britain’s modern anti-immigration movement, called for and supported the recruitment of doctors from abroad during his time as minister of health in the early 1960s. In a 1961 House of Lords debate, Lord Cohen of Birkenhead stated that the “Health Service would have collapsed” had it not been for junior doctors from India and Pakistan. This is without even taking into account the effect of the Windrush generation or Irish migrants, who formed a significant part of the nursing workforce in post-war Britain. This cognitive dissonance was apparent even in recent governments. Take former Home Secretary Priti Patel, under Boris Johnson’s Conservative government, who enforced some of the harshest migration conditions in recent decades, yet also introduced the Health and Care Visa and oversaw a significant increase in the recruitment of overseas healthcare workers during and after the pandemic to meet workforce shortages. Britain knows its health service cannot function without migration, but it never has.</p><p>This is not a new debate. In the 2010s, successive Conservative governments, while overseeing years of austerity and historically low funding growth in the health service, blamed migrants for its woes. The NHS migrant surcharge was introduced in 2015 as the Immigration Health Surcharge, forcing migrants who move to Britain to pay additional costs to use the NHS, despite many also contributing through income tax and national insurance. Currently, the surcharge stands at 1,035 pounds ($1,405) per year per adult, which can easily rack up significantly higher costs for families relocating to Britain. Thus, migrants do pay more to use the National Health Service. So why does Britain continue to blame them for the faltering service time and again?</p><p>The redirection tactic is easier to use than dealing with the complexity of fixing the NHS. The service has become so fragmented that it is almost impossible to work out where exactly the blame should lie internally, or where to begin when trying to fix the numerous problems that lead to poor wait times. Blaming migrants, however, is easy. It is tangible, too. Images regularly circulate on social media of A&amp;E departments filled with brown and Black patients waiting to be seen, with racist captions blaming “foreigners” for the wait – even though they could very easily be British nationals. None of those posts ever considers that close to half of doctors currently practising in the UK qualified overseas. Instead, visible ethnic differences are enough to convince them that immigration is the cause of the NHS’s faults. Politicians jump on this sentiment, and the truth becomes irrelevant.</p><p>Reform, for example, fails to take into account that research from the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government found that areas with more migrants do not experience longer NHS waiting times and, in some cases, even record slightly shorter waits. Migrants are often younger, healthier and therefore less likely to use GP services than Britain’s ageing population. Explaining that to the British public, however, is more complicated than adding it to the ever-growing list of things to blame immigrants for.</p><p>British politics has become encapsulated in two recurring debates – fixing the NHS, and migration. Just as the NHS stokes up emotion in British politics, migration causes a heated conversation. Combining the two creates a political firestorm that Reform believes will lead them to election victory – a tactic which has been used before, when the now infamous Vote Leave bus claimed the NHS would receive money going to the European Union, helping the Vote Leave campaign win the Brexit referendum. It wins voters, even if the figures do not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>This is why, now, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has introduced fast-tracked legislation to prioritise British doctors in training posts over international ones, to “back homegrown talent”, and the Labour government has proposed tightening the social care worker visa route. Britain remains short of doctors, nurses and social care workers, but the last few years have proved a marked ideological shift. No longer is the debate about “good immigrants” who are needed in the NHS – the policy is to deter all migrants, for short-term political gain. Perhaps when Britain releases itself from the idea that it is competing with migrants for care, it will realise that migrants are the care.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In one confidential memo, he sought Epstein’s views on investment opportunities in Afghanistan’s Helmand province.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court,” the police statement added.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”</p><p>Mountbatten-Windsor should cooperate with the United States authorities in their investigation, the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said. “No one is above the law,” he added. Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>As the arrest became public, the family of Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre welcomed the news. “At last, today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” Giuffre’s siblings said in a statement to CBS News. “He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you,” said the family members of Giuffre, who died by suicide last year at age 41.</p><p>Giuffre had alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor on three occasions, twice when she was just 17. Her accusations and other documents made public reignited UK anger over his ties to Epstein.</p><p>It culminated with the former prince being stripped of his royal titles and honours and announcing that he would be ousted from his mansion on the royal estate at Windsor, west of London. Andrew has always denied that he sexually abused Giuffre.</p><p>After she launched a lawsuit against him, he paid her a multi-million-pound settlement in 2022 without making any admission of guilt.’Another blow to the monarchy’</p><p>“This is such an unprecedented action and move for a prince that was one time the queen’s favourite child, who held a number of high-profile roles within the British establishment, who gradually had this fall from grace because of his association with a convicted pedophile,” said Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic, reporting from London. “This is yet another blow to the branding of the monarchy.”</p><p>Michael Walker, a political commentator and contributing editor at Novara Media, says the developments are “incredibly damaging” for the UK’s monarchy and establishment, more generally.</p><p>“There is an impression that even though Andrew has been pushed out of the royal family, it was always one step behind,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“There is no impression that the royal family sort of learned about these things and was genuinely morally outraged so therefore pushed Andrew to the side,” he added.</p><p>“It always seems like they are a step behind, there’s a PR disaster and they say, ‘How do we distance ourselves from this man who is an embarrassment’ – as opposed to “How do we sort of bring about consequences for this man who has morally erred’.”</p><p>The arrest comes after the royal family last week <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/uk-king-charles-will-support-police-probe-into-ex-prince-andrew-epstein\">committed to cooperate</a> with the police on any investigation regarding Mountbatten-Windsor.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two sides have been fighting a <a href=\"/features/longform/2023/5/30/as-the-night-descended-they-came-and-killed-sudans-other-war\">vicious civil war</a> since April 2023.</p><p>In a new report on Thursday, the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Sudan said RSF fighters were responsible for atrocities after an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=el-fasher+siege+site%3Aaljazeera.com&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enQA1192QA1192&amp;oq=el-fasher+siege++site%3Aaljazeera.com&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQyNDdqMGo0qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">18-month siege</a> on el-Fasher, during which they imposed conditions “calculated to bring about the physical destruction” of non-Arab communities, in particular the Zaghawa and the Fur communities.</p><p>“The scale, coordination, and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around el-Fasher were not random excesses of war,” said Mohamed Chande Othman, the chair of the mission.</p><p>“They formed part of a planned and organised operation that bears the defining characteristics of genocide.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, genocide refers to any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy – in whole or in part – a national, ethnical, racial or religious group: Killing members of the group; causing its members serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to bring about its physical destruction; imposing measures intended to prevent births in the group; and forcibly transferring its children to another group.</p><p>Under the 1948 convention, a genocide assessment could be made even if only one of the five criteria were met.</p><p>The fact-finding mission, which was mandated by members of the Human Rights Council, said it found at least three of those five were met in the alleged actions of the RSF.</p><p>According to the report, they included killing members of a protected ethnic group; causing serious bodily and mental harm; and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group’s physical destruction in whole or in part.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The independent UN probe cited a systematic pattern of ethnically targeted killings, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/8/sudan-group-accuses-rsf-of-raping-19-women-who-fled-el-fasher\">sexual violence</a>, destruction, and public statements explicitly calling for the elimination of non-Arab communities.</p><p>The team’s report documented acts directed specifically against protected ethnic groups, accompanied by “exterminatory rhetoric”, accusing the RSF of targeting individuals based on their ethnicity, gender and perceived political affiliation.</p><p>“RSF fighters openly stated their intention to target and eliminate non-Arab communities,” the report stated, citing accounts of “explicit threats to ‘clean’ the city”.</p><p>“Survivors cited them as saying: ‘Is there anyone Zaghawa among you? If we find Zaghawa, we will kill them all … We want to eliminate anything Black from Darfur.'”</p><p>It said the alleged violations indicated the RSF intent to destroy the Zaghawa and Fur communities in whole or in part.</p><p>The report also stated that girls and women between the ages of seven and 70, including pregnant women, were raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence, including whipping, beatings and forced nudity.</p><p>It quoted survivors reporting that “numerous” women were raped and recounting point-blank killings of civilians in homes, streets, open areas or while attempting to flee el-Fasher.</p><p>“They described individuals being gunned down in the streets, trenches and public buildings where they were hiding, while bodies of men, women and children filled the roads,” it stated.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>There was no immediate comment by the RSF, which has previously denied such accusations.</p><p>Sudan descended into conflict nearly three years ago when a rivalry between its army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the commander of the RSF, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, exploded into an all-out war.</p><p>Since then, tens of thousands of people have been killed while millions have been forced from their homes, with both sides accused of war crimes.</p><p>The RSF was formed out of tribal “Janjaweed” militias, which became a notorious state-backed group that was used as a counterrebel force during the Darfur war that began in 2003. About 300,000 people died in combat as well as from famine and disease brought on by the conflict.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel – backed by its principal ally, the United States – has poured billions of dollars into waging its war on Gaza. So, how much does the killing of more than 72,000 Palestinians cost? How much do you need to spend on munitions to commit a genocide? And what is the impact of industrialised mass killing on an economy?</p><p>Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-money-has-israel-spent-on-the-gaza-war\">How much money has Israel spent on the Gaza war?</h2><p>The Bank of Israel put the overall economic toll of the war at about 352 billion shekels ($112bn). That total includes roughly 243 billion shekels ($77bn) in direct defence costs, 33 billion shekels ($10.5bn) for the property tax compensation fund, civilian outlays of 57 billion shekels ($18bn) and interest payments of 19 billion shekels ($6bn).</p><p>In early 2025, taking the Gaza war in isolation, Israel’s former chief military economic adviser, Gil Pinchas, estimated that the cost to Israel had been 150 billion shekels ($48bn), running at an average cost of 300 million shekels ($96m) per day. On average, 100 Palestinians were killed in Gaza every day, according to Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).</p><p>“Every item the [Israeli army] uses in combat has a price tag in shekels, detailed in a special, highly specific price book,” Pinchas told journalists, referring to the price paid by the Israeli army, and not Palestinians, for every combat ration, litre of fuel, vehicle, bullet and missile launched against Gaza. “The book is updated constantly, including during the war … We keep our finger on the pulse.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-of-the-war-s-expenditure-was-spent-on-munitions\">How much of the war’s expenditure was spent on munitions?</h2><p>We don’t know for sure.</p><p>Pinchas did say that Israel had spent 340 billion shekels ($108bn) on munitions since the war began, but nowhere near all of that has been used. A significant proportion of that money has also been spent on purchasing arms from Israeli manufacturers, which has helped to offset the wider impact of the war on the Israeli economy.</p><p>Line-by-line details for most military budgets are rarely available. But some insights can be gleaned from Israel’s other wars in the region.</p><p>According to an estimate midway through the war by The Wall Street Journal, Israel’s war on Iran was costing it $200m per day, with the missiles used to intercept Iranian rockets, sometimes reaching 400 a day, estimated at anywhere between $700,000 and $4m each.</p><p>In addition, Israel’s <a href=\"/news/2024/9/18/more-devices-exploding-across-lebanon-whats-happening\">September 2024</a> attack on the Lebanese group Hezbollah’s communication devices, which relied on a plan that had been set into motion years earlier, is reported to have set the Israeli treasury back some one billion shekels ($318m).</p><h2 id=\"what-has-been-the-overall-cost-to-the-wider-israeli-economy\">What has been the overall cost to the wider Israeli economy?</h2><p>Considerable, and much of that is down to manpower.</p><p>Of Israel’s 465,000 military reservists, upwards of 300,000 were deployed to Gaza during the first year of the war. This is in addition to 170,000 active-duty personnel. The cost of maintaining that number of active soldiers, as well as the impact on the wider economy due to the loss of workers called up as reservists, is astronomical.</p><p>According to Israel’s treasury, some 70 billion shekels ($22.3bn) has been spent on its reserve forces alone during the course of the war, while the cost of maintaining its standing army in 2025 was estimated to be 15.37 billion shekels ($4.9bn).</p><p>The Bank of Israel estimates that the cost of one month of service for a military reservist is about 38,000 shekels ($12,100) in lost production.</p><p>With military budgets unlikely to recede in the wake of the genocide and other wars that Israel has engaged in over the past two years, a column in the Israeli liberal daily Haaretz suggested that over the next decade, the cost of the war could run to, at a minimum, 500 billion shekels ($159bn).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-much-has-israel-s-genocide-cost-the-us\">How much has Israel’s genocide cost the US?</h2><p>More than many US voters might suppose.</p><p>According to Brown University’s 2025 <a href=\"https://costsofwar.watson.brown.edu/paper/AidToIsrael\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Costs of War report</a>, since October 7, 2023, the US has provided Israel with some $21.7bn in military aid.</p><p>In addition to that, the American taxpayer has funded US operations in support of Israel in Yemen, Iran and the wider Middle East at a cost of $9.65bn to $12.07bn, meaning a total US investment of somewhere between $31.35bn and $33.77bn on Israel’s wars since 2023.</p><h2 id=\"how-much-will-it-cost-to-rebuild-gaza\">How much will it cost to rebuild Gaza?</h2><p>According to the United Nations, rebuilding Gaza – where Israel has destroyed the majority of buildings – would take decades and cost somewhere in the region of $70bn.</p><p>In a report, the UN noted that Israel’s military operations had “significantly undermined every pillar of survival” within the enclave and that the entire population of 2.3 million people faced “extreme, multidimensional impoverishment” – the term for poverty extending beyond financial duress, in areas such as a lack of clean water, proper sanitation and education.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

On Thursday, Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk urged Polish citizens to leave Iran “immediately … and ⁠do not go to this country ‌under any circumstances”.</p><p>The satellite images offer a rare glimpse of Iranian activities at some of the sites at the centre of tensions with Israel and the US.</p><p>Some 30km (20 miles) southeast of Tehran, the Parchin complex is one of Iran’s most sensitive military sites. Western intelligence has suggested Tehran carried out tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations there more than 20 years ago. Iran has always denied seeking ⁠atomic weapons and says its nuclear programme is purely for civilian purposes.</p><p>Neither US intelligence nor the UN nuclear watchdog found any evidence last year that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons.</p><p>Israel reportedly struck Parchin in October 2024. Satellite imagery taken before and after that attack shows extensive damage to a rectangular building at Parchin, and apparent reconstruction in images from November 6, 2024. Imagery from October 12, 2025, shows development at the site, with the skeleton of a new structure visible and two smaller structures adjacent to it.</p><p>Progress is apparent in imagery from November 14, with what appears to be a metallic roof covering the large structure. By February 16, it cannot be seen at all, hidden by what experts say is a concrete structure.</p><p>The Institute for ‌Science and International Security (ISIS), in a January 22 analysis of satellite imagery, pointed to progress in the construction of a “concrete sarcophagus” around a newly built facility at the site, which it identified as Taleghan 2.</p><p>ISIS founder David Albright wrote on X: “Stalling the negotiations has its benefits: Over the last two to three weeks, Iran has been busy burying the new Taleghan 2 facility … More soil is available and the facility ⁠may soon become a fully unrecognizable bunker, providing significant protection from aerial strikes.”</p><p>The institute also reported in late January that satellite images showed new efforts to bury two tunnel entrances at the Isfahan complex – one of the three ⁠Iranian uranium-enrichment plants bombed by the US in June during the war. By early February, ISIS said all entrances to the tunnel complex were ⁠”completely buried”.</p><p>Other images point to ongoing efforts since February 10 to “harden and defensively ⁠strengthen” two entrances to a tunnel complex under a mountain some 2km (1.2 miles) from Natanz – the site that holds Iran’s other two uranium enrichment plants.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This comes as Washington seeks to negotiate a deal with Tehran on its nuclear programme while threatening military action if talks fail.</p><p>On Tuesday, US and Iranian representatives reached an understanding on main “<a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/17/us-and-iran-reach-guiding-principles-in-geneva-nuclear-talks\">guiding principles</a>” during a meeting in Geneva, but felt short of achieving any breakthrough. The meeting in the Swiss city came after a first round of talks in Oman on February 6.</p><p>Reports suggest that Tehran would make detailed proposals in the next two weeks to close gaps. Among the many hurdles in the negotiations is the US push to widen the scope of the deal to include restrictions on Iran’s ballistic arsenal and support for its allies in the region.</p><p>That is fuelled by Israel’s demands and regional narrative, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly pressing US President Donald Trump to shift from nuclear-only parameters.</p><p>Tehran has insisted that these provisions are non-negotiable but that it is open to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>A previous negotiating effort collapsed last year when Israel launched attacks on Iran, triggering the 12-day war that Washington joined in by bombing key Iranian nuclear sites.</p><p>As diplomacy forges a path, both parties are ramping up military pressure.</p><p>The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) held a series of war games on Monday and Tuesday in the Strait of Hormuz to prepare for “potential security and military threats”.</p><p>On Wednesday, Tehran announced new joint naval drills with Russia in the Sea of Oman. Rear Admiral Hassan Maqsoudlou said the exercises were aimed at preventing any unilateral action in the region, and enhancing coordination against threats to maritime security, including risks to commercial vessels and oil tankers.</p><p>The US has also escalated its military build-up in the region. Trump has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, according to satellite imagery.</p><p>The Trump administration also <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/white-house-says-iran-would-be-wise-to-take-deal-amid-military-buildup\">issued new threats against Tehran</a> with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying on Wednesday that “Iran would be very wise to make a deal” with the US. Trump escalated his rhetoric on social media.</p><p>“Should Iran decide not to make a Deal,” the US may need to use an Indian Ocean airbase in the Chagos Islands, “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime”, he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead of aggressive rhetoric, it said it would <a href=\"/features/2025/11/19/cooperation-not-threats-nigeria-wants-us-alliance-to-curb-violent-attacks\">welcome US assistance</a> in dealing with security challenges that have long proved a thorn in the side of successive Nigerian governments.</p><p>Weeks later, on the night of December 25, the US launched what Trump described as “powerful and deadly” <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/26/live-nigeria-confirms-joint-us-strikes-on-isil-targets-in-its-north-west\">strikes</a> in northwest Nigeria but the US military’s Africa Command (AFRICOM) made clear the attacks were carried out “at the request of Nigerian authorities”.</p><p>That cooperation between the US and Nigeria only appears to have grown, culminating this week in <a href=\"/news/2026/2/16/us-deploys-100-soldiers-to-nigeria-for-training-mission-nigerian-military\">100 US military personnel</a> arriving in the country to help train Nigerian soldiers in the fight against armed groups.</p><p>Nigeria’s Ministry of Defence said US forces will assist with “technical support” and “intelligence sharing”, and despite not playing a direct combat role, will help target and defeat “terrorist organisations”.</p><p>To many, the developments come as a surprise – as in a little over three months, Nigeria appears to have overturned Trump’s “Christian slaughter” claim to instead win US military support for Abuja’s own military goals against armed groups.</p><p>“There’s been a strong shift,” said Ryan Cummings, the director of analysis at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused risk management firm. The narrative has “transitioned completely from a slap on the wrist to one where there seems to be a holding of hands in tackling this issue together”.</p><p>Although a notable shift, it is not fully surprising to many analysts, who see Nigeria’s cooperation as a strategic move to de-escalate tensions.</p><p>“It is neither unexpected nor hypocritical,” said Cheta Nwanze, the CEO of Nigerian risk advisory SBM Intelligence, who noted that Nigeria’s longstanding security partnerships since 1999 have favoured Western military doctrines.</p><p>What has shifted, he said, is the “US posture”: Washington now feels more entitled to get involved in a country where it sees strategic interests.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4323271\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323271\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4323271\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-01-22T131724Z_1703878274_RC296JAZ7DJY_RTRMADP_3_USA-NIGERIA-SECURITY-1771450457.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4323271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nigeria’s National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu and US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Allison Hooker deliver a speech during the inauguration of the Nigeria-US Joint Working Group to boost counterterrorism cooperation at the Office of the National Security Adviser in Abuja, Nigeria, on January 22, 2026 [Marvellous Durowaiye/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"lobbyists-and-working-groups\">Lobbyists and working groups</h2><p>Kabir Adamu, the director of Beacon Security and Intelligence in Abuja, feels the Tinubu administration has been “successful in de-escalating the Trump threat and in establishing a joint working group between the two countries”. But the “challenge”, the risk analyst said, is that Abuja has not been transparent enough about the process.</p><p>“At what cost did [the government] do this?” he asked. “It has so far failed to be transparent in letting Nigerians know what agreement it entered with the US government that led to a de-escalation of the situation.”</p><p>In January, the US and Nigeria convened a <a href=\"https://ng.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-at-the-end-of-the-first-session-of-the-us-nigeria-joint-working-group-to-address-nigerias-country-of-particular-concern-designation/\">joint working group</a> to address Nigeria’s designation as a CPC and how the country can work to reduce violence against vulnerable groups. But outside of that, details of what transpired between the first Trump threats and the first US strikes are scant.</p><p>However, Cummings of Signal Risk points to one deal, in particular, that he believes helped turn the tide: on December 17, the Nigerian government, through a legal intermediary, hired the <a href=\"https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/markets/nigeria-hires-us-lobbyists-for-dollar9-million-to-communicate-its-position-to-the/k6sz113\">DCI Group</a>, Washington, DC-based lobbyists, for a reported sum of $9m.</p><p>According to the terms of the contract published online, DCI would “assist the Nigerian government through Aster Legal in communicating its actions to protect Nigerian Christian communities and maintaining U.S support in countering West African jihadist groups and other destabilizing elements”.</p><p>In hiring DCI, Nigeria has decided to “fight fire with fire”, Cummings said, comparing Abuja’s approach with what <a href=\"/features/2025/5/21/can-ramaphosa-charm-offensive-help-fix-south-africas-ties-with-trumps-us\">South Africa has done</a> in the face of similar false accusations by Trump’s government that a “white genocide” is taking place there.</p><p>In both Nigeria and South Africa, the claims were first spread by local minority lobby groups aided by Republicans and evangelicals in the US, Cummings said. These groups fed selectively framed or exaggerated accounts into the Trump administration.</p><p>Nigeria hired a lobby group “to basically persuade the Trump administration that what is happening in Nigeria and what has been told to the Trump administration by certain lobby groups was not an accurate reflection of the status quo,” Cummings said.</p><p>“And that seemingly has been pivotal in changing the stance of the US government towards Nigeria,” he said.</p><p>Trump’s Africa positions are strongly shaped by a conservative evangelical base in the US, Cummings added, displaying concern for Christians globally and sympathy for white minorities portrayed as supposed victims of Black governments.</p><p>In the sense of playing to his core constituency, Trump’s concerns for these groups are genuine, Cummings said, but in other ways, they are instrumental: Trump uses issues like “Christian persecution” or “white genocide” to pressure other countries on broader foreign‑policy alignment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4323265\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4323265\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4323265\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-10T220656Z_254521550_RC29OIAZU7HR_RTRMADP_3_USA-NIGERIA-TROOP-1771450448.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C512&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nigeria\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4323265\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People read newspapers reporting on US air strikes against Islamic State fighters in Nigeria, in Lagos, on December 26, 2025 [Sodiq Adelakun/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"calculated-trade-off\">‘Calculated trade-off’</h2><p>Pressuring states for geopolitical gains plays out not just in Africa but outside the continent as well, both Nwanze and Adamu pointed out, citing the US’s recent abduction of Nicolas Maduro, the then-president of Venezuela, which, like Nigeria, holds significant oil reserves.</p><p>“Nigeria holds tens of billions of barrels of oil reserves and is Africa’s largest producer. The US National Security Strategy prioritises securing strategic resources through unilateral action”, so to some extent, the US’s recent moves regarding Nigeria are about “asserting control over global energy flows”, Nwanze said.</p><p>“The counterterrorism framing is genuine but convenient because it provides cover for interventions that also serve resource security objectives,” he explained.</p><p>Also citing the example of Venezuela, Adamu said that witnessing the US’s abduction of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/maduro-says-hes-a-prisoner-of-war-why-that-matters\">Maduro</a> also likely “made the Nigerian government more disposed to US cooperation”.</p><p>Adamu described Nigeria’s decision to allow the US to intervene as “a calculated trade-off” – one that provides security benefits through US troops and intelligence sharing; and stronger diplomatic ties with a powerful country — while also maintaining Nigeria-led oversight of US operations.</p><p>From Tinubu’s side, cooperation with the US is an “operational necessity”, Nwanze said. “Nigeria’s security forces are overstretched, and US intelligence and air power offer tactical advantages against militant groups.”</p><p>However, Cummings cautioned that while US support may improve Nigeria’s tactical counterterrorism capacity, it “treats the symptoms” and not the socioeconomic conditions at the root of the violence.</p><p>“There hasn’t been enough focus on how America can actually assist the Nigerian government in addressing the causes of these insurgencies, which very much lies in basic economics – creating employment opportunities, ensuring governance and access to public services in these areas are good, and ensuring that you as a country or as a government can make a better deal for local communities than the jihadists can,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"risk-of-escalation-by-armed-groups\">Risk of escalation by armed groups</h2><p>In fact, a US military presence in Nigeria may actually empower the armed groups, the analysts noted.</p><p>“There is a real risk of escalation,” Nwanze said, noting that recent security data compiled by his firm has shown “an uptick in attacks” since the US’s CPC designation.</p><p>He said armed groups like Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) and the al-Qaeda-linked Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) “have consistently exploited narratives of foreign intervention to recruit and radicalise”.</p><p>“The December strikes [on Nigeria by the US] provide propaganda material, allowing them to frame local grievances as part of a global war against Western forces,” he added.</p><p>“There is also the risk that militant groups will rebrand themselves as resisting foreign occupation, gaining propaganda advantages that outweigh tactical losses.”</p><p>Adamu said a US presence could motivate armed groups to intensify attacks, especially symbolically. But more than that, “due to the controversy and difference in support between Nigerians for the US presence, it can lead to a further polarisation of Nigeria along religious and ethnic divides”.</p><p>There are “domestic perception risks” for Abuja, he said, noting that previous Nigerian governments had faced public criticism when allowing US presence in Nigeria, and many now feel Tinubu is <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/856429-nigeria-on-the-brink-as-we-handover-sovereignty-to-america-by-jibrin-ibrahim.html\">“handing the country over to US imperialism”</a>.</p><p>The domestic “optics” are a concern, Nwanze agreed. “The perception of compromised sovereignty feeds nationalist resentment and deepens distrust in government,” he said.</p><p>For Cummings, Nigeria was in a tough spot in the face of US aggression, and “on balance, it was a smarter decision by the Tinubu government [to have] greater alignment with the United States”.</p><p>The analyst argues that Nigeria is historically more pro‑West, with economic, political, social and diaspora ties to the US. He says in the absence of alternative partners – like BRICS or other South-South alliances – Abuja’s cooperation and seeming alignment with the Trump administration was the best way to de-escalate this crisis.</p><p>But other analysts like Nwanze are concerned that by choosing to concede to Trump the right to violate Nigerian sovereignty — even with Nigerian oversight — the Tinubu government had left the country exposed to further crises.</p><p>“Adding a US military footprint, however limited, risks deepening instability by broadening the conflict’s ideological scope,” he warned. “The [armed] groups were already motivated; now they have a more compelling story to tell.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
