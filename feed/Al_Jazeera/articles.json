Many were threatened with violence, imprisonment or death.</p><p>AP spoke with three Bangladeshi men who escaped from the Russian military, including Rahman, who said that after arriving in Moscow, he and a group of fellow Bangladeshi workers were told to sign Russian documents that turned out to be military contracts.</p><p>They were taken to an army camp for training in drone warfare techniques, medical evacuation procedures and basic combat skills using heavy weapons.</p><p>Rahman protested, complaining that this was not the work he agreed to do. A Russian commander offered a stark reply through a translation app: “Your agent sent you here. We bought you.”</p><p>Rahman said the workers in his group were threatened with 10-year jail terms and beaten. “They’d say, ‘Why don’t you work? Why are you crying?’ and kick us,” said Rahman, who escaped and returned home after seven months.</p><p>The families of three other Bangladeshi men who are missing said their loved ones shared similar accounts with relatives.</p><p>AP said the workers’ narratives were corroborated by documents, including travel papers, Russian military contracts, medical and police reports, and photos. The documents show the visas granted to Bangladeshi workers, their injuries sustained during battles and evidence of their participation in the war.</p><p>The three Bangladeshi men told AP they were coerced into front-line tasks against their will, including advancing ahead of Russian forces, transporting supplies, evacuating wounded soldiers and recovering the dead.</p><p>Men from other South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have also complained of being duped into signing up to fight by Russian recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa, Jordan and Iraq said the same has happened to citizens from their countries.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Some Bangladeshi workers were lured into the army with promises of positions far from the front line.</p><p>Mohan Miajee enlisted in the Russian army after the job that initially brought him to Russia – serving as an electrician for a gas-processing plant in the remote Far East – was plagued by harsh working conditions and relentless cold.</p><p>While searching for employment online, Miajee was contacted by a Russian army recruiter. When he expressed his reluctance to kill, the recruiter said his skills as an electrician made him an ideal candidate for an electronic warfare or drone unit and not combat.</p><p>Miajee was taken in January 2025 to a military camp in the captured city of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine. He showed the camp commander documents describing his experience and explained that his recruiter had instructed him to ask for “electrical work”.</p><p>“The commander told me, ‘You have been made to sign a contract to join the battalion. You cannot do any other work here. You have been deceived,'” he said after returning to his village of Munshiganj.</p><p>Miajee said he was beaten with shovels, handcuffed and tortured in a cramped basement cell and held there every time he refused to carry out an order or made a mistake. Because of language barriers, for example, “if they told us to go to the right and we went to the left, they would beat us severely,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4268402\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4268402\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4268402\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26026620526228-1769504088.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Russia war\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4268402\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mohammed Siraj holds a photograph of his 20-year-old son, Sajjad, who was killed after being taken to fight in Russia, at his home in Lakshmipur, Bangladesh [Rajib Dhar/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Neither the Russian Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs nor the Bangladeshi government responded to a list of questions, the AP report said.</p><p>The families of some of these men filed a complaint with police in Bangladesh and travelled on three occasions to the capital, Dhaka, to pressure the government to investigate.</p><p>Salma Akdar has not heard from her husband since March 26. In their last conversation, Ajgar Hussein, 40, told her he had been sold to the Russian army.</p><p>Hussein left in December 2024, believing he was being offered a job as a laundry attendant in Russia, his wife said. For two weeks, he was in regular touch.</p><p>Then he told his wife he was being taken to an army camp where they were trained to use weapons and carry heavy loads up to 80kg (176lb). “Seeing all this, he cried a lot and told them, ‘We cannot do these things. We have never done this before,'” his wife said.</p><p>For two months after that, he was offline. He reappeared briefly to explain they were being forced to fight in the war. Russian commanders “told him that if he did not go, they would detain him, shoot him, stop providing food”, she said.</p><p>Families in the village confronted the recruiting agent, demanding to know why their loved ones were being trained for war. The agent replied dismissively, saying it was standard procedure in Russia, insisting that even launderers had to undergo similar training.</p><p>Hussein left a final audio note for his wife: “Please pray for me.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

In an interview last year, Bovino’s sister, Natalie, recalled how strongly he reacted to the television series The Border, which focused on the US Border Patrol.</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"872\">“Greg was so psyched because he loved the toughness and the values of all these old-timers,” she said, according to a report by the British outlet The Times of London.</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"872\">“Then he watched it, and the Border Patrol person was a criminal. Greg came home totally pissed about it. Since then, he was like, ‘Dude, I want to do Border Patrol.’”</p><p data-start=\"602\" data-end=\"872\">According to a report by the Chicago Sun-Times, Bovino’s father, Mike Bovino, was involved in a fatal crash in 1981, killing a young woman after “drunkenly crashing his truck head-on into her car.”</p><p>Court records show the judge ordered Mike Bovino to serve time in state prison “for treatment of his alcoholism”. He was jailed for four months, and according to the report, the lawsuit forced the sale of the family’s bar and the property it sat on. Greg’s mother, Betty Bovino, later filed for divorce, gaining custody of the couple’s three children as part of the settlement.</p><p data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">Bovino joined the US Border Patrol in 1996, beginning his career in El Paso, Texas, a key hub for border enforcement.</p><p data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">Over the next decade, he moved into senior leadership roles across the southwest, including Arizona and California, and New Orleans in the southeast.</p><p data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">More recently, Bovino has become one of the most recognisable faces of US immigration enforcement, following Trump’s return to the White House.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"was-bovino-fired\" data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">Was Bovino fired?</h2><p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denied rumours that Bovino had been fired<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/greg-bovino-demoted-minneapolis-border-patrol/685770/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-ylk=\"slk:,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">,</a>  saying in a post on X that: “Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties.”</p><p></p><h2 id=\"who-is-tom-homan-trump-s-border-czar-heading-to-minneapolis\" data-start=\"100\" data-end=\"333\">Who is Tom Homan, Trump’s border tsar heading to Minneapolis?</h2><p>Nevertheless, Bovino is now no longer leading ICE’s activities in Minnesota.</p><p>Instead, US President Donald Trump has deputed Tom Homan, his so-called “border czar”, to take charge of the crackdown on immigrants in the midwestern state.</p><p>A longtime US immigration official with more than four decades of experience in border and immigration enforcement, the 64-year-old Homan became a key figure during the Barack Obama administration, leading ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations unit. That branch of ICE is responsible for finding people with deportation orders and removing them from the country.</p><p>In 2015, when Obama was president, Homan received a Presidential Rank Award, one of the highest honours for senior civil servants.</p><p>According to reports, he was at his retirement party in January 2017 when Trump’s then-choice for homeland security secretary, John Kelly, asked him to stay at ICE. Homan accepted, after taking a weekend to think about the offer, and became a leading figure in the first Trump administration through four tumultuous years.</p><p>Under Obama, the US carried out 432,000 deportations in 2013, the highest annual total since records were kept – until 2025. Deportations under the first Trump administration never topped 350,000. But in December 2025, the DHS announced that the Trump administration had deported more than 600,000 people in his first 11 months back in office, while another 2.5 million people had “self-deported” – voluntarily fled the country. As a result, the US, for the first time in decades, had net negative immigration in 2025.</p><p>Homan, who Trump hired to oversee border security in his second term, has been central to the administration’s crackdown on immigrants. Now, with the Minnesota appointment, the ambit of his role has been widened – to controversial ICE actions far from the southern border.</p><p>“I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,” Trump wrote on Monday on Truth Social. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” the president added.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-is-homan-s-stance-on-immigration\">What is Homan’s stance on immigration?</h2><p data-start=\"81\" data-end=\"282\">When he was appointed border tsar, Homan was widely viewed as a figure who not only shared Trump’s hardline views but also brought extensive hands-on experience in immigration enforcement and policy.</p><p data-start=\"81\" data-end=\"282\">Homan portrays undocumented immigration as black and white and has made no apologies for Trump’s policy of targeting everyone in the country without proper documentation.</p><p>“If you’re in the country illegally, you should be concerned,” he said in a 2018 interview with The Associated Press news agency. “That’s the way it’s supposed to be. Just like if I go speeding down the highway, are you worried about getting a ticket? If you lie on your taxes, are you worried about an audit?”</p><p>But Homan himself has been accused of illegalities – in September 2024, he was reportedly recorded accepting a bag containing $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents. Homan and the Trump White House have denied the accusations, but the administration has so far not explained what happened to the cash.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

The official said the deal was expected to be implemented within a year.</p><h2 id=\"eu-exports-expected-to-double\">EU exports ‘expected to double’</h2><p>The EU said it expected its exports to India to double by 2032 as a result of the deal.</p><p>Bilateral trade between India and the EU in goods has already grown by nearly 90 percent over the past decade, reaching 120 billion euros ($139bn) in 2024, according to EU figures. Trade in services accounts for a further 60 billion euros ($69bn), EU data shows.</p><p>Under the agreement, tariffs on 96.6 percent of EU goods exports to India would be eliminated or reduced, EU officials said. The deal would save up to 4 billion euros ($4.74bn) a year in duties on European products, officials said.</p><p>Among the products that would have tariffs all or mostly eliminated were machinery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Tariffs on cars would gradually reduce to 10 percent with a quota of 250,000 vehicles a year, officials said, while EU service providers would gain privileged access to India in key areas such as financial and maritime services. Tariffs on EU aircraft and spacecraft would be eliminated for almost all products.</p><p>Tariffs would be cut to 20-30 percent on EU wine, 40 percent on spirits, and 50 percent on beer, while tariffs on fruit juices and processed food would be eliminated.</p><p>“The EU stands to gain the highest level of access ever granted to a trade partner in the traditionally protected Indian market,” von der Leyen said on Sunday. “We will gain a significant competitive advantage in key industrial and agri-good sectors.”</p><p>Last-minute talks on Monday had focused on several sticking points, including the impact of the EU’s carbon border tax on steel, sources familiar with the discussions told the AFP news agency.</p><p>Talks on the India-EU trade deal were launched in 2007, but for many years made little progress. However, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine led to the relaunch of talks in 2022, while United States President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policy spurred rapid progress in negotiations.</p><p>India and the EU also announced the launch of a security and defence partnership, similar to partnerships the EU has with Japan and South Korea, as von der Leyen said Brussels and New Delhi would grow their strategic partnership further.</p><p>The moves come as India, which has relied on Russia for key military hardware for decades, has tried to reduce its dependence on Moscow by diversifying imports and pushing its domestic manufacturing base, while Europe is doing the same with regard to Washington.</p><p class=\"p1\">The EU-India deal comes days after Brussels signed a key pact with the South American bloc <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/eu-mercosur-bloc-sign-free-trade-deal-after-25-years-of-negotiations\">Mercosur</a>, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.

United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That is wrong. ICE has authorised its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that needs only be signed by a Border Patrol agent. That’s unconstitutional, and that’s wrong,” Madel says in the video.</p><p>Madel said the party had made it “nearly impossible” for Republicans like him to win a statewide election in Minnesota, even as the Democratic Party in the state is embroiled in a sweeping corruption scandal.</p><p></p><p>Madel’s decision comes just days after US Border Patrol agents shot dead Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while he was filming an Operation Metro Surge patrol in Minneapolis on Saturday.</p><p>The shooting unleashed a <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/25/outrage-after-us-agents-kill-icu-nurse-alex-pretti-in-minnesota\">wave of outrage across the US,</a> as well as questions about how it was handled by top White House officials such as Kristi Noem, who heads the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p><p>Noem and her department – which oversees ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – were quick to place the blame on Pretti in the aftermath of the shooting, who she accused of “brandishing” a weapon at Border Patrol officers and engaging in “domestic terrorism”.</p><p>Pretti was a licensed gun owner and armed at the time of his killing. Video evidence shows he was not holding his gun at the time he was shot. Instead, CBP agents can be seen disarming Pretti before shooting him multiple times.</p><p>Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, told Al Jazeera that Noem and others had broken with traditional protocol following a civilian shooting.</p><p>“The response of the homeland secretary there was very offensive and off the cuff. When you have a shooting of a civilian by a law enforcement officer, there should not be comment until the facts come out,” said Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 under President George W Bush<span>.</span></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Noem’s remarks and the narrative around the shooting drew rare criticism from Republicans, some of whom took issue with the characterisation of Pretti’s gun at the scene.</p><p>Republicans such as Senators Bill Cassidy and Lisa Murkowski, Representative Thomas Massie, and traditionally conservative organisations like the National Rifle Association, have all pushed back and alluded to Pretti’s right to bear arms under the US Constitution.</p><p>“Lawfully carrying a firearm does not justify federal agents killing an American — especially, as video footage appears to show, after the victim had been disarmed,” Murkowski wrote on X.</p><p>Senator Thom Tillis, another Republican, also appeared to tacitly criticise Trump officials on X, writing that “any administration official who rushes to judgement and tries to shut down an investigation” would do a disservice to the president and the nation.</p><p>Cassidy, Murkowski, and Tillis are among a small group of congressional Republicans who have called for an in-depth investigation into Pretti’s shooting.</p><p>David Smith, an expert in US politics and foreign policy at the University of Sydney in Australia, told Al Jazeera that silence elsewhere in the Republican Party also spoke volumes.</p><p>“The fact that most Republicans are really quiet about it is in itself a very telling sign,” Smith said.</p><p>“Because of the fact the Department of Homeland Security suggested that, because Alex Pretti was carrying a gun, therefore he was a terrorist … A lot of Republicans are really worried about what their pro-gun constituents are going to think,” he said.</p><p>Smith said disquiet had spread beyond the pro-gun lobby, as well, to other corners of the Republican Party that fear government overreach.</p><p>“They’re looking at this situation in American cities where you have armed federal troops wearing masks with no accountability whatsoever using violence in almost a seemingly random way,” he continued.</p><p>“This really looks like the government just throwing its weight around in ways that are dangerous to ordinary people.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Still, disagreements remained over whether SDF fighters would integrate individually or retain their battalions. The SDF also wanted some form of autonomy or political decentralisation for the northeast.</p><p>But <a href=\"/news/2026/1/7/syria-designates-aleppos-kurdish-areas-closed-military-zones-as-clashes-persist\">clashes</a> in Aleppo and a rapid government offensive pushed the SDF back. The offensive was bolstered by an alliance of sorts with tribes in Deir Az Zor and Raqqa, and support from the US, which signalled that its yearlong support for the SDF may be ending.</p><p>“…the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps,” US Special Envoy Tom Barrack wrote on social media platform X.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It’s very much clear the US gave the green light for advances from the government in Deir Az Zor,” Thomas McGee, the Max Weber Fellow specialising on Syria at the European University Institute in Florence, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>With this new reality on the ground, a new deal was agreed on January 18 that gave more favourable terms to Damascus.</p><p>“The March agreement has been replaced by the January deal signed under military duress on Damascus’s terms,” Nanar Hawach, International Crisis Group (ICG)’s senior Syria analyst, told Al Jazeera. “Both parties have agreed to individual integration: SDF fighters join the Syrian army as individuals, not preserved units. This was Damascus’s core demand.”</p><p>Mazloum Abdi (also known as Mazloum Kobani), the SDF commander, has also reportedly been offered positions as either deputy defence minister or governor of Hasakah.</p><p>“It seems like the government has all the cards,” Alexander McKeever, author of the newsletter This Week in Northern Syria, told Al Jazeera from Damascus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"kurdish-fears\">Kurdish fears</h2><p>An extended <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/ceasefire-between-syrian-army-and-kurdish-led-forces-extended-for-15-days\">15-day ceasefire</a> was agreed on Saturday, though analysts and observers said clashes were ongoing. They also said the ceasefire was likely brokered by the US to move ISIL (ISIS) fighters imprisoned in the area to Iraq, before the beginning of a more intense government offensive.</p><p>Many residents of Deir Az Zor and Raqqa celebrated the Syrian government’s entering their areas. Videos spread on social media of locals stomping on yellow SDF flags and waving the green, white and black Syrian flag. On Saturday, the Syrian Ministry of Justice announced it had released 126 juveniles from al-Aqtan, an SDF prison in the Raqqa province.</p><p>But as the Syrian Army continued its offensive, residents of Kurdish-majority areas have expressed fears that massacres inflicted on the coast or in Suwayda last year could repeat in the northeast.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Analysts said recent history has shaken this population to the core. From 2014 to 2017, a <a href=\"/news/2024/5/31/yazidi-survivors-ten-years-on\">genocide of the Yazidi people</a>, a Kurdish-speaking religious minority, was committed by ISIL. Other incidents involved Turkiye or Turkish-backed groups, some of which were incorporated into the Syrian army, including an <a href=\"/news/2018/1/21/turkeys-troops-cross-over-into-syrias-afrin\">invasion in Afrin</a> in 2018. Many families are still displaced from Afrin.</p><p>“Kurdish fear is existential, grounded in what they’ve witnessed over the past year and experienced directly this month,” ICG’s Hawach said. “The Syrian army includes factions that view Kurds as enemies, not fellow citizens. This creates genuine fears about what government control could mean.”</p><p>In Kobane, a Kurdish-majority city on the border with Turkiye that is also known as Ain al-Arab, thousands of families have sought refuge after the fighting. Locals and analysts said the area was overcrowded to the point that some displaced families were sleeping in cars or crowding together in homes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The United Nations says more than 134,000 people have been displaced in the Hasakah province of northeast Syria due to the clashes.</p><p>Locals in Kobane claimed the government had cut off water and electricity since January 17. The Syrian government denied it was besieging the area and that the Tishrin Dam, which provides electricity, had been damaged during the fighting.</p><p>The area is also undergoing an intense cold front of sub-zero temperatures, which locals call the worst in years. The Kurdish Red Crescent reported on Saturday that five children had frozen to death in the last week.</p><p>A UN convoy of 24 trucks arrived in Kobane on Sunday, carrying blankets and basic needs, but a resident, who asked their name be withheld for fear of retribution, told Al Jazeera, “It’s not enough.</p><p>“We don’t have vegetables, we do not have basic items such as sugar or rice,” they said. “There are half a million people, all without electricity and without water … and with major internet problems.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-will-of-the-syrian-government\">‘The will of the Syrian government is not a military takeover’</h2><p>In addition to the hardship, locals expressed fear that after the ceasefire period, government forces may enter Kurdish-dominant towns.</p><p>Musa, the coordinator of the Missing Persons group, said locals feared that sieges and service cuts would turn into policies of collective punishment, that national and religious minorities such as Kurds and Yazidis would be targeted or subjected to arbitrary arrests or enforced disappearances.</p><p>“The military escalation, the imposition of severe restrictions on movement, and the cutting off of basic services have led to widespread displacement and an unprecedented state of collective fear, particularly in predominantly Kurdish cities like Kobane and Hasakah, in addition to the serious repercussions of what happened in the Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh neighbourhoods of Aleppo,” Musa said.</p><p>Syrian government officials expressed awareness of concerns from locals in northeast Syria.</p><p>“The suspicious emotions are understandable after decades of marginalising discrimination and most recently after the systematic propaganda against the state itself, plus, of course, I will not hide behind my fingers, the violations that took place in Suwayda and on the coast,” Obayda Ghadban, a researcher with the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The will of the Syrian government is not a military takeover; it is an option, but it is directed to a political solution, and we hope it is the one that will prevail. Not the military or security option,” Ghadban emphasised.</p><p>He said President al-Sharaa and the government are committed to ensuring Kurdish rights, including through a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">presidential decree</a> from Friday, January 16.</p><p>But government assurances have done little to ease the angst of many of Syria’s Kurdish community and other minorities in the country’s northeast. Locals said that for goodwill to be gained, the government could reopen roads, restore basic services, give access to humanitarian organisations and ensure civilians are protected.</p><p>“What we are witnessing is a true test for the transitional government: Either it protects civilians and their rights, or the region slides into a deeper humanitarian and human rights catastrophe, the price of which will be paid by future generations,” Musa said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p><strong>Johannesburg, South Africa –</strong> On a late November morning – two days before leaders of the world’s leading economies convened in Johannesburg for the 2025 Group of 20 summit – the governors of the South African and Chinese central banks met just 20 minutes away to inaugurate a system that many hope can help move international trade out of the shadow of dollar dominance.</p><p>At a ceremony at the South African Reserve Bank in Pretoria that day, Standard Bank – Africa’s largest by assets – became the first on the continent to link directly into China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This integration means African businesses can now settle payments with China directly in renminbi without the use of any intermediary currency – notably the United States dollar (USD).</p><p>The USD has been the world’s principal reserve currency since the end of World War II, and is used in more than 80 percent of international trade today.</p><p>But in recent years, talk of alternatives to the greenback has been gaining traction, particularly in the Global South, and spearheaded by the BRICS group of developing economies, of which South Africa is a part, along with Brazil, Russia, India and China as the founding members. Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates have also joined in recent years.</p><p>Like South Africa, Brazil has also integrated into CIPS. At the same time, it has increasingly been using the real and the yuan to settle bilateral trade with China, such as in the sale of soya beans, bypassing the USD.</p><p>Other countries have also been leaning into the use of local currencies. India and the UAE have traded in rupee and dirham, while China and the UAE have settled liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade in yuan. China has traded with others, including Argentina, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, using the yuan. And China and Russia have sharply shifted their bilateral trade settlement into local currencies, partly as a workaround to bypass Western sanctions. China’s oil trade with Iran and Russia has mainly been settled in renminbi. India and Russia have increased the use of roubles and rupees for their bilateral trade.</p><p>As a group, BRICS is also pushing ahead with its Bridge digital currency that, if successful, would allow them to trade bypassing both the USD and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) – a messaging network banks use to facilitate international payments, which is heavily influenced by US and European Union regulations. Although the Bridge system is not yet active, a working model is expected to be presented during this year’s BRICS summit in India.</p><p>For analysts, bilateral trade allowing countries to set their own terms has always been part of international economics. So such endeavours are not new or unexpected.</p><p>However, they are increasing in frequency as there is more incentive to move away from sole dependence on the USD, say analysts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3766309\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3766309\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3766309\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2015-03-13T120000Z_325275701_GM1EB3D1PDE01_RTRMADP_3_AFRICA-CURRENCIES-1749565248.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Money\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3766309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A currency exchange operator counts US dollars in Abuja, Nigeria [File: Afolabi Sotunde/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hidden-costs-that-benefit-the-us\">‘Hidden costs’ that benefit the US</h2><p>While the US, as the world’s leading economy, has historically dominated global trade, that influence has waned over the last decade, with China taking the lead, especially in the Global South, which accounts for 85 percent of the world’s population and about 50 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>In Africa, for example, China was the source of most of the continent’s imports in 2024, followed by the EU, India and the US, according to the United Nations Comtrade database. For that reason, bilateral trade in local currencies, or integrating CIPS, makes economic sense, analysts say.</p><p>“For every time you do a transaction in the dollar, there is a hidden cost that goes back to the US,” notes Sanusha Naidu, a foreign policy analyst at South African think tank, the Institute for Global Dialogue.</p><p>Now, according to the analyst, countries around the world have rightly started asking: “Why must we pay the US that cost?”</p><p>Instead of the buyer’s local currency getting converted into USD before being converted into the seller’s currency, with both parties risking losing some revenue in the process, money can now flow directly.</p><p>But for Danny Bradlow, a professor with the Centre for Advancement of Scholarship at the University of Pretoria, local currency trade faces challenges; and these are less about what is possible and more about what is practical.</p><p>Although two countries can trade in whatever currency they choose, whether each party would want stores of the other’s currency is unclear, he said.</p><p>For example, if two countries with not many transactions between them – like Botswana and Mexico – want to trade goods, it would be more practical for them to convert pulas and pesos into dollars to trade with the in-demand USD than to keep large amounts of one another’s tender.</p><p>Another challenge in bypassing the USD is that the “infrastructure that supports trade settlement in local currencies must first be in place to ensure the wide adoption of local currency transactions”, said Shirley Yu, managing director of ACME Macro Advisory and director of the China-Africa Initiative at the London School of Economics.</p><p>As well as CIPS, she pointed to BRICS Pay (a decentralised financial messaging and payment system designed for BRICS nations) and Project mBridge (a multi-central bank digital currency platform), which are enabled by blockchain technology. “The technology infrastructure itself enables countries to trade in local currencies without going through SWIFT or using the dollar as the medium of exchange”, but these need to be built up, she said.</p><p>Although the number of local currency transactions is increasing, it is still a fraction of what goes through SWIFT and the USD. The Chinese currency is still involved in less than 10 percent of global trade, for instance. While other currencies, like the European tender, are also in use globally, Yu noted that “the renminbi is a bigger trade settlement currency than the euro”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"incentives-to-change\">‘Incentives’ to change</h2><p>But what has shifted and grown dramatically are “the incentives to change and develop alternatives”, said Bradlow of Pretoria University, “and one of the ways you see that is that the price of gold is going up so much”.</p><p>Countries are no longer treating the USD as a fully stable reserve currency; instead, they are managing and hedging their risk against it, says Naidu. The rise in gold and silver prices signals this declining trust in the dollar, she adds.</p><p>Chris Weafer, an investment analyst with Macro-Advisory, a strategic consultancy that focuses on Eurasia, says political changes in the US have led to this distrust.</p><p>“President [Donald] Trump’s lack of predictability and the huge US debt mean that the US dollar is not as safe or as predictable as it used to be.” The US national debt is currently more than <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/23/us-national-debt-surpasses-a-record-38-trillion\">$38 trillion</a>.</p><p>“But even without Trump, many people around the world – even in the West – would say that the role of the dollar is a problem,” Bradlow argued.</p><p>“Having a system that’s so heavily dependent on the dollar means … vulnerability to US monetary and economic policies. Shifting to a system that is more diversified or more internationalised in some way but not subject to one country’s control would be more acceptable to everyone,” he says.</p><p>But does that mean the end – or even the beginning of the end – for the US dollar?</p><p>Most analysts still say no.</p><p>“The US dollar will remain the global reference currency, for example, pricing oil or materials, and would be the world central banks’ main reserve currency,” Weafer said.</p><p>There are currently “no alternatives to the US dollar in terms of currency”, he said.</p><p>But experts also say a replacement for the USD is not necessarily what the Global South and BRICS countries are seeking. What they want is diversification and alternative or additional trade settlement systems – ways to get around SWIFT or a Western hegemonic system through which the US asserts its dominance.</p><p>However, even these alternatives “will still rely on the US dollar as a reference currency”, Weafer noted.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US will also do all it can to protect the dominance of the dollar, Yu said.</p><p>“President Trump wants to ensure the dollar’s global dominance, through the Genius Act,” she notes, referring to the US law that creates a framework for issuing and supervising US‑dollar stablecoins. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like the USD.</p><p>“The dollar is fundamental to the US national power, therefore, national security. The global dominance of the dollar will be protected at all costs.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"usd-in-a-slow-burn-decline\">USD in a ‘slow burn’ decline</h2><p>Although the USD faces no real competition and will maintain its position, for international relations expert Naidu, the debate playing out is about more than just the “hard currency” value of the dollar. It is about the rise and fall of nations and how hegemonic power tends to peak and unravel after 70-80 years.</p><p>The USD, like the US empire itself, is a “wounded hegemon”, she said.</p><p>When a hegemon becomes wounded and feels its dominance challenged, “it becomes very dangerous and unpredictable”.</p><p>Naidu said the four pillars of US structural power – security, finance, knowledge and production – have all been anchored in the dollar. As more countries become risk-averse to the dollar, and as alternative payment systems emerge, these pillars weaken.</p><p>So while the USD is not about to be suddenly replaced, it is undergoing a “slow burn” decline, she said, arguing that this is more dangerous and consequential than if it were a rapid collapse.</p><p>Although the world is a long way away from having another currency to rival the dollar, if one were to emerge in the “very long term”, many experts say it might be China that is next in line.</p><p>If countries lose confidence in the US economy, political leadership and dollar, “eventually, it will be the rise and greater use of the Chinese yuan that will break the global dominance of the US dollar,” Weafer said, especially in the Global South.</p><p>Yu said “the scale of dedollarisation will certainly expand among Global South countries”, especially in the light of recent geopolitical events in Venezuela, and US tensions with Iran.</p><p>But “the quantum shift for the global currency architecture will happen when the petroyuan replaces the petrodollar”, she added, referring to a scenario where the yuan becomes the currency used for global oil pricing and settlement – a function currently performed by the USD.</p><p>“This event, if it does happen, will signal the end of the US dollar as the global central reserve currency,” Yu said, noting how China’s oil trade with Iran and Russia over the past few years has already largely been conducted in renminbi.</p><p>The bottom line, according to analysts, is that there is no imminent or even medium-term threat to the USD, but that is less because of anything the greenback is doing right, and more because international trade, for the most part, has few other options at the moment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Shawon had gone to jail with Musabbir four times under the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which was widely accused of brutal crackdowns on the political opposition, including through mass arrests, killings and forced disappearances.</p><p>That era of fear, many Bangladeshis believed, had ended with Hasina’s ouster in the popular student-led uprising, which forced her to flee to India on August 5, 2024.</p><p>But while the interim government of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, who replaced Hasina, is not accused of orchestrating any such excesses, political violence in Bangladesh is surging again before the upcoming vote.</p><p>“Police say there was no political motive [behind Musabbir’s killing], but fear doesn’t disappear,” said Shawon, a leader of the BNP’s student wing in the capital, Dhaka. “We don’t want killings or confrontation with anyone. But the reality is, during elections, violence feels inevitable.”</p><p>Bangladesh is heading to the polls for the first time since Hasina was removed from power, ending more than 15 years of hardline government. The Yunus interim government is overseeing a vote that coincides with a referendum on state reforms, with about 120 million voters eligible to cast ballots in the South Asian nation of approximately 170 million people.</p><p>Yet, a series of killings, threats and street clashes is reviving fears of a return to past election-season violence, which Bangladesh has routinely grappled with since its 1971 independence from Pakistan.</p><p>Across Bangladesh’s 300 constituencies, the BNP is leading a coalition of 10 like-minded parties. Meanwhile, the Jamaat-e-Islami, also known as the Jamaat, is heading a separate 11-party alliance, which includes the National Citizen Party, a group formed by students who led the anti-Hasina movement.</p><p>Outside these blocs, the Islami Andolan Bangladesh, which broke away from the Jamaat-led alliance, and the Jatiya Party, a longtime ally of Hasina’s Awami League (AL), are contesting independently. The AL itself is absent from the election as Yunus’s administration banned its political activities in May 2025.</p><p>But while these parties represent diverse ideological platforms, a spate of killings and violent attacks across the country is sparing none of them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4267846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4267846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4267846\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25198412179733-1769477144.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A woman mourns the death of her son who died during the previous day's violent clashes between supporters of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and security forces in Gopalganj, Bangladesh, Thursday, July 17, 2025.

Yet, for party activists, that distinction offers little reassurance.</p><p>Local media and rights groups say BNP leaders and activists account for 13 of the 16 deaths recorded since the election schedule was announced. The others include Hadi, Jamaat leader Anwarullah, and a leader of the banned AL youth wing, Jubo League.</p><p>Seven of the victims were shot dead, underscoring the widespread presence of illegal firearms, reports Prothom Alo, a Bangla daily.</p><p>Government data show that of the 3,619 weapons looted from security forces during the 2024 uprising, about 1,360 remain unaccounted for, along with a large quantity of ammunition, despite security forces recovering more than 60 percent of the stolen arms before the polls.</p><p>Meanwhile, at least 62 election-related clashes have been recorded nationwide since the election schedule was announced, according to a report by the Human Rights Support Society (HRSS).</p><p>For many Bangladeshis, these deaths revive bitter memories of decades of political violence.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4267848\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4267848\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4267848\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25198492534838-1769477203.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jamaat-e-Islami activists condemn Wednesday's attack in Gopalganj on National Citizen Party (NCP) leaders by supporters of the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, during a protest in front of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Thursday, July 17, 2025.

It represents both a chance for reunion after a long separation, and an opportunity to secure treatment for their son, whose life, schooling, and normal childhood have all been destroyed by the two-year war.</p><p>With the United States pushing a deeply intransigent Israel to progress to phase two of the ceasefire that began on October 10, the reopening of the Rafah crossing was directly tied by the far-right government to the recovery of the remains of the final Israeli captive, and only partially for pedestrian use under strict military supervision.</p><p>On Monday, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/remains-of-last-israeli-captive-in-gaza-retrieved-says-israel\">retrieval of the last Israeli captive’s body</a> appeared to open that locked door, with thousands in urgent need of treatment or family reunification in a state of anxious anticipation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>From her family’s displacement site in the Nuseirat refugee camp near Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Khitam, 50, a mother of six, sits trying to organise her thoughts as news circulates about Rafah.</p><p>Next to her is her 14-year-old son, Yousef, unable to walk, suffering from a rare genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a painful condition primarily affecting his bone development, with potential cardiac complications.</p><p>“Yousef has been undergoing treatment for this syndrome since he was very young … he has had around 16 surgeries,” Khitam tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>“We got used to hospitals, but before the war, there was some monitoring and a little hope.”</p><p>Since long before October 2023, the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt has been a lifeline for Palestinians, not only as a natural exit and entry point, but also as a symbol of connection with the outside world.</p><p>Before the war, the crossing was heavily used by patients seeking medical treatment, families visiting relatives abroad, and the movement of goods and supplies that helped ease Gaza’s economic pressure under Israeli blockade.</p><p>Its closure, beginning in May 2024 after Israeli forces took control, marked a dramatic turning point in the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>The shutdown affected not just the movement of people, but also significantly reduced the flow of medical aid and essential supplies, impacting thousands of patients waiting for treatment outside Gaza, including children and the wounded, amid a severe shortage of health services and medical equipment.</p><h2 id=\"opening-the-crossing-shouldn-t-be-a-miracle\">‘Opening the crossing shouldn’t be a miracle’</h2><p>Before the war, Khitam and her family monitored Yousef’s condition regularly, and he could walk and move.</p><p>But the war halted everything. <a href=\"/news/2025/4/13/timeline-israels-attacks-on-hospitals-throughout-its-war-on-gaza\">Hospitals were routinely bombed by Israel</a>, and most ceased functioning. Medics were killed by the hundreds, medications ran out, and medical checkups became nearly impossible.</p><p>“Since the war, Yousef’s condition has deteriorated. His legs are weaker, walking is harder, he uses crutches,” Khitam pauses before continuing: “He falls often… and my heart is in my throat every time.”</p><p>The mother no longer knows the full extent of her son’s health. “I don’t know if he has heart complications, or if his spine has worsened … we are living with him with no answers.”</p><p>The war also separated the family. Weeks before the conflict erupted, Khitam’s 52-year-old husband, Hatim, had left Gaza for Egypt, as an initial step to secure a chance for the family to migrate and access advanced medical care for Yousef.</p><p>“Since then, I’ve been alone. Six children, one with a special medical condition, war, displacement, hunger,” Khitam says, her voice exhausted.</p><p>“Being displaced alone is so difficult. You don’t know where to go, how to protect your children, how to provide food or safety. The constant anxiety and fear have affected everyone, but Yousef suffers the most.”</p><p>“No school, no play, no outings, no treatment … even psychologically, he is exhausted. A child his age should be living his life, not caught between war and illness.”</p><p>But, she adds, “just the idea of travelling eases us a bit psychologically. It feels like a door might open” for treatment outside of the besieged enclave.</p><p>She still fears how the crossing will operate, even as hope keeps her going.</p><p>“Even if the crossing opens, not everyone can leave, and not every case will be approved,” she adds. “Opening the crossing shouldn’t be a miracle… it’s a right.”</p><p>Yousef’s story intersects with those of hundreds of families of sick children in Gaza, for whom Rafah is not just a crossing, but a lifeline.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4259901\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4259901\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4259901\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty_697212eae7-1769083626.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Truck carrying aid enter Gaza through the border crossing on in Rafah, Egypt.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4259901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A truck carrying aid enters Gaza through the border crossing from Rafah, Egypt into Gaza [File: Ali Moustafa/Getty Image]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-family-started-a-new-battle-against-time\">‘The family started a new battle against time’</h2><p>Local estimates indicate that more than 22,000 patients and injured people, including about 5,200 children, are unable to travel for treatment due to the Israeli closure, with thousands more waiting for approved medical transfers that cannot be executed.</p><p>Among them is Hur Qeshta, a newborn girl only 15 days old, born with a large, unusual tumour in her neck, affecting breathing and swallowing.</p><p>She requires urgent surgery outside Gaza, according to doctors at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.</p><p>Her mother, Doaa Qeshta, 32 and a mother of five, tells Al Jazeera, “From the first moment she was born, the family started a new battle against time to ensure she could urgently travel for treatment.”</p><p>Hur was delivered via Caesarean section and now lies in the Nasser Hospital neonatal ICU, on oxygen and fed via a tube from her abdomen.</p><p>“She can’t breastfeed, everything is through a tube, and the mass is growing rapidly … all within 15 days,” says her mother.</p><p>Doctors confirmed that surgery inside Gaza is currently impossible due to a lack of facilities.</p><p>Doaa links her daughter’s condition to the circumstances during her pregnancy, including displacement in a tent in al-Mawasi, exposure to nearby shelling, smoke, gunpowder, hunger, and lack of nutrition.</p><p>“I was pregnant during famine … no food, no vitamins, no safety,” she recalls. “Shelling was nearby, 300 metres (980 feet) away… the tent shook; we thought we were dead.”</p><p>“Opening the crossing means saving my daughter’s life,” she says. “I’ve registered the whole family as companions … the most important thing is Hur goes, gets treatment, and survives.”</p><p>Of the reopening of the Rafah crossing, Doaa says, “We hear news and live on hope, but we are really in a limbo… we don’t know what’s happening or when.

A year later, I got a scholarship to Turkiye, did the online interviews, was accepted, and since then I’ve been stuck,” Rana tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>Her Turkish scholarship includes 220 students from Gaza, all from different disciplines, most with high academic grades.</p><p>Over the past two years, Rana tried not to stagnate, taking Turkish language courses and exploring alternatives like local universities. But she would hold back each time she heard news of Rafah possibly reopening.</p><p>“Every time there’s news the crossing might open, I tell myself, ‘Let me wait a bit’… but it turns out to be just talk, and my hopes are dashed,” she adds. “A lot of our time and life has been wasted waiting … our lives and futures hang on a hope.”</p><p>Rana is displaced with her family of eight. They returned briefly to northern Gaza during the first ceasefire, found their home intact, but fled again after fighting resumed, and are now settled in Deir el-Balah.</p><p>“My biggest fear is leaving and not being able to come back,” she says. “Before, they [her family] were 100 percent supportive. Now there’s fear because the travel process is unclear, and they don’t know how many will be allowed or registered to travel.”</p><p>Many Palestinians fear leaving Rafah would be a one-way ticket as part of an openly touted Israeli plan to permanently expel the population from Gaza.</p><p>“We students and youth are the most affected group during the war,” Rana says. “Our years have gone by silently, our studies destroyed by war, and no one talks about us. All we want is education — not travel for tourism or anything else.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Moscow has insisted that for the war to end, Russia must take over all of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.</p>\n</li>\n<li>German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Johann Wadephul denounced Russia’s “stubborn insistence on the crucial territorial issue” following the talks in Abu Dhabi.</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>European Union countries have approved a ban on Russian gas imports by late 2027, a move to cut ties with their former top energy supplier nearly four years after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Minister of Energy Denys Shmyhal welcomed the ban, saying in a statement that independence from Russian energy “is, above all, about a safe and strong Europe”.</li>\n<li>Germany’s Wadephul said that Russia is testing European countries’ resilience with hybrid tactics, such as the damaging of undersea cables, the jamming of GPS signals and the deployment of a shadow fleet of vessels to break sanctions, as its deadly war in Ukraine continues.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Hungarian <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/hungary-protesters-demand-pm-viktor-orban-quits-over-child-abuse-cases\">Prime Minister Viktor Orban</a> said that Budapest would summon Ukraine’s ambassador over what Orban said were attempts by Kyiv to interfere in a Hungarian parliamentary election due on April 12.

We think they’re going to. If they don’t disarm, then they’ve breached the deal. We think disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty, and candidly, we think we have a very, very good programme to disarm,” the official said, according to the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington, DC, said the official made the comment during a background briefing by senior officials from US President Donald Trump’s administration and reporters.</p><p>“A senior administration official told reporters that Hamas agreed to disarmament and that it will happen,” Jordan said.</p><p>“The same official also alluded to the fact – when the question was raised about whether Hamas could be recognised as a political entity in exchange for [dis]armament – the official said the possibility of amnesty for those Hamas fighters who lay down their weapons was part of the discussion,” Jordan said.</p><p>“But the official didn’t get into any more details. Even so, the fact that that was put out there for reporters to discuss publicly is a significant step,” she said.</p><p>“How long is it going to take to work out these terms? Well, it certainly depends on what the Israelis, the Americans , their various interlocutors – the Qataris, the Turkish, the Egyptians – what they are all able to bring to the table with Hamas in order to get this figured out. But some sort of amnesty has now been publicly floated,” she added.</p><p>On Monday, Israel confirmed that the remains of the last captive held in Gaza, Ran Gvili, had been positively identified and that all those held in the war-torn Palestinian territory “have now been repatriated”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Hamas said on Monday the return of remains of captives underscored its commitment to phase one of the ceasefire agreement, and that it had “fulfilled all its obligations in a clear and responsible manner”.</p><p>Israel must now hold up its side of the ceasefire deal “without any deduction or delay”.</p><p>“Especially the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/hamas-says-gave-israel-mediators-details-about-last-gaza-captives-remains\">opening of the Rafah crossing</a> in both directions without restrictions, the entry of the Gaza Strip’s needs in the required quantities, the lifting of the ban on any of them, the complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and facilitating the work of the National Committee for the management of the Gaza Strip,” the group said.</p><p>Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan states that once all captives are returned, Hamas members who decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage under the plan. The plan also states that aid must flow “freely” into the enclave, and the Rafah border crossing with Egypt is to be reopened.</p><p>Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Hakan Fidan met Hamas officials in Ankara on Monday and discussed the second phase of the ceasefire agreement and humanitarian conditions in the enclave, a ministry source told Reuters.</p><p>The minister briefed the Hamas officials about Turkiye’s efforts in international platforms, including Trump’s Board of Peace, to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza, the source added.</p><p>Turkiye’s official Anadolu news agency reported that Fidan said efforts to deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to Gaza “would continue with determination”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
