Newsmax host Rob Schmitt asked if that meant another election would not happen for another five years.</p><p>“The only thing I could say is that there will not be an election in this immediate period of time where the stabilisation has to be achieved,” Rodriguez replied.</p><p>He explained that the decision is tied to a wider effort to rebuild and strengthen Venezuela’s state institutions.</p><p>“What we’re working on at the moment is what we call the re-institutionalisation of the country, so that every single institution of the country can again be brought to full power and full recognition by everybody,” he said.</p><p>Rodriguez, who has led the National Assembly since 2021, added that Venezuelans are seeking a return to normalcy following the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">abduction of President Nicolas Maduro</a>.</p><p>“The government of <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/who-is-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-now-leading-the-country\">Delcy Rodriguez</a> is actually looking for that, to stabilise the country completely and to make it all good and reconcile everybody, all the population of Venezuela,” he said.</p><p>The US abducted Maduro in a military action on January 3. In the weeks since, the Venezuelan Supreme Court has appointed Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, the National Assembly leader’s sister, as acting president.</p><p>She was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/delcy-rodriguez-sworn-in-as-venezuelas-president-after-maduro-abduction\">formally sworn in</a> on January 5, with support from both Venezuela’s military and the governing party, as well as the US.</p><p>Jorge Rodriguez told Newsmax that the current government would need to “reach an agreement with all sectors of the opposition” to create a “timetable” for new elections.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"amnesty-law\" data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Amnesty law</h2><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Maduro’s abduction had initially inspired hope that a new election would be carried out after the controversy that accompanied the 2024 presidential race.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">In that election, Maduro controversially claimed victory for a third straight term, despite the opposition publishing voter tallies that appeared to show its candidate won.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Protests broke out, and Maduro’s government responded with a violent crackdown. An estimated 25 people were killed, according to the US State Department.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">In Monday’s interview, Rodriguez rejected the assertion that the 2024 race was not legitimate. Instead, he emphasised his push for national unity, saying, “We have been divided for a very long time.”</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">He highlighted the legislature’s efforts to pass a mass <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/venezuelas-national-assembly-approves-amnesty-bill-in-first-of-two-votes\">amnesty law</a>, which would result in the release of all political prisoners and forgive any crimes related to political dissent since 1999.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">The bill was approved unanimously in the first of two votes on Thursday and is expected to pass this week.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Still, questions have surrounded the bill. Critics fear that political repression could take other forms after the prisoners’ release.</p><p data-start=\"610\" data-end=\"909\">Schmitt asked whether opposition leader Maria Corina Machado would be able to return to Venezuela and campaign freely in a future election, following the bill’s passage.</p><p data-start=\"203\" data-end=\"338\">“So, allow me not to speak about only one single name, because there are many, many actors abroad that have to be included in this discussion,” Rodriguez responded.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">“There is an amnesty law that is being done at the moment that contemplates working with people, but there are sectors of the opposition abroad which have promoted violence.”</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">He then indicated that the amnesty bill would not apply to the opposition leaders accused of violent crimes.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">“Through this amnesty law, we are promoting for all the sections of the opposition who are abroad to comply with the law, so they can come back to the country,” Rodriguez said.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Opposition leaders, however, have long alleged that the government has peddled false accusations of violent crime to arrest and jail them.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Machado herself was accused of conspiring to assassinate Maduro in 2014, leading to her expulsion from the National Assembly.</p><p data-start=\"340\" data-end=\"728\">Rodriguez’s comments also come amid developments in the case of former lawmaker <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/venezuela-rearrests-opposition-figure-guanipa-after-release-prosecutor\">Juan Pablo Guanipa</a>.</p><p data-start=\"2351\" data-end=\"2529\">The leader was released on Sunday after spending more than eight months in pretrial detention, but he was rearrested less than 12 hours later, after speaking with the media and supporters.</p><p data-start=\"2351\" data-end=\"2529\">According to his family, he was detained by armed men without identification or a court order. His son, Ramon Guanipa, described the incident as an “abduction”.</p><p data-start=\"2596\" data-end=\"2766\">Officials later stated that they had requested the revocation of his release order, citing his alleged failure to comply with the conditions imposed upon his release.</p><p data-start=\"2768\" data-end=\"2890\">In the early hours of Tuesday, Guanipa was transferred to his residence in Maracaibo, where he remains under house arrest.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">Machado condemned the actions, stating that Guanipa’s case demonstrates that the releases announced by the government do not guarantee the full exercise of political and civil rights.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">“What was Juan Pablo’s crime? Telling the truth. So are these releases, or what are they?” Machado said on Monday.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">She proceeded to question whether the released prisoners were truly free from what she described as the repressive machinery of the Venezuelan government.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3124\">“Can’t we talk in Venezuela about those who have been in prison? Can’t we recount what they have experienced? Can’t we describe the horror of what is happening in our country today?”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4303872\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4303872\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4303872\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-01-28T195733Z_1870997235_RC2JAJAC5AAK_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZULA-1770758374.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Maria Corina Machado\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4303872\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado speaks with the media [File: Kylie Cooper/Reuters]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

That deployment includes the USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier.</p><p>Channel 12 and the news outlet Axios reported on Tuesday that Trump is also thinking about sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East.</p><p>That <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/iran-ready-for-nuclear-focused-talks-rejects-us-military-build-up\">military build-up</a> has spurred fears of an impending US strike against Iran. Critics fear such an attack could destabilise the region.</p><p>Already, on Monday, the US has issued <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/us-urges-american-ships-to-stay-as-far-as-possible-from-iranian-waters\">guidelines</a> to US-flagged commercial ships, warning them to stay “as far as possible” from Iranian territorial waters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heightened-demands\">Heightened demands</h2><p>Since January, Trump has heightened US pressure on Iran, warning that his country’s military is “locked and loaded and ready to go”.</p><p>Trump has also compared Iran’s situation to that of Venezuela, where a US military operation on January 3 resulted in the abduction and removal of deposed President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>“Like with Venezuela, [the US military] is ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary. Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972658725010644\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media on January 28.</p><p>Late last month, the Trump administration issued Iran three overarching demands. They include an end to Iran’s uranium enrichment, a requirement to sever ties with regional proxies, and limits on the country’s ballistic missile stockpiles, a goal long sought by Israel.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump reiterated his position that Iran should comply with his demands, telling the news outlet Fox Business it would be “foolish” not to.</p><p>During his first term, the US president pulled his country out of a <a href=\"/features/2025/4/20/everything-you-need-to-know-about-iran-us-nuclear-negotiations\">2015 deal</a> that placed strict limits on Iran’s nuclear activities, in exchange for sanctions relief.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term in January 2025, Trump has resumed his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.</p><p>That push has included severe sanctions and pressure to dismantle Iran’s nuclear programme, which Tehran insists is for civilian energy purposes only.</p><p>Already, last June, Trump authorised a military strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, as part of a 12-day war between Iran and Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><h2 id=\"responding-to-anti-government-protests\">Responding to anti-government protests</h2><p>Trump’s renewed threats in January have coincided with a recent wave of anti-government protests in Iran.</p><p>The government in Tehran reacted to those demonstrations with a violent crackdown that reportedly killed thousands of people, drawing widespread condemnation from rights groups.</p><p>Reports have found that state security forces opened fire on crowds of protesters as the country was under an internet blackout.</p><p>On January 2 — one day before his military operation in Venezuela — Trump threatened to intervene on behalf of the protesters and “<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">come to their rescue</a>“, although he ultimately declined to do so.</p><p>Some analysts have pointed out that the proposed strikes on Iran would do little to aid the protesters, but would align with longstanding US and Israeli goals of reducing Iran’s military capacity.</p><p>The Iranian government has argued that the protests included the violent targeting of security forces by armed groups, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of officers. It has also accused outside powers like the US and Israel of backing the anti-government demonstrations.</p><p>Details around the protests and their crackdown remain difficult to verify, but Iranian officials have conceded that the government’s response killed <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/at-least-3117-people-killed-during-iran-protests-state-media-reports\">thousands of people</a>.</p><h2 id=\"chaotic-wars-of-choice\">‘Chaotic wars of choice’</h2><p>The prospect that the US might intervene in Iran, however, has prompted pushback domestically for Trump.</p><p>On Tuesday, a coalition of 25 advocacy groups called on the US Congress to assert greater oversight over Trump’s use of the military, in the face of his threats against Iran.</p><p>Their letter was coincided with a new <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/sjres104/BILLS-119sjres104is.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">war powers resolution</a> introduced by senators Tim Kaine and Rand Paul on January 29.</p><p>The bill calls for the US military to be removed “from hostilities within or against the Islamic Republic of Iran”, unless authorised by Congress to take action.</p><p>The advocacy groups urged other Congress members to support the bill and ensure its passage.</p><p>“Iran has not attacked the United States nor threatened an offensive strike, and Congress has not authorized any military action against Iran,” their letter said.</p><p>“As a coalition of groups concerned with reckless military escalation, we urge Congress to represent its constituents, assert its Constitutional role and block an unauthorized war with Iran.”</p><p>The Center for International Policy, J Street, CODEPINK, and Common Defense were among the letter’s signatories.</p><p>Previous war powers resolutions, however, have failed to pass. In June, after the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, lawmakers failed to advance <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-curb-trumps-power-to-go-to-war-with-iran\">a similar bill</a> that sought to prohibit further “unauthorized hostilities” against Iran.</p><p>Legislation to limit Trump’s military actions in Venezuela also <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-senate-defeats-war-powers-resolution-designed-to-rein-in-trump\">faced defeat</a> last month.</p><p>Ordinarily, Congress has the sole power to authorise war and similar military actions under the US Constitution. But critics say that presidents in recent decades have exerted ever-growing control over the country’s military.</p><p>Ryan Costello, the policy director at the National Iranian American Council Action (NIAC), told Al Jazeera that a war powers resolution on Iran could face a tough path forward. His organisation was among the groups that signed onto Tuesday’s letter.</p><p>Still, Costello expressed optimism. He pointed out that Congress had passed such resolutions during Trump’s first term — once in 2019 and again in 2020 — though the Republican president ultimately vetoed both bills.</p><p>Congress should take action again, given the high stakes of a war between the US and Iran, according to Costello.</p><p>“The messiness and bloodiness of a new war with Iran, combined with the prospect of pressure from Congress on war powers resolutions, likely makes diplomatic off-ramps look much more attractive,” said Costello.</p><p>“While it is a high bar to pass war powers resolutions, Congress did so in Trump’s first term and forced him to exercise a rare veto. We hope they keep the pressure up and do what their voters want, which is to keep the US out of new, chaotic wars of choice.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He formerly served as a congressmemeber representing a different New Jersey district from 2019 to 2023.</p><p>In his <a href=\"https://x.com/Malinowski/status/2021244666063081981\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> conceding defeat, Malinowski applauded Mejia, saying she deserves “unequivocal praise and credit for running a positive campaign and for inspiring so many voters on election day”.</p><p>But he nevertheless acknowledged the role AIPAC played in the results.</p><p>“The outcome of this race cannot be understood without also taking into account the massive flood of dark money that AIPAC spent on dishonest ads during the last three weeks,” Malinowski wrote.</p><p>“The threat unlimited dark money poses to our democracy is far more significant than the views of a single member of Congress on Middle East policy.”</p><h2 id=\"an-ineffective-strategy\">An ineffective strategy?</h2><p>With Mejia’s victory, many observers see AIPAC’s newest approach backfiring.</p><p>Malinowski has long been a supporter of US funding for Israel. But he has suggested <span>that Washington should not provide a “blank cheque” to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</span></p><p>Mejia, in contrast, was the only candidate in the race to refer to Israel’s war in Gaza as a genocide.</p><p>She will face two Republicans in a special election in April, competing for a district that swung heavily Democratic in the 2024 vote.</p><p>While the Democratic Party’s progressive branch has long criticised AIPAC’s tactics, the campaign against Malinowski has brought criticism from what is considered its more moderate flank.</p><p>The advertisements bought by UDP did not specifically reference Malinowski’s support for Israel.</p><p>Instead, they attacked the former Congress member over domestic issues, including a 2019 vote in support of funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p>Representative Brad Schneider, the leader of the centrist caucus New Democrat Coalition, told the publication Politico that AIPAC’s strategy “raised eyebrows”.</p><p>He questioned the group for “spending against a candidate that would’ve been a New Dem and instead electing a far-left candidate”.</p><p>“Come on, guys, this is not what we were hoping for here,” said Schneider, who himself has enjoyed AIPAC support.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Mark Pocan, a Democratic Congressman and longtime AIPAC critic, meanwhile called the strategy a “monumental failure”.</p><p>He said the spending showed that Democratic voters were becoming increasingly averse not just to AIPAC but to groups associated with it, like the UDP, as outrage over Israel’s genocide in Gaza continues to grow.</p><p>“Their money is so toxic that the very people they are trying to help are now hurt by their involvement, no matter how well disguised,” Pocan <a href=\"https://x.com/MarkPocan/status/2020505199761338478\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>For its part, AIPAC sent a letter to supporters last week, downplaying the situation. It noted that, because Mejia is running in a special election, even if she wins in April, her term will only run through January of next year. She will face another Democratic primary in June before the general election.</p><p>It pledged to get involved in that race as well.</p><p>“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, her prospective win was an anticipated possibility,” AIPAC said in its email.</p><p>“Our ultimate focus for this race remains the June primary that will likely determine who represents this district for the full term beginning in January 2027.”</p><p><em><strong>Ali Harb contributed reporting. </strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

For many countries, economic stability is a matter of national survival. Faced with repeated shocks from Washington, they can’t remain dependent on an increasingly erratic trading partner,” Rogowsky said.</p><p>Last month, Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade, seeking to reset ties that had been frozen since Canadian authorities arrested a top official of Chinese telecommunications giant <a href=\"/economy/2022/5/19/huawei\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huawei</a> in December 2018.</p><p>During Carney’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, the two leaders agreed to slash tariffs on certain goods and allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into Canada with minimal tariffs.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Last week, Canadian Industry Minister Melanie Joly said her government was working with China to launch a joint EV assembly facility in Canada to export to the world.</p><p>The move marks a significant departure from Canada’s previous efforts to restrict China’s EV industry, including a 100 percent tariff on imports introduced after a similar move by the US.</p><p>Canada is also trying <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/canada-moves-to-rebuild-trade-ties-with-india-after-years-of-tension\">to rebuild ties</a> with India, another key trading partner, after years of tensions over the killing of a Canadian Sikh activist, with Carney expected to visit New Delhi in the next few months.</p><h2 id=\"reconfiguration-of-trade\">‘Reconfiguration of trade’</h2><p>“The reconfiguration of global trade is under way,” Rogowsky said.</p><p>Although remaking supply chains and trade relationships that evolved in the aftermath of World War II will be neither quick nor easy, particularly when they involve the world’s largest economy, “the pace of change is accelerating”, he added.</p><p>While two-way trade between the US and 19 of its trade partners grew slightly last year, total global trade grew much faster, according to Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.</p><p>In dollar terms, US trade with its partners grew 3.6 percent, compared with a 6.3 percent increase in global trade, he said.</p><p>One reason for the marginal change in US trade, despite Trump’s tariffs and threats, is that many countries ramped up their exports in anticipation of new taxes. Deeply embedded supply chains also take time to change.</p><p>“There is no doubt Trump has shaken the world trade order. Most importantly, trading rules once agreed in the WTO, or FTAs, no longer bind the US,” Hufbauer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“From a diplomatic standpoint, trust in the US has dropped to a post-Second World War low. Carney is right to describe the current geopolitical context as a ‘rupture’ from the past 80 years.”</p><p>Hufbauer said he expected to see further trade diversion away from US trade this year.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“There is a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, and countries are proactively looking to hedge,” Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s almost like trade agreements and partnerships today are strategic signals that there are friends and partners beyond Washington. However, there is a parallel effort in keeping ties with Washington as stable as possible. It is a big market and carries major global weight. A stable relationship with the US is pragmatic.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But Paramount has expressed a different opinion.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported late last year that Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, Larry Ellison’s son, promised Trump “sweeping changes” to CNN if his company was ultimately successful in the acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount has already reshaped CBS after Skydance’s acquisition of the storied broadcaster, including <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hiring Bari Weiss</a>, a conservative opinion writer with no previous television experience, to lead one of the US’s largest news organisations.</p><p>Press freedom experts argue that the acquisition could hurt Warner Bros in the long term.</p><p>“WBD shareholders should push back against any transaction that would result in CNN being controlled by people who have already shown willingness to sell out journalism and journalists to benefit their other interests,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Al Jazeera. “And that’s not to mention WBD’s other holdings, which also rely on a strong First Amendment. What happens when Donald Trump objects to the content of an HBO show? Authoritarianism isn’t just bad for democracy; it’s bad for business.”</p><p>While Democrats, including US Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have voiced concern about political bias in the Paramount Skydance deal, Republicans allege that Netflix is being politically biased.</p><p>Last week, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos appeared at the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights and faced questions about alleged political bias from Republicans.</p><p>“Netflix has no political agenda of any kind,” Sarandos said.</p><p>Republicans have often treated transgender identity as a political position, labelling it an ideology. At the hearing, US Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri pressed the platform on why it allowed content he claimed “promotes a transgender ideology”.</p><p>“We feature a wide variety of stories and programmes to meet a wide variety of people’s tastes,” Sarandos said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>If Netflix were to succeed in the merger fight, it would become the world’s largest streaming platform, with roughly half a billion subscribers.</p><h2 id=\"financial-questions\">Financial questions</h2><p>Paramount offered other measures that would address financial concerns posed by the Warner Bros board, including a backstop debt exchange that Paramount argues will eliminate the risk of a $1.5bn fee owed to the bondholders.</p><p>The company also said it certified compliance with the US Department of Justice’s second request on Monday, triggering a 10-day waiting period, and has already secured foreign investment clearance in Germany. It added that it is in talks with antitrust regulators in the US, the European Union and the United Kingdom.</p><p>“Paramount’s latest offer attempts to address regulatory concerns about successfully closing a deal, but both bids from Netflix and Paramount Skydance could face lengthy, contentious regulatory reviews in the US and internationally with no guarantee of a successful outcome,” Seth Shafer, principal analyst at S&amp;P Global, told Reuters.</p><p>The company also yet again extended the deadline for Warner Bros Discovery to consider its <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/22/paramount-skydance-extends-warner-bros-takeover-bid-offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offer by February 20.</a> Warner Bros will hold a special investor meeting to vote on the Netflix deal, with the streaming pioneer saying that the meeting was expected to be held by April.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Netflix had last month switched to an all-cash offer for Warner Bros without increasing its $82.7bn price. The Warner Bros board has said the Netflix merger deal is superior to Paramount’s bid because its investors would retain a stake in the separately traded Discovery Global.</p><p>On Wall Street, Warner Bros Discovery’s stock is up 2.1 percent since the market opened on Tuesday. Paramount also ticked up in midday trading by 1.3 percent. Netflix is also up by about 2.4 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I barely had anything to do with that person,” Lutnick said.</p><p>The commerce secretary is the latest member of the political and financial elite to face pressure over relations with the disgraced financier.</p><p>The administration of President <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/4/trump-hits-out-at-reporter-for-question-on-epstein-survivors\">Donald Trump</a> has come under particular scrutiny for its handling of government files related to Epstein and the president’s own years-long relationship with the convicted sex offender.</p><p>During Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers pressed Lutnick about statements he made on a podcast last year, explaining that he had pledged to “never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again” after he and Epstein met in 2005.</p><p>Lutnick said he made the decision after Epstein showed him and his wife a massage table featured prominently in his residence and made sexually suggestive comments about it.</p><p>But recently released emails suggest that Lutnick may have visited Epstein’s private island for a lunch meeting in 2012 and may have met on other occasions as well.</p><p>“You led people to believe that you had cut off all contact with Jeffrey Epstein after the 2005 encounter you and your wife had in his apartment,” Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, told Lutnick at the committee hearing.</p><p>“But as I’m sure you know, the Epstein files show a very different record of interaction.”</p><p>Lutnick, however, downplayed his interactions with Epstein and emphasised that nothing “untoward” happened in the 2012 encounter.</p><p>“I know, and my wife knows, that I have done absolutely nothing wrong in any possible regard,” Lutnick said.</p><p>The apparent contradiction emerged after the Department of Justice released 3 million pages of Epstein-related records on January 30, in an attempt to satisfy the requirements of the bipartisan <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/30/us-department-of-justice-releases-three-million-new-epstein-documents\">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008, but he continued to enjoy close relationships with some of the most influential figures in politics, business, culture and science for years afterwards.</p><p>In 2019, Epstein was re-arrested and charged with federal sex-trafficking crimes. He was found dead that year in his jail cell, in what medical examiners ruled a suicide.</p><p>His former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her participation in Epstein’s crimes, including child sex trafficking.</p><p>But critics have argued that few of those involved in Epstein’s crimes have faced any consequences.</p><p>The government in the United Kingdom is currently facing a political crisis over Epstein’s connections to the country’s former ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson.</p><p>In October, King Charles III also stripped his brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, of his titles following mounting evidence of his relationship with Epstein.</p><p>But there are few signs that the US is on the verge of a similar reckoning. Trump has previously called the scrutiny of the Epstein files a “hoax” and a Democrat-led “scam”.</p><p>Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, two lawmakers who spearheaded the Epstein Files Transparency Act, have both called on Lutnick to resign.</p><p>“This is bringing down the British government. It may bring down the monarchy. It’s bringing down elites,” Khanna, a Democrat, said on Monday. “What are we doing here in the US to stand up to the Epstein class? We’ve got a commerce secretary who is all over the files.”</p><p>Massie, a Republican, wrote on social media that Lutnick’s contradictory statements raise questions that need to be resolved.</p><p>“Lutnick went to the island and was in business deals with Epstein, long after Lutnick says he parted ways and even after Epstein was convicted of sex crimes,” Massie said. “What else is Lutnick covering up with respect to his association with Epstein?”</p><p>Still, at a Tuesday news briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Lutnick.</p><p>“Secretary Lutnick remains a very important member of President Trump’s team, and the president fully supports the secretary,” she told reporters.</p><p>Leavitt also brushed aside reports that Maxwell is seeking clemency from Trump, calling the issue “not a priority” for the administration.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Netanyahu said he will <a href=\"/news/2026/2/9/netanyahu-to-meet-trump-in-us-to-discuss-iran-says-israeli-pm\">present Donald Trump</a> with “principles” for negotiating with Iran as he heads to Washington, DC, for his sixth official visit with the US president over the past year.</p><p>Netanyahu hailed the “unique closeness” between Israel and the United States and his own warm ties to Trump before leaving Tel Aviv on Tuesday.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“I will present Trump with principles for negotiations with Iran that are important not only to Israel but to everyone who wants peace and security,” Netanyahu told reporters, according to The Jerusalem Post newspaper.</p><p>“In my opinion, these are important principles for everyone who wants peace and security in the Middle East.”</p><p>His visit comes days after Washington and Tehran concluded a round of nuclear talks in Oman – the first negotiations since the June 2025 war that saw the US bomb Iran’s main nuclear facilities after waves of <a href=\"/news/2024/10/26/israel-strikes-iran-what-we-know-so-far-and-whats-next\">Israeli attacks</a>.</p><p>Israel is not part of those talks, but Netanyahu has long sought <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/what-happens-when-netanyahu-visits-trump-a-look-at-his-past-six-us-visits\">to exert influence</a> over US presidents to shape Washington’s policies in the region.</p><p>Later on Tuesday, top Iranian official Ali Larijani, who is <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/irans-top-security-official-in-oman-following-nuclear-talks-with-us\">visiting Oman</a>, said the Trump administration must not allow Netanyahu to derail diplomacy between Washington and Tehran.</p><p>“They must remain alert to the destructive role of the Zionists,” Larijani said of US officials.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Netanyahu did not provide details about his “principles” for a potential Iran deal, but he has previously said Tehran should agree to full disarmament of heavy weapons, akin to Libya’s 2003 deal with the West.</p><p>Iran has ruled out negotiations over its missile programme, which it views as one of its most important deterrents against Israeli attacks.</p><p>When Israel launched its surprise assault against Iran in June of last year – killing several of the country’s top generals and nuclear scientists as well as hundreds of civilians – Tehran relied primarily on its missiles to respond after air defences were taken out.</p><p>Iran fired hundreds of missiles at Israel, dozens of which penetrated the country’s multilayered air defences, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">killing 28 people</a> and causing significant damage.</p><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Al Jazeera on Saturday that Iran’s missile programme is a defence issue that is “never negotiable”.</p><p>Israel and the US may also push Iran to end support to its network of allied non-state actors in the region – including the Houthis in Yemen, <a href=\"/features/2026/2/3/will-hezbollah-continue-to-avoid-responding-to-israels-attacks-on-lebanon\">Hezbollah in Lebanon</a>, Hamas in Palestine, and armed groups in Iraq.</p><p>But that alliance, known as the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/iraqs-kataib-hezbollah-warns-of-total-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">Axis of Resistance</a>, has already been weakened by Israeli assaults over the past two years.</p><p>Another sticking issue in the talks is whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium domestically.</p><p>While Tehran has said it would agree to strict limits and monitoring of its nuclear activities, it has maintained that domestic enrichment is a sovereign national right.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite Washington’s talks with Tehran, US Ambassador <a href=\"/news/2024/11/12/trump-picks-pro-settlement-mike-huckabee-as-us-ambassador-to-israel\">Mike Huckabee</a> – who is joining Netanyahu on his trip – has stressed Israel and the United States have the same red lines when it comes to Iran.</p><p>“I think there’s an extraordinary alignment between Israel and the United States. Everyone would love to see something that would resolve without a war, but it will be up to Iran,” he told reporters.</p><p>“If they insist on holding nuclear weaponry and enriched uranium, then I think the president made very clear that this is not acceptable.”</p><p>The United States has moved the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/29/how-does-us-military-build-up-off-iran-compare-to-the-june-2025-strikes\">USS Abraham Lincoln</a> aircraft carrier, destroyers, and fighter jets to the Middle East to pressure Iran into an agreement. Tehran says it won’t be swayed by threats of war.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That’s a lot.”</p><p>The other top issue on Netanyahu’s agenda was Iran. The Israeli prime minister had been seeking escalation against Tehran.</p><p>But instead of a move towards war, Trump announced at the meeting with Netanyahu that the US and Iran would hold <a href=\"/news/2025/4/12/iranian-us-delegations-set-to-begin-high-stakes-nuclear-talks-in-oman\">nuclear talks</a>, reiterating his preference for a deal with Iran.</p><p>“We have a very big meeting, and we’ll see what can happen. And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,” Trump said at that time.</p><p>Netanyahu responded by setting out maximalist conditions for US diplomacy with Iran – a complete disarmament of heavy weapons akin to the 2003 Libyan model.</p><p>“If it can be done diplomatically in a full way, the way it was done in Libya, I think that would be a good thing,” Netanyahu said. “But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.”</p><p>Iran has repeatedly denied seeking nuclear weapons while Israel is widely believed to have an undeclared <a href=\"/news/2009/10/27/israels-nuclear-arsenal\">nuclear arsenal</a>.</p><p>Despite signs of disagreement between Trump and Netanyahu over Iran and trade at that time, the US administration continued to support and fund Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"july-victory-lap\">July: Victory lap</h2><p>Although Trump and Netanyahu did not appear on the same page when it came to Iran weeks earlier, the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/22/us-joins-israel-in-attacks-against-iran-strikes-key-nuclear-sites\">US joined Israel</a> in bombing Iran in June, hitting three of its key nuclear sites and fulfilling a wish that the Israeli prime minister had been seeking for years.</p><p>Netanyahu visited the White House a month later to hail the war and its outcomes, which Trump said “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><p>“I think the partnership between Israel and the United States, the partnership between President Trump and me, produced a historic victory. It’s an incredible victory, actually,” Netanyahu said.</p><p>“It brought the greatest capabilities of the United States – that are unmatched – with the great capabilities of Israel and the army of Israel, the pilots of Israel, the soldiers of Israel and the Mossad.”</p><p>Netanyahu met with Trump on <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/trump-netanyahu-meet-for-a-second-time-to-discuss-a-gaza-ceasefire\">two occasions</a> during that visit as the US was pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza amid international outrage at Israel’s atrocities and a forced starvation campaign against Palestinians.</p><p>Some media reports had suggested at the time that Trump may pressure Netanyahu to stop the war, but the Israeli prime minister stressed that he and the US president were in “lockstep” over Gaza.</p><p>“President Trump wants a deal, but not at any price,” <a href=\"/news/2025/7/10/if-trump-wants-gaza-ceasefire-he-must-pressure-netanyahu-experts-say\">Netanyahu said</a>. “I want a deal, but not at any price.

Gaza is one thing, but we’re talking about much beyond Gaza. The whole deal, everything getting solved. It’s called peace in the Middle East.”</p><p>While Netanyahu said he accepted the Trump proposal, he did so with caveats.</p><p>“Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter, for the foreseeable future,” Netanyahu said.</p><p>“Gaza will have a peaceful civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas nor by the Palestinian Authority but by those committed to a genuine peace with Israel.”</p><p>The truce would go into effect days later, but more than four months on, Israel has continued to bomb and <a href=\"/video/by-the-numbers-3/2026/2/8/israel-is-killing-far-more-civilians-than-fighters-in-gaza\">kill Palestinians</a> in Gaza while restricting the entry of medicine and material for temporary shelters into the territory.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"december-iran-again\">December: Iran again</h2><p>Netanyahu had proclaimed in July that the joint US-Israeli strikes against Iran set back the country’s nuclear and missile programmes, which he called “two tumours”. Still, the prime minister returned to the US at the end of the year to raise concerns about the same issues.</p><p>Even before the two leaders met at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/five-key-takeaways-from-trump-netanyahu-meeting-in-florida?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialPulse&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawP3JxdleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFpZHZ6alg2YmxqS2V1dFM3c3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHiYhtfeQmNlxqsKsagM5W8Jnu1Ib3VQObRsfPMMK2UUW8aNqZG1aFzc-0IS8_aem_Q8qA-Y1Q3BmwUbQZzA3GeA\">Trump threatened</a> Iran with more bombs.</p><p>“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump said. “We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully, that’s not happening.”</p><p>From there, Trump and Netanyahu heaped praise on one another, dismissing media reports that they were not seeing eye to eye on the future of Gaza and other regional issues.</p><p>Trump called Netanyahu a “hero”, arguing that Israel may not have existed without his leadership.</p><p>“We’re with you, and we’ll continue to be with you, and a lot of good things are happening in the Middle East,” Trump told Netanyahu.</p><p>For his part, the prime minister announced that his country would award Trump the Israel Prize, which is normally given to Israeli citizens.</p><p>“I have to say that this reflects the overwhelming sentiment of Israelis across the spectrum,” Netanyahu said.</p><p>Days after that meeting, antigovernment protests broke out in Iran, leading Trump to threaten to intervene militarily as he promised demonstrators who faced a <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/13/iran-protests-live-tehran-says-its-prepared-for-any-move-by-trump\">security crackdown</a> that “help is on the way”.</p><p>That threat never materialised.</p><p>With the protest movement in Iran all but faded and renewed US-Iranian diplomacy under way, the Israeli prime minister is likely to lobby for greater pressure on Tehran as he returns to Washington, DC, this week.</p><p>What remains to be seen is how the US president – who, like his predecessors has shown reluctance to say “no” to Israeli demands – will respond.</p></div></div></body></html>"
