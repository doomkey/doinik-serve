On May 7, 2024, Israel announced it had taken “operational control” of the Palestinian side of the crossing, effectively shutting down a vital lifeline for humanitarian aid and medical evacuations.</p><p>In the weeks that followed, media outlets documented how aid trucks were left stranded, and food supplies destined for Gaza had spoiled under the sun, while Rafah remained closed or effectively disabled at the height of humanitarian need.</p><p>With its closure, Rafah was transformed from a crossing point into an instrument of collective regulation.</p><p>Through numerical caps, name lists and layered approvals, Israeli authorities have exercised full control over movement, with immediate consequences for food supply chains, humanitarian assistance, medical evacuations, and Palestinian civilians’ right to travel and reunite with their families.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4298186\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Death-toll-tracker-1770566370.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-Feb 4, 2026_Death toll tracker-1765554400\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>Following the closure of the Rafah crossing, the Israeli army selectively opened alternative points for the passage of “pre-approved goods” and limited numbers of patients and humanitarian staff.</p><p>The United Nations repeatedly warned about unsafe access to several crossings because of Israeli military activity in Gaza.</p><p>The crossings deemed “operational”, which shifted over time, were primarily Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) and Kissufim.</p><p>In reality, this arrangement did not result in a stable flow of aid, but in a volatile system reliant on constantly changing entry points in line with military developments.</p><p>In northern Gaza, following Israel’s enforced separation of Palestinians from the south, the UN documented the Israeli army’s closure of multiple key roads and corridors.</p><p>This meant restrictions applied not only to “entry into Gaza” but also to “access within Gaza”, further isolating entire areas from supplies and essential services.</p><p>Beyond crossings and roads, Israel’s war imposed an additional layer of control through what became known as “mandatory coordination” for humanitarian convoys. Even when aid was permitted to enter, its movement inside Gaza remained contingent on Israeli military approvals, particularly near areas of Israeli troop deployment or on routes leading to crossings.</p><p>Data from the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) show hundreds of humanitarian missions faced “impediment, cancellation, or denial”.</p><p>According to Maha al-Hussaini, advocacy director at the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, what unfolded during the genocide was not merely temporary restrictions on freedom of travel, but “a systematic policy through which Israel used control over movement to and from Gaza as a central tool of siege, collective punishment, and coercive management of the civilian population”.</p><p>Al-Hussaini told Al Jazeera that under international law, Israel – as the occupying power – is obligated to allow freedom of movement to guarantee “access to food, humanitarian aid, healthcare, education, and family reunification”.</p><p>Yet, she said, Israeli practices during the war reflected “a systematic violation of these obligations” through the near-total closure of crossings, strict control over who is permitted to leave or return, and the use of “arbitrary and degrading measures against civilians”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298929\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298929\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4298929\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_6988f44172-1770583105.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt='ARISH, EGYPT - FEBRUARY 5: Maha, 10 years old, had her foot amputated after being exposed to shelling in a tent in Gaza, and she left to receive medical treatment in Egypt at the UAE \"floating hospital\" on February 5, 2026 in Arish, Egypt.

It is instead a purposefully slow and heavily conditioned pathway.</p><p>Official figures expose a stark gap between demand and reality.</p><p>Between May 8, 2024, and January 18, 2025, only 459 patients were evacuated through Karem Abu Salem. During a subsequent ceasefire period between January 19 and March 17, 2025, when Rafah was partially reopened, the number rose to 1,702 patients, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/we-just-sit-and-cry-gazas-cancer-patients-die-waiting-for-treatment\">including hundreds of children</a>, clearly indicating that evacuations improve only when additional movement routes were available.</p><p>Once that period ended and reliance on Karem Abu Salem resumed, evacuations again dropped sharply to just 352 patients between March 18 and July 16, 2025.</p><p>By contrast, the World Health Organization (WHO) today reports that more than 18,500 patients in Gaza remain in urgent, life-saving need of medical treatment outside the Strip.</p><p>The disparity between need and outcome shows that evacuations conducted over many months addressed only a tiny fraction of actual demand, leaving thousands trapped on open-ended waiting lists in war-battered Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"cruel-and-inhuman-treatment\">‘Cruel and inhuman treatment’</h2><p id=\"more-than-1-600-palestinians-have-died-while-waiting-for-healthcare-abroad-in-this\">More than 1,600 Palestinians have died while waiting for healthcare abroad. In this context, al-Hussaini said restrictions on movement amount to one of Israel’s gravest violations during the genocide.</p><p>“Thousands of wounded and ill Palestinians, including children and cancer patients, were denied the ability to travel outside Gaza for medical treatment, or were forced to wait for weeks or months under complex and opaque procedures. In many cases, their health deteriorated or they died before permission to leave was granted,” she said.</p><p>“Such practices cannot be justified on security grounds and constitute a direct violation of the right to life, amounting to cruel and inhuman treatment.”</p><p>When Rafah was partially reopened this month after the United States applied pressure on Israel’s leaders, the underlying reality did not fundamentally change. On February 2, the WHO announced the evacuation of just five patients and seven companions.</p><p>It was a tightly controlled border opening with Egypt governed by multiple layers of scrutiny: small numbers allowed to cross, prior Israeli security authorisation for returnees, European screening at Rafah, followed by a second identification and interrogation process in a corridor administered by the Israeli army.</p><p>Al-Hussaini said the restrictions imposed during the war, taken in totality, show that Israel uses freedom of movement in Gaza to regulate the daily life of Palestinians, determining who receives aid, who accesses health treatment, and who remains trapped in the Strip, placing these policies at the heart of legal debates around proportionality, the prohibition of collective punishment, and the obligations of an occupying power.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298933\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298933\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4298933\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/afp_6988f477719a-1770583159.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Etedal Rayyan (29), who recently returned back to Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah border crossing, looks out the window of her heavily-damaged house in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in the northern Gaza Strip on February 8, 2026.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4298933\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Etedal Rayyan, 29, recently returned to Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah border crossing [AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"blockade-as-permanent-policy-since-2007\">Blockade as permanent policy since 2007</h2><p>Israeli restrictions on freedom of movement in Gaza did not begin with the current war. Since 2007, they have evolved from purportedly temporary security measures into a permanent policy structuring the lives of 2.4 million people.</p><p>Following Hamas’s rise to power in 2007 through democratic elections, Israel imposed a comprehensive land, sea and air blockade. The International Committee of the Red Cross has consistently stated that the comprehensive closure of Gaza targets the civilian population as a whole, infringes on fundamental rights, and constitutes a form of collective punishment prohibited under international humanitarian law.</p><p>UN agencies have similarly stressed that long-term restrictions, even during periods of relative calm, lack any legitimate legal justification.</p><p>Economically and socially, the World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) have documented how the blockade has paralysed Gaza’s economy, eroded its productive base and driven unprecedented levels of poverty and unemployment. Severe restrictions on goods, raw materials and exports have made any form of sustainable economic recovery impossible, entrenching chronic dependence on humanitarian aid.</p><p>Israel further reinforced the blockade by a policy of separating Gaza from the occupied West Bank, treating the Strip as a distinct territorial unit despite their status as a single territory under international law.</p><p>UN special rapporteurs and rights groups say this separation has fractured social and family ties, and obstructed access to education, work and healthcare.</p><p>For more than 15 years, these restrictions have been recalibrated after each escalation. The severe constraints imposed during the current war are merely an intensification of a system in place since 2007.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4298188\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gaza-death-count-1770566375.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-feb 4, 2026_Gaza death count-1765555845\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"controlling-food-water-medicine\">Controlling food, water, medicine</h2><p>In March 2024, OCHA reported that only 26 percent of aid missions were facilitated by Israel’s army, while 40 percent were denied, 20 percent delayed, 11 percent impeded and 3 percent withdrawn.</p><p>May 2024 marked a turning point, as crossing closures and restrictions led to a sharp reduction in aid and humanitarian personnel entry.</p><p>As security conditions on convoy routes deteriorated, aid increasingly failed to reach the intended destinations. This prompted the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, to suspend aid entry through the Karem Abu Salem crossing on December 1, 2024, citing unsafe conditions and repeated looting incidents. In many cases, aid was unloaded on roads or seized before reaching warehouses.</p><p>In August 2025, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global hunger monitor, confirmed that <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/famine-confirmed-in-northern-gaza-global-hunger-monitor-says\">famine had taken hold</a> in northern Gaza.</p><p>Subsequent updates reiterated that famine risk would persist as long as Israeli military operations continued and humanitarian access remained restricted, noting that the vast majority of the population faced extreme levels of food deprivation.</p><p>“Restrictions on movement were among the gravest violations. Movement control was not incidental or administrative – it was used as a central tool to manage and pressure the civilian population,” said al-Hussaini.</p><p>She described Israel’s actions as “a clear violation of international humanitarian law, including the prohibition on the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare”.</p><p>Israeli restrictions fragmented humanitarian flows, increased risks along convoy routes, and at times forced aid agencies to suspend operations entirely.</p><p>“The population was left trapped in a cycle of hunger, driven not only by shortages but by the denial of access, freedom of movement, and ultimately the right to survive,” al-Hussaini said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298926\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298926\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4298926 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_6988f3c8e4625-1770582984.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Siham Omran, 54, recently returned from Egypt after completing medical treatment, cooks food over a fire beside her tent in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, Saturday, Feb. 7, 2026.

A key promise: If his party wins the country’s February 12 election, it would lay the ground for Bangladesh to quadruple its gross domestic product (GDP) to $2 trillion by 2040.</p><p>Addressing politicians and diplomats, the 67-year-old Rahman pledged investment in technology-driven agriculture, manufacturing, information technology, education and healthcare, alongside higher foreign investment and increased public spending.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Economists in Dhaka have cast doubt on whether sweeping promises can be financed, describing the manifesto as heavy on slogans but short on detail. But for Jamaat’s leadership, the manifesto is less about fiscal arithmetic than signalling intent, say analysts.</p><p>For years, critics have tried to portray Jamaat, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party, as driven too much by religious doctrine to be able to govern a young, diverse, forward-looking population. The manifesto, by contrast, presents a party long excluded from power as a credible alternative – and as a force that sees no contradiction between its religious foundations and the modern future that Bangladeshis aspire to.</p><p>His audience was telling too.</p><p>Until recently, Bangladesh’s business elites and foreign diplomats either kept their distance from Jamaat or engaged with it discreetly. Now, they are doing so openly.</p><p>Over the past few months, European, Western, and even Indian diplomats have sought meetings with Rahman, a figure who, until not long ago, was seen by many internationally as almost politically untouchable.</p><p>For a leader whose party has been banned twice, including by ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s administration, the coming election is raising a question few would have dared to ask even a year ago: Could Shafiqur Rahman become Bangladesh’s next prime minister?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293577\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293577\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293577\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-01-14T133248Z_1708878016_RC2GRIA4B3YA_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ELECTION-JAMAAT-1770410521.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Shafiqur  Rahman, Ameer (President) Jamaat-e-Islami, poses for a photograph after an interview with Reuters, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 31, 2025.

It upended the country’s political order, hollowing out the familiar duopoly that for decades defined Bangladeshi politics – the rivalry between Hasina’s Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).</p><p>With the Awami League effectively barred from the political field and the BNP the only big party left standing, a vacuum emerged. Many initially assumed it would be filled by the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP). Instead, Jamaat – long pushed to the margins – moved to occupy the space.</p><p>As Bangladesh heads towards a high-stakes election in less than two weeks, Jamaat has now emerged as one of the country’s two most prominent political forces. Some pre-election polls now place it in direct competition with the BNP.</p><p>At the centre of that transformation is Rahman, according to Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair, Jamaat’s assistant secretary-general and a longtime associate of the party chief.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Zubair, who worked closely with Rahman when he led Jamaat in the country’s Sylhet region, said the resurgence is the result of years of grassroots social work and political survival under repression.</p><p>Rahman, a soft-spoken former government doctor, took over as Jamaat’s chief in 2019, at a time when the party was banned under Hasina. In December 2022, he was arrested in the middle of the night on charges of supporting militancy and was released only after 15 months when he secured bail.</p><p>In March 2025, months after the student-led protest had overthrown Hasina and an interim government under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus had taken office, Rahman’s name was dropped from the list of accused in the case.</p><p>Since then, his carefully calibrated, emotional public appearances have drawn wide attention.</p><p>At a massive rally in Dhaka last July, Rahman collapsed twice on stage due to heat-related illness but returned to finish his speech, defying doctors’ advice.</p><p>“As long as Allah grants me life, I will fight for the people,” he told the crowd, barely sitting on the stage, supported by the doctors. “If Jamaat is elected, we will be servants, not owners. No minister will take plots or tax-free cars. There will be no extortion, no corruption. I want to tell the youth clearly – we are with you.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293585\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293585\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293585\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26034328142472-1-1770410903.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman waves a their party flag during an election campaign in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Jan. 22, 2026.

Everyone in the party trusts him,” said Lokman Hossain, a Jamaat supporter in Dhaka. He said that over the past year and a half, the party has reached far more people than before, with Rahman’s appeal beyond Jamaat’s traditional base playing a central role.</p><p>Rahman’s challenge, however, is no longer purely electoral – it is reputational.</p><p>As new supporters drift towards Jamaat, he is attempting to reframe how the party is seen: less as an Islamic force defined by doctrine and history, and more as a vehicle for clean governance, discipline and change.</p><p>Whether this reinvention is substantive or merely cosmetic will define both Rahman’s leadership and Jamaat’s future, say analysts.</p><p>Any attempt to recast Jamaat’s public image, however, runs up against the unresolved legacy of 1971. For decades, the party’s role during Bangladesh’s war of independence – when it sided with Pakistan – and the subsequent trials and executions of several senior leaders have shaped perceptions of Jamaat at home and abroad.</p><p>Rahman has approached that history with caution. He has avoided detailed admissions but has recently acknowledged what he calls Jamaat’s “past mistakes”, asking forgiveness if the party caused harm.</p><p>The language marks a subtle shift from outright denial, while stopping short of naming specific actions or responsibilities. Supporters say this reflects political realism rather than evasion – an attempt to move the party beyond its dark chapter. Critics, by contrast, see the ambiguity as deliberate, arguing it softens Jamaat’s image without confronting the substance of its past.</p><p>“He knows what those mistakes were,” said Saleh Uddin Ahmed, a United States-based Bangladeshi academic and political analyst. “But stating them explicitly would destabilise his leadership inside the party.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ahmed nonetheless considers Rahman more moderate than Jamaat’s previous leaders, noting his relative willingness to discuss unresolved historical questions and address issues such as women’s rights – topics the party long avoided. “This opening up is also happening because of increased public and media scrutiny,” Ahmed said. “People are asking questions now, and Jamaat has to respond.”</p><p>Jamaat’s effort to reach voters beyond its traditional base and reassure foreign audiences, while retaining the loyalty of its conservative supporters, has created a persistent tension – one that has often resulted in dual messaging.</p><p>That balancing act has been evident in public statements by senior leaders. Abdullah Md Taher, one of Rahman’s closest aides, in an interview with Al Jazeera, said Jamaat is a moderate party, adding that it would not impose or strictly adhere to Islamic law.</p><p>The party has also, for the first time in its history, <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/6/if-jamaat-comes-to-power-bangladeshi-hindus-will-be-safe-i-am-the-proof\">nominated a Hindu candidate</a>.</p><p>Yet when addressing conservative supporters, the party continues to emphasise its Islamic identity, with some backers encouraging votes for Jamaat as an act of religious merit – a practice the rival BNP has criticised as the misuse of religious sentiment.</p><p>The strategy appears to have helped Jamaat re-enter political conversations that were once closed to it. At the same time, it has sharpened doubts about how far Rahman is willing – or able – to go in reinterpreting the party’s past and ideology as he courts a broader electorate.</p><p>Those limits are most visible in Jamaat’s stance on women and leadership. They came into sharp focus during his Al Jazeera interview in which Shafiqur Rahman said it was not possible for a woman to hold the party’s top position – a remark that reignited longstanding criticism of Jamaat’s gender politics, despite its attempts to project a more inclusive image.</p><p>“Allah has made everyone with a distinct nature. A man cannot bear a child or breastfeed,” Rahman said. “There are physical limitations that cannot be denied. When a mother gives birth, how will she carry out these responsibilities? It is not possible.”</p><p>Critics argue that the stance exposes the limits of Jamaat’s claims of moderation.</p><p>Mubashar Hasan, an adjunct researcher at the Humanitarian and Development Research Initiative at Western Sydney University in Australia and author of Narratives of Bangladesh, also questioned Jamaat’s internal culture, noting that even female leaders who publicly endorse such views operate within a male-dominated hierarchy. He was referring to the party’s large number of female supporters and members, including women within its Majlis-e-Shura, the highest decision-making body. “It reflects a structure where women follow what men say in that party,” he said.</p><p>The criticism carries particular weight given the movement that helped reopen political space for Jamaat itself. The July 2024 uprising against Hasina, analysts note, saw extensive participation by women, often at the front lines of protest. “Women were part of that movement as much as men, if not more,” Hasan said. “Undermining them now gives Jamaat a deeply problematic outlook.”</p><p>Political historians argue this is not a new contradiction but a longstanding one. Since contesting elections under its own symbol in 1986, Jamaat has never fielded a woman candidate for a general parliamentary seat, relying instead on reserved quotas.</p><p>“This isn’t a temporary position or a tactical lapse,” said political historian and author Mohiuddin Ahmad.“It reflects the party’s ideological structure, and that structure has not fundamentally changed.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4293590\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4293590\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4293590\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26021348970837-1770411239.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Head of Bangladesh's interim government Muhammad Yunus, center, with Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Ameer Shafiqur Rahman, inaugurate the July Uprising Memorial Museum, once the official residence of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026.

White-bearded, soft-spoken and visibly attentive to supporters, Rahman fits the image.</p><p>“He connects with young people through his words,” said Abdullah Al Maruf, a Gen Z law student from Chattogram and a Jamaat supporter. “There is something about his recent work that feels like the relationship between a grandfather and his grandchildren. Where BNP leaders often belittle young people, Shafiqur speaks to them with respect.”</p><p>Maruf added that Rahman’s appeal extends beyond Jamaat’s traditional base. “Outside the usual Jamaat circle, he is more popular than previous Jamaat leaders,” he said.</p><p>Zubair, Jamaat’s assistant secretary-general, described the party’s outreach beyond traditional voters – such as the decision to nominate a Hindu candidate – not as a tactical move but one rooted in Jamaat’s constitutional framework rather than political expediency.</p><p>“Our constitution allows any Bangladeshi, regardless of religion, to be part of the party if they support our political, economic and social policies,” he said. “Supporting our religious doctrine is not a requirement for political participation.”</p><p>Jamaat leaders argue the move reflects a broader effort to shift the party’s public image – from one defined primarily by theology to one centred on governance and accountability. “We are emphasising corruption-free politics, discipline and public service,” Zubair said. “People have seen our leaders stand with them during floods, during COVID, and during the July uprising. That is why support is growing.”</p><p>Krishna Nandi, the party’s Hindu candidate from the city of Khulna, agrees. “When families fall into poverty, Jamaat-linked welfare networks step in without asking about religion or political loyalty. This culture of service explains why many citizens see Jamaat not as a party of slogans but as a party of discipline, structure and responsibility,” <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/6/if-jamaat-comes-to-power-bangladeshi-hindus-will-be-safe-i-am-the-proof\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nandi wrote for Al Jazeera</a>.</p><p>The Jamaat’s outreach has also extended well beyond domestic audiences. Zubair said the party’s leadership has held meetings with Indian diplomats in Dhaka who paid a courtesy visit to Shafiqur when he was ill. Jamaat figures were invited to India’s 77th Republic Day reception at the Indian High Commission last month – an unprecedented step.</p><p>European and Western diplomats, he added, have also sought engagements with Rahman in recent months. That shift has been mirrored in Washington. In a leaked audio recording reported by The Washington Post, a US diplomat was quoted as saying American officials wanted to “be friends” with the Jamaat, asking journalists whether members of the party’s influential student wing might be willing to appear in their programmes.</p><p>As Jamaat’s international engagement expands – and as it emerges as a serious electoral force alongside frontrunner BNP – many general supporters express confidence in Rahman’s leadership.</p><p>“He is a patriot,” said Abul Kalam, a voter in Rahman’s Dhaka constituency. “Whether as prime minister or opposition leader, he will lead us well.”</p><p>What lies next for the party is unclear. But analysts say that irrespective of the outcome of the elections, Rahman’s stature within Jamaat – and beyond, in Bangladesh – appears resolute.</p><p>“Shafiqur Rahman is an experienced politician and is frequently in the headlines,” Ahmad, the political historian, said. “His political thinking is not yet fully clear, but his grip over the party is evident.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We will only repay them by working at our utmost to bring all the good things to them, to our country,” he said.</p><p>Asked about forming a coalition and appointing a cabinet, Anutin said he was waiting for clarity on the final numbers, and that each party would need to hold internal discussions on how to proceed.</p><p>Anutin called the election in December after fewer than 100 days in office, seeking to capitalise on a wave of ‌nationalism generated by Thailand’s three-week conflict with Cambodia.</p><p>He described the election result as “a victory for all Thais”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The People’s Party has already ‌ruled out the possibility of joining a coalition led by ⁠Anutin, with its leader, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, saying late on Sunday that it would not seek to form a rival coalition.</p><p>Polls at the end of January suggested the People’s Party was significantly ahead of Bhumjaithai.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tony Cheng, reporting from Bangkok, called the outcome of Sunday’s election “somewhat of a surprise”.</p><p>“But the two things we kept hearing from Thai voters, regardless of political affiliation, was that people wanted stability to return to Thai politics. This was an election that shouldn’t have happened. The last one only happened three years ago. So it was a sign Thailand was teetering on the edge,” Cheng said.</p><p>“The other thing Thai voters wanted was economic growth. This is a country that’s been in economic stagnation for nearly two decades now, while it’s surrounded by countries seeing huge growth: Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam – all growing between 5 and 6 percent. Thailand is barely scraping along at 1.5 percent GDP growth. And it’s falling back. And the voters wanted to arrest that halt and to give it a significant boost,” he added.</p><p>Bhumjaithai will now look to smaller parties to form a coalition.</p><p>Possible partners include Deputy Prime Minister Thammanat Prompao’s party, Kla Tham, which looks set to win an estimated 58 seats, according to Thai media.</p><p>Together, Bhumjaithai and Kla Tham could surpass the 251 votes required to form a government.</p><p>The prime minister previously indicated that if he was re-elected, ‌the incumbent ministers of finance, foreign affairs and commerce would retain their roles in a new cabinet.</p><p>“Bhumjaithai will start negotiations to form a coalition government in a position of great strength. They won’t need to give away important ministries to smaller parties. They will be able to bring in a couple of partners, but they’ll very much be in the driving seat,” said Al Jazeera’s Cheng.</p><p>“With this return to power, Anutin has got a popular mandate, his party will be firmly back in parliament, they’ll be able to pass the bills he needs, and I think, again, that’s what Thai voters wanted,” he said.</p><p>“They voted for stability and economic growth.”</p><p>Thai voters on Sunday also backed a proposal to change the ‌constitution, with nearly two-thirds in favour of replacing a charter put in place after a 2014 military coup, which critics say gave too much power to an undemocratic Senate.</p><p>It is expected to take at least two years to implement the new constitution, with two more referendums required to endorse the drafting process and the final text.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Some of them have called for the end of the Islamic Republic,” said Sina Azodi, the director of the Middle East Studies programme at George Washington University in Washington, DC.</p><p>“This tells me the Islamic Republic has decided to close any avenues for political dissent and, rather, to rule with an iron fist, through crackdowns and more fear-mongering among any political dissidents.”</p><h2 id=\"talks-with-us\">Talks with US</h2><p>The Iranian clampdown has also ratcheted up tensions with Washington.</p><p>When the protests first broke out, US President Donald Trump – who is seeking to curb Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes – threatened Tehran with new attacks if it used force against the protesters. Trump, who had ordered the US military strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites last June, also deployed a naval “armada” to the Gulf region.</p><p>The move prompted Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to warn of a “regional war” if Iran is attacked, as well as a push by regional powers to ease the tensions.</p><p>The diplomacy resulted in Iran and the US holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday. President Masoud Pezeshkian described the discussions as “a step forward” in a social media post on Sunday and said his government favoured continued dialogue.</p><p>Another round of negotiations is scheduled for next week.</p><p>Phyllis Bennis, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that she does not expect the latest arrests in Iran to affect the ongoing nuclear negotiations.</p><p>“I am not sure that these arrests are going to be a specific focus of the talks as they continue,” she told Al Jazeera. However, she noted the arrests come amid the talks in Oman and a planned visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the US capital.</p><p>Netanyahu will probably demand Iran halt all uranium enrichment, end its missile programme, and stop supporting regional allies, Bennis said.</p><p>“It’s essentially a call for Iranian surrender,” she said.</p><p>“So there’ll be a big question as to whether the US is going to go along with the Israeli position or maintain its own position, which historically has been slightly different than Israel’s, particularly on the question of nuclear enrichment.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But both showed the flaws that have opened the door for Arsenal to potentially end their long wait to be crowned champions once again.</p><p class=\"p1\">Haaland has scored just once from open play in his last 13 games, and an uncharacteristic lack of confidence from the Norwegian showed with the best chance of the first half inside the opening two minutes.</p><p class=\"p1\">Silva’s clever pass split the Liverpool defence, but Haaland’s shot lacked conviction under pressure from Milos Kerkez, and Alisson Becker was able to save low to his left.</p><p class=\"p1\">Haaland hooked another effort straight at Alisson among 10 first-half City attempts without a breakthrough.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Second-half slumps have been a consistent feature of City’s season, and the visitors again faded in the second period until a late flurry saved their title challenge.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hugo Ekitike should have opened the scoring when he completely miscued his header just before the hour mark after a lightning-fast Liverpool break.</p><p class=\"p1\">Marc Guehi was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card when he dragged down Mo Salah just outside the box.</p><p class=\"p1\">But it was City who were left fuming at the award of the free kick that led to the opener when Ryan Gravenberch went down under minimal contact.</p><p class=\"p1\">Szoboszlai scored the only goal with an outrageous free kick when Arsenal visited Anfield in August and produced another stunning strike that clipped the inside of the post before finding the net.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, the Hungarian went from hero to villain when City levelled six minutes from time.</p><p class=\"p1\">Szoboszlai played Silva onside as he slid in to volley home Haaland’s header for City’s first second-half goal in the Premier League this year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Alisson then wiped out Matheus Nunes to concede a penalty and Haaland kept his cool from the spot to put City in front.</p><p class=\"p1\">Pep Guardiola’s men still needed a stunning save from Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip behind Alexis Mac Allister’s deflected shot.</p><p class=\"p1\">With Alisson remaining forward from the resulting corner, the Liverpool goal was open when Cherki took aim from the halfway line to roll the ball into an empty net.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, Haaland and Szoboszlai’s grappling as the ball trickled towards the goal saw the strike ruled out, with a free kick awarded to City instead, and the Liverpool player given his marching orders.</p><p>Silva, who was named player of the match, told Sky Sports that it was a vital win for City.</p><p>“I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over. We felt like we needed to win,” he said.</p><p>“The hope is there, and we are going to fight until the end. We need to keep doing our job that we haven’t lately.”</p><p>Liverpool boss Arne Slot said he was disappointed not to come away with a result and claimed that several key decisions had gone against his side.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“You cannot compare this game with three or four months ago. We have improved so much – but we need to improve the results,” he told Sky.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“So many times this year we haven’t got what I think we deserve, and this is another time.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"palace-end-dire-run-at-brighton\">Palace end dire run at Brighton</h2><p class=\"p1\">Earlier on Sunday, Crystal Palace ended a 12-game winless run in all competitions by beating rival Brighton 1-0.</p><p class=\"p1\">Ismaila Sarr scored the only goal of the match at the Amex Stadium to move Palace nine points clear of the relegation zone and leapfrog Brighton into 13th place.</p><p class=\"p1\">“It was an unbelievable atmosphere and what a way to start my Palace career, a win in a derby,” said Palace’s record signing Jorgen Strand Larsen, who joined from Wolves on deadline day. “It was really important to win, as there has been a run without wins before I joined.</p><p class=\"p1\">“This is the most intense game I have ever played, so I’m tired now, but it is worth it.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Sarr’s winner came after running through in the 61st minute and firing past goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen. It was his second goal in as many games and his 10th of the season.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

She arrived on a visitor’s visa, staying with her mother, a US citizen, in Paterson, New Jersey, home to one of the largest Arab communities in the country.</p><p>She later transitioned from a tourist visa to a student visa, according to her habeas corpus petition.</p><p>After her mother applied for Kordia to remain in the US as the relative of a citizen, her green card application was approved in 2021. However, she received incorrect advice from a teacher that led to her student visa expiring in 2022, according to her lawyers.</p><p>Before her arrest, Kordia worked as a server at a Middle Eastern restaurant on Palestine Way in New Jersey and helped to care for her autistic half-brother.</p><p>Kordia was moved to protest against Israel’s war due to personal loss. Since the start of the war in October 2023, Kordia said, more than 200 of her relatives have been killed.</p><p>Israel has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 170,000 in a war that human rights groups, a United Nations commission and a growing number of scholars said amounts to genocide. Since a “ceasefire” began in October, Israel has killed more than 500 Palestinians and continues to impose curbs on the entry of aid into Gaza.</p><p>If deported, Kordia would be handed over to the Israeli government.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3852409\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3852409\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3852409\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-05-07T232621Z_1067079386_RC28DEAXD5K3_RTRMADP_3_USA-COLUMBIA-PROTESTS-1753273385.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C524&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3852409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pro-Palestinian protesters take over Butler Library on the campus of Columbia University on May 7, 2025 [Ryan Murphy/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-was-kordia-arrested\">Why was Kordia arrested?</h2><p>She was first arrested in April 2024 during a protest outside the gates of Columbia University, but the case was soon dropped.</p><p>On March 13, 2025, Kordia showed up at the ICE headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, for what she believed to be routine immigration questions. She was detained there, “thrown into an unmarked van and sent 1,500 miles [more than 2,400km] away”, Kordia wrote in the USA Today newspaper last month.</p><p>Kordia was neither a student at Columbia University nor a part of political circles.</p><p>“Though I was not a student, I felt compelled to participate. After all, Israel, with the backing of the United States, has laid waste to Gaza, forcibly displacing my family, killing nearly 200 of my relatives,” she wrote in USA Today.</p><p>Today, Kordia is the only person who remains in detention from the Columbia campus demonstrations. She has been held at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas.</p><p>A leader of the protests, Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student with Algerian citizenship and a US green card, and others have been released. Khalil, however, is still in a legal battle to remain in the US with his American wife and child. Last month, an appeals court panel <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/us-court-hands-trump-victory-against-pro-palestine-activist-mahmoud-khalil\">dismissed</a> a lawsuit Khalil filed challenging his detention and deportation order.

I’m a Palestinian woman who enjoys playing the oud, making pottery and hiking,” Kordia wrote. “Speaking out against what rights groups and experts have called a genocide is my moral duty and – I thought – a constitutionally protected right for all in this country. Except, it seems, when that speech defends Palestinian life.”</p><p>An immigration judge has called for Kordia’s release twice.

Privacy does not exist here.”</p><p>Last year, when Kordia’s cousin Hamzah Abushaban visited her a week after her arrest, he told The Associated Press news agency in an interview that he was taken aback by the dark circles under her eyes and her state of confusion.</p><p>“One of the first things she asked me was why she was there,” Abushaban said. “She cried a lot. She looked like death.”</p><p>Rights groups and some Democratic Party leaders have called her a “political prisoner”, condemning the way her case has proceeded.</p><p>State Representative Salman Bhojani said the conditions at the detention facility were “suffocating”.</p><p>Kordia’s dorm, he said, had 60 mattresses crammed into a space designed for 20 women.</p><p>“She does not even have clothing that fully covers her body. Community organizations have tried to provide more appropriate clothing and have been turned away,” Bhojani said. “Male staff enter the dorm at any time, leaving her body exposed in violation of her religious obligations.”</p><p>Calling for her release, Amnesty International noted that ICE has “repeatedly violated” Kordia’s religious rights. “She has been served almost no halal meals, forcing her to eat food that doesn’t meet her dietary requirements and causing significant weight loss,” the human rights group said in a statement.</p><p>“During Ramadan, staff refused to let her save food for when she could break her fast, forcing her either to go hungry or to break her fast early,” Amnesty said. “She has not been provided with clothing suitable for prayer or a clean prayer space.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4297367\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4297367\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4297367\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-05T225526Z_1154928823_RC2VFJAS7L42_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-NEW-YORK-PROTEST-1770550377.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ICE columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4297367\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People participate in a protest organised by Columbia University students and professors against President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and demand that the school establish itself as a sanctuary campus [File: Amr Alfiky/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-was-kordia-hospitalised\">Why was Kordia hospitalised?</h2><p>On Friday, Abushaban said he heard about Kordia’s hospitalisation in the morning from a person formerly detained with his cousin.</p><p>Kordia had fallen, hit her head and suffered a seizure in a bathroom at the Prairieland Detention Center, he told The Dallas Morning News newspaper.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday, Kordia’s attorneys and family members demanded answers from the Department of Homeland Security and Prairieland Detention Center regarding her health and whereabouts.</p><p>“[Kordia] was reportedly hospitalised yesterday morning after fainting and having a seizure at the Prairieland Detention Center,” the statement said, adding: “Neither her legal team nor family have been provided answers about where she has been hospitalised, the specifics of her health status, and whether and how ICE will ensure her health upon discharge from the undisclosed, off-site hospital.”</p><p>“We have since learned that she is expected to spend another night there, but we still have not been able to speak with her directly or have any confirmation of what brought her to the hospital in the first place,” the statement said.</p><p>The family members told US media that they called all hospitals in the vicinity but could not locate Kordia.</p><p>In a statement, the Council on American-Islamic Relations urged people to contact their Congressional representatives to demand that the Department of Homeland Security and ICE disclose Kordia’s “location and medical status, end administrative stays, and release her immediately.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4297369\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4297369\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4297369\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2025-10-07T200014Z_173659322_RC277HAZJUAD_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-USA-PROTEST-1770550438.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"columbia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4297369\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students protest outside Columbia University on the two-year anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel and start of Israel’s war on Gaza [File: Ryan Murphy/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-were-the-columbia-protests-about\">What were the Columbia protests about?</h2><p>In 2024, pro-Palestinian student encampments at Columbia University helped ignite a global movement against Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><p>The protest sites, however, were broken up after Columbia University allowed hundreds of New York City police officers on campus, leading to dozens of arrests.</p><p>The student protesters demanded an end to Israel’s war in Gaza and the university’s divestment from companies linked to the Israeli military.</p><p>Columbia University imposed severe punishments, including expulsion and revocation of academic degrees, on dozens of students who participated in the protests.

He said China and Russia have also been informed of the content of the talks.</p><p class=\"s6\">“Being afraid is lethal poison in this situation,” Araghchi said about Washington amassing what US President Donald Trump has called a “beautiful armada” near Iran’s waters.</p><h2 id=\"push-the-region-back-years\" class=\"s3\">‘Push the region back years’</h2><p class=\"s6\">Iran’s top military commander on Sunday issued a new warning that the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/1/khamenei-warns-us-of-regional-war-if-iran-is-attacked\">entire region will be engulfed in conflict</a> if Iran is attacked.</p><p class=\"s6\">“While being prepared, we genuinely have no desire to see the outbreak of a regional war,” Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi told a gathering of air force and air defence commanders and personnel.</p><p class=\"s6\">“Even though aggressors will be the target of the flames of regional war, this will push back the advancement and development of the region by years, and its repercussions will be borne by the warmongers in the US and the Zionist regime,” he said in reference to Israel.</p><p class=\"s6\">According to Mousavi, Iran “has the necessary power and preparedness for a long-term war with the US”.</p><p class=\"s6\">But many average Iranians are left in limbo without much hope that the talks with the US will lead to results, including for the country’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/6/protests-grow-as-irans-government-makes-meager-offer-amid-tanking-economy\">heavily declining economy</a>.</p><p class=\"s6\">“I was 20 when the first negotiations with the West over Iran’s nuclear programme were held about 23 years ago,” Saman, who works at a small private investment firm in Tehran, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"s6\">“Our best years are behind us.

The United Nations special rapporteur on Iran, Mati Sato, said more than 20,000 may have been killed as information trickles out despite <a href=\"/news/2026/2/2/irans-economy-falters-as-internet-shutdown-hits-people-businesses-hard\">heavy internet filtering</a>.</p><p>Al Jazeera cannot independently verify these figures.</p><p class=\"s6\">Amid numerous reports that dozens of medical staff were arrested for treating wounded protesters and remain incarcerated in harsh conditions, Iran’s judiciary issued a rejection of the allegations late Saturday. It claimed that only “a limited number of medical personnel were arrested for participating in riots and playing a role in the field”.</p><p class=\"s6\">A large number of schoolchildren and university students were also reportedly among tens of thousands arrested during and in the aftermath of the nationwide protests. The Ministry of Education claimed last week that it did not know how many schoolchildren were arrested, but could confirm that all have since been released.</p><p>The Coordinating Council of Iranian Teachers’ Trade Associations on Sunday released the four-minute video below, titled “200 empty school desks”, which shows the schoolchildren and teenagers confirmed killed during the protests.

The PM called Sunday’s snap elections only after three months, in hopes of turning the party’s political fortunes.</p><p>However, Takaichi’s election promise to suspend the eight percent sales tax on food to help households cope with rising prices has spooked investors, who are concerned about how the nation with the heaviest debt burden among advanced economies will fund the plan.</p><p>Nevertheless, residents trudged through winter weather to cast their ballots, with record snowfall in parts of the country snarling traffic and requiring some polling stations to close early.</p><p>“It feels like she’s creating a sense of direction – like the whole country pulling together and moving forward. That really resonates with me,” Kazushige Cho, 54, told Reuters news agency.</p><p>Meanwhile, Niigata resident Mineko Mori, 74, padding through the snow with her dog, said she worried that Takaichi’s tax cuts could saddle future generations with ‌an even bigger burden.</p><h2 id=\"she-can-push-any-legislation\">‘She can push any legislation’</h2><p>Craig Mark, a lecturer at Hosei University, says Takaichi’s apparent success likely gives the LDP the ability to “override the opposition parties”.</p><p>“Essentially, she can push through any legislation she wants, whether it’s <a href=\"/news/2022/12/16/pacifist-japan-unveils-unprecedented-320bn-military-build-up\">the record budget</a> that was recently approved or defence spending,” Mark told Al Jazeera from the capital Tokyo.</p><p>It is also the “greatest chance” for Takaichi to change the country’s image as a pacifist nation, he added. Japan’s post-World War II constitution does not officially recognise the military, and limits it to nominally self-defensive capabilities.</p><p>The head of Japan’s top business lobby, Keidanren, welcomed the result as restoring political stability.</p><p>“Japan’s economy is now at a critical juncture for achieving sustainable and strong growth,” Yoshinobu Tsutsui said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"china-tensions\">China tensions</h2><p>China will also be keeping a close eye on ‌the results.</p><p>Weeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with China in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.</p><p>A strong mandate could accelerate her plans to bolster military defence, which Beijing has cast as an attempt to revive Japan’s militaristic past.</p><p>“Beijing will not welcome Takaichi’s victory,” said David Boling, principal at the Asia Group, a firm that advises companies on geopolitical risk.</p><p>“China now faces the reality that she is firmly in place – and that its efforts to isolate her completely failed.”</p><h2 id=\"takaichi-thanks-trump\">Takaichi thanks Trump</h2><p>On Thursday, US President Donald Trump delivered his endorsement of Takaichi via social media and also took the unusual step of announcing before the results of the voting that she would visit the White House on March 19.</p><p>Trump said the United States and Japan have been working to strike a “very substantial” deal on trade, as well as collaborating on national security. Trump offered his “Complete and Total Endorsement” of Takaichi.</p><p>On Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also hailed a “big victory” for Takaichi and declared that a strong Japan makes the United States “strong in Asia”.</p><p>Takaichi thanked Trump for his “warm words” endorsing her as her party romped to a landslide victory in elections on Sunday.</p><p>“I look forward to visiting the White House this spring and to continuing our work together to further strengthen the Japan–U.S. Alliance,” she wrote on X.</p><p>Underlining that the partnership is “built on deep trust and close, strong cooperation”, she added that “the potential of our Alliance is LIMITLESS”.</p><p>US-Japan trade was $317bn in 2024, and the two nations also have a longstanding security alliance, with some 50,000 US forces based in Japan, a lynchpin of the US military presence in the Asia-Pacific.</p></div></div></body></html>"
