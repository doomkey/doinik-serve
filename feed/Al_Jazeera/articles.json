The plan, which has been heavily criticised as far too favourable to Russia by many observers, is in its draft stage and has yet to be made public. However, a Ukrainian official is understood to have provided the details to international media.</p><p>Here is a closer look at the points and the significance of this plan.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-28-points-of-trump-s-proposal-for-ukraine\">What are the 28 points of Trump’s proposal for Ukraine?</h2><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">1. Ukraine’s sovereignty will be confirmed.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">2. A comprehensive, non-aggression agreement will be concluded between Russia, Ukraine and Europe.

Ukraine is eligible for European Union (EU) membership and will receive short-term preferential access to the EU market while this issue is being considered.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">12. A powerful global package of measures will be provided to rebuild Ukraine, including but not limited to:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">The creation of a Ukraine Development Fund to invest in fast-growing industries, including technology, data centres and artificial intelligence.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">The US will cooperate with Ukraine to jointly rebuild, develop, modernise and operate Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, including pipelines and storage facilities.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Joint efforts to rehabilitate war-affected areas for the restoration, reconstruction and modernisation of cities and residential areas.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Infrastructure development.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">Extraction of minerals and natural resources.</li>\n<li class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">The World Bank will develop a special financing package to accelerate these efforts.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">13.

Europe will add $100bn to increase the amount of investment available for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Frozen European funds will be unfrozen. The remainder of the frozen Russian funds will be invested in a separate US-Russian investment vehicle that will implement joint projects in specific areas. This fund will be aimed at strengthening relations and increasing common interests to create a strong incentive not to return to conflict.</li>\n</ul><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">15. A joint American-Russian working group on security issues will be established to promote and ensure compliance with all provisions of this agreement.</p><p class=\"EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy \">16.

Once all parties agree to this memorandum, the ceasefire will take effect immediately after both sides retreat to the agreed points to begin implementation of the agreement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-has-ukraine-reacted-to-these-proposals\">How has Ukraine reacted to these proposals?</h2><p>Zelenskyy met with US Army officials in Kyiv on Thursday to discuss the proposals, which have been drawn up by US and Russian officials without any input from Ukraine or its European allies.</p><p>After the meeting, Zelenskyy <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/ukraine-doubts-russias-desire-for-peace-amid-reports-of-us-drafted-plan\">said</a> in an address: “The American side presented points of a plan to end the war – their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it’s all genuine.”</p><p>Zelenskyy added, “From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace – one that will not be broken by a third invasion. A dignified peace – with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty and the dignity of the Ukrainian people.”</p><p>The Ukrainian president said that he will now discuss the proposals with Ukraine’s European allies.</p><h2 id=\"does-this-mean-ukraine-and-its-allies-will-accept-the-proposal\">Does this mean Ukraine and its allies will accept the proposal?</h2><p>No.</p><p>“Zelenskyy had a nuanced response – he said ‘We will work on it’,” Keir Giles, a Eurasia expert at the London political think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>However, he added that agreeing to the terms of the plan in its current form would be “catastrophic” for Ukraine because of the heavy concessions Kyiv is being asked to make.</p><p>While European leaders have not reacted to the 28-point plan, they have indicated that they would not accept a plan that requires Ukraine to make such concessions.</p><p>“Ukrainians want peace – a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.”</p><p>For now, Ukraine’s allies are not commenting. European Council President Antonio Costa said that the EU has not yet been officially informed about the US plan, so “it makes no sense to comment” on it.</p><p>More reactions from Europe might come starting from Saturday, when Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak at the G20 summit.</p><p>“A 28-point plan was made public. We will discuss the situation both with European leaders and with leaders here on the sidelines of the G20,” von der Leyen said, according to UK media.</p><h2 id=\"what-are-russia-and-the-us-saying-about-this-plan-now\">What are Russia and the US saying about this plan now?</h2><p>The US has not made details of the plan public, and officials from Washington have not commented on it.</p><p>Russia has denied that there have been formal consultations between the US and Russia on a peace plan.</p><p>“Consultations are not currently under way. There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hungarian PM and close Trump ally Viktor Orban seemed to back the plan on Friday.</p><p>In an X post, Orban wrote that Trump’s plan had “gained new momentum”.</p><p>“The American President is a persistent maverick. If he had been President at the time, the war would never have broken out. It is clear that once he sets his mind on something, he does not let it go, and he has certainly set his mind on ending the Russian-Ukrainian war,” Orban wrote.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"what-do-analysts-say-about-these-proposals\">What do analysts say about these proposals?</h2><p>Experts said the terms of the 28-point plan and how they would be implemented are far from clear.</p><p>“The terms are unenforceable, nonsensical and vague that they cannot be enforced without months of wrangling,” Giles said.</p><p>For instance, he said, point 9 states that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. However, it is unclear what “European” or “fighter jets” mean.</p><p>Giles said “European” could mean the European Union or European countries. “‘Fighter jets’ is a militarily meaningless term, which provides plenty of room for argument,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-the-us-be-compensated-for-security-guarantees\">How would the US be ‘compensated’ for security guarantees?</h2><p>It is unclear what security guarantees the US is offering Ukraine. Further details of these have not been released.</p><p>Point 10 states that the “US will receive compensation for the guarantee”. While it is unclear what the specific compensation would be, experts suggest that point 14 may shed some light on this.</p><p>Point 14 of the plan states that $100bn in frozen Russian assets plus $100bn from Europe would be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction.</p><p>The plan further states that the US will receive 50 percent of the profits from the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is not specified how these profits would be generated.</p><p>The plan also states that remaining Russian funds would go into a joint US-Russia investment vehicle for projects to build ties and deter future conflict, again with little detail.</p><p>Giles said this likely refers to about $300bn in Russian Central Bank assets, which have been frozen by the US and European countries since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>In October this year, EU leaders suggested a “reparations plan” under which it would use frozen Russian assets to lend Ukraine $164bn to buy European weapons, and for reconstruction.</p><p>Giles said that the point about Russian frozen assets was likely deliberately added by negotiators from Moscow because “Russia has already written off frozen assets abroad, and now is dangling that as a carrot in front of the US”.</p><p>Giles added that, according to earlier plans, however, “those funds were supposed to rebuild Ukraine”.</p><p>However, now we don’t know whether the reconstruction will be of a “free Ukraine or Russian efforts of Russification in occupied Ukraine”, he said.</p><h2 id=\"would-the-proposal-give-russia-amnesty-for-war-crimes\">Would the proposal give Russia amnesty for war crimes?</h2><p>Point 26 of the plan states that all parties involved in the conflict will receive “full amnesty for their actions during the war”.</p><p>In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href=\"/news/2023/3/17/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-russias-putin-over-ukraine-crimes\">issued an arrest warrant</a> for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.</p><p>The US cannot unilaterally grant amnesty to an individual convicted of war crimes by an international organisation.</p><p>“Writing off the war, pretending it never happened, rolling back sanctions and ignoring war crimes is just one of the elements of this draft list where the US is assuming the cooperation of the rest of the world,” Giles said.</p><p>He added that a large number of countries across the world strongly believe in international law, and are likely to push back on this point.</p><p>“If a negotiation like this were to be enforced, then it is the US endorsing the seizure of territory through open arms aggression, and it will be encouragement to other aggressors around the world that they have the US blessing,” Giles warned.</p><h2 id=\"what-territory-would-ukraine-have-to-concede\">What territory would Ukraine have to concede?</h2><p>The plan says that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be considered Russian territory.</p><p>Donetsk and Luhansk are collectively called the Donbas region.</p><p>Crimea was seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 and remains a matter of dispute.</p><p>According to the Institute for the Study of War, overall, Ukraine still controls 14.5 percent of the territory in the Donbas, including parts of Donetsk around the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.</p><p>Russia also controls 75 percent of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/russia-gains-ground-in-zaporizhzhia-in-southeastern-ukraine\">Zaporizhia</a> and <a href=\"/features/2025/9/15/russian-occupiers-brought-death-and-intimidation-to-kherson-ukrainian-teen\">Kherson</a> in southern Ukraine, bordering the Black Sea. The plan says that the current battle lines will be frozen in these regions.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4109941\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4109941\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4109941\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1763294067.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1763294067\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4109941\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-would-russia-be-brought-back-into-the-international-fold\">How would Russia be brought back into the international fold?</h2><p>Parts of the proposal aim to bring Russia out of the isolation imposed on it by the Western world since it started the Ukraine war.</p><p>Point 12 states that Russia will be invited to rejoin the G8.</p><p>The G8 – <a href=\"/news/2025/6/15/g7-summit-who-is-attending-and-whats-on-the-agenda\">currently the G7</a> – was an unofficial forum for the leaders of eight major industrialised nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US.</p><p>Russia was part of the G8 but was ejected following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p><p>The plan also mentions the establishment of a US-Russian investment vehicle that would implement joint projects in specific areas. However, further details about this have not been revealed.</p><p>The plan also mentions the formation of a joint US-Russian working group on security issues to ensure compliance with the plan.</p><h2 id=\"will-the-proposal-end-the-war-in-ukraine\">Will the proposal end the war in Ukraine?</h2><p>Analysts are doubtful. “This agreement is not going anywhere – similar to the previous ones,” Giles said.</p><p>He called it “another iteration of the merry-go-round that we’ve been on many times before”.</p><p>He said he believes the plan will receive pushback from Ukraine and Europe, which will want to negotiate changes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The democratic socialist’s victory sent shock waves through national politics, emboldening progressives across the country to run and to win on agendas as unapologetically ambitious as the moment demands.</p><p>Campaigning across the city, Mamdani reached out to various social groups, including African Americans, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, East Africans and South Asians, and especially the youth, many of whom had grown politically disengaged after the Democratic Party’s demoralising performance in recent years. He brought people back into the political process, mobilising voters who otherwise might have stayed home.</p><p>Running on a platform calling for a more equitable distribution of wealth through higher taxes on the super-wealthy, a more affordable and accessible housing market, a free and faster public bus system, and universal, no-cost childcare for children from six weeks to five years old, Mamdani has brought into the mainstream a political discourse centred on equity, one the nation has arguably not witnessed since Eugene V Debs, the early 20th-century socialist organiser and five-time presidential candidate who championed workers’ rights and economic justice.</p><p>When asked live on television what “democratic socialist” means, Mamdani replied: “When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr [Martin Luther] King [Jr] from decades ago who said, ‘Call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.’”</p><p>But what, really, is “democratic socialism”? To many, the term “socialism” evokes the economic system of the former Soviet Union, characterised by inefficient allocation of resources, state control and ownership of productive assets, and political repression under a brutally totalitarian regime. Yet that is not what socialism means.</p><p>As the late Erik Olin Wright, one of the most influential sociologists of the past half-century and a pioneering scholar of class analysis in capitalism, detailed, what was practised by the Soviet Union was not socialism but “statism”, an economic system in which state incumbents control investment and production through a centralised planning <a href=\"https://www.asanet.org/wp-content/uploads/sage_wright_presidential_address.pdf\">apparatus</a>. Indeed, in common parlance, most people use the term “socialism” to describe what is most accurately referred to as statism.</p><p>Over the past century, struggles for more equal alternatives to capitalism have been waged under the banner of “socialism”. Yet the term itself has long been contested, its precise meaning the subject of intense debate both within and without the academic and policy circles.</p><p>If nothing else, Karl Marx himself saw socialism as grounded in two essential principles. First, it required the democratisation of not only political life, which refers to the procedural democracy exercised in most developed countries, but also economic life, so that ordinary workers have a voice in how economic resources are distributed. Second, socialism envisioned a reduction in working hours, so that people could cultivate their creative capacities outside the workplace. Indeed, Marx’s critique of capitalism stemmed largely from his belief that it curtails “human flourishing and self-actualisation”.</p><p>Yet the socialist experiments of the 19th and 20th centuries across the world bore no resemblance to these humanistic ideals. Socialism, once seen as an economic system that would extend democracy into realms capitalism would never allow, turned into a centralised, grossly inefficient, and authoritarian state apparatus of command and control of both the economy and society. Soviet-style dictatorships rife with corruption and venality turned socialism into a vehicle for state domination rather than human liberation. With shortages, rationing, and long lines in stores, socialism came to be seen by the 1980s as a failed project of social transformation in the places where it was implemented.</p><p>So, what is “democratic socialism”?</p><p>The term is composed of two words: “democratic” and “socialism”. Democracy is fundamentally a socialist principle. Indeed, democracy is the most effective political mechanism we know for ensuring that the state serves as an agent of the people. If “democracy” is the term to signify the subordination of state power to people’s power, “socialism” is the term to signify the subordination of economic power to people’s power. In democratic socialism, control over investment and production is organised through genuinely democratic means. The central moral objective of democratic socialism is that a national economy should be organised in such a way as to serve the needs and aspirations of ordinary people, not those of elites.</p><p>Democratic socialism thus represents an attempt to reconcile the egalitarian goals of socialism with the institutions of liberal democracy. It envisions an economy where markets still allocate resources, but the ownership of productive assets and the distribution of wealth are subject to participatory and democratic decision-making. The goal is not to abolish markets, but to make them answer to the public, to ensure that economic outcomes reflect shared values rather than private power.</p><p>It is now well understood that capitalism grants prosperity to some while consigning many others to <a href=\"https://www.aacademica.org/erik.olin.wright/11.pdf\">poverty</a>. It denies the conditions for genuine human flourishing and development from vast segments of the world’s population, even within the most advanced economies. “Freedom of choice,” often celebrated by capitalism’s defenders as its central moral virtue, is in fact only partial. The stark inequalities of income, wealth, and opportunity that capitalism produces narrow what might be called “real freedom”: the genuine ability of people to pursue their life plans and act on the choices that truly matter to them.</p><p>The promise of democratic socialism is not simply greater equality, but greater freedom. Its goal is to give all people the ability to truly shape their own lives. That’s what Zohran Mamdani’s platform represents. His policies, such as a rent freeze, fare-free buses and universal childcare, are not merely economic measures; they are instruments of real freedom for ordinary people. When most of one’s paycheque disappears into rent, freedom is constrained. Housing stability helps people feel secure, make long-term plans, and avoid the stress of potential eviction. Housing stability is tied to human dignity. Fare-free public transit extends the freedom of mobility across the city. Free buses make mobility a right, not a privilege, and open up the physical and social space of freedom itself. And universal childcare liberates parents, especially women, from an impossible trade-off between childcare and participation in society. When the burden of childcare is shared by society, everyone gains the freedom to work, study, and engage in public life on equal terms. These policies redefine freedom not as the privilege of the few to accumulate without limit, but as the shared capacity of all to live with security, opportunity, and power over their own lives. That is the freedom democracy promises, and the one democratic socialism delivers.</p><p>Among capitalist countries today, the social democracies of the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland) come closest to the ideals of democratic socialism. A much stronger working class, and its insistence on a firm commitment to social welfare over the narrow interests of elites, has long distinguished these nations from other varieties of capitalism. Yet in social democracies, <a href=\"https://fabianpfeffer.com/wp-content/uploads/PfefferWaitkus2021.pdf\">wealth inequality</a> remains strikingly high, despite a more even distribution of income compared to the other parts of the developed world.</p><p>Mamdani’s election as mayor of New York City is a glimmer of hope that democratic processes can still serve the many rather than the few. His equity-centred platform, once dismissed as naive, won the confidence of a diverse majority yearning for justice and dignity. That victory, achieved in the face of relentless racism and Islamophobia, marks a collective triumph.</p><p>Yet elections are only beginnings. The hard work now lies ahead: translating promises into policy and hope into tangible change for a more humane and equal distribution of economic resources. The people have spoken; now it is time to deliver.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

China’s 72-year-old president has dialled back foreign visits, increasingly delegating his top emissary.</p><p>“The US is giving China an opportunity to expand its global influence,” Zhiqun Zhu, professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University, told Al Jazeera. “With the absence of the US, China and EU countries will be the focus of the summit and other countries will look for leadership [from them].”</p><p>But observers say that while Trump’s absence will direct heightened attention to Beijing’s statements and behaviour, it does not spell the end of the US-led order altogether.</p><p>Jing Gu, a political economist at the United Kingdom-based Institute of Development Studies, said the US’s failure to attend “does not automatically make China the new leader, but it creates visible space for China to present itself as a more stable, reliable partner in governance”.</p><p>“It reinforces the perception that the US is stepping back from multilateralism and the shared management of global problems,” she said. “In that context, China can present itself as a more predictable, stable actor and emphasise continuity, support for open trade and engagement with the Global South.”</p><h2 id=\"expanding-influence-in-the-african-continent\">Expanding influence in the African continent</h2><p>This year’s G20 will, for the first time, have an African chair and take place on the African continent. The African Union (AU) will also participate fully as a member.</p><p>South Africa, which holds the G20 presidency, is expected to push for consensus and action on priority issues for African countries, including debt relief, economic growth, climate change and transition to clean energy.</p><p>Zhu, who also serves as editor-in-chief of the academic journal, China and the World, said South Africa’s themes were a “natural fit” for China, Africa’s largest trading partner.</p><p>“China aims to become a leader in green energy, and there’s a lot of room for China and African countries to work on that,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The African continent, with its mineral wealth, booming population and fast-growing economies, offers huge potential for Chinese firms. Li, China’s premier, travelled to Zambia this week, marking the first visit to the country by a Chinese premier in 28 years. The copper-rich nation has Beijing as its largest official creditor for $5.7bn.</p><p>Eager to secure access to Zambia’s commodities and expand its exports from resource-rich East Africa, China signed a $1.4bn deal in September to rehabilitate the Tazara Railway, built in the 1970s and connecting Tanzania and Zambia, to improve rail-sea transportation in the region.</p><p>“The Chinese economy and African economy are complementary; they both benefit from trade,” Zhu said. The G20 “is a great platform for China to project its global influence and seek opportunities to work with other countries”, he added.</p><p>Africa’s growing demand for energy and China’s dominance in manufacturing make the two a good fit, observers say. This is playing out. A report by energy think tank Ember, for instance, found Africa’s imports of solar panels from China rose a whopping 60 percent in the 12 months to June 2025.</p><p>According to Gu at the Institute of Development Studies, China will be looking to tap into this growing synergy with Africa and will deliver a three-fold message at this year’s G20.</p><p>“First, it will stress stability and the importance of global rules and regulations,” she said. Second, “it will link the G20 to the Global South and highlight issues like development and green transformation”.</p><p>Third, “by offering issue-based leadership on topics such as digital economy, artificial intelligence and governance, it will position itself as a problem-solver rather than a disruptor”, the economist added.</p><h2 id=\"china-as-a-bastion-of-multilateralism\">China as a bastion of multilateralism</h2><p>An absence of American officials at this year’s G20 – after <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/chinas-xi-defends-multilateralism-at-apec-after-striking-deal-with-trump\">skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)</a> meeting in Korea as well as the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/cop30-summit-in-brazil-what-to-know-about-the-un-climate-conference\">United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil</a> – would be “another opportunity for China”, Rosemary Foot, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Oxford, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It can contrast, yet again, its declared commitment to multilateralism and responsible behaviour as a major state versus the dangers of a unilateralist America focusing not on public goods but on benefits to itself only.”</p><p>China has been looking to expand its influence in Africa as a counterweight to the US-led world order. In stark contrast to Trump’s decision to end Africa’s duty-free era and slap 15-30 percent tariffs on 22 nations, Xi announced at the APEC summit last month a zero-tariff policy for all African nations with diplomatic ties to Beijing.</p><p>On that occasion, Xi emphasised China’s commitment “to joint development and shared prosperity with all countries”, stressing the country’s goal to “support more developing countries in achieving modernisation and opening up new avenues for global development”.</p><p>Similarly, Li, China’s premier, marked the United Nations’ 80th anniversary at the General Assembly in September by expressing the need for stronger collective action on climate change and emerging technologies, calling for greater solidarity to “[lift] everyone up, while division drags all down”.</p><p>His remarks were in stark contrast to Trump’s, who, in his speech, described climate change as the “<a href=\"/news/2025/9/24/youre-destroying-your-countries-key-moments-from-trumps-un-speech\">greatest con job ever perpetrated</a>” and called renewable sources of energy a “joke” and “pathetic”.</p><p>Foot said the spotlight will now be on Beijing as it seeks to strike a similar conciliatory pose – and in doing so, set itself apart from the US – at the G20. “Whether Beijing will have a major impact on the G20 agenda is more difficult to determine,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Because the painting sold on Thursday comes from a private collection, it is legally eligible for international sale.

She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite.</p><p>Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was altered by a bus accident at 18.</p><p>She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, and then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view painting as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.</p><p>“I’m very proud that she’s one of the most valued women, because really, what woman doesn’t identify with Frida, or what person doesn’t?” her great-niece, Mara Romeo Kahlo, told The Associated Press news agency before the auction.</p><p>“I think everyone carries a little piece of my aunt in their heart.”</p><p>Kahlo resisted being labelled a surrealist painter, a style of art that is dreamlike and centres on a fascination with the unconscious mind.</p><p>“I never painted dreams,” she once said. “I painted my own reality.”</p><p>The new record for Kahlo’s painting came hours after a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/gustav-klimt-portrait-breaks-modern-art-record-with-236m-sale\">Gustav Klimt portrait sold</a> for $236.4m, setting a new record for a modern art piece.</p><p>Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer sold after a 20-minute bidding war, also at Sotheby’s in New York, on Tuesday.</p></div></div></body></html>"
