Brighton game, made a lightning start, taking the lead in the first minute when Joe Gomez set up Ekitike, who thumped the ball past Bart Verbruggen.</p><p>Salah entered the fray about 20 minutes

am there.”</p><p>Salah, third in Liverpool’s all-time scoring charts with 250 goals, has won two Premier League titles and one Champions League crown during his spell on Merseyside.</p><p>He scored 29

Western governments had previously shunned him because of his crushing of dissent and backing for Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p><p>Separately, Ukraine’s prisoner of war coordination centre said it had received 114 prisoners released by Belarus, including Ukrainian citizens accused of working for Ukrainian intelligence and Belarusian political prisoners.</p><p>The centre’s statement said the released captives would receive medical attention, adding that the Belarusian citizens who so wished would subsequently be transported to Poland or Lithuania.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said five Ukrainian citizens were among those freed.</p><p>The US, the European Union and the United Kingdom did not recognise Lukashenko as a legitimate president after the country’s 2020 elections, which were rigged according to the opposition and rights groups. They also imposed sanctions that hobbled the economy and isolated longtime ruler Lukashenko, whose main international supporter remains Putin.</p><p>Speaking from Warsaw, Pavel Slunkin, a former Belarus diplomat, told Al Jazeera that today’s release of prisoners signifies a major improvement in relations between the US and Belarus that was “turning the table on sanctions”.</p><p>“For Lukashenko, it means he starts to renew his international legitimacy … His relations with the West are going to improve,” he said.</p><p>“I expect the US to lift more sanctions … I think Washington will also pressure the European Union to do the same,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya expressed gratitude to Trump and said the fact that Lukashenko had agreed to release prisoners in return for the concessions on potash was proof of the effectiveness of sanctions.</p><p>The opposition has consistently said it sees Trump’s outreach to Lukashenko as a humanitarian effort, but that EU sanctions should stay in place.</p><p>“US sanctions are about people. EU sanctions are about systemic change — stopping the war, enabling democratic transition, and ensuring accountability. These approaches do not contradict each other; they complement each other,”  Tsikhanouskaya said in a statement.</p><p>US officials told the Reuters news agency that engaging with Lukashenko is part of an effort to peel him away from Putin’s influence, at least to a degree – an effort that the Belarus opposition, until now, has viewed with extreme scepticism.</p><p>“The United States stands ready for additional engagement with Belarus that advances US interests and will continue to pursue diplomatic efforts to free remaining political prisoners in Belarus,” the US embassy in Lithuania added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"t-is-a-very-emotional-moment\">‘It is a very emotional moment’</h2><p>It was not immediately clear where many of the group of 123 freed prisoners were heading after their release.</p><p>Officials told the Reuters news agency that nine of the released prisoners left Belarus for Lithuania and 114 were taken to Ukraine.</p><p>Speaking from Vilnius, Lithuania, Anais Marin, former UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus, told Al Jazeera that “it is a very emotional moment”.</p><p>She said that relatives of the political prisoners, journalists and rights groups had not even received any news on many of the prisoners in five years.</p><p>“They had been held incommunicado, which is a very serious human rights violation, where they have no access to their lawyers, no chance to get phone calls from their relatives and even the post was not delivered. So we were just not aware if they were alive still,” she said.</p><p>She added that at least seven political prisoners had died due to the lack of sufficient food and access to healthcare in the prisons.</p><p>Bialiatski, co-winner of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize and a human rights campaigner who fought for years on behalf of political prisoners before becoming one himself, is among the prisoners being taken to Lithuania, according to his wife.</p><p>“I spoke with him, he is travelling to Lithuania, and he is feeling well,” his wife Natalia Pinchuk told the AFP news agency.</p><p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee has expressed its “profound relief and heartfelt joy” after Bialiatski’s release and called on Belarus to release all political prisoners.</p><p>Also freed were Kolesnikova, a leader of mass protests against Lukashenko in 2020, and Viktar Babaryka, who was arrested that year while preparing to run against the president in an election.</p><p>Kolesnikova was among the large group taken by bus to Ukraine.</p><p>“Of course, it’s a feeling of incredible happiness first of all: to see with your eyes the people who are dear to you, to hug them, and understand that now we are all free people. It’s a great joy to see my first free sunset,” she said in a video published by the Ukrainian Telegram channel Khochu Zhit.</p><p>It showed her embracing Viktar Babaryka, an opposition politician arrested in 2020 while preparing to run against Lukashenko in an election. Babaryka said his son Eduard was still in prison in Belarus.</p><p>Tatsiana Khomich, Kolesnikova’s sister, told the Reuters news agency she had spoken to her by phone.</p><p>“She told me she is very happy to be freed, that she is thankful to the USA and Trump for their efforts in leading the process, and to all countries involved.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

As I stood by the side of the road, I felt a small hand tugging at my clothes.</p><p>I looked down and saw a little girl, no older than eight. She was barefoot, her shirt was torn, and her hair was messy and unwashed. Her eyes were beautiful, and her face showed innocence, yet exhaustion and despair clouded it.</p><p>She pleaded: “Please, please, give me just one shekel, God bless you.”</p><p>Before I gave her the money, I decided to speak with her. I knelt down and asked, “What is your name, my dear?”</p><p>She replied in a frightened voice, “My name is Nour, and I am from the north.” Her name, which means “light” in Arabic, stood in stark contrast to the darkness surrounding her.</p><p>I asked her, “Why are you asking for money, Nour?”</p><p>She looked at me hesitantly, then whispered, “I want to buy an apple… I crave one.”</p><p>In Gaza, a single apple now costs $7; before the war, a kilogramme of apples was less than a dollar.</p><p>I tried to ignore the pain rising in my chest. I thought about the circumstances we now face, where young children are forced to beg in the street just to buy an apple.</p><p>I gave Nour one shekel ($0.30), but as soon as I did, the situation worsened. A large group of children, all Nour’s age or younger, gathered around me, repeating the same request. I felt immense distress.</p><p>For more than two years, we have faced genocide. We have witnessed countless tragedies and horrors. But for me, the sight of children begging in the streets is particularly unbearable.</p><p>Before the war, Gaza was still a poor place. We used to see child beggars, but they were few, mostly roaming in a few areas. Now, they are everywhere, from the north to the south.</p><p>The genocidal war has destroyed families and livelihoods across Gaza. The carnage has orphaned more than 39,000 children, and the enormous destruction has deprived more than 80 percent of the workforce of their jobs, driving countless children into extreme poverty and forcing them to beg for survival.</p><p>But child begging is not just a result of poverty; it is a sign of a deep disintegration affecting the family, the education system, and the community. No parent sends their child to beg because they want to. The war has left many families in Gaza without options, and in many cases, there are no surviving parents to keep the children away from the streets.</p><p>Child beggars do not just lose their childhood; they also face exploitation, harsh labour, illiteracy and psychological trauma that leaves a lasting effect.</p><p>The more begging children increase in number, the more the hope for this generation diminishes. Houses can be rebuilt, infrastructure can be restored, but a young generation that is deprived of education and hope for the future cannot be rehabilitated.</p><p>The strength Gaza possessed before the war was not just about military power; it was about human power, the main pillar of which was education. We had one of the highest levels of literacy in the world. The enrolment rate for primary education stood at 95 percent; for higher education, it reached 44 percent.</p><p>Education stood as a counterforce to the debilitating siege that dispossessed the people of Gaza and crippled the economy. It nourished skills and ingenuity within the young generations to help them cope with an increasingly harsh economic reality. More importantly, education gave children a sense of direction, security and pride.</p><p>The systematic attack on Gaza’s education system – the destruction of schools, universities, libraries and the killing of teachers and professors – has pushed what used to be a remarkably resilient and effective educational system to the brink. The pillar that protected children and guaranteed them a clear future is now falling apart.</p><p>After I left the Nuseirat roundabout, Nour’s eyes stayed with me. It was not just because of the pain of seeing an innocent child being forced to beg. It was also because of the realisation that this encounter brought about: That the capacity of the next generation to rebuild Gaza one day is being taken away.</p><p>The world allowed Israel to carry out genocide in Gaza for two years. It knew what was going on, and yet it chose complicity and silence. Today, it cannot erase its guilt, but it can choose to redeem itself. It can take all necessary action to save the children of Gaza and to grant them the rights they are inherently given by the Convention on the Rights of Children: The right to food, water, healthcare, a safe environment, education, and protection from violence and abuse.</p><p>Anything short of that would mean continuing support for the slow genocide of Gaza.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

While terminating protections for Ethiopians who fled documented armed conflict, the administration simultaneously opened a refugee resettlement programme for white South Africans of Afrikaner ethnicity, claiming “race-based discrimination”. That discrimination has been rejected by the South African government and by numbers of Afrikaners themselves.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Scott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, told Al Jazeera the contrast revealed a “perverse honesty” about the administration’s priorities.</p><p>“If you’re white and you’ve got connections you get in,” he said. “If you’re not white, forget about it.”</p><p>Legal challenges have mounted against several TPS terminations, with courts temporarily blocking some decisions.</p><p>Ethiopian TPS beneficiaries can continue working during the 60-day transition period, but after the deadline, anyone without an alternative legal status becomes subject to immediate arrest and removal.</p><p>The administration has offered what it calls a “complimentary plane ticket” and “$1,000 exit bonus” to those who depart voluntarily using a mobile app to report their departure.</p></div></div></body></html>"
