Settlers have been rampaging with impunity, attacking and killing Palestinian civilians and burning their properties and olive groves.</p>\n<p>According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), at least 948 Palestinians have been killed in the territory by Israeli soldiers since October 7, 2023. Of that figure, at least 204 are children.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, from the beginning of 2024 until the end of June 2025, more than 2,200 Israeli settler attacks were <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/palestinian-child-shot-dead-in-west-bank-by-israeli-forces-amid-land-grabs\">reported</a>, resulting in more than 5,200 Palestinian injuries, according to OCHA figures. In that same period, nearly 36,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced across the occupied West Bank due to Israeli military operations, settler violence or home demolitions carried out by the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>The Israeli settler violence in the occupied West Bank is part of the Israeli government’s strategy for preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state, according to Amjad Abu El Ezz, a lecturer of international relations at the Arab American University.</p>\n<p>The increased number of killings, and the destruction of Palestinian homes and vehicles by Israeli settlers in coordination with the Israeli army, aim to encourage Palestinians to leave their land, Abu El Ezz told Al Jazeera from Ramallah.</p>\n<p>Israel is weakening the governing Palestinian Authority, “making Palestinian lives impossible”, while at the same time “building Israeli facts on the ground” to prevent the Palestinians from building their own state, he added.</p>\n<p>“We are talking about more than 700,000 Israeli settlers. They have weapons, they are acting as an army in parallel to the Israeli army,” Abu El Ezz said.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Israel’s parliament approved a symbolic measure calling for the annexation of the occupied West Bank.</p>\n<p>Knesset lawmakers <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/israeli-parliament-approves-symbolic-motion-on-west-bank-annexation\">voted</a> 71-13 in favour of the motion on Wednesday, a non-binding vote which calls for “applying Israeli sovereignty to Judea, Samaria and the Jordan Valley” – the Israeli terms for the area.</p>\n<p>The motion, advanced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, is declarative and has no direct legal implications, though it could place the issue of annexation on the agenda of future debates in the parliament.</p>\n<p>The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement has called the Israeli parliament’s non-binding vote on the annexation of the occupied West Bank a “dangerous escalation”.</p>\n<p>In a statement on Telegram, the group said the move was a “clear disregard for the international community” and a way for Israel to implement “its criminal plans targeting the land of Palestine and its people”.</p>\n<p>The West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, has been under Israeli occupation since 1967. Since then, Israeli settlements have expanded exponentially, despite being illegal under international law and, in the case of settlement outposts, Israeli law.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"42\" data-end=\"471\">Before this catastrophe began, I was living the happiest days of my life, surrounded by the warmth of my family, the affection of my friends, and dreams that felt within reach. I spent most of 2023 preparing for my graduation and getting ready to move from lecture halls to practical training fields, rotating between the laboratories of the Islamic University in Gaza and the eye hospitals spread across the Gaza Strip.</p>\n<p data-start=\"473\" data-end=\"1043\">On the evening of October 6, I was organising my books, tools and white coat, getting ready for a long training day at Al-Nasr Eye Hospital in Gaza. My feelings were a mix of excitement and nervousness, but I had no idea that night would mark the end of my peaceful life. At 6am the next morning, October 7, it wasn’t the sound of my alarm that woke me, but the sound of rockets. I opened my eyes, wondering, “Is this a dream or a nightmare?” But the truth was impossible to deny. A war had begun, turning our once-bright lives into a never-ending nightmare.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1045\" data-end=\"1497\">On October 8, I received the devastating news that my university had been destroyed – its laboratories, its classrooms and every place where I had learned how to help patients. Even the graduation hall, where I had pictured myself celebrating at the end of the year, had turned to rubble. I felt a sharp pain in my chest, as if a part of my soul had collapsed. Everything fell apart so suddenly. Overnight, all that I had dreamed of was reduced to ashes.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1499\" data-end=\"1760\">On December 27, 2023, the bombing in our neighbourhood intensified, and we were forced to leave our home and flee to the so-called humanitarian zones in Rafah. There, we took shelter in one of the hundreds of tents that had become the only refuge for survivors.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1762\" data-end=\"2216\">There was one thing I still held on to: my knowledge and modest experience in the field of eye care. I began to notice children and women suffering from persistent eye infections, caused by inhaling smoke and dust and constant exposure to dirt. Even I developed an infection in my own eyes. I looked at them, then at myself, and I knew I couldn’t just stand by and watch. I wanted to be a reason someone healed, a reason the light returned to their eyes.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2218\" data-end=\"2610\">In December 2024, I volunteered at Al-Razi Health Center, working in the eye clinic under the supervision of a remarkably compassionate doctor. At first, I was afraid and hesitant. The war had taken a toll on my memory and shaken my confidence. But the doctor told me words I will never forget: “You are hardworking. You’ll remember everything. And you will become a tool for healing others.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"2612\" data-end=\"2808\">Patients started arriving from everywhere: north, central and southern Gaza. The clinic wasn’t equipped for such numbers, but we did everything we could. I witnessed cases I had never seen before:</p>\n<p data-start=\"2810\" data-end=\"3111\">A four-year-old girl lost her vision completely due to severe corneal burns caused by an explosion near her home. She screamed in pain. She was far too young to endure such suffering. Despite the lack of resources, she underwent surgery to remove her damaged eye and replace it with an artificial one.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3113\" data-end=\"3423\">A man in his late 30s was struck by shrapnel in the face and suffered skull fractures. He had a torn upper eyelid and a deep corneal injury. He needed delicate surgery, but it was postponed multiple times because it required repeated general anaesthesia, which was impossible under the current conditions.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3425\" data-end=\"3697\">A young woman in her 20s had taken a direct hit that caused an orbital fracture and muscle tears around the eye, leading to hypotropia and facial asymmetry. She broke down emotionally at every visit. As a young woman like her, I felt her wound as if it were my own.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3699\" data-end=\"4118\">There was also an elderly man suffering from eye cancer. The disease was eating away at his eye, and there was a strong possibility it would spread to the other one. But we couldn’t help him. Resources were unavailable, and he couldn’t travel for treatment due to the closure of the borders. At every visit, I did my best to lift his spirits, hoping that maybe, just maybe, I could ease his pain, even if only a little.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4120\" data-end=\"4315\">Most children were suffering from chronic conjunctivitis and the appearance of chalazion (fatty cysts on the eyelid), due to dust, touching their eyes with their hands, and a lack of hygiene in the camps.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4317\" data-end=\"4606\">The elderly, most of whom suffered from cataracts, a condition that leads to gradual loss of vision, needed lens removal surgery and intraocular lens implantation, but all such operations were postponed due to the disruption of communication with northern Gaza, the only place in the Strip where the necessary equipment was available.</p>\n<p data-start=\"4608\" data-end=\"5056\">During those months, the operating rooms turned into real teaching labs for me after the occupation destroyed the university’s lab. I accompanied the doctor to every surgery, performing them by the light of hope and the sounds of bombing. One time, a rocket hit a house next to the centre while we were inside the operating room. Despite the panic, we held ourselves together. We didn’t break down. Instead, we completed the operation successfully.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5058\" data-end=\"5285\">In the few moments of spare time, there wasn’t only room to talk about medicine. We spoke about the pain, about our lost homes, about our missing relatives, about postponed dreams. The war spoke from every corner of the clinic.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5287\" data-end=\"5540\">We faced severe difficulties due to the shortage of medicines. We had to prescribe alternatives whose side effects we didn’t fully know, but what else could we do? There was no other choice. The crossings were closed, and the medicines were unavailable.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5542\" data-end=\"5821\">One day, during a surgery, I felt dizzy and had severe chest pain. I couldn’t bear it, and fainted from extreme exhaustion, malnutrition and psychological pressure. I was just a person trying to hold on. But I didn’t give up. I returned the same day to continue my work at the clinic.</p>\n<p data-start=\"5823\" data-end=\"6312\">In January 2025, with the announcement of a temporary ceasefire, the university resumed sessions at the European Hospital. I went only four times. The road was long, and the place was desolate, filled with the remnants of war. Just one kilometre (two-thirds of a mile) from the clinic’s window, tanks were stationed. I wondered: Should I flee or stay? The ceasefire was no guarantee. Indeed, days didn’t pass before the war returned and the sessions were cancelled, after the occupation took control of the area.</p>\n<p data-start=\"6314\" data-end=\"6340\">We returned to square one.</p>\n<p data-start=\"6342\" data-end=\"6679\">I am still here, moving between health centres, healing, listening and trying to bring light back into people’s lives, literally. My purpose is not forgotten. My spirit is not broken. I was made to help. And I will continue, even through smoke and rubble, with steady hands and an unshakable heart, until the light returns for all of us.</p>\n<p data-start=\"6342\" data-end=\"6679\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Brussels says China’s deepening political and economic relations with Russia since the 2022 invasion represent tacit support for Moscow that has helped its economy weather sweeping Western sanctions.</p>\n<p>Meeting Xi on Thursday, Costa urged China to “use its influence” to help end Russia’s “war of aggression”.</p>\n<p>Last week, the bloc adopted a new package of sanctions on Russia – including on two Chinese banks, leading Beijing’s commerce minister to issue “solemn representations” to his EU counterpart.</p>\n<p>“This is a core issue for Europe,” the senior EU official said.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"joint-statement-on-climate\">Joint statement on Climate</h2>\n<p>While expectations for any concrete deals were low heading into the summit, Brussels and Beijing have signed an agreement on climate change and carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>According to the joint statement, China and the EU have agreed to uphold the goals of Paris agreement and enhance “bilateral cooperation” in areas such as  “energy transition, adaptation, methane emissions management and control, carbon markets and green and low-carbon technologies.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-this-summit-mean-for-the-us\">What does this Summit mean for the US?</h2>\n<p>Chinese state media and officials have billed the EU-China summit as a chance for Beijing and the EU to normalise relations at a time of global uncertainty, stirred by United States President Donald Trump and others.</p>\n<p>The EU is likely to seal a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/eu-and-us-edge-closer-to-trade-deal-as-tariff-deadline-looms\">trade deal</a> with the US for a broad tariff of 15 percent on its exports after intense negotiations, avoiding a harsher 30 percent figure threatened by Trump.</p>\n<p>China and the US are also negotiating trade after the two sides agreed to slash tit-for-tat heavy tariffs for 90 days in May. That suspension expires on August 12. In June, the US said it would impose 55 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, down from the 145 percent Trump had imposed in April. In return, Beijing said, it will impose a 10 percent tariff on goods it imports from the US, down from 125 percent.</p>\n<p>Gunnar Wiegand, the former managing director for Asia and the Pacific at the European External Action Service (EEAS) and currently a distinguished fellow at the Indo-Pacific Program of the German Marshall Fund’s Brussels Office, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/eu-china-summit-who-is-attending-and-whats-on-the-agenda\">told</a> Al Jazeera that Europe’s economic relationship with the US is stronger than that with China since they are also NATO allies.</p>\n<p>“With Russia’s war in Ukraine threatening Europe, Brussels will not be pushed closer to Beijing,” he said.</p>\n<p>“But as Brussels negotiates tariffs with Washington, certainly there will be an important China dimension in the finalisation of a deal with the US administration.”</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

My sister’s son, Ezz Aldin, was born on December 25, 2023 – in the early months of the war.</p>\n<p>One morning, Tasneem walked into our space carrying them in her arms. I looked at her and asked the question that wouldn’t leave my mind: “Tasneem, do Noor and Ezz Aldin understand hunger? Do they know we’re in a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/16/what-is-famine-and-why-is-gaza-at-risk-of-reaching-it-soon\">famine</a>?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said immediately. “Even Ezz, who’s only known war and ruins, understands. He’s never seen real food in his life. He doesn’t know what ‘options’ are. The only thing he ever asks for is bread.”</p>\n<p>She imitated his baby voice: “Obz! Obza! Obza!” – his way of saying “khobza” (a piece of bread).</p>\n<p>She had to tell him, “There’s no flour, darling. Your dad went out to look for some.”</p>\n<p>Ezz Aldin doesn’t know about ceasefires, borders, or politics. He doesn’t care about military operations or diplomatic statements.</p>\n<p>He just wants one small piece of bread. And the world gives him nothing.</p>\n<p>Noor has learned to count and recite the alphabet from her mother. Before the war, she loved chocolate, biscuits. She was the first grandchild in our family, showered with toys, snacks, and little dresses.</p>\n<p>Now, every morning, she wakes up and turns to her mother with wide, excited eyes. “Go buy me 15 chocolates and biscuits,” she says.</p>\n<p>She says 15 because it’s the biggest number she knows.

A man mourned over the shrouded bodies of seven of his family. In despair, he cried, “We’re hungry.”</p>\n<p>They had been starving for days, then an Israeli surveillance drone struck their tent near al-Tabin School in Daraj, northern Gaza.</p>\n<p>“This is the young man I was raising,” the man in the video wept.  “Look what became of them,” as he touched their heads one last time.</p>\n<p>Some people still don’t understand. This isn’t about whether we have money. It’s about the <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/more-than-100-ngos-warn-israels-forced-mass-starvation-stalks-all-gaza\">total absence of food</a>. Even if you’re a millionaire in Gaza right now, you won’t find bread. You won’t find a bag of rice or a can of milk. Markets are empty. Shops are destroyed. Malls have been flattened. The shelves are not bare – they are gone.</p>\n<p>We used to grow our own food. Gaza once exported fruits and vegetables; we sent strawberries to Europe. Our prices were the cheapest in the region.</p>\n<p>A kilo (2.2 pounds) of grapes or apples? Three shekels ($0.90). A kilo of chicken from Gaza’s farms? Nine shekels ($2.70). Now, we can’t find a single egg.</p>\n<p>Before: A massive watermelon from Khan Younis weighed 21 kilos (46 pounds) and cost 18 shekels ($5). Today: The same watermelon would cost $250 – if you can find it.</p>\n<p>Avocados, once considered a luxury fruit, were grown by the tonne in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis and Rafah. They used to cost a dollar a kilo. We had self-sufficiency in dairy, too – cheeses and yoghurts made in Shujayea by local hands.</p>\n<p>Our children were not spoiled – they just had basic rights. Breakfast meant milk. A sandwich with cheese. A boiled egg. Now, everything is cut off.</p>\n<p>And no matter how I explain it to the children, they cannot grasp the words “famine” or “price hike”. They just know their bellies are empty.</p>\n<p>Even seafood – once a staple of Gaza’s diet – has disappeared. Despite strict fishing restrictions, we used to send fish to the West Bank. Now, even our sea is silent.</p>\n<p>And with all due respect to Turkish coffee, you haven’t tasted coffee until you’ve tried Mazaj Coffee from Gaza.</p>\n<p>It had a strength you could feel in your bones.</p>\n<p>This is not a forecast. Famine is now. Most of us are displaced. Unemployed. Mourning.</p>\n<p>If we manage one meal a day, we eat it at night. It’s not a feast. It’s rice. Pasta. Maybe soup. Canned beans.</p>\n<p>Things you keep as backup in your pantries. Here, they are luxury.</p>\n<p>Most days, we drink water and nothing more. When hunger becomes too much, we scroll through old photos, pictures of meals from the past, just to remember what life once tasted like.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"starving-while-taking-exams\">Starving while taking exams</h2>\n<p>As always, our university exams are online, because the campus is rubble.</p>\n<p>We are living a genocide. And yet, we are trying to study.</p>\n<p>I’m a second-year student.</p>\n<p>We just finished our final exams for the first semester. We studied surrounded by hunger, by drones, by constant fear. This isn’t what people think university is.</p>\n<p>We took exams on empty stomachs, under the scream of warplanes.  We tried to remember dates while forgetting the last time we tasted bread.</p>\n<p>Every day, I talk with my friends – Huda, Mariam, and Esraa – on WhatsApp. We check on each other, asking the same questions over and over:</p>\n<p>“What did you eat today?”</p>\n<p>“Can you even concentrate?”</p>\n<p>These are our conversations – not about lectures or assignments, but about hunger, headaches, dizziness, and how we’re still standing. One says, “My stomach hurts too much to think.” Another says, “I nearly collapsed when I stood up.”</p>\n<p>And still, we keep going. Our last exam was on July 15. We held on, not because we were strong, but because we had no choice. We didn’t want to lose a semester. But even saying that feels so small compared to the truth.</p>\n<p>Studying while starving chips away at your soul.</p>\n<p>One day, during exams, an air strike hit our neighbours. The explosion shook the walls.</p>\n<p>A moment before, I was thinking about how hungry I felt. A moment after, I felt nothing.</p>\n<p>I didn’t run.</p>\n<p>I stayed at my desk and kept studying. Not because I was OK, but because there is no other choice.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"they-starve-us-then-blame-us\">They starve us, then blame us</h2>\n<p>Let me be clear: The people of Gaza are being starved on purpose. We are not unlucky – we are victims of war crimes.</p>\n<p>Open the crossings. Let aid enter. Let food enter. Let medicine enter.</p>\n<p>Gaza doesn’t need sympathy. We can rebuild. We can recover. But first, stop starving us.</p>\n<p>Killing, starving, and besieging are not just conditions – they are actions forced upon us. Language reveals those who try to hide who is responsible.</p>\n<p>So we will keep saying: We were killed by the Israeli occupation. We were starved by the Israeli occupation. We were besieged by the Israeli occupation.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Well, this is a core issue for Europe. It’s an issue fundamental to European security,” the official added.</p>\n<p>In an address to the European Parliament earlier this month, von der Leyen also accused China of “de facto enabling Russia’s war economy”.</p>\n<p>Brussels has <a href=\"/news/2024/2/29/why-has-the-eu-sanctioned-indian-chinese-companies-for-russia-links\">sanctioned several Chinese companies</a> for facilitating the supply of goods which are used for weapons production in Russia, and on July 18, the EU also slapped sanctions on Chinese banks for the first time, for reportedly financing the supply of such goods.</p>\n<p>China has rejected such accusations and warned of retaliations. Beijing has also reiterated that its position on the Ukraine war is all about “negotiation, ceasefire and peace”.</p>\n<p>But according to an article by the South China Morning Post, during a meeting with the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, in early July, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing did not want to see Russia lose the war in Ukraine, since the United States would then focus on China.</p>\n<p>Wiegand said Europe should have no illusions.</p>\n<p>“For China, having good and close relations with Russia is of utmost importance to increase its own strength in the global context. They will not sacrifice this relationship,” he said.</p>\n<p>“This is the most important negative factor which has impacted the overall [EU-China] relationship,” he added.</p>\n<p>Besides the Ukraine war, EU officials in Brussels said, the 27-member bloc will also discuss tensions in the Middle East and other security threats in Asia.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-difficult-will-trade-discussions-be\">How difficult will trade discussions be?</h2>\n<p>Another contentious issue between Brussels and Beijing is <a href=\"/news/2025/7/2/eu-presses-china-on-rare-earth-elements-and-ukraine-war\">trade</a>. This is likely to be central to the summit’s agenda in the afternoon with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, followed by a dinner, EU officials involved in planning the summit told reporters in Brussels on July 18.</p>\n<p>China is the EU’s third-largest trading partner, but the two have recently been squabbling over a series of trade issues, including 45 percent European tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and Beijing’s control of rare earth minerals, which are vital for chip making and producing medical devices.</p>\n<p>In her speech at the European Parliament earlier this month, von der Leyen accused Beijing of “flooding global markets with subsidised overcapacity – not just to boost its own industries, but to choke international competition”.</p>\n<p>The EU has a trade deficit with China of more than 300 billion euros ($352bn) as of 2024. EU exports to China amounted to 213 billion euros ($250bn), while EU imports from China amounted to 519 billion euros ($609bn), according to figures from the European Commission.</p>\n<p>EU officials say Chinese companies are benefitting from massive government subsidies and, due to sluggish demand for goods locally, cheap Chinese goods like EVs are being shipped to the EU instead.</p>\n<p>To protect European interests, Brussels has begun taking action and imposed tariffs of up to 45 percent on Chinese EVs last October. The bloc also barred Chinese companies from medical devices tenders in June, among other trade barriers, after concluding that European firms were not being granted access to Chinese markets.</p>\n<p>The EU is also concerned about Beijing’s export controls on rare earth minerals.</p>\n<p>At the Group of Seven summit in Canada in June, von der Leyen accused China of “blackmail” and said, “No single country should control 80-90 percent of the market for essential raw materials and downstream products like magnets.”</p>\n<p>“The present situation is not sustainable. We need rebalancing … China benefits from our open market but buys too little,” a senior EU official told reporters in Brussels before the summit. “Trade access is limited and export controls are excessive. We will go there [to Beijing] with a positive and constructive attitude … but China has to acknowledge our concerns.”</p>\n<p>In her speech at the European Parliament in July, the European Commission president said the 27-member bloc is “engaging with Beijing so that it loosens its export restrictions” on rare earth minerals.</p>\n<p>Wiegand said while trade negotiations have been ongoing, achieving common ground or any trade deal at the summit this week looks unlikely.</p>\n<p>“There is a constructive tone [from the EU] when it comes to ‘de-risking’, not ‘de-coupling’ from China. The Chinese, however, don’t like the term ‘de-risking’. They think it is disinformation. But it is simply the process of reducing trade vulnerabilities by diversifying and improving our own capacities,” he said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-china-view-trading-relations-with-the-eu\">How does China view trading relations with the EU?</h2>\n<p>China wants the EU to view their trading partnership “without emotion and prejudice”, according to the Foreign Ministry.</p>\n<p>He Yongqian, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, told a news conference in Beijing on Monday that China hopes that Brussels will also “be less protectionist, and be more open”.</p>\n<p>In an email statement to Al Jazeera before the forum, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU (CCCEU) said it hopes the summit will “address critical challenges, including market and investment barriers faced by Chinese companies in the EU”.</p>\n<p>“Recent EU measures, such as the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) and International Procurement Instrument (IPI), have disproportionately impacted Chinese firms in clean tech, high-tech, and medical devices. We urge constructive dialogue to ensure fair treatment,” CCCEU noted.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"will-human-rights-be-discussed-at-the-summit\">Will human rights be discussed at the summit?</h2>\n<p>EU-China relations have also been icy over human rights issues. In 2021, Brussels slapped sanctions on Chinese officials over reported human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in China’s <a href=\"/opinions/2023/9/12/chinas-beautiful-xinjiang-continues-to-oppress-uighurs\">Xinjiang</a> region.</p>\n<p>Beijing denied these allegations and retaliated by sanctioning EU lawmakers. The tit-for-tat sanctions were accompanied by a halt in bilateral dialogues between the European Parliament and the National People’s Congress (NPC) of China.</p>\n<p>Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s China director, told Al Jazeera that on the 50th anniversary of EU-China diplomatic relations, there is “little to celebrate” when it comes to talking about human rights in China in 2025.</p>\n<p>“Amnesty International has regularly documented serious and widespread human rights violations, from arbitrary detention and persecution in the Uighur region, for which no official has been held to account; to assaults on the rule of law and the chipping away of civil and political freedoms in Hong Kong, despite international treaties guaranteeing those rights; to the systematic use of national security legislation to target rights defence and criticism, at home and increasingly abroad. The EU, at least on paper, has also come to similar conclusions,” she said.</p>\n<p>“At the summit, the EU’s leadership needs to ensure that those words become action and use every tool at their disposal to create positive human rights change for people – not more empty promises at the negotiating table or the speaker’s podium,” she added.</p>\n<p>While China lifted some of its sanctions in April this year and hinted at resuming political dialogues between the European Parliament and the NPC, the 2021 EU sanctions remain in place. The bloc said last week that it had “not observed changes in the human rights situation in China/Xinjiang”.</p>\n<p>“Promoting and protecting human rights is important to the EU. We will raise the EU’s concern on the deterioration of rights in Xinjiang, Tibet, and other regions,” an EU official said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"will-the-issue-of-us-tariffs-arise\">Will the issue of US tariffs arise?</h2>\n<p>The meeting between the EU and China comes amid US President Donald <a href=\"/economy/2025/5/13/why-did-the-us-and-china-slash-tariffs-and-whats-next\">Trump’s global tariff war</a>, which both Brussels and Beijing are trying to navigate.</p>\n<p>Trump has announced imposing a tariff of 30 percent on goods EU imports from August 1, and Brussels has been holding trade negotiations with Washington, seeking to strike a trade deal.</p>\n<p>China and the US agreed to slash tit-for-tat heavy tariffs for 90 days in May. That suspension expires on August 12. In June, the US said it would impose 55 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, down from the 145 percent Trump had imposed in April. In return, Beijing said, it will impose a 10 percent tariff on goods it imports from the US, down from 125 percent. But trade negotiations are ongoing.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, some analysts in Brussels hinted that tariff tensions with Washington could improve Brussels-Beijing trade ties.</p>\n<p>The CCCEU also told Al Jazeera that with US tariffs looming, “China and the EU share a responsibility to uphold free trade and multilateralism while mitigating external pressures” and pushed Brussels to improve its business environment for foreign companies and enhance supply chains.</p>\n<p>But in the run-up to the summit, expectations remain low.</p>\n<p>“It is quite clear the US tariff issue is an over-encompassing issue … we are negotiating with the US at present. It is clear that there is a need to find and engage with other actors worldwide due to the impact of US tariffs,” a senior EU official told reporters in Brussels before the summit.</p>\n<p>“But with China, we are certainly not agreeing to compromise on our values,” the official stressed.</p>\n<p>Wiegand also pointed out that Europe’s economic relationship with the US is stronger than that with China since they are also NATO allies.</p>\n<p>“With Russia’s war in Ukraine threatening Europe, Brussels will not be pushed closer to Beijing,” he said.</p>\n<p>“But as Brussels negotiates tariffs with Washington, certainly there will be an important China dimension in the finalisation of a deal with the US administration.”</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Still, his release has been once again delayed for a period of 30 days, at the request of Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, who fear he could be deported.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously on Wednesday, a second court hearing was unfolding in Maryland under US District Judge Paula Xinis.</p>\n<p>She has been hearing arguments about Abrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to El Salvador, as part of a lawsuit filed by his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura.</p>\n<p>Given that Trump officials have signalled they plan to deport Abrego Garcia if he is released, Xinis issued a ruling requiring that immigration officials to give him notice of three business days if they initiate removal proceedings.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration, Xinis wrote, has “done little to assure the court that, absent intervention, Abrego Garcia’s due process rights will be protected”.</p>\n<p>Xinis also ordered the government to restore the legal status that Abrego Garcia had previously been under, which allowed him to live and work in Maryland.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of an immigration judge’s 2019 order barring him from being sent back to his home country.</p>\n<p>His lawyers have maintained that Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador as a teenager to avoid gang threats.</p>\n<p>The government acknowledged that Abrego Garcia’s removal to El Salvador had been the result of an “administrative error”.</p>\n<p>Judge Xinis — and later the US Supreme Court — ultimately ruled that the Trump administration had a responsibility to “facilitate” his return to the US.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration doubled down, arguing that Abrego Garcia’s removal was lawful and painting him as a member of MS-13.</p>\n<p>Trump even posted a picture of himself to social media holding a photo of Abrego Garcia’s knuckles, with the letters and numbers for “MS-13” digitally superimposed on each finger, next to real tattoos of a smiley face and marijuana leaf.</p>\n<p>“He’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114361211919694573\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, falsely, on April 18.</p>\n<p>Judge Xinis had threatened to find the Trump administration in contempt of court for failing to adequately facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release, or provide meaningful updates. Officials had argued that they had little power to bring him back, given that he was held in El Salvador.</p>\n<p>But in early June, the Trump administration abruptly announced Abrego Garcia’s return to the US. At the same time, the Justice Department revealed it had obtained an indictment to criminally charge Abrego Garcia.</p>\n<p>At the centre of the government’s case is a video from a November 2022 traffic stop, showing Abrego Garcia driving a Chevrolet Suburban SUV with three rows of seats. A police officer heard in the footage speculates that the nine passengers could be involved in human smuggling, but no charges were brought at that time.</p>\n<p>His lawyers have dismissed the government’s case as “preposterous”.</p>\n<p>Still, before Xinis’s ruling, the lawyers had requested Abrego Garcia remain in custody as he awaits trial, for fear that he might be immediately deported if released.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>While Abrego Garcia cannot be sent to El Salvador again, the Trump administration has maintained he can be legally deported to a third country, even one where he has no personal ties.</p>\n<p>Last month, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could, at least in the short term, continue to deport individuals to such <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/supreme-court-lets-trump-restart-deporting-migrants-to-third-countries\">third-party countries</a> while legal challenges proceed against the practice.</p>\n<p>Some of those third-party countries have included <a href=\"/news/2025/7/5/trump-administration-completes-contentious-deportations-to-south-sudan\">South Sudan</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/us-deports-immigrants-to-african-country-of-eswatini-amid-rights-concerns\">Eswatini</a>, formerly known as Swaziland, both of which have faced accusations of human rights abuses in their prisons.</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security took to the social media platform X on Wednesday to criticise Xinis’s latest ruling.</p>\n<p>“The fact this unhinged judge is trying to tell ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] they can’t arrest an MS-13 gang member, indicted by a grand jury for human trafficking, and subject to immigration arrest under federal law is LAWLESS AND INSANE,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin <a href=\"https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1948104840896266500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, reiterating unproven claims.</p>\n<p>Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, however, applauded Wednesday’s court decisions.</p>\n<p>“These rulings are a powerful rebuke of the government’s lawless conduct and a critical safeguard for Kilmar’s due process rights,” lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

A 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent known as Humphrey’s Executor holds that the president cannot fire members of an independent board without providing a legitimate justification.</p>\n<p>The commission members also said that their firing would deprive the public of vital expertise and oversight.</p>\n<p>The Department of Justice, however, has maintained that preventing the president from firing members of the executive branch undercuts his constitutional authority.</p>\n<p>Even independent agencies like the Consumer Product Safety Commission fall under the executive branch, the Justice Department pointed out.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration’s argument was dealt a defeat on July 2, when US District Judge Matthew Maddox issued an order blocking the dismissal of the three Democratic appointees while their case proceeded.</p>\n<p>But Trump’s Justice Department made an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, whose conservative majority sided with the president in a brief, unsigned order.</p>\n<p>The majority wrote that the government risked greater harm by allowing fired employees to remain in the executive branch than by removing them, even wrongfully, while their court cases proceeded.</p>\n<p>The court’s three left-leaning justices, however, issued a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a11_2cp3.pdf#page=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dissent</a> that denounced the ruling as an erosion of the separation of powers. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that the Consumer Product Safety Commission was created by an act of Congress and answers both to the legislature and the president.</p>\n<p>“By allowing the President to remove Commissioners for no reason other than their party affiliation, the majority has negated Congress’s choice of agency bipartisanship and independence,” Kagan wrote.</p>\n<p>She added that the court’s decision on Wednesday was part of a series of rulings that amounted to “an increase of executive power at the expense of legislative authority”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has sought to exercise greater control over federal agencies created and funded by Congress, often using a maximalist interpretation of presidential powers to do so. The Supreme Court, which has six conservative members, has mostly <a href=\"/news/2025/6/27/explosive-us-supreme-court-deals-blow-to-those-challenging-trumps-power\">ruled in favour</a> of such efforts.</p>\n<p>In a similar case in May, the court allowed Trump to remove Democratic members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board as their cases moved forward.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court also ruled earlier this month that the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out the Department of Education through a campaign of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/14/us-supreme-court-gives-nod-to-trumps-push-to-gut-federal-education-agency\">mass firings</a> could move forward.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
