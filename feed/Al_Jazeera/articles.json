You have 20 days to get out.'”</p><p>Trump said, without providing evidence, that he believed that the banks’ refusal to take his deposits indicated that the administration of former US President Joe Biden had encouraged banking regulators to “destroy Trump”.</p><p>Trump said he subsequently tried to deposit funds with Bank of America and was also refused, and eventually split the cash among a number of smaller banks.</p><p>“The banks discriminated against me very badly,” he said.</p><p>In a statement, JPMorgan did not address the president’s specific claim that it had discriminated against him.</p><p>“We don’t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,” JPMorgan said. “We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.”</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Bank of America declined to comment.</p><h2 id=\"reputational-risk\">‘Reputational risk’</h2><p>During Biden’s administration, regulators could have asked the banks why they were providing banking services to Trump because of the “reputational risk” issue, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters news agency.</p><p>Another source said that banks were under intense scrutiny and pressure with regards to what qualified as a reputational risk for banks and they needed to be careful due to Trump’s legal entanglements.</p><p>The source also added that at present, JPMorgan continues to have a banking relationship with members of the Trump family that dates back years, and that the bank also handles a number of campaign accounts related to Trump.</p><p>After Trump took power, the Federal Reserve announced in June that it was directing its supervisors to no longer consider “reputational risk” when examining banks, scrapping a metric that had been a focus of industry complaints.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported late on Monday that the expected executive order would instruct regulators to investigate whether any financial institutions breach the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws or consumer financial protection laws by dropping customers for political reasons.</p><p>It said the order could be signed as early as this week, authorising monetary penalties, consent decrees or other disciplinary measures against violators.</p><p>The White House had no immediate comment on the reported order.</p><p>Trump in January said the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America denied services to conservatives. At the time, the two banks denied making banking decisions based on politics.</p><p>“This seems to be rhetoric that will likely be forgotten by lunchtime,” said David Wagner, head of equities at Aptus Capital Advisors. “I don’t see any material impact on banks, as there are many other drivers that will ultimately presage performance for banks, such as deregulation.”</p><p>Both banks’ stocks are taking a hit on Wall Street.

For example, his “One Big Beautiful Bill”, which was signed into law in July, earmarked $45bn for immigration detention centres, many of which will be run by private contractors.</p><p>An additional $4.1bn in the law is devoted to hiring and training more officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), with another $2.1bn set aside for bonuses.</p><p>But the Trump administration has made expelling migrants from the country a top priority, prompting legal challenges and backlash to the rapid pace of such deportations.</p><p>Critics say deported migrants have been denied their right to due process, with little to no time allotted to challenge their removals.</p><p>Then, there are the cases where undocumented migrants have been deported to “third-party countries” where they may not even speak the language.</p><p>Within weeks of taking office in January, Trump began deporting citizens of countries like India, China, Iran and Afghanistan to places like Panama, where migrants were imprisoned in a hotel and later a detention camp.</p><p>Trump also accused <a href=\"/news/2025/3/16/venezuelan-immigrants-deported-to-el-salvador-despite-us-court-ban\">more than 200 men</a>, many of them Venezuelan, of being gang members in order to authorise their expedited removal to El Salvador in March. Lawyers have since cast doubt on Trump’s allegations, arguing that many of their clients were deemed to be gang members based on little more than their tattoos and fashion choices.</p><p>El Salvador reportedly received $6m as part of a deal to hold the men in a maximum security prison, the Terrorism Confinement Centre or CECOT, where <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/venezuela-to-probe-el-salvadors-bukele-for-torture-of-us-deportees\">human rights abuses</a> have been documented.</p><p>The men were ultimately released last month as part of a <a href=\"/news/2025/4/21/el-salvadors-bukele-suggests-prisoner-swap-for-venezuelans-deported-by-us\">prisoner exchange</a> with Venezuela, but a federal court in the US <a href=\"/news/2025/4/17/us-judge-says-probable-cause-to-hold-trump-administration-in-contempt\">continues to weigh</a> whether the Trump administration violated a judge’s order by allowing the deportation flights to leave in the first place.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"deportations-to-africa\">Deportations to Africa</h2><p>In May, the Trump administration unveiled efforts to start “third-party” deportations to countries in Africa as well, sparking further concerns about human rights.</p><p>Initially, Libya was floated as a destination, and migrants were reportedly loaded onto a flight that was prepared to take off when a judge blocked its departure on due process grounds.</p><p>The Libyan government later denied reports that it was willing to accept deported, non-citizen migrants from the US.</p><p>But the Trump administration proceeded later that month to send eight migrants on a flight <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/migrants-in-us-detention-lose-appeal-against-deportation-to-south-sudan\">to South Sudan</a>, a country the US State Department deems too dangerous for Americans to travel to.</p><p>That flight was ultimately diverted to Djibouti, after a judge in Massachusetts ruled that the eight men on board were not given an adequate opportunity to challenge their removals.</p><p>Seven of them hailed from Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, Mexico and Myanmar. Only one was reportedly from South Sudan.</p><p>The Trump administration said all eight had criminal records, calling them <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/07/03/dhs-releases-statement-scotus-victory-criminal-illegal-alien-deportations-south\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“sickos” and “barbaric”</a>. A spokesperson pledged to have them in South Sudan by the US Independence Day holiday on July 4.</p><p>The US Supreme Court paved the way for that to happen in late June, when it issued a brief, unsigned order allowing the deportation to South Sudan to proceed. The six conservative members of the bench sided with the Trump administration, while the three left-leaning justices issued a vehement dissent.</p><p>They argued that there was no evidence that the Trump administration had ascertained the eight men would not be tortured while in South Sudan’s custody. They also described the deportations as too hasty, depriving the men of their chance to appeal.</p><p>“The affected class members lacked any opportunity to research South Sudan, to determine whether they would face risks of torture or death there, or to speak to anyone about their concerns,” the justices wrote, calling the government’s actions “flagrantly unlawful”.</p><p>In mid-July, the Trump administration also <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/us-deports-immigrants-to-african-country-of-eswatini-amid-rights-concerns\">began deportations to Eswatini</a>, a tiny, landlocked country ruled by an absolute monarchy. It identified the five deported individuals as hailing from Laos, Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba and Yemen.</p><p>“This flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,” administration spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin <a href=\"https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1945274627976200206\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Lawyers for the five men have since reported they were denied access to their clients, who are being held in a maximum-security prison.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"cosying-up-to-trump\">Cosying up to Trump?</h2><p>Little is known so far about the newly announced deportations to Rwanda. It is not yet clear when deportation flights to Rwanda will begin, nor who will be included on the flights.</p><p>Reuters, however, reported that Rwanda will be paid for accepting the deportations in the form of a grant. The amount is not yet known.</p><p>Rwanda also has set parameters for whom it may accept. No child sex offenders will be allowed among the deportation flights, and the country will only accept deported individuals with no criminal background or whose prison terms are complete.</p><p>But the deportation announcement continues a trend of Rwandan authorities seeking closer relations with the Trump administration.</p><p>In June, President Trump claimed credit for <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/dr-congo-and-rwanda-hold-first-talks-since-signing-of-peace-deal\">bringing peace</a> between Rwanda and its neighbour, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</p><p>He invited leaders from both countries to attend a ceremony at the White House and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/27/dr-congo-and-rwanda-sign-peace-deal-in-turning-point-after-years-of-war\">sign a peace deal</a>. Critics, however, noted that the deal was vague and did not mention Rwanda’s support for the M23 paramilitary group, which has carried out deadly attacks in the DRC.</p><p>The deal also appeared to pave the way for Trump to pursue another one of his priorities: <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/6/27/dr-congo-and-rwanda-sign-peace-deal-after-years-of-war\">gaining access to valuable minerals</a> in the region, like copper and lithium, that are key to technology development.</p><p>In an interview with The Associated Press news agency, Rwandan political analyst Gonzaga Muganwa said that his government’s recent manoeuvres seem to reflect the mantra that “<span>appeasing President Trump pays”.</span></p><p>Muganwa explained that Tuesday’s agreement to accept migrants from the US will strengthen the two countries’ shared bond.</p><p>“This agreement enhances Rwanda’s strategic interest of having good relationships with the Trump administration,” he said.</p><p>Rwanda previously struck a deal in 2022 with the United Kingdom to accept asylum seekers from that country.</p><p>But the British Supreme Court nixed the agreement in 2023, ruling that Rwanda was not a safe third country to send asylum seekers to.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Last week, I saw aid dropping from the sky near my central Gaza neighbourhood of az-Zawayda. Neither I nor any of my neighbours had the courage to chase after it because we knew that the moment it hit the ground, a battle would erupt. If the aid survived the air, it wouldn’t survive the looters.</p><p>It is almost always the same scene. Gunfire breaks out the second the plane drops the boxes. Armed gangs are already waiting on the ground, ready to take the goods by force. Whoever gets there first, whoever shoots first, also walks away with the food. It is never those who need it the most.</p><p>Later, we would see those same “aid boxes” in the market in Deir el-Balah, their contents up for sale at exorbitant prices.</p><p>Recently, my little brother was craving a biscuit. I saw biscuits from an aid package at the market and asked for the price. It was 20 shekels ($5) for a biscuit, something we could not afford.</p><p>The aid dropped from the sky not only fails to feed the hungry, but it also kills them. On Monday, an airdropped pallet hit a tent for the displaced and <a href=\"https://aje.io/6n5fcc?update=3872151\">killed</a> Uday al-Quraan, a medic working at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. A week ago, 11 people were injured when another airdropped pallet hit tents in northern Gaza.</p><p>Last year, in other failed airdrops, people also died. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/08/gaza-aid-airdrop-kills-civilians-when-parachute-fails-to-open-witness-says\">Five</a> were killed in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City when the parachute of a pallet did not open; <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/18-palestinians-killed-in-gaza-by-aid-airdrop-malfunction/3175307\">12 drowned</a> trying to reach boxes that dropped into the sea; six were killed in a stampede after a crowd of people rushed to an airdrop location.</p><p>The idea for these latest airdrops came from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called on the world to help with the process. Many governments welcomed the idea and some joined the effort, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and European countries.</p><p>But Netanyahu knows very well that the airdrops will not stop the starvation of Palestinians, which is why he called for them instead of opening the land crossings into Gaza and allowing United Nations agencies to distribute aid in a fair and orderly fashion, just like they have always done.</p><p>While, the global public may be deceived that something is being done about the hunger, inside Gaza, these airdrops aren’t seen as a real solution or a humanitarian gesture. We see them as nothing more than a PR show – a way to cover up a crime that hasn’t stopped: starving an entire population under tight siege by preventing thousands of trucks from entering while a few boxes fall from the sky for the cameras. It’s all part of a strategy to extend the starvation and ease international pressure on Israel.</p><p>And so the famine proceeds at full speed. According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, more than 180 people have died from hunger, including 92 children.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>It is not just in Gaza that airdrops are seen as inefficient and dangerous. In Afghanistan in 2001, airdropped aid was packaged in the same way as cluster bombs. The latter would get mistaken for food boxes by children who would get killed running after them. In Syria, aid airdropped into a besieged area did not reach the starving civilians because it was either damaged or fell into ISIL (ISIS)-held territory.</p><p>It is well known that airdrops do not work and when other options are available, there is no reason to use them. The UN has repeatedly said this method is ineffective and ground delivery is safer and far better. A truck can carry four to 10 times more aid than a parachute. It is also much cheaper. Thousands of trucks are waiting on the Egyptian side of the border, enough to feed people and prevent more deaths from starvation.</p><p>And yet, we see this futile spectacle once again in Gaza. Here we know not to look to the sky with hope. The same sky that drops bombs can’t be trusted to drop food.</p><p>This “humanity with parachutes” is a fig leaf deployed to try to cover the world’s shame and its decision to silently watch starvation.</p><p>Gaza is not only under siege by bombs but also by lies, by complicity, by soft language covering bloody massacres. Everyone who stays silent, who justifies, who treats the killer and victim as equal is a partner in this crime.</p><p>And we, the Palestinians, are not just victims – we are witnesses. We see the world refuse to act, we see countries continue to arm Israel, to trade with it, to give it diplomatic cover. We see governments think of pitiful excuses not to impose embargoes – as they are obliged to do under international law – on a nation committing genocide.</p><p>And tomorrow, when history is written, it won’t be in the language of diplomacy with euphemisms and excuses. It will be in the language of facts with the names of those complicit in the mass killing and starvation of Palestinians written in clear letters.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

She was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-maxwell-found-guilty-of\">What was Maxwell found guilty of?</h2><p>At her trial, four women testified that Maxwell groomed them as teenagers to participate in sexual acts with Epstein and sometimes participated in the abuse.</p><p>She was ultimately found guilty on five of six counts: sex trafficking of minors, conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.</p><p>Epstein himself faced federal charges related to sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-these-records-being-sought-now\">Why are these records being sought now?</h2><p>Conspiracy theories have long swirled around Epstein’s influence and his death. The wealthy financier, whose high-profile friends included current US President Donald Trump and powerful figures on both the liberal and conservative sides of the political spectrum, was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019 before he could stand trial.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>While his death was ruled a suicide, many prominent figures in Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement have long doubted that narrative, insisting – without firm evidence – that Epstein might have been killed to stop him from revealing the identities of some of his clients.</p><p>Some government officials appointed by Trump in his second term, including FBI Director Kash Patel, have previously fanned the flames of those conspiracy theories.</p><p>In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi said an Epstein client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review”, adding that she was following a directive from Trump to look at the files.</p><p>But in July, Bondi’s Justice Department issued a memo concluding that there was no client list and the financier had died by suicide – an apparent turnaround that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/17/who-are-the-maga-influencers-calling-for-pam-bondis-head-over-epstein\">sparked calls for Bondi’s resignation</a> from parts of the MAGA movement.</p><p>Trump initially tried to dismiss that response from his support base and then tried to portray the criticism his administration was facing as orchestrated by opposition Democrats to distract from his supposed achievements as president.</p><p>But the pressure hasn’t let up. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had written a birthday note to Epstein in 2003 with the implication that the two knew each other better than the president has let on.</p><p>Trump denied writing the letter and has sued the newspaper and the author of the article. But amid the mounting scrutiny, he also ordered Bondi to seek the release of all grand jury testimony in the Epstein case.</p><p>Still, scrutiny over his administration’s actions has only grown. Last week, Maxwell was moved to an all-women federal prison camp after a meeting with a senior DOJ official.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-people-named-in-the-epstein-case\">Who are the people named in the Epstein case?</h2><p>In 2024, a court unsealed about 950 pages of documents that included the <a href=\"/news/2024/1/4/jeffrey-epstein-list-whose-names-are-on-the-newly-unsealed-documents\">names of several public figures</a> who had known Epstein well. The presence of their names on the documents does not in itself imply any wrongdoing – although some have faced accusations that they sexually exploited women.</p><p>Some of the most prominent figures in the documents include:</p><ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Prince Andrew: </strong></strong>Johanna Sjoberg, who is one of the many women who have accused Epstein of sexual abuse, said in the documents that the British royal put his hand on her breast in Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in 2001. Virginia Giuffre, another of Epstein’s accusers, also <a href=\"/news/2022/1/4/explainer-virginia-giuffres-lawsuit-against-prince-andrew\">alleged that Andrew</a><span> sexually abused her two decades ago when she was 17, an allegation the prince called baseless. Giuffre’s lawsuit against Andrew was </span><a href=\"/news/2022/2/15/prince-andrew-settles-sex-abuse-lawsuit-with-virginia-giuffre\">settled in 2022</a><span>.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Alan Dershowitz: </strong>An unnamed accuser said Epstein “required” her to have sexual relations with the Harvard University law professor on multiple occasions when she was a minor.</li>\n<li><strong>David Copperfield: </strong>Sjoberg testified to meeting the American magician at one of Epstein’s houses. She added that she observed him to be a friend of Epstein’s.</li>\n<li><strong>Bill Clinton: </strong>While Sjoberg said she did not meet the former US president, she testified that Epstein said to her: “Clinton likes them young,” apparently referring to girls. Clinton has repeatedly rejected all allegations that he was involved in anything unlawful and has said he had no interactions with Epstein for several years before the financier’s arrest.</li>\n<li><strong>Trump: </strong>Sjoberg mentioned an incident when she flew with Epstein, Giuffre and a few others on a plane from Palm Beach, Florida, in 2001. When the plane was unable to land in New York due to a storm, they had to land in Atlantic City and went to one of Trump’s casinos.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"why-does-it-matter-whether-these-trial-transcripts-are-unsealed\">Why does it matter whether these trial transcripts are unsealed?</h2><p>The documents could show the information that the grand jury had before it while deliberating the case. Bondi’s DOJ said in a filing that the transcripts contain nothing that is not already known publicly.</p><p>It could help Trump and his team beat back accusations from the president’s base that they have anything to hide.</p><h2 id=\"ell-going-to-testify-to-congress\">Is Maxwell going to testify to Congress?</h2><p>The House of Representatives Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell in late July, seeking her deposition on Monday. Maxwell’s lawyer has said she is willing to testify before Congress.</p><p>But the committee has since said it is willing to postpone Maxwell’s deposition while the Supreme Court decides whether to take up her appeal against her 2021 conviction.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This past month’s death toll is a fraction of that, but the outrage that followed it is palpable.</p><p>“Luanda is slowly regaining its usual rhythm, but obviously, it is a different city. All over the city, you see signs of what happened these last days,” said Candero, who is the director of the Luanda-based rights group, Mosaiko.</p><p>Thousands of people took to the streets of Africa’s third-largest oil-producing country last Monday to protest against a government decision to cut fuel subsidies and increase the price of diesel by one-third from July 1.</p><p>This followed a first round of protests on July 12 that was largely peaceful.</p><p>According to the government, at least 22 people died last week in clashes between the police and protesters, and 197 others were injured. More than 1,200 people were arrested.</p><p>The unrest was triggered by a three-day strike by minibus taxi associations to protest against the decision that the government says is part of essential budgetary containment measures.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><h2 id=\"the-people-live-in-misery\">‘The people live in misery’</h2><p>Angola has been under increasing pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to tighten its budget since 2023, when it last cut fuel subsidies.</p><p>President Joao Lourenco’s government says fiscal restraint is necessary, as subsidies account for about 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and debt exceeds 60 percent of GDP.</p><p>Economic Coordination Minister Jose de Lima Massano said in April that last year’s fuel subsidies of about $3bn equalled the budget for 1,400 infrastructure and development projects. Of those projects, 500 had to be suspended due to fiscal constraints.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3873126\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3873126\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873126\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-05-23T181036Z_264300555_RC2SNEAIQ6XJ_RTRMADP_3_BRAZIL-ANGOLA-1754375215.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Joao Lourenco\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3873126\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Angola’s President Joao Lourenco [File: Mateus Bonomi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Analysts say part of the problem is Angola’s heavy reliance on oil, which makes up about 60 percent of government revenue and 95 percent of exports. However, the country only produces about 30 percent of its domestic fuel consumption demand from its lone oil refinery, which dates to the colonial era.</p><p>What’s more, Angola based its 2025 budget on an oil price of $70 per barrel, but Brent oil futures fell below $60 in April after United States President Donald Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/4/4/have-trumps-tariffs-killed-us-africa-preferential-trade\">announced a sharp increase in tariffs</a>.</p><p>Carlos Rosado de Carvalho, a professor of economics at the Catholic University of Angola, said the volatility of the oil market leaves Angola in a precarious position.</p><p>“It’s a real problem, because the [fuel] subsidies cost annually about $3bn. This is more than the government spending on health and education together,” de Carvalho said, suggesting that the government’s hand was forced.</p><p>Nevertheless, he concedes that the timing of the new policy was far from ideal. It coincided with tariff increases in electricity and water bills of up to 50 percent and 30 percent, respectively.</p><p>De Carvalho estimates that in July 2025, the minimum wage also only covered 66 percent of the basket of goods and services it did in 2017 – the year Lourenco came to power.</p><p>At the same time, low wages and rising unemployment have left millions of Angolans facing poverty and hunger. “This is where we must look for the causes of the popular uprisings that have marked Angola, especially Luanda,” he said.</p><p>To make matters worse, government leaders failed to explain the motivation for the increases.</p><p>Commercial oil production in Angola started in the mid-1950s. In 2024, the government said, it generated $31.4bn from oil exports; that revenue is more than ten times the amount spent on fuel subsidies.</p><p>The government’s critics say most of the country’s 36 million people have yet to see the benefits of living in a country blessed with natural wealth.</p><p>“Ordinary Angolans are not benefitting from the country’s natural resources wealth because of high levels of corruption,” Candero said.</p><p>“And, as you see in all rich natural resources countries in Africa, particularly where this exploitation is happening, the people live in misery.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3863397\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3863397\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3863397\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AFP__20250728__68348QF__v1__HighRes__AngolaUnrest-1753799124.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A group of shops are targeted as looting erupted in the Kalemba 2 district of Luanda on July 28, 2025 during a general strike in the taxi sector declared for three days to protest against the rising prices of fuel.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3863397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shops are looted in the Kalemba 2 district of Luanda on July 28, during a general strike in the taxi sector declared for three days to protest against the rising prices of fuel [AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>He does not accept the justification that President Lourenco gave in an interview following the protests, that Angola’s comparatively low fuel prices justify the reduction in subsidies. The government has also pointed out that the discounted prices have attracted illicit cross-border traders from neighbouring countries.</p><p>Candero insists this is no justification for increasing fuel prices. He blames the status quo on decades of mismanagement by the ruling People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) party and believes there are other means of bringing public spending under control.</p><p>“If the government really wants to cut spending, it should start by cutting spending on superfluous goods and services, extravagant perks for high public officeholders and stop running up debt to buy fleets of luxury cars, trips with numerous entourages, each person with extra perks,” Candero said.</p><h2 id=\"keep-goods-cheap\">‘Keep goods cheap’</h2><p>Attiya Waris, a development expert based at the University of Nairobi, has called on Angola’s government to reconsider the reduction of subsidies.</p><p>“Fuel subsidies are important in Angola as they keep goods cheap. The government needs to make sure that any change in fuel prices does not affect movement and the cost of the basket of goods [for] people in the country,” said Waris, who reported to the United Nations Human Rights Commission in February this year as an independent expert on the effects of foreign debt on human rights in Angola.</p><p>In her report, Waris, who is Kenyan, warns that the subsidy cuts could push up food price inflation and negatively affect vulnerable groups. She points out that the price of basic staples like eggs had already increased by 400 percent.</p><p>The report recommends that the government conduct a comprehensive assessment of the economic and social impacts of cutting fuel subsidies and urges it to seek alternative support mechanisms to mitigate the negative impact it may have on low-income households.</p><p>World Bank researchers have also backed up Waris’s findings. They point out that removing subsidies could deepen poverty and inequality and may have dire consequences for specific sectors, such as fishing and agriculture; not to mention that it could lead to a nutritional crisis.</p><p>“To mitigate these effects, subsidies should be gradually eliminated and paired with targeted support for specific producers, cash transfers for affected households, and public awareness campaigns about the benefits of subsidy reform,” an <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/africacan/preventing-adverse-effects-while-reforming-fuel-subsidies-afe-in-angola\">article</a> published in May on the World Bank blog site reads.</p><p>The authors point out, however, that fuel subsidies have drawbacks, too, including disproportionately benefitting wealthier households, straining public finances, limiting investments in physical and human capital and promoting the over-consumption of fossil fuels.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3873124\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3873124\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873124\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250726__67X73RH__v1__HighRes__AngolaPoliticsEconomyDemo-1754375123.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Angola\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3873124\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Angolan anti-riot police officers stand in formation as protesters gather in Luanda on July 26 during a protest over high living costs [Julio Pacheco Ntela/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-fight-will-continue\">‘The fight will continue’</h2><p>The government’s handling of the subsidy reforms has been widely criticised, especially after the crackdown on protesters.</p><p>Human Rights Watch <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/07/18/angola-police-use-excessive-force-against-peaceful-protesters\">accused</a> police of using excessive force after they fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters on July 12 during the first round of protests against the reduction of subsidies.</p><p>Ashwanee Budoo-Scholtz, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the use of force was part of a broader trend of security force problems in Angola. She cited a protest in 2023 by 400 women traders in Luanda, which was met with tear gas and police beatings.</p><p>When Lourenco was elected for a second term in August 2022, Human Rights Watch made a series of recommendations to place human rights at the centre of his government’s policies, including investigating repeated allegations of rights violations by Angola’s state security forces, such as summary executions, excessive use of force against peaceful protesters, and arbitrary detentions.</p><p>“Angolans should be able to peacefully protest government policies without being met with excessive force and other violations of their basic rights,” Budoo-Scholtz said in a statement last month.</p><p>Despite the criticisms, President Lourenco on Friday praised the police for “acting within the scope of their duties”.</p><p>In a national address, he reminded Angolans that this year marks five decades of independence, nearly half of which were marked by civil war. “[We] cannot accept or tolerate any more pain and mourning among Angolans,” he said.</p><p>He ended his address with the words: “Long live Angola.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Candero and other civil society groups feel nowhere near as triumphant.</p><p>Overnight, transport costs have doubled to about 4,000 kwanza ($4.36) a day for workers who rely on public transport such as minibus taxes, exceeding the daily wages of 53 percent of Angolans, who earn less than $3.65 per day, and 31 percent who live on less than $2.15 per day, according to the World Bank.</p><p>Candero said it is almost inevitable that the rising costs of living will lead to more protests.</p><p>And with economically desperate people out in the streets, this can also lead to looting, observers note.</p><p>“Some people do not agree with destruction of businesses or other public goods. Others think that causing economic and financial consequences is a payback to the government that [harms many] by allowing corruption,” Candero said.</p><p>“For others, especially young people from poor suburbs, the fight will continue until the improvement of their social conditions, especially hunger reduction.</p><p>“These were only symptoms. Until we deal with the root causes, these demonstrations will never stop. This is no longer a taxi strike. It is the cry of a hungry people for a piece of bread and for some dignity.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Lahore is the capital of Punjab, the country’s most politically important region and home to half of its population.</p><p>Khan, a popular cricket star, was elected prime minister in 2018. But once in office, he fell out with Pakistan’s powerful military and was toppled in 2022 through a vote in parliament. His arrest in May 2023 on several charges spurred widespread protests against the military, leading to a <a href=\"/news/2024/12/26/pakistan-military-court-sentences-60-more-civilians-over-pro-khan-protests\">crackdown</a> on the party.</p><p>In a message attributed to Khan on his party’s X account on Monday, he urged supporters to “come out and hold peaceful protests until a true democracy is restored in the country”.</p><p>The former leader has “overwhelming support” in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in particular, where tens of thousands of people have come out to protest, said Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from the province’s city of Peshawar.</p><p>Reports have emerged, however, of police cracking down on demonstrators.</p><p>Khan’s party posted a video on its X account on Tuesday, showing a former PTI candidate, Rehana Dar, being carried into a police van by personnel with riot gear.</p><p>“An elder like Rehana Dar is being dragged by the shameless Punjab Police, a disgraceful sight,” the PTI said.</p><p></p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Social media videos also showed at least two other people being detained in Lahore.</p><p>The PTI’s Multan chapter alleged that its Lahore rally was “attacked by police”, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported on Tuesday.</p><p>“Rallies are being held today on the orders of the PTI founder,” PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan said in a statement, adding they would continue until Khan’s release.</p><p>The rallies were held despite the government’s order barring “illegal” gatherings and large assemblies, Pakistan’s Geo TV reported.</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: A convoy of hundreds of vehicles from Peshawar has set off towards Swabi.</em></p><p>In a statement on Monday, police said security was beefed up in major cities nationwide.</p><p>At a news conference on Monday, Khan’s party was accused of always creating “chaos” by Uzma Bukhari, a spokesperson of the provincial government.</p><p>“No political party can be barred from politics in Pakistan, but a terrorist organisation disguised as a political party is not allowed to disrupt Pakistan’s peace,” Bukhari said.</p><p>PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said the party has pledged to demonstrate peacefully and was not seeking confrontation, Geo TV reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Khan says the charges against him – ranging from terrorism to disclosure of official secrets – are politically motivated. He was convicted in January in a <a href=\"/news/2025/1/17/pakistans-ex-pm-imran-khan-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case\">corruption case</a>, while being acquitted of other charges or receiving suspended sentences.</p><p>Before the protest call, hundreds of Khan’s party members, including several parliamentarians, were convicted late last month on charges related to the 2023 protests against his arrest.</p><p>The government has been bringing cases against the leadership of Khan’s party, said Hyder. “Some of them have been given sentences of 10 years each on anti-terrorism charges,” he added.</p><p>Khan’s party emerged as the single biggest in the 2024 election, and it says rigging robbed it of more seats.

In a Monday social media post, however, he said he “will be <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/trump-says-he-will-substantially-raise-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil\">substantially raising</a> the Tariff paid by India to the USA” because of India’s imports of Russian crude.</p><p>In late July, the EU also slapped sanctions on Nayara, one of India’s two big private oil refiners, which is Russian-majority owned. The bloc also banned the import of refined oil made from Russian crude, again hurting Indian refiners.</p><p>Until Monday night, India’s response had been muted. That has now changed. Two hours after Trump’s latest announcement, New Delhi issued a statement accusing the US and EU of double standards and of, in fact, quietly encouraging India to buy Russian crude earlier.</p><p>As India’s relations with the West – otherwise warm and growing until recently – now fray over its purchase of Russian energy, how true are New Delhi’s claims that the West is as guilty of enabling the Kremlin’s war machine as those it blames?</p><h2 id=\"what-did-india-say-on-monday\">What did India say on Monday?</h2><p>After hesitating for days to publicly take on Washington and Brussels directly, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government issued a terse statement on August 4, calling the targeting of India “unjustified and unreasonable”.</p><p>“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, in words that suggest New Delhi is in no mood to back down.</p><p>But Jaiswal also directly pushed back against suggestions from the US and EU that India – in buying large volumes of Russian crude – had acted in a way that broke with the West’s own behaviour.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“In fact, India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,” Jaiswal said, referring to Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p>“The United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets’ stability,” he added.</p><p>He said India’s decision to import Russian oil was “meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer”.</p><p>“However, it is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,” he added.</p><p>The EU, he said, had traded more with Russia in goods in 2024 than India had. “European imports of LNG in 2024, in fact, reached a record 16.5 million tonnes, surpassing the last record of 15.21 million tonnes in 2022,” Jaiswal said.</p><p>The US, meanwhile, “continues to import from Russia uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its EV industry, fertilisers as well as chemicals,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>India’s response is not surprising, said Biswajit Dhar, a trade economist who has been involved with multiple Indian trade negotiations.</p><p>“The aggressiveness that the Trump administration has shown – there had to be some reaction from India,” he told Al Jazeera. “For a sovereign country to hear this kind of a threat from another country is unacceptable.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873391\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Who-are-Russias-biggest-trade-partners-August-5-2025-1754385613.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Who are Russia’s biggest trade partners - August 5, 2025-1754385613\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-significant-are-the-us-eu-sanctions-and-tariffs-against-india\">How significant are the US, EU sanctions and tariffs against India?</h2><p>India’s pushback reflects just how much is at stake for its economy.</p><p>The US is India’s largest export destination: Americans bought $87bn worth of Indian goods in 2024. By contrast, India imported $41bn worth of US goods last year, leading to a large $46bn trade deficit for the US.</p><p>Trump’s earlier threat of 25 percent tariffs on Indian goods was already threatening to dramatically disrupt that trade. His announcement of even higher tariffs could bleed India’s export revenue further.</p><p>The decision by Brussels to bar the import of refined petroleum sourced from Russian crude could also batter the profits of Indian refineries. According to market intelligence firm S&amp;P Global, Indian exports of petroleum products to Europe have jumped from $5.9bn in 2019 to $20.5bn, largely because of India’s ability to buy subsidised Russian oil, refine it, and then sell it to the West.</p><p>But stopping the purchase of Russian oil would come with its costs: After the US and Europe imposed tough sanctions on Moscow over its war on Ukraine, Russia offered discounted crude to India. The EU also introduced price caps on Russian oil shipped by European tankers. As a result, India saved billions of dollars, with Russia becoming its biggest source of imported crude.</p><p>For India, say experts, it isn’t just the economic calculations that make the recent threats and sanctions problematic. The West is “just changing goalposts”, Anil Trigunayat, a retired Indian diplomat, told Al Jazeera. “So, India is just showing them the mirror with facts and figures now.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873394\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Who-buys-Russian-crude-oil-August-5-2025-1754385618.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Who buys Russian crude oil - August 5, 2025-1754385618\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"did-the-us-and-eu-encourage-india-to-buy-russian-oil-until-now\">Did the US and EU encourage India to buy Russian oil until now?</h2><p>Trump, in his latest post targeting India, claimed that “they don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine.”</p><p>India is arguing that the same accusations levelled against it hold true against the US and EU – and that they actually acquiesced to New Delhi buying Russian oil when the West no longer wanted to.</p><p>“They [India] bought Russian oil because we wanted someone to buy Russian oil at a price cap – that was not a violation or anything, that was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity, we did not want the price of oil to go up,” Eric Garcetti, the US ambassador to India under former President Joe Biden, said at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations in May 2024. “They fulfilled that.”</p><p></p><p>The logic was simple: If no one had bought Russian oil, that would have shrunk the total available oil supply with the same global demand, driving up costs. As Garcetti pointed out, Indian purchases of Russian crude helped avoid that – while allowing the West to reduce its dependence on Russian energy.</p><p>Until July, the EU, too, had not imposed any restrictions on the import of petroleum products sourced from Russian crude.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873389\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-EU-imports-of-Russian-LNG-are-on-the-rise-August-5-2025-1754385608.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-EU imports of Russian LNG are on the rise - August 5, 2025-1754385608\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"is-the-west-trading-more-with-russia-than-india-is\">Is the West trading more with Russia than India is?</h2><p>That’s the other major claim from India.</p><p>And the facts suggest that New Delhi is right. According to the EU, its total trade with Russia was worth 67.5 billion euros ($77.9 bn) in 2024. India’s total trade with Russia in 2024-25 was <a href=\"https://indianembassy-moscow.gov.in/overview.php#:~:text=Bilateral%20trade%20between%20India%20and,amounting%20to%20USD%2063.84%20billion.\">worth $68.7bn</a>.</p><p>To be sure, Europe’s trade with Russia has fallen sharply, from 257.5 billion euros ($297.4bn) in 2021, before the invasion of Ukraine, while India’s trade with Russia has surged from about $10bn before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>But data shows that the bloc continues to buy Russian gas. Since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the grouping has paid Moscow $105.6bn for gas imports – an amount equivalent to 75 percent of Russia’s 2024 military budget – according to the Finnish think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which has been tracking Russian energy trade through the war.</p><p>In 2024, <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/presentation-russian-lng-exports-to-the-eu-implications-for-the-us-lng-market/\">EU imports of Russian LNG</a> rose 9 percent compared with the year before.</p><p>Mineral fuels make up almost two-thirds of EU imports from Russia, followed by food, raw materials, machinery and transport equipment, according to the bloc.</p><p>And the US does indeed still import a range of chemicals from Russia, as Jaiswal claimed. Total Russia-US trade in 2024 stood at <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/russia-and-eurasia/russia\">$5.2bn</a>, according to the US Trade Representative’s office – though the numbers are down significantly from 2021, when their trade in goods stood at <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4621.html#2023\">$36bn</a>.</p><p>Given this backdrop, India’s Foreign Ministry was “absolutely right to call out the US and EU”, Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Al Jazeera. “They are still importing from Russia. They’re allowed to do it; we are not. That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>Russia, too, criticised the Western measures against India.</p><p>“Sovereign countries have the right to choose their own trade partners,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the AFP news agency, accusing the West of trying to “sever” trade ties between other countries and Russia, and describing those moves as illegitimate.</p><h2 id=\"is-this-all-a-trade-negotiating-tactic\">Is this all a trade negotiating tactic?</h2><p>Some Indian experts believe that the threats and tariffs from Trump are bargaining measures aimed at securing a <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/who-has-a-deal-who-doesnt-the-state-of-play-on-eve-of-trumps-tariffs\">trade deal with India</a> that is favourable to the US.</p><p>The two countries have been locked in negotiations over a trade agreement to minimise Trump’s tariffs, but have yet to agree on a pact, even though India has cut tariffs on several US imports.</p><p>A key sticking point is agriculture, where India has long imposed high tariffs to protect its farm sector, which represents about half of the country’s population.</p><p>“The way the Trump administration has been demanding that India open its market to US agribusiness – that’s a no-go for India,” Dhar said. “Our small farmers will face a serious adverse situation; so it’s economically and politically completely unacceptable to India.”</p><p>Ghosh echoed those sentiments.</p><p>“There’s no question of giving in on agriculture,” she said. “In India, you cannot give in and allow US heavily subsidised multinational conglomerates to invade our markets, when a majority of our population still depends on agriculture for a livelihood.”</p><p>But in recent weeks, Trump has also tried to ramp up pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire deal with Ukraine, and choking Moscow’s oil exports would make it harder for Russian President Vladimir Putin to sustain his economy.</p><p>On Monday, Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller <a href=\"/news/2025/8/4/top-trump-aide-accuses-india-of-financing-russias-ukraine-war-through-oil\">accused India of “financing this (Russia’s) war</a>“.</p></div></div></body></html>"
