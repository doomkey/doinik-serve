The plan coordinates various elements of the national government in “the case of a possible migratory crisis due to the United States military intervention in our brother country, Venezuela”.</p><p>The minister said he met local officials to take stock of available resources for refugees, including food and healthcare supplies, to better understand areas where officials lack reserves.</p><p>With support from the United Nations International Organization for Migration, the minister said, the government is also activating 17 ​​<a href=\"https://x.com/MinIgualdad_Col/status/2007805872013975754\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">centres</a> across the country tasked with helping immigrants and refugees with food supplies, access to education, training and employment, violence prevention, and more.</p><p>Although there has been no uptick in border crossings yet, the minister said, the Colombian government expects that up to 1.7 million people could arrive in the country.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The New Year demonstrations in Iran came at the end of a year marked by war, economic strain, and political uncertainty.</p><p>In 2025, Israel launched a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day attack on Iran</a>, assassinating senior military leaders and targeting military and economic infrastructure. The assault was followed by US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in <a href=\"/news/2025/6/22/us-joins-israel-in-attacks-against-iran-strikes-key-nuclear-sites\">Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz</a>.</p><p>As the year closed, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/sporadic-protests-in-tehran-as-clashes-reported-in-irans-west\">protests erupted</a> in the capital, Tehran, and in cities across central and southwestern Iran, beginning in the final week of 2025 and continuing into the first days of 2026.</p><p>These protests were not unprecedented. Iranian society has witnessed<a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/a-timeline-of-protests-in-iran-after-the-1979-islamic-revolution\"> thousands of demonstrations</a> since the mid-1990s, varying in scale and levels of participation. Over the years, the drivers of these demonstrations have differed, ranging from restrictions on social and political freedoms to the deterioration of economic conditions.</p><p>In Iran, recurring protests are shaped by the interaction between domestic politics, governance, foreign policy, and the impact of sanctions, which together influence both the emergence of dissent and the state’s response to it, particularly amid sustained sanctions and ongoing tensions with Israel and the United States.</p><p>The protests that closed the year followed a strike by merchants and bazaar owners over a sharp decline in purchasing power. This accelerated decline was driven by rising inflation, reflected in the falling value of the Iranian rial, which lost the equivalent of about 50 percent of its value, and by an increase in unemployment to 7.5 percent.</p><p>This was not the first time economic grievances had sparked unrest. In 2008, following an increase in the rate of value-added tax, the bazaar erupted in protest, forcing the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to retreat from implementing the measure.</p><p>More limited demonstrations followed in 2010, after the Ahmadinejad government attempted to impose a law raising the income tax rate to 70 percent, before retreating again under popular pressure.</p><p>Across Iran’s protest movements over different periods, economic concerns have consistently featured alongside demands for greater social freedom, including opposition to compulsory hijab laws. These issues prompted widespread demonstrations in 2022, after the killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in custody over the hijab law, and the authorities’ attempts to blame her for what happened, which fuelled public anger.</p><p>Nevertheless, no fundamental reforms have been undertaken by successive governments. President Mohammad Khatami (1997–2005) proposed an alternative economic strategy focused on reducing reliance on oil revenues and developing non-oil sectors to mitigate the impact of sanctions, which often target Iran’s oil industry. These measures did not succeed, however, as the nuclear crisis escalated after the publication of the first images of the Natanz facility in August 2002, increasing economic pressure from abroad.</p><p>From 2005 to 2013, Ahmadinejad pursued a populist approach, centred on redistributing oil revenues through the so-called oil-to-cash programme. This strategy failed, encountering resistance from powerful domestic economic interests and the tightening sanctions regime imposed by the United Nations Security Council, under resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, and 1929. These measures restricted trade, froze financial assets, and curtailed access to international finance, building on years of unilateral US sanctions dating back to 1980.</p><h2 id=\"bad-governance-or-sanctions\">Bad governance, or sanctions?</h2><p>As demonstrations have expanded in scope over time, an enduring question has resurfaced: To what extent do <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/9/28/whats-the-fallout-from-the-latest-un-sanctions-on-iran\">sanctions</a> explain Iran’s economic crisis, and where does governance bear responsibility?</p><p>Iran’s economy has suffered from longstanding structural problems that have not been addressed since 1980, as priorities linked to revolutionary ideology and its associated costs have taken precedence over building a resilient state economy. Economic and financial legislation failed to keep pace with global developments. As a result, Iran became increasingly isolated from international markets, compounding internal crises and amplifying the impact of sanctions across nearly all sectors.</p><p>This raises a persistent question for Iran’s political and economic elite: Why have successive governments failed to advance economic policies and programmes capable of countering the effects of sanctions?</p><p>In this context, Iran’s economic partnerships with China, most notably the 25-year strategic cooperation agreement – valued at $400bn and covering energy, telecommunications, transport, and infrastructure – have not delivered economic stability. Nor has the strategic partnership with Russia, signed in early 2025 and intended to strengthen cooperation over two decades, improved Iran’s economic situation.</p><p>Together, these partnerships have failed to mitigate the harsh consequences of sanctions imposed by the US and the European Union.</p><p>Iranian public opinion, as reflected in protest slogans, has long linked foreign policy, particularly Iran’s involvement in the Middle East to the depletion of national income. Iran’s support for proxies and armed groups — including in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen, as well as Palestine — has long been part of its regional strategy, drawing on funding, training, and logistical aid from Tehran. As living conditions deteriorated, the slogan “No Gaza or Lebanon, let my life be a scapegoat for Iran” was heard repeatedly, emerging as a defining feature of demonstrations at the end of 2024.</p><p>Since early 2025, however, this linkage has become less convincing as an explanation for Iran’s economic crisis. Iranian influence has declined significantly in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and Yemen, weakening the argument that regional engagements are the primary drain on state resources. This shift has gone so far that some Iranian military officials have even demanded that Syria repay around $50bn in debt to Iran — a claim rejected by members of Syria’s new interim government as they prepare a compensation bill against Tehran for the costs of its support for the regime during the civil war rather than accept repayment.</p><p>For the first time, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian have publicly acknowledged that responsibility for Iran’s economic situation cannot be placed solely on sanctions. This admission underscored the continuing centrality of governance failures and clarified how the leadership interprets the protests that followed the Israeli and US attacks in the summer of 2025.</p><h2 id=\"diverging-narratives-and-the-risks-ahead\">Diverging narratives and the risks ahead</h2><p>Iran’s leadership now advances two competing narratives to explain the demonstrations. The first, articulated by the supreme leader and the president, centres on failures in economic governance and recognises that sanctions alone cannot account for the depth of the crisis. The second, promoted by the security establishment, continues to emphasise the role of external actors in inciting unrest and targeting the regime.</p><p>This divergence creates confusion within state institutions, as the security narrative implicitly frames the demonstrations as an existential threat. In doing so, it deepens social tensions and widens the gap between the regime and society.</p><p>Historically, concerns over regime survival have strengthened the position of the security establishment in responding to protests. Today, however, a changed internal and regional context places pressure on both political and security institutions to respond differently, if the survival of the political system is to be ensured.</p><p>At the same time, the confidence and military capability felt by Israel, combined with what Iranian leaders perceive as unlimited US support, has enabled Israeli decision-makers to seriously contemplate a new war on Iran. Israel has effectively begun a second military operation through a clear narrative that it will not allow Iran to enrich uranium at all, and that the Iranian nuclear program should be dismantled just as the Libyan nuclear program was dismantled in 2003. Such a conflict would aim to render the regime fragile, politically, economically, and in security terms.</p><p>This prospect has intensified Iran’s internal confrontation with its society, raising the possibility that a prolonged state of conflict could eventually lead to regime change, even if only over time, with the declared aim of neutralising what Israel regards as the “Iranian threat” once and for all.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Then, in a post on X alongside photos of their meeting, Jaishankar wrote words that demonstrate a dramatic break with New Delhi’s past relationship with the BNP: “Conveyed deepest condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India. Expressed confidence that Begum Khaleda Zia’s vision and values will guide the development of our partnership.”</p><p>For decades, India had been – at times, publicly, on other occasions, privately – opposed to Khaleda’s “vision and values”.</p><p>Where for millions of her supporters in Bangladesh, she represented a heroic struggle against military rule in the 1980s that first brought her to power in 1991, India viewed her with suspicion and distrust. For decades, the BNP had an alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist group that advocates for stronger ties with Pakistan, India’s arch-enemy. Meanwhile, India treated Khaleda’s rival, Sheikh Hasina, and her avowedly secular Awami League party as its natural partners.</p><p>But as Bangladesh prepares for national elections in February, Jaishankar’s comments underscore how India and the BNP appear to be pivoting from their animus towards a closer working relationship.</p><p>Jaishankar’s “very cordial” meeting with Rahman and his team of confidantes in Dhaka presented the “potential of a new phase in the bilateral relationship”, Humayun Kabir, foreign affairs adviser to Rahman, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>It’s a shift that circumstances have forced on both India and the Rahman-led BNP, say analysts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4212601\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4212601\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4212601\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20251231__89CL9WF__v2__MidRes__TopshotBangladeshPoliticsZia-1767466712.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"rahman\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4212601\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BNP’s acting Chairman Tarique Rahman (C) standing alongside chief adviser of the country’s interim government, Muhammad Yunus (2L), during the burial ceremony, on December 31, of Rahman’s mother and the nation’s former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, a day after her death in Dhaka [Photo by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Media Cell/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-new-start\">A new start?</h2><p>Since the student-led July 2024 uprising toppled Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, New Delhi’s decades-long support for the ousted leader has prompted strong anti-India sentiments on Bangladeshi streets.</p><p>Hasina now lives in exile in New Delhi, and India has so far refused to return her to Bangladesh to face the death penalty, after being convicted in absentia by a tribunal on charges related to the brutal crackdown by her security forces on protesters last year. The United Nations estimates that about 1,400 people died in the crackdown.</p><p>Bilateral relations have continued to slide further: After a 2024 protest leader who was vocally anti-India was murdered, protests against India picked up again in Bangladesh. A Hindu Bangladeshi man was lynched. Both countries had to temporarily suspend visa services at their respective high commissions.</p><p>But Hasina’s Awami League is banned from participating in the February elections. And some analysts believe that the BNP is trying to occupy the liberal and centrist political space vacated by the Awami League. It has also broken up with the Jamaat – the Islamist group has since partnered with a party formed by leaders of the 2024 student protest movement, in a formidable alliance.</p><p>The BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are seen as the frontrunners competing to form the next government after the February elections. And while India can’t reconcile with the Jamaat’s politics – and its pro-Pakistan tilt – Rahman has in recent days made statements that are far more palatable to New Delhi.</p><p>Since returning to Dhaka in late December after 17 years in exile, Rahman told supporters that he wanted an inclusive Bangladesh, where minorities are safe.</p><p>His words suggest that Rahman has “matured during his years in exile”, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former Indian foreign secretary who has also served as high commissioner in Dhaka, told Al Jazeera.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4212605\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4212605\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4212605\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20040214__HKG2004010662380__v2__MidRes__PakistanSaarcClosingVajpayeeZia-1767466879.jpg?w=768&amp;resize=768%2C552&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"khaleda zia\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4212605\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (R) and Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia (L) share a light moment during the closing ceremony of the 12th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit, in Islamabad, January 6, 2004.

Rahman, if he comes to power, would keep Bangladesh equidistant from regional powers, like India and China, and keep “Bangladesh first”, Kabir added.</p><p>“Hasina used India in a bad way to legitimise her own crimes in Bangladesh, so people have a very bitter distaste for India,” Kabir said. He added that the “new Bangladesh” after the July 2024 revolution sees Hasina as a “terrorist”.</p><p>Kabir said Dhaka would continue to press India for Hasina’s extradition if Rahman is elected to power in February. “The onus to maintain this [bilateral] relationship lies on New Delhi, for keeping Hasina there,” he said.</p><p>Hasina has publicly criticised Bangladesh’s direction under the Yunus government, angering Dhaka. “India needs to move on from Hasina’s era and should not be seen complicit with her rogue activities to destabilise Bangladesh, while she sits in India,” Kabir said. Otherwise, he cautioned, “widespread anti-India distaste among people makes it difficult for the next elected government to engage [with New Delhi] against the popular sentiment.”</p><p>Persistent tensions have also played out beyond the worlds of politics and diplomacy in recent days.</p><p>On Saturday, India’s cricketing body, which governs the popular Indian Premier League, asked the Kolkata Knight Riders franchise to drop Bangladeshi pacer Mustafizur Rahman after BJP leaders protested the player’s participation.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-s-next\">So what’s next?</h2><p>Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat who served in Bangladesh for five years, told Al Jazeera that if Rahman returns to power in Dhaka, “India’s biggest challenge would be to keep a check on Pakistan and other anti-India militant groups being embedded in Bangladesh.”</p><p>Danilowicz said he agreed that India would harbour those concerns – given the BNP’s past leanings towards Pakistan, when the Jamaat was its ally.</p><p>But Kabir, Rahman’s adviser, said the BNP leader was focused on “improving and pushing cooperation” with India and other neighbours.</p><p>“The relationship never existed between India and Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina; it was just limited to Hasina,” said Kabir. “Now, we need confidence that India means a change of direction and is setting its policy to actually rekindle the relationship between the people of Bangladesh and India.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He has maintained that Greenland should come under the jurisdiction of the US, and his latest threat came just a day after US forces <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/6/live-un-security-council-members-slam-us-abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro\">abducted Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro</a> and his wife.</p><p>That military operation has caused alarm in Denmark and Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of the Danish kingdom and thus part of NATO.</p><p>“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” said Frederiksen.</p><p class=\"p1\">“That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the second world war,” she told Danish broadcaster TV2.</p><p>Trump has not ruled out using military force to take control of Greenland, and last month, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, who <a href=\"/news/2025/12/22/denmark-to-summon-us-ambassador-following-greenland-envoy-appointment\">publicly supports annexation</a>, was named as special envoy to the mineral-rich Arctic island.</p><p>Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, posted on Saturday the contentious image of the Danish autonomous territory in the colours of the US flag on her X feed.</p><p>Her post had a single word above it: “SOON”.</p><p>Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen called that post “disrespectful”.</p><p>“Relations between nations and peoples are built on mutual respect and international law – not on symbolic gestures that disregard our status and our rights,” he said on X.</p><p>He, however, added, “There is neither reason for panic nor for concern.

But the military did not provide evidence for the claim, and it was not clear if its statement referred to the tent attack.</p><p>Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have continued near-daily attacks on Gaza and have maintained restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid. Much of the enclave has been devastated by Israel’s genocidal war, with roughly 88 percent of buildings damaged or destroyed, Palestinian officials say.</p><p>Most of Gaza’s two million people are now living in tents, makeshift shelters or damaged buildings in areas vacated by Israeli troops.</p><p>The Palestinian Civil Defence said on Monday that another Palestinian home damaged in earlier Israeli strikes collapsed in the central Maghazi camp, killing a 29-year-old father and his eight-year-old son.</p><p>But the rescue service said in a subsequent statement that it was unable to respond to requests to remove hazards caused by damaged buildings because of a lack of equipment and continuing fuel shortages.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Gaza ceasefire, agreed upon after more than two years of Israeli attacks that killed more than 71,000 people, is being implemented in phases. The first stage includes exchanges of captives and prisoners, increased humanitarian aid and the reopening of Gaza’s Rafah border crossing with Egypt.</p><p>Hamas has freed all remaining living captives and returned dozens of bodies, except for one, while Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners, including some serving life sentences.</p><h2 id=\"hopes-for-rafah-crossing\">Hopes for Rafah crossing</h2><p>However, humanitarian groups say that Israeli restrictions continue to hamper aid deliveries, while Gaza’s Rafah crossing with Egypt remains closed. The crossing had long been Gaza’s only connection to the outside world until the Israeli military occupied the Palestinian side in May 2024.</p><p>Israel’s Kan broadcaster reported on January 1 that Israeli authorities are preparing to reopen the crossing in “both directions” following pressure from US President Donald Trump.</p><p>If confirmed, it would mark a shift from an earlier Israeli policy that stated the crossing would only open “exclusively for the exit of residents from the Gaza Strip to Egypt”. The policy drew condemnation from regional governments, including Egypt and Qatar, with officials warning against the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.</p><p>The latest Israeli report has left many Palestinians hopeful.</p><p>Tasnim Jaras, a student in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera that it was her “dream that the crossing opens so we can continue our education”.</p><p>Moaeen al-Jarousha, who was wounded in the war, said he needed to leave Gaza to receive medical treatment abroad. “I need immediate medical intervention. I live in very difficult conditions,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinians in Gaza have been waiting for the crossing to open for a long time.</p><p>“For many, this isn’t about travel, it’s about survival. Parents are asking about medical access they haven’t been able to obtain over the past two years. Students think of this as an opportunity to continue their education,” he said.</p><p>“And for many families, this is an opportunity to reunite with family members who have been separated for too long. But hope here is never simple. People here have heard about these announcements numerous times, and many recall how quickly it shut again,” he added.</p><p>Israel, meanwhile, continues to retain control of 53 percent of Gaza, and witnesses on Monday reported continued demolitions of residential homes in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City.</p><p>The Israeli military also said it attacked a Palestinian who had crossed the so-called “yellow line” – an unmarked boundary where the Israeli military repositioned itself when the truce came into effect – in southern Gaza on Monday with the aim of “removing the threat”. It did not provide evidence for the claim.</p><p>Israel also said it had carried out strikes against Hezbollah and Hamas targets in southern and eastern Lebanon.</p></div></div></body></html>"
