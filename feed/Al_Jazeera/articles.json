If the Israeli people can do it, we can also do it,” Chakravorty told the gathering, adding that the Modi government was “determined” to do so.</p><p>Six years later, Chakravorty’s words ring truer than ever. As Modi prepares for his second visit to Israel starting on February 25, the two countries are bound by more than just friendship, trade and military partnerships – they are increasingly, say some analysts, also joined at the hip in certain facets of their models of governance.</p><p>Under Modi, India has openly embraced Israel – at the <a href=\"/features/2026/2/23/how-modi-broke-down-walls-between-india-israel-at-palestines\">expense</a> of its longstanding support for the Palestinian cause, say analysts. But New Delhi, they add, also appears to have imported multiple elements of Israel’s security and administrative approach to Palestinians, and unleashed them into its domestic policies since Modi took power in 2014.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-17T084945Z_766476451_RC1AE9AD5D10_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771863278.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi Israel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu writes a message in the visitors’ book as his wife Sara and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi look on, during a visit to Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad, India, January 17, 2018 [Amit Dave/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hostile-subjects-under-occupation\">‘Hostile subjects under occupation’</h2><p>At the heart of these deepening ties, say analysts, is a shared ideological vision.</p><p>Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has roots in a philosophy, Hindutva, that seeks to turn India into a Hindu nation and a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – similar to Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland.</p><p>“The India-Israel relationship under Modi is a bond between two ideologies that see themselves as civilisational projects and Muslims as demographic and security threats,” said Azad Essa, author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel.</p><p>“The friendship works because they have similar supremacist ends,” Essa told Al Jazeera. “Under Modi, India and Israel became strategic partners, and Delhi began to see Israel as a template and as key to India’s move toward becoming a great power.”</p><p>One of the most apparent examples of India borrowing from Israel is the so-called “bulldozer justice” policy of Modi’s party.</p><p>Over the past decade, authorities in several BJP-ruled states have demolished the homes and shops of hundreds of Muslims and also razed multiple mosques. These demolitions have been carried out, for the most part, without legal notices being issued to occupants or owners of the establishments. They have usually followed religious tensions in the particular neighbourhood, or protests against Modi government policies – and sometimes, after just a local argument that had taken on religious overtones.</p><p>One of the BJP’s top leaders, Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, is now known by his supporters as “Bulldozer Baba” (Daddy Bulldozer).</p><p>It’s a leaf straight out of Israel’s playbook. Israel has demolished thousands of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and displaced their residents, making way for illegal Israeli settlements. And during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, almost all of the Palestinian territory’s homes, offices, hospitals, schools, universities and places of worship have been destroyed or badly damaged.</p><p>“The Hindu nationalist belief system is steeped in affinity for Zionism and Israel,” said Sumantra Bose, a political scientist whose work focuses on the intersection of nationalism and conflict in South Asia. “Generations of [Rashtriya SwayamSevak Sangh, the ideological fountainhead of the BJP] cadres, Modi included, have been indoctrinated in this ideology and have imbibed the love of Israel.”</p><p>The nation-state of Israel, which Bose characterised as majoritarian and supremacist, is the model Hindu nationalists are implementing in India in the Modi era, he argued. “The Israeli ideal finds reflection in many policies and measures of Modi’s government.”</p><p>Muslims in India have faced a range of social boycotts in recent years. It is increasingly difficult to rent a home, Muslim children often face bullying and harassment at school, and the community has mostly fled a number of villages after attacks.</p><p>In November 2024, India’s top court ruled that government authorities cannot demolish any property – even if belonging to people accused of a crime – without following due legal process. However, on the ground, such demolitions continue.</p><p>Essa, the author of Hostile Homelands, said both India and Israel use the bulldozing of homes and properties “to target and punish certain populations and underscore a political message to communities, including who may belong to the nation and who is an outsider”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332439\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332439\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332439\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-15T083553Z_1879430900_RC1CE343E010_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771863248.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C508&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi ISrael\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332439\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu adjusts his headphones as he and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi attend a signing of agreements ceremony at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, January 15, 2018 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"overarching-shadows-of-security-doctrine\">Overarching shadows of security doctrine</h2><p>At the forefront of India-Israel bilateral ties are their defence relations and an overlapping security doctrine. India is the largest buyer of Israeli weapons, pumping in billions of dollars in purchases.</p><p>India has also supplied weapons to Israel amid its ongoing genocidal war on Gaza. Israel has provided joint training sessions for Indian soldiers with the Israeli army, alongside a wide array of Israeli systems, including UAVs, air defence systems, and advanced radar and surveillance technology.</p><p>But among advocates of a deeply securitised Indian state, Israel has long had an appeal that extends far beyond its supply of advanced weapons.</p><p>After gunmen killed 26 civilians in the tourist town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22, 2025, India bombed multiple locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, accusing Islamabad of being behind the attack on tourists.</p><p>Pakistan, which denied any role, hit back, firing missiles and drones as the nuclear-armed neighbours engaged in an intense four-day air war.</p><p>During that period, debates and shows on several Indian TV news channels were rife with references to Israel after the attack in Kashmir. Arnab Goswami, an anchor, stated: “22 April is to India what 7 October was to the Israelis,” referring to the day when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel in 2023. A guest on the programme said, “We demand we turn Pakistan into Gaza.”</p><p>A retired top policeman, who was posted in Indian-administered Kashmir, told a Hindi newspaper that “we must respond like Israel.”</p><p>Among Israel’s most controversial security exports to India is the sophisticated spyware, Pegasus, made by the Israeli software firm NSO Group.</p><p>Siddharth Varadarajan, cofounder of The Wire, a nonprofit news website publishing from New Delhi, was one of the journalists targeted by the spyware that an Israeli firm reportedly sold to the Modi government under an undisclosed defence deal.</p><p>“[The Israeli spyware] turns an iPhone into a personal spying device,” Varadarajan told Al Jazeera, recounting his experience, adding that it could secretly record and transmit video and photographs.</p><p>“This Israeli model of using spyware to keep an eye on any possible arena of opposition or criticism is something that the Modi government has adopted and embraced wholeheartedly,” he said.</p><p>India’s Supreme Court appointed an expert committee, which found malware in some phones but said it could not conclusively attribute it to Pegasus, citing limited cooperation from the Modi government.</p><p>Varadarajan said that even if some repressive ideas are not exclusively Israeli, the Indian government has been “a happy adopter”. India ranks at the top among democracies that impose internet restrictions, and the country has slid in multiple democracy indices in recent years.</p><p>Referring to the overlapping patterns in India and Israel’s policies, Varadarajan said, “It is a great pity that methods that the Israelis use against occupied people are being used by the Modi government against its own citizens.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4299762\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4299762\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299762\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-08T163436Z_723218502_RC2P7JA6BDJI_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-1770628461.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"West Bank\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4299762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Palestinian woman ushers her children away from a group of Israeli soldiers during a weekly settlers’ tour in Hebron, in the Israeli‑occupied West Bank, January 24, 2026 [Mussa Qawasma/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"treat-populations-like-external-threats\">‘Treat populations like external threats’</h2><p>To be sure, India has long battled a series of internal security challenges of its own, as it has tried to unify and hold together a large and diverse landmass: Separatist movements have ranged from its northeast to Kashmir. In 1966, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered helicopter gunships to bomb parts of the northeastern state of Mizoram to quell a rebel movement.</p><p>Other regions, especially India’s deep south, have long worried about the Hindi-speaking north trying to dominate them culturally – this has led to sporadic tussles over language and resources.</p><p>But amid all of that, “what Israel has done is help provide India with the technology and expertise to become more oppressive, authoritarian, and militarised, like Israel,” Essa told Al Jazeera. “And these methods are all-encompassing: They treat populations as external threats.”</p><p>Nowhere is that clearer than in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>One of the world’s most militarised zones, Kashmir has since August 2019 been stripped of not just its earlier semi-autonomous status, but of most democratic power – as a region – that other provincial authorities have. The Modi government’s move to kill political dialogue or diplomatic engagement when it comes to Kashmir also mirrors Israel’s approach, said Bose, also a professor of international politics at Krea University, in India.</p><p>“It echoes Netanyahu’s approach of rejection and non-engagement with the Palestinians and the exclusive reliance on military power,” he added.</p><p>To be sure, Kashmir and Palestine have a very distinct past and present. Still, India’s approach to Kashmir increasingly carries parallels with Israel’s treatment of the West Bank, said Essa.</p><p>“There is the militarisation, population management, and the legal regimes that allow both India and Israel to conduct their occupations and maintain daily control over the people – from checkpoints to raids and communication blackouts,” Essa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Like the occupied West Bank, India maintains Kashmir in a state of almost permanent emergency, where military presence, surveillance, and extraordinary legal powers shape everyday life,” he argued. “And like the West Bank, daily governance in Kashmir is outsourced to local administrators with limited real power.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Afghan Ministry of Defence said the strikes hit a religious school and residential homes, killing and wounding dozens, including women and children. Afghan sources told Al Jazeera that at least 17 people were killed in Nangarhar alone. Kabul pledged a “measured and appropriate response”.</p><p>Later on Sunday, India entered the picture, condemning the Pakistani military action and throwing in its support for Afghanistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p>“India strongly condemns Pakistan’s airstrikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal <a href=\"https://x.com/MEAIndia/status/2025602055684108325?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>.</p><p>“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” he said.</p><p>In many ways, the statement from New Delhi underscored the unease in Islamabad over India’s growing engagement with Taliban-ruled Afghanistan — an emerging partnership between two countries that Pakistan has repeatedly blamed in recent months for its domestic security turmoil.</p><h2 id=\"breaking-point\">Breaking point</h2><p>Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, in a statement issued on Sunday, said it had “conclusive evidence” that the recent attacks on its soil were carried out by fighters and suicide bombers acting on the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers.”</p><p>It said Islamabad had repeatedly urged Kabul to take verifiable steps to prevent armed groups from using Afghan soil, but that no substantive action had followed.</p><p>“Pakistan has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region,” the <a href=\"https://x.com/MoIB_Official/status/2025316690855354804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2025316690855354804%7Ctwgr%5E7b39f2f3cec4e4b436768e9a65ffdfd38d299f73%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.aljazeera.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D4331765action%3Dedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> read, “but the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remain its top priority.”</p><p>Pakistan’s attack shattered a fragile ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye after talks in <a href=\"/news/2025/10/30/pakistan-afghanistan-to-resume-talks-amid-tensions-over-border-clashes\">October</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/10/29/last-ditch-push-pakistan-afghanistan-talks-falter-amid-deep-mistrust\">November</a>, following earlier rounds of deadly border clashes. The discussions last year had failed to produce a formal peace agreement, and calm along the frontier remained tenuous.</p><p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has repeatedly rejected allegations that it is supporting armed groups that attack Pakistan.</p><p>But as far back as October last year, the Pakistan military’s spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, had warned that Islamabad’s patience was wearing thin.</p><p>“Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations against Pakistan, and there is proof and evidence of that. The necessary measures that should be taken to protect the lives and property of the people of Pakistan will be taken and will continue to be taken,” he said during a press briefing, without presenting evidence publicly.</p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, after a suicide bombing outside a district court in Islamabad in November, had also stressed the need for cooperation from Kabul.</p><p>“Afghanistan must understand that lasting peace can only be realised by reining in TTP and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"left-between-bad-and-worse-options\">‘Left between bad and worse options’</h2><p>The TTP, which emerged in 2007, is distinct from the Taliban in Afghanistan but shares deep ideological, social and linguistic ties with the group. Pakistan accuses the Taliban of providing sanctuary to the TTP on Afghan soil, a charge Kabul denies.</p><p>Abdul Basit, a scholar at the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said Pakistan’s attack confirms the collapse of the temporary ceasefire that followed the talks late last year.</p><p>Basit questioned the logic behind Pakistan’s bombings.</p><p>“The more Pakistan will strike in Afghanistan, the more Kabul and TTP will come closer,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>At the same time, Basit said, he understood Pakistan’s dilemma. “They have to retaliate after losing so many security personnel,” he said, describing Pakistan as being “left between bad and worse options”.</p><p>The losses for Pakistan in recent months have been steep. Last year was among the deadliest in nearly a decade, with 699 attacks recorded nationwide, a 34 percent increase from the previous year, according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><p>Its 2025 security report said at least 1,034 people were killed in the renewed wave of violence, marking a 21 percent rise in “terrorism-related fatalities”. “In addition, 1,366 people were injured over the course of the year, underscoring the growing human cost of terrorism,” the report said.</p><p>Cross-border air raids are not new. A similar operation in December 2024 killed at least 46 people, most of them civilians. That episode prompted sharp warnings from Kabul, but attacks on Pakistani soil — blamed by Islamabad on the TTP — continued.</p><p>Some experts said Pakistan’s strategy needed to involve more than military pressure on the Taliban.</p><p>Fahad Nabeel, who heads the Islamabad-based research consultancy Geopolitical Insights, said Pakistan must also work to build goodwill among Afghans.</p><p>“Reopening the border and resuming bilateral trade are two possible measures that Pakistan can adopt. Pakistan also needs to share actionable intelligence with allied countries like China, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkiye to increase pressure on the Afghan Taliban to act against anti-Pakistan militant groups,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"the-india-question\">The India question</h2><p>An intriguing dimension of the crisis has been not only who Pakistan targeted, but who responded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331802\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331802\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331802\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_699c22b308-1771840179.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"NEW DELHI, INDIA - OCTOBER 12: Afghanistan's Taliban Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, adresses media at a press conference on October 12, 2025 in New Delhi, India.

He offered no public evidence to back his claims.</p><p>Basit said while Pakistan’s attacks on Afghanistan would amount to “India’s gain” — drawing the Taliban and New Delhi closer, with a shared enemy in Islamabad — India faced limitations imposed by geography. “It can provide humanitarian support to Afghanistan, but nothing more than that,” he said.</p><p>Still, Nabeel argued, Pakistani policymakers need clarity on how to address armed groups operating from Afghan soil.</p><p>“Pakistan cannot afford to keep both borders [with Afghanistan and India] engaged at a time when the prospects of military confrontation between the US and Iran are growing with each passing day,” he said, referring to rising tensions in the Middle East.</p><h2 id=\"narrowing-options\">Narrowing options</h2><p>Pakistan’s eastern border with India has remained tense since the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/14/what-did-india-and-pakistan-gain-and-lose-in-their-military-standoff\">two countries had</a> a four-day military confrontation in May last year after an attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed. India blamed Pakistan, which denied any role.</p><p>To the west, the Taliban government shows little sign of acting decisively against the TTP, say Pakistani officials. At home, a surge in attacks, including in big cities, has intensified public pressure on the military to respond forcefully.</p><p>Sunday’s air raids were intended to project strength to Kabul, say experts. Whether they amount to a coherent long-term strategy is less clear, especially as the Taliban has pledged retaliation.</p><p>But Basit pointed out that the Taliban leadership also needs to project strength domestically and respond to entrenched “anti-Pakistan sentiment” among Afghans.</p><p>“Kabul is well within its rights to respond, considering it is a matter of their own sovereignty, but also because by doing that, the public will rally behind them and increase their domestic legitimacy, as we saw in the last cycle of attacks,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Minister for Restoration of Ukraine Oleksii Kuleba said Russia had attacked port infrastructure in Odesa.</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Seven police officers have been injured, two of them seriously, in an explosion in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv, the head of the national police, Ivan Vyhivskyi, said. In a Facebook post, Vyhivskyi wrote that the attack, which was the second involving police in three days, was “not a coincidence” and carried out to “deliberately” kill officers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">An explosion also hit a city police station in the southeastern city of Dnipro, smashing windows and damaging furnishings inside. No injuries were reported, and police did not comment on what might have caused the explosion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Ukrainian drones have struck a Russian pumping station serving the Druzhba oil pipeline, set up to supply Moscow’s crude to Eastern Europe, a Ukrainian security official said.

Here’s what to expect from Trump’s State of the Union.</p><h2 id=\"when-and-where-will-the-speech-be\">When and where will the speech be?</h2><p>Trump will deliver the speech at 9pm local time (02:00 GMT, Wednesday) in front of members of the 100-member Senate and 435-seat House.</p><p>The speech will take place from the podium in the House chamber, with Trump likely flanked by Vice President JD Vance and the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson, as is tradition.</p><p></p><p>Johnson officially “invited” Trump to deliver the speech last month.</p><p>Under the US Constitution, presidents are required from “time to time” to give Congress “information of the State of the Union” and outline the legislative agenda the White House considers to be “necessary and expedient”.</p><h2 id=\"will-focus-be-on-economy\">Will focus be on economy?</h2><p>In 1992, in summing up the top concern for US voters, Democratic strategist James Carville famously quipped: “It’s the economy, stupid.”</p><p>The assessment has proven enduring. Exit polling suggested Trump’s success in the 2024 election was due, in no small part, to voter concerns over the cost of living, with the US economy still experiencing high inflation and soaring prices as knock-ons from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Trump has <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/18/trump-mcdonalds-lower-prices\">regularly touted</a> the strength of the US economy, but several metrics have shown a mixed bag: relatively strong performance by Wall Street, steady job numbers, but, as announced last week, slower-than-forecasted gross domestic product (GDP) growth at the end of 2025.</p><p>Trump’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/12/trump-names-conservative-economist-to-lead-labour-statistics-agency\">move last year to fire</a> Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, baselessly accusing her of producing inaccurate labour statistics, has further stoked concerns over federal government data and reporting on the economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the administration’s hyperbolic assessments have run up against a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/19/the-us-economy-seems-strong-after-a-year-of-trump-but-is-it-really\">harsh reality</a>: Many US voters have not seen the gains Trump has claimed reflected in their lived experience.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has signalled that he will again send a message that his administration has overcome the country’s “affordability” woes, which he has portrayed as a Democratic bogeyman.</p><p>Public opinion polls indicate otherwise, with a Quinnipiac University poll released in early February showing that just 39 percent of registered voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 56 percent disapprove.</p><p>An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released in December found approval on the issue sat at about 36 percent, the lowest rating for a president over the question’s six-year history.</p><p>“I have to listen to the ‘fake news’ talking about affordability,” Trump said during a speech in Georgia last week.</p><p>“I’ve won affordability,” he added. “I had to go out and talk about it.”</p><h2 id=\"major-blow-to-trade-policy-but-trump-still-defiant\">Major blow to trade policy, but Trump still defiant</h2><p>Trump’s speech comes after he received one of the most substantial blows yet to his policy agenda, with the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-global-tariffs\">Supreme Court rejecting</a> the president’s premise that US trade deficits represented an “emergency” for the country’s national security.</p><p>Trump’s wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs had roiled lawmakers within his own Republican Party, representing a rare area of bipartisan support for checking Trump’s broad interpretation of his executive power.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump has made it clear that he will continue to impose tariffs on imports using existing US laws, rather than emergency powers.</p><p>“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs,” the US president wrote in a social media post on Monday. “It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”</p><p>The US Bureau of Economic Analysis last week reported that the US <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/19/us-trade-deficit-swells-in-december-as-imports-surge\">trade deficit</a> continued to grow in 2025 despite the administration’s new policies, recording a 2.1 percent increase from 2024.</p><h2 id=\"deportation-drive\">Deportation drive</h2><p>Also closely watched will be how Trump approaches his government’s aggressive policies on immigration, which have seen the administration transform legal immigration, as well as refugee and asylum programmes, while undertaking a no-holds-barred mass deportation drive.</p><p>The first months of Trump’s second term have seen immigration and other federal agents surge to communities across the country, employing what advocates have called a “dragnet” approach, which has increasingly ensnared long-term undocumented residents with no criminal records.</p><p>Critics have further accused the administration of taking increasingly dire measures to meet sky-high immigration detention quotas, sparking outrage and protests among US citizens.</p><p>In January, two US citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by immigration agents in separate incidents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with the Trump administration initially offering <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/trump-administration-maga-allies-spread-misinformation-on-pretti-killing\">accounts of the killings</a> that diverged from video evidence.</p><p>Federal authorities have continued to freeze out independent state investigators from the probes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The issue has emerged as an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/trumps-approval-on-immigration-falls-to-record-low-new-poll-finds\">unexpected vulnerability</a> for Republicans heading into the midterms. While stricter immigration enforcement, on its face, maintains wide support among some segments of voters, public opinion polls have shown widespread dismay over the Trump administration’s actions.</p><p>In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late January, 53 percent of respondents disapproved of Trump’s handling of immigration, up from 41 percent shortly after he took office. Meanwhile, 58 percent said immigration agents had gone too far. The poll was conducted after Good’s January 7 killing, and bridged the time period before and after Pretti’s January 24 killing.</p><p>An Associated Press-NORC poll released in February suggested that 62 percent of Americans felt Trump’s deployments of immigration agents to cities across the country had gone too far.</p><p>Immigration raids have also become a key issue in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/catch-of-the-day-trump-launches-new-ice-immigration-crackdown-in-maine\">states like Maine</a>, where the Trump administration launched, and then backed away from, a major operation earlier this month.</p><p>Maine’s Republican Senator Susan Collins is considered one of the most vulnerable for the party in November.</p><h2 id=\"spectre-of-war\">Spectre of war</h2><p>Then there are the soaring tensions with Iran, which have seen the Trump administration lob repeated threats as it surged the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/iran-says-us-military-build-up-unnecessary-and-unhelpful-deal-achievable\">largest collection of military assets</a> to the Middle East since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p>On February 19, Trump said he would take 10 to 15 days to decide whether to strike. It is an uncomfortable juxtaposition for a president who <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/trump-undermined-antiwar-vows-in-first-year-will-democrats-seize-on-this\">came into office decrying</a> decades of US “foreign entanglement”, as well as Washington’s past involvement in foreign regime change and “endless wars”.</p><p>Trump had already launched strikes on Iran in June last year, capping a 12-day war between Iran and Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon has launched a bombing campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, increased strikes in Somalia, Nigeria and Syria, and killed at least 145 people in strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, in an operation described by rights observers as extrajudicial killings.</p><p>The Trump administration began the year with the extraordinary US military abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a move decried as a flagrant violation of international law and sovereignty.</p><p>Trump is set to speak as a set of US lawmakers has again pledged to introduce a so-called “War Powers resolution” that would rein in Trump’s ability to strike Iran without congressional approval.</p><p>A similar resolution on Venezuela narrowly failed in January, as a handful of Republican holdouts folded.</p><p>Trump also announced last week that the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/trump-announces-billions-of-dollars-in-gaza-aid-at-board-of-peace-meeting\">US was committing $10bn</a> to his so-called Board of Peace, a panel meant to focus on reconstruction and rehabilitation in Gaza, for which Trump has envisioned a wider global role.</p><p>But while the president has been pushing to involve US allies in the Middle East in the future of Gaza, his administration’s staunch support for Israel’s right-wing government is causing friction with some Arab countries.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have expressed outrage at US Ambassador <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/us-envoy-huckabee-tries-to-deny-saying-he-would-support-israel-expansionism\">Mike Huckabee</a> over the past few days for suggesting that it would be “fine” for Israel to take over most of the Middle East.</p><h2 id=\"democratic-response-and-epstein-guests\">Democratic response and Epstein guests</h2><p>Democrats have tapped Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger to deliver the party’s response to the president’s address, which has become a tradition in the US.</p><p>The choice underscores the narrative Democrats hope to establish going into the midterms: one of stable pragmatism in the face of Trump’s policies of upheaval.</p><p>The selection of Spanberger, a former member of Congress and CIA agent, steers away from the more progressive flank of the party, embodied in figures like New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani.</p><p>Spanberger, who has faced criticism from progressives for her past support of Israel and stances on law enforcement, won her race against incumbent Governor Glenn Youngkin last year by a resounding 15 points, energising beliefs that her brand of affordability-focused politics can make inroads against vulnerable Republicans.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The governor has said she will address “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring”.</p><p>At least 12 Democrats, meanwhile, have said they will boycott Trump’s State of the Union and instead attend a counter-programming event on the National Mall, hosted by the progressive MoveOn and MeidasTouch groups.</p><p>“These aren’t normal times and showing up for this speech puts a veneer of legitimacy on the corruption and lawlessness that has defined his second term,” US Senator Chris Murphy, who is among those boycotting, said in a statement.</p><p>Representatives Jamie Raskin and Suhas Subramanyam have announced they will attend Trump’s address with family members of Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>It comes as Democrats continue to heap <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/ex-prince-andrews-arrest-spurs-epstein-accountability-calls-from-uk-to-us\">pressure on the administration</a> for accountability related to the sex trafficking ring that the financier, who was found dead by apparent suicide in 2019, was criminally charged with running.</p><h2 id=\"get-ready-to-weave\">Get ready to ‘weave’</h2><p>As with any of Trump’s public events, expect the unexpected.</p><p>The US president rarely stays on script, instead dipping into tangents, meandering stories, and lengthy exposition on personal and political vendettas.</p><p>During his 2024 presidential campaign, as Trump’s ubiquitous stump speeches often dragged on late into the night, he dubbed his rhetorical style “the weave”.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Zelenskyy.</p><p>Fico’s announcement on Monday came two days after he warned Zelenskyy on social media that he would ask state-owned company SEPS to halt emergency supplies of electricity if flows of Russian crude oil via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline crossing Ukraine did not resume.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“As of today, if the Ukrainian side turns to Slovakia with a request for assistance in stabilising the Ukrainian energy grid, such assistance will not be provided,” Fico said in a video on his Facebook page.</p><p>Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said in a statement that it had not been officially informed yet, but that it would “not affect the situation in the unified power system of Ukraine”.</p><p>“The last time Ukraine requested emergency assistance from Slovakia was over a month ago and in a very limited volume,” it said.</p><p>Fico said the stoppage would be lifted “as soon as the transit of oil to Slovakia is restored”.</p><p>“Otherwise, we will take further reciprocal steps,” he said, adding his country would also reconsider “its previously constructive positions on Ukraine’s EU membership”.</p><p>He said the stalled oil supply was a “purely political decision aimed at blackmailing Slovakia over its international positions on the war in Ukraine”.</p><p>Slovakia and neighbouring Hungary, which have both remained dependent on Russian oil since the Kremlin launched its <a href=\"/features/2026/2/20/ukraines-patience-with-us-peace-push-wears-thin-as-russia-skirts-pressure\">invasion of Ukraine</a> almost four years ago, have become increasingly vocal in demanding that Kyiv resume deliveries through the Druzhba pipeline, which was shut down after what Ukraine said was a Russian drone strike hit infrastructure in late January.</p><p>Ukraine says it is fixing the damage on the pipeline, which still carries Russian oil over Ukrainian territory to Europe, as fast as it can.</p><p>Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage and have declared emergencies over the cut in oil deliveries.</p><p>The EU imposed a ban on most oil imports from Russia in 2022, but the Druzhba pipeline was exempted to give landlocked Central European countries time to find alternative oil supplies.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Union failed to agree on new sanctions on Russia for the fourth anniversary of Europe’s biggest war since World War II, after Hungary vetoed the move.</p><p>Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban – the friendliest EU leader to the Kremlin – is stalling the sanctions and a 90-billion-euro ($106bn) EU loan to Ukraine until Kyiv reopens the oil pipeline.</p><p>Fico also said he has refused to “involve the Slovak Republic” in the latest EU loan due to Zelenskyy’s “unacceptable behaviour”, alluding to Ukraine’s earlier halting of <a href=\"/news/2025/1/1/russian-gas-flow-to-europe-via-ukraine-stopped-who-does-it-hurt\">Russian gas</a> supplies after a five-year-old transit agreement expired on January 1, 2025, which Fico claimed is costing Slovakia “damages of 500 million [euros; $590m] per year”.</p><p>Hungary and Slovakia have accounted for 68 percent of Ukraine’s imported power this month, according to Kyiv-based consultancy ExPro. It was not immediately clear if emergency electricity supplies were included in that figure.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago! They were also just reaffirmed by the ridiculous and poorly crafted supreme court decision!” Trump said in the post.</p><p>Trump does have some authority to impose other tariffs, but they are much more limited.</p><p>Following the court’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-global-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">6–3 decision</a> on Friday, the president said he would introduce a 10 percent tariff, raising it to 15 percent by Saturday under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, the maximum limit under the statute that enables the White House to impose tariffs for 150 days.</p><p>The statute only requires a presidential declaration and does not require further investigation. Section 122 is only temporary; the tariffs would then expire unless Congress extends them.</p><p>Trump’s tariffs are overwhelmingly unpopular. A new Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of tariffs.</p><h2 id=\"looming-uncertainty\">Looming uncertainty</h2><p>Experts warn that Trump’s newly imposed tariffs will fuel further economic uncertainty.</p><p>“What we do know is that it would continue to require all those parties affected to continue to live in uncertainty and, as many have already pointed out, such uncertainty is not good for our economy and has negative impacts on American consumers,” Max Kulyk, partner and CEO of Chicory Wealth, a private wealth advisory firm, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It’s impossible to plan. You hear that tariffs are off, and you are considering how to get refunds. Then a few hours later, it’s 10 percent. Then it’s 15 percent the next day…. Not having that stable framework is hurtful for activity, hiring, investment,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told the Reuters news agency.</p><p>Gold, which is considered a safe investment in times of economic uncertainty, surged by 2 percent on Monday, hitting a three-week high as tariff pressures remain unclear.</p><p>US markets are also taking a hit. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 1.1 percent in midday trading. The S&amp;P 500 is also down by 1 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped by 1.5 percent since the market opened on Monday.</p><h2 id=\"stalling-trade-deals\">Stalling trade deals</h2><p>Trump’s erratic approach has also deterred movement on looming trade deals.</p><p>On Monday, the European Parliament opted to postpone voting on a trade deal with the US. It is the second time the bloc has pushed back the vote. The first was in protest against Trump’s unsolicited attempts to acquire Greenland.</p><p>The assembly had been considering removing several European Union import duties on US goods. Committee chair Bernd Lange said the new temporary US tariff could mean increased levies for some EU exports, and no one knew what would happen after they expire in 150 days. EU lawmakers will reconvene on March 4 to assess if the US has clarified the situation and confirmed its commitment to last year’s deal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

to guarantee peace and security of all the population, of all of Mexico,” Sheinbaum said, adding that conditions have improved and Mexico “is calm” after the Sunday raid that killed <a

href=\"/news/2026/2/23/who-was-el-mencho-what-drug-lords-killing-means-for-mexico\">killing of Mencho</a> comes as Mexico is under growing pressure from the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/not-going-to-happen-sheinbaum-dismisses-trump-threat-of-mexico-strikes\">United States</a> to take a more aggressive stance towards drug-trafficking groups, although the killing of top-level <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/who-are-mexicos-top-cartel-bosses-killed-or-arrested-in-recent-years\">cartel figures</a> in the past has had little impact on the drug trade and has often created a leadership vacuum that others violently act to fill.</p><p>The raid also set off a wave of reprisal attacks and impromptu roadblocks that have spread fear and uncertainty through Mexico, where criminal groups violently jostle for control of territory.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Garcia Harfuch said that the 25 members of the National Guard were killed in six incidents across Jalisco, adding that 30 people he described as criminal suspects were also killed in the clashes, along with four in Michoacan.</p><p>“First there was a huge gun battle, and then another, and another,” an anonymous resident of the town of Aguililla in Michoacan told the news service AFP, saying that cartel gunmen attacked a local outpost of soldiers on Sunday. “But they couldn’t advance because the soldiers stopped them.”</p><p>Defence Secretary Ricardo Trevilla said that an additional 2,500 security force members would be sent to Jalisco to reinforce the armed forces already deployed there, and Sheinbaum said that all of the more than 250 roadblocks erected across 20 states in response to the raid have been removed.</p><p>Mexican officials have sought to downplay the prospect of long-term disruptions stemming from the raid, with Sheinbaum saying that flights to and from Puerto Vallarta, located in the state of Jalisco, are expected to resume on Monday or Tuesday.</p><p>“In Puerto Vallarta, flights continue to be disrupted due to availability of flight crews. The Embassy is in close contact with airlines to monitor their plans,” the US Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs said in a social media post on Monday. “All other airports in Mexico are open, and most airports are operating normally. If you are traveling via any airport other than Guadalajara or Puerto Vallarta, we have received no indication of any security-related flight disruptions.”</p><p>The Mexican Embassy to the US has shared social media posts debunking online rumours of attacks on civilians at Guadalajara airport and US tourists being held hostage.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Later that evening, in Riad al-Solh Square, around 50 or so protesters gathered to express their discontent with the government’s decision.</p><p>“You have no housing, you have no loans, you have no safety, I mean, you live here in a prison, brother,” one angry protester told Lebanese television station Al Jadeed from the Ring Bridge protest.</p><p>His comments represent the frustration felt by many Lebanese – that the tax increases are yet another indignity the population must live through, including <span><a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/one-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-largest-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">near-daily </a><a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/one-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-largest-palestinian-refugee-camp-in-lebanon\">Israeli attacks</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/2/9/heres-how-israel-is-repeatedly-violating-the-lebanon-ceasefire\">violations of the 2024 ceasefire</a>, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/2/20/residents-in-northern-lebanon-terrified-their-buildings-will-collapse\">collapsing buildings in the north</a>, and an ongoing <a href=\"/news/2025/3/10/whats-happening-with-lebanons-economy-and-will-it-recover\">economic</a> crisis since 2019.</span></p><h2 id=\"salam-doubles-down\">Salam doubles down</h2><p>The last time a tax spike sent Lebanese people to the streets was in 2019. Anger in Lebanon had boiled after decades of economic and political mismanagement by the government. Then, as the country’s economy started collapsing, the government tried to implement a series of taxes, including on WhatsApp calls.</p><p>The response was widespread protests that collapsed the government, led at the time by then-Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. But they failed to dislodge the wider sectarian system that many activists and experts say plagues Lebanon and prevents reform.</p><p>Last week’s protests were on a far smaller scale than 2019, however.</p><p>Then, protesters forced the government to walk back the taxes. But Salam, the prime minister, defended the tax hike on Friday. The government’s argument is that the taxes are necessary to pay salaries and pensions for state employees and retirees.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“We had to find a quick source to fund the raises,” he said. “These are exceptional measures… but the government wants to reform the tax system, not just impose new taxes.”</p><p>Salam also said that his government inherited a “very difficult” financial situation and promised that he would rebuild trust between the state and the people by working to establish a fair tax system.</p><p>Lebanon’s Finance Minister Yassine Jaber said the fuel price increase would take effect immediately, but that VAT increases would need parliament’s approval.</p><p>“More than 50 per cent of the budget today is allocated to salaries, and it was necessary to take steps to secure the funds,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"vat-is-a-regressive-tax\">VAT is a regressive tax</h2><p>But not everyone agreed with the decision, including some ministers themselves. The right-wing Lebanese Forces bloc – which is part of the government coalition – voiced objection to the tax increase, calling for a study of the impacts.</p><p>Analysts, meanwhile, were heavily critical of the tax increase. They said that the rise of petrol prices and VAT would punish the country’s most vulnerable and would further widen the gap between rich and poor in Lebanon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The people who are most affected by value-added taxes are usually the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable, given the type of their consumption, which is mostly filled of the goods and the services that are affected by taxation, and whereby the proportion of the taxation is significant,” Farah al-Shami, senior fellow and programme director for Social Protection at the Arab Reform Initiative, told Al Jazeera. “VAT is by nature the most regressive type of taxation. Studies have shown that it affects the full supply chain, meaning everything that goes into the production, for example, of a certain good is affected.”</p><p>A price increase at every step of the supply chain means that prices compound to end up being more expensive for consumers.</p><p>In 2019, decades of government mismanagement of the economy ended in the collapse of the banking sector and the depreciation of the Lebanese pound by over 90 percent. Before 2019, $1 was equivalent to 1,500 Lebanese pounds, whereas now $1 is valued at nearly 89,500 Lebanese pounds.</p><p>Many lost their life savings with the currency freefall. Banks quickly shut their doors and limited withdrawals. More than six years later, many Lebanese have not recovered, nor has the economy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"scandalous-undertaxing\">Scandalous undertaxing</h2><p>The high cost of living is a regular talking point among Lebanese, particularly in the capital, Beirut. Many are struggling to make ends meet and rely on the $5.8bn in remittances from family or contacts abroad (these are 2024 figures).</p><p>With so many struggling, a tax increase that impacts the entire population is a recipe for anger. And analysts said that if the government is in need of tax revenue, there are plenty of undertaxed sources to draw from.</p><p>“Property in Lebanon remains scandalously undertaxed,” Dania Arayssi, a senior analyst at New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy Luxury, told Al Jazeera. “Real estate in Beirut — some of the most expensive per square metre in the region — generates a fraction of the public revenue it could and should. Capital gains on property are minimal. Wealth held in land and assets is effectively sheltered. Similarly, luxury goods face no meaningful additional burden.”</p><p>Fouad Debs, a lawyer and member of the Depositors Union, a group founded after the 2019 banking crisis to protect the rights of depositors, said the decision went against the government’s stated goals of reform.</p><p>“All of this is to keep the [current] system intact and save the banks, instead of having them also pay the taxes that they should pay,” Debs said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

If it wasn’t Turkiye, it would be Iraq. If it wasn’t Iraq, it would be Hezbollah. If it wasn’t Hezbollah, it would be the Muslim Brotherhood. It doesn’t matter who. There just always needs to be a threat.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"worsening-relations\">Worsening relations</h2><p>Israel has existed in a heightened state of war since the attack led by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Since then, Israel has carried out a genocide in Gaza, invaded Lebanon, bombed Yemen, occupied parts of Syria, launched a war against regional power Iran, and most recently defied global opinion and international law by moving closer to annexing territory in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Against this background, analysts explained, talk of more threats – such as the one from Turkiye – and fresh alliances are cast from the same mould. Despite being political opponents, Netanyahu and Bennett are both right-wing Israelis who are completely opposed to a Palestinian state, and who share similar beliefs on pushing for Israeli regional hegemony.</p><p>“This has always been what Naftali Bennett has been about,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said.</p><p>“Liberal [Israelis] have been projecting their own hopes onto him for years, simply because he was an opponent of Benjamin Netanyahu. That’s to miss the point,” he said, referencing both men’s apparent contempt for Palestinians. “He isn’t even pretending now. He’s just trying to overtake Netanyahu on his right.”</p><p>But a focus on Turkiye as a threat is both complicated – the two countries have a decades-long relationship, and Turkiye is a member of NATO – while also an understandable objective for an Israeli right keen to ensure that a new bogeyman exists.</p><p>While Israel has had an antagonistic relationship with Iran since the latter’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, Israel-Turkiye relations have been more pragmatic, with Israel’s continued repression of Palestinians historically often a point of negotiated dispute, rather than open threats spurring aggressively hostile rhetoric.</p><p>However, since coming to power in the early 2000s, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been increasingly critical of Israel.</p><p>Israel’s attack on a flotilla travelling to Gaza in 2010, ultimately killing 10 Turkish activists, was one of the defining moments in the relationship’s downturn, with fierce political rhetoric and diplomatic downgrades following.</p><p>Subsequent Israeli military operations in Gaza and Syria have further fuelled public and government anger in Turkiye, with Ankara adopting an increasingly confrontational stance to Israel’s genocide and territorial ambitions, leaving bilateral ties strained and the suggestion of Turkiye’s involvement in Gaza’s proposed interim security force politically toxic in Israel.</p><p>But beyond their clear opposition to Israel, comparisons between Ankara and Tehran border upon the ludicrous, analysts said.</p><p>“Israel has worked alongside Turkiye numerous times,” said Pinkas. “It wasn’t all that long ago that policymakers in Israel talked of the Middle East being overseen by two superpowers, Israel and Turkiye, in opposition to Iran. And now they’re trying to supplant Iran with Turkiye? What are they talking about, armed conflict? Turkiye is a NATO power.”</p><p>Pinkas noted further points of difference. “Has the leadership in Turkiye ever denied Israel’s right to exist, or threatened to wipe it from the map?” he asked.</p><p>“No,” he said. “It’s ridiculous.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hexagonal-alliances\">Hexagonal alliances</h2><p>While the alliance with the US is ultimately Israel’s biggest protection, it has also sought to broaden its network.</p><p>At the forefront of this, Netanyahu explained, would be the support of India’s Modi and what he described as a “hexagon” of allied states, including India, the aforementioned Greece and Cyprus, and various unspecified Arab, African, and Asian nations.</p><p>“The intention here is to create an axis of nations that see eye to eye on the reality, challenges, and goals against the radical axes, both the radical Shia axis, which we have struck very hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis,” Netanyahu said, without specifying the “radical” states he was referring to.</p><p>Netanyahu stressed that his proposed new hexagon of alliances was intended to complement, rather than replace, Israel’s typical reliance on the US. But <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/some-israel-question-influence-over-us-iran-war-decision-nears\">some believe</a> – as support for Israel is becoming more politically toxic in the US – that Tel Aviv now needs to hedge its bets.</p><p>Political analyst Goldberg called the moves by Netanyahu “desperate”.</p><p>“All of this because we’ve burnt through past alliances with Russia and now the United States, so we’re [now] claiming that India will be leading this hexagon of ‘moderate states’,” Goldberg said. “Not even people in Israel, not even the most deluded, have any belief that Israel might still be a moderate state.”</p><p>And the talk of the Turkish threat and hexagonal alliances was evidence that Israel is not as central to decision-making on any US attack on Iran, said Yossi Mekelberg, an expert with Chatham House.</p><p>“It’s all deflection; there just isn’t any honesty, and it just gets worse and worse,” Mekelberg said of Netanyahu’s framing of events. “The big issue is Iran. [That is] what they’re interested in. Turkiye is just so much noise.”</p><p>While the intention may be to distract by talking up the Turkish threat, it still carries risks, Mekelberg cautioned.</p><p>“Most leaders, at least the devious ones, can separate rhetoric and reality, so there’s no real chance of one spilling over into the other,” he said. “The risk is that as Israel ramps up its rhetoric against Turkiye, it risks making it a genuine opponent.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
