He argues it lacks clarity and does not explicitly establish that private companies can hold majority ownership.</p><p>“This law is a law of ambiguity, designed to avoid openly breaking with Chavez’s oil legacy,” Guerra said. “It is not emphatic about private participation.”</p><p>He noted that, in practice, the government has already ceded ground to private capital through production participation contracts (CPP), under which companies could effectively hold more than 50 percent.</p><p>The CPP framework emerged in 2024 when Rodríguez was serving as energy and oil minister. Its operation has been marked by opacity, as it is shielded by Article 37 of the Anti-Blockade Law, enacted to circumvent sanctions imposed on PDVSA in 2019.</p><p>That provision establishes a regime of confidentiality and document classification, allowing the government to bypass the existing Hydrocarbons Law, which limits private or foreign capital to joint ventures in which PDVSA must hold a majority stake.</p><p>On January 15, Rodríguez told the National Assembly that the introduction of CPPs in April of 2024 led to a rebound in oil production, from 900,000 barrels per day to 1.2 million bpd, and that investments under this model reached nearly $900m in 2025.</p><p>But the introduction of the proposed changes were marred by controversy as the draft was not made public until just a couple of hours before lawmakers convened for its first debate. The opposition declined to vote, arguing that in a country with the world’s largest oil reserves, energy legislation should be treated as a “social pact”, the result of a broad and thorough consultation among all stakeholders.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"chevron-model\">‘Chevron model’</h2><p>Luis Oliveros, dean of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the Metropolitan University at Caracas, described it as a positive sign that the law formalises what is known as the “Chevron model”.</p><p>“It opens room for foreign companies to assume technical, operational and financial management of the joint ventures they operate, with greater flexibility,” he said. However, he added that eliminating PDVSA’s mandatory majority stake would have been more attractive to foreign investors.</p><p>Oswaldo Felizzola, coordinator of Venezuela’s International Centre for Energy and Environment (CIEA), told Al Jazeera that the reform contains enough elements to invite new capital to invest in the industry, but ultimately falls short.</p><p>“What has been proposed is necessary, but not sufficient. The law needs to be updated for the 21st century,” Felizzola said. “That said, it is no longer as statist as to paralyse the industry.”</p><p>He noted that many existing companies could shift to a different operating model to improve profitability, but warned that the framework still has significant shortcomings. “It does not take into account current or future issues – climate change, for example – and therefore it is not a law that will drive the role of oil in the years ahead,” he said.</p><p>According to Felizzola, the conditions outlined in the reform are closer to the model that prevailed in Venezuela during the last quarter of the 20th century. “Are further reforms needed? Yes. But there is at least enough in place to work with – and for the Venezuelan government to allow you to do so.”</p><p>The reform bill must now move to a consultation phase and a second, article-by-article debate in the National Assembly before it can be enacted. It is not clear when that will happen.</p><p>Meanwhile, energy cooperation with the Trump administration is already having an impact on Venezuela’s economy. This week, the country received its first $300m from US crude sales, earmarked for stabilising the foreign exchange market.</p><p>“We are witnessing a shift,” Guerra said. “The Rodriguez–Trump pact is clearly being implemented, and oil revenues are already flowing in. The lifting of sanctions allows Venezuela to sell at market prices rather than at a discount, as it has been doing. At a minimum, oil revenues this year are expected to rise by 30 percent compared with last year.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

From attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities to Tehran’s calibrated retaliation across the region, the risk of escalation has become tangible rather than theoretical. For Gulf states, whose security and economic stability are directly exposed to any US–Iran conflict, the implications are immediate. It is within this environment that Qatar’s diplomacy between Washington and Tehran should be understood: not as neutrality for its own sake, but as a calculated effort to contain risks that escalation would only magnify.</p><p data-start=\"1242\" data-end=\"2114\">Periods of heightened tension between the United States and Iran have long carried consequences well beyond Washington and Tehran. Following a wave of protests inside Iran that, according to varying estimates, resulted in the deaths of several thousand people, rhetoric between Tehran and Washington has hardened markedly. This included President Trump’s threat to intervene on behalf of the protesters, a development that further heightened the urgency of diplomacy in the Gulf. The Gulf’s geography, concentrated energy infrastructure and interlinked security environment mean that even limited confrontation risks rapid regional spillover. Against this backdrop, Qatar’s approach toward Washington and Tehran has consistently prioritised de-escalation, mediation and the maintenance of political channels at moments when such channels appeared increasingly fragile.</p><p data-start=\"2116\" data-end=\"2772\">Qatar has emerged as an effective and credible mediator at moments of acute tension between the United States and Iran, offering practical avenues that have helped prevent crises from escalating further. Drawing on its sustained relations with Tehran and its strategic partnership with Washington, Doha has maintained discreet and trusted channels that allow both sides to communicate when direct engagement becomes politically constrained. This positioning has enabled Qatar to facilitate de-escalatory outcomes that have saved face for both parties, reinforcing its role as a mediator that creates political space for restraint rather than confrontation.</p><p data-start=\"2774\" data-end=\"3291\">This role was most visibly demonstrated in September 2023, when Qatar helped facilitate a prisoner exchange between Iran and the United States, alongside the release of frozen Iranian funds for humanitarian purposes. The process required months of indirect negotiations, careful sequencing and political reassurance on both sides. While the agreement did not signal a broader rapprochement, it underscored an important point: even amid deep hostility, diplomacy remains possible when credible mediators are available.</p><p data-start=\"3293\" data-end=\"4444\">For Doha, such mediation is not an end in itself. It reflects a broader conviction that the Iranian nuclear issue, and US–Iran tensions more generally, cannot be sustainably managed through coercion alone. Qatar has consistently aligned itself with the view that dialogue rather than military action offers the only viable path toward containing risks and preventing escalation. This position does not imply indifference to Iranian regional behaviour or to proliferation concerns; rather, it reflects an assessment of costs, uncertainty and unintended consequences for regional security. As such, even in the aftermath of Iran’s calibrated missile strike on the Al Udeid airbase in Qatar — a Qatari military facility hosting US forces — launched in June 2025 in response to US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, Doha moved swiftly to engage both sides and contain the crisis. Through urgent outreach and established communication channels, Qatar contributed to broader efforts that helped support a fragile ceasefire that has broadly held since, underscoring both its capacity to be effective in mediation and the trust placed in Qatari diplomacy.</p><p data-start=\"4446\" data-end=\"5117\">A military confrontation aimed at overthrowing the Iranian regime would almost certainly generate effects that extend far beyond Iran’s borders. Internally, such a scenario risks producing state collapse, fragmentation of authority and the re-politicisation of ethnic and sectarian identities within a large and highly complex society. Externally, the spillover effects could include large-scale refugee movements toward neighbouring states, including across the Gulf, as well as severe disruptions to maritime security and energy markets. Taken together, these outcomes would pose immediate challenges to Gulf states whose own stability is closely tied to regional calm.</p><p data-start=\"5119\" data-end=\"5706\">Recent developments in the region have already altered the strategic balance. Since the October 7 attacks and the subsequent regional confrontations, Iran’s network of allied non-state actors has come under sustained pressure. Several elements of the “axis of resistance” have been weakened militarily and politically, reducing Tehran’s ability to project influence in certain theatres. At the same time, the US attacks on Iran in June 2025 have dispelled any remaining misconception about Washington’s willingness to strike Iran directly and degrade its nuclear enrichment capacity.</p><p data-start=\"5708\" data-end=\"6675\">From a Gulf perspective, however, further escalation offers diminishing returns. Weakening Iranian regional influence does not automatically translate into regional stability, particularly if pursued through strategies that risk state collapse. For Gulf states, the priority is not the dramatic remaking of Iran’s political system, but the avoidance of chaos that would be costly, unpredictable and difficult to contain. This assessment is not limited to Doha. In recent years, Qatar’s position has increasingly converged with those of Saudi Arabia and Oman, both of which have invested in reducing tensions with Tehran through dialogue and confidence-building measures. Their efforts to communicate the risks of military escalation to the Trump administration reflected a broader regional mood, one that favours containment and engagement over confrontation. This convergence is notable given the political differences that have historically separated Gulf capitals.</p><p data-start=\"6677\" data-end=\"7648\">Qatar’s mediation efforts offer a pathway that helps prevent regional chaos at a moment when escalation increasingly offers diminishing returns. By keeping channels open, facilitating limited agreements and discouraging maximalist strategies, Doha seeks to reduce the likelihood of miscalculation. Such efforts rarely produce dramatic breakthroughs, and they are often invisible by design. Yet their absence would likely make escalation more probable, not less.</p><p data-start=\"6677\" data-end=\"7648\">In an increasingly polarised regional environment, the value of de-escalation is easily overlooked. It lacks the clarity of deterrence and the euphoria of military action. Still, as Qatar’s engagement between Washington and Tehran illustrates, diplomacy, however incremental and imperfect, remains one of the few tools capable of preventing crises from spiralling into wider conflict. In a region where the costs of war are shared far beyond the battlefield, that contribution should not be dismissed lightly.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

This system will be transformed,” he said in an evening video address.</p><p>Russia has also attacked Kyiv with Shahed drones fitted with jet engines, giving them greater speed and making them difficult to intercept, the Ukrainian Air Force has said.</p><p>Ukraine has been adapting. Its air force posted a video on January 15 showing a Sting drone successfully intercepting a jet-powered Shahed. The Sting was developed by Wild Hornets, a Ukrainian charitable fundraising money for air defences, and was designed to kill Shaheds.</p><p>Zelenskyy wants to speed up innovation to counter Russian adaptations to its defences, as well. As part of this effort, he appointed Mykhailo Fedorov as defence minister on January 2 to oversee faster drone production, and on Tuesday announced Colonel Pavlo Yelizarov as deputy head of the air force.</p><p>“With the participation of Pavlo Yelizarov, taking into account his experience and innovative approaches, the “small air defense” system will be improved,” wrote Oleksandr Syrskii, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p><p>Zelenskyy has long warned Ukrainians to expect worse. On Sunday, he said it again. “Russia has prepared for a strike – a massive strike – and is waiting for the moment to carry it out,” he said.</p><p>Syrskii told Ukrainian news outlet Ib.ua that Russia planned to increase daily Shahed production from 404 to 1,000.</p><p>By the time Zelenskyy went to Switzerland to meet Trump this week, the situation in Ukraine was dire.</p><p>“Today in Ukraine was the most difficult day for the power system since the blackout of November 2022,” wrote energy minister Denys Shmyhal on Thursday. “The situation is extremely difficult.

His failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize last year also seemed to be on his mind.</p><p>“Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store on Sunday, adding he sought “Complete and Total Control of Greenland”.</p><p>That prompted eight Baltic and North Sea states to send military reinforcements to the island, which is self-governing but part of the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump performed an about-turn, saying he wouldn’t fight NATO allies for Greenland in a rambling 71-minute speech in Davos, but the diplomatic damage had been done. “Nobody is in any mood to stage a grand spectacle around an agreement with Trump right now,” one official told The Financial Times.</p><p>At Davos, European officials remained largely deferential to the US, but there were statements which demonstrated a different mood under the surface.</p><p>European diplomats said Brussels was floating the idea of giving Ukraine preliminary EU membership in 2027 as part of its security guarantees. Full membership would follow later.</p><p>This idea goes against the EU’s usual merit-based accession process, but diplomats said Ukraine’s security should be prioritised over that process. “We have to recognise that we are in a very different reality than when the (accession) rules were first drawn up,” one EU official was quoted as saying.</p><p>Finnish President Alexander Stubb said Europe could “unequivocally” defend itself without the United States, in a discussion about security. He also said Russia was not winning its war, saying it had taken “at most” 1 percent of Ukraine’s territory in the past 1,000 days, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.</p><p>On January 15, Macron reminded the French military that a coalition of 35 countries, not including the US, is now providing all of Ukraine’s military and financial support, after Washington adopted neutrality in the war under Trump.</p><p>“Where Ukraine was extremely dependent on American intelligence capacity, huge majority [of it] a year ago, in [the space of] a year, two-thirds is today provided by France,” Macron said.</p><p>In Brussels, European Commission President <a href=\"https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/2013888436625617323\">Ursula von der Leyen</a> was even clearer about the need for Europe to decouple from US foreign and defence policy.</p><p>“The shift in the international order is not only seismic, but it is permanent,” she told the European Parliament on Wednesday, adding that it is “imperative for Europe … to speed up our push for independence … Europe needs its own levers of power … above all with a real capacity to defend ourselves.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 470 Palestinians <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/how-many-times-has-israel-violated-the-gaza-ceasefire-here-are-the-numbers\">have been killed</a> since a ceasefire was announced by Trump on October 10 last year.</p><p>Presented as a plan to rebuild the Palestinian territory, the Trump administration’s proposal this week, however, offers no insight into core issues such as property and land rights — let alone justice for war crimes — amid plans to construct shimmering buildings atop an estimated 68 million tonnes of rubble and war debris, where thousands of bodies remain buried.</p><p>Praising the redevelopment plan, Trump, who also spoke at length at the forum in Davos, argued that the war in Gaza “was really coming to an end”, even as Israeli forces killed at least 11 Palestinians, including two children and three journalists, in separate strikes on the Gaza Strip on Thursday.</p><p>“I’m a real estate person at heart, and it’s all about location,” Trump said about the development plan. “And I said, look at this location on the sea, look at this beautiful piece of property, what it could be for so many people.”</p><p>Experts have strongly criticised the “imperialist” vision of Trump’s so-called master plan, which they say does not include any consultation with Palestinians and reduces the ongoing catastrophic genocide to an “investment opportunity”.</p><p>Trump’s proposal reeks of “imperial plans for Gaza,” Palestinian-American writer Susan Abulhawa wrote in a post on X. “This is a plan to erase Gaza’s indigenous character, turn what remains of her people into a cheap labor force to manage their ‘industrial zones’ and create an exclusive coastline for ‘tourism’.”</p><p>During more than two years of bombardment on Gaza from October 2023, Israel, which is diplomatically supported and armed by the US, destroyed or damaged more than 80 percent of the Strip’s buildings, with residential blocks completely flattened.</p><p>All major hospitals and universities, and most of the Strip’s electricity and water systems, roads and municipal services have been destroyed.</p><p>Nearly all the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced, many of them multiple times. People face hours-long queues for basic food and water, and aid into the territory has been restricted by Israel, which controls everything that goes in and out.</p><p>So, what’s in the Gaza reconstruction plan, part of Trump’s launch of a “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">Board of Peace</a>”; could it be realised — and at what cost, especially for the people of Gaza?</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261411\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261411\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261411\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260122__93M84X6__v1__MidRes__SwitzerlandUsPoliticsEconomyDiplomacy-1769164474.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"kushner\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261411\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US businessman Jared Kushner speaks at the ‘Board of Peace’ meeting during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 22, 2026 [Fabrice Coffrini/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-the-board-of-peace\">What’s the Board of Peace?</h2><p>In Davos on Thursday, Trump formally announced the charter for his “Board of Peace”, which he has pitched as the next phase of his administration’s 20-point peace plan and a mechanism to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza. Membership on the board has a three-year cycle. Those seeking a permanent seat must pay $1bn.</p><p>But the 11-page charter for the Board of Peace does not mention Gaza and appears to have morphed into something far more ambitious – an international disputes forum and a potential rival to the United Nations.</p><p>The executive board so far includes former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Kushner, with Trump as the chairman himself with veto power. It also includes Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even though he faces an arrest warrant from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>At least 50 countries’ leaders have confirmed that they have received invitations, including US adversaries China and Russia — and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">several have agreed to join</a>. However, Trump withdrew Canada’s invitation ‍on Thursday, in what appeared to be a retaliatory move following Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which he denounced Trump’s aggressive stance over Greenland.</p><p>Speaking at the forum, Trump said the board was going to be “very successful in Gaza” and “we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza”.</p><p>Kushner then outlined details about the board’s development plans for Gaza without mentioning plans for a path to Palestinian statehood.</p><p>Hamas, which currently governs Gaza, condemned the proposal, saying: “Our people in the Gaza Strip will not allow these plans to pass.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261413\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261413\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261413\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260122__93M687E__v1__MidRes__SwitzerlandUsPoliticsEconomyDiplomacy-1769164477.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"kushner\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261413\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jared Kushner speaks as a ‘Gaza Timeline’ is displayed on a giant screen at the ‘Board of Peace’ meeting during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on January 22, 2026 [Mandel Ngan/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-s-in-the-gaza-plan\">What’s in the Gaza plan?</h2><p>Trump’s development plan includes projections to raise Gaza’s gross domestic product (GDP) to $10bn by 2035, after the size of the territory’s economy crashed to just $362m by 2024 amid the war; 500,000 new jobs; and at least $25bn in investment for modern utilities and public services.</p><p>Kushner did not specify who would fund the redevelopment. “As you guys know, peace is a different deal than a business deal, because you’re changing a mindset,” he said, calling the Gaza peace efforts “very entrepreneurial”.</p><p>However, he also focused on security. “[The] number one thing is going to be security,” Kushner said. “Without security, nobody’s going to make investments, nobody’s gonna come build there. We need investments in order to start giving jobs,” Kusher said.</p><p>He added that the US is working “very closely with the Israelis to figure out a way to de-escalation, and the next phase is working with Hamas on demilitarisation”.</p><p>There is no evidence that Palestinians or their leadership have been consulted over any of these plans. Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza, said Palestinian civil society and official bodies were not included in discussions with the Board of Peace.</p><p>“We were surprised, as Palestinian actors on the ground, after 10 years of work, and especially the last two years of work in Gaza, that no one consulted us about the plans for Gaza and its future,” he said.</p><p>“At the time these leaders are holding ceremonies, Israel is using this period to continue its actions in Gaza.”</p><p>Here are some of the highlights of Trump’s redevelopment plan:</p><h3 id=\"four-phases-of-development\">Four phases of development</h3><p>Presenting a four-phase development timeline beginning in Rafah, southern Gaza, and then moving its way north, Kushner displayed colour-coded maps showing coastal tourism zones, mixed-use towers, and residential and industrial areas, as he unveiled the plan in Davos.</p><p>Phase one of Trump’s plan for rebuilding is set to start in Rafah, Gaza’s southern-most city, and some parts of Khan Younis. Phase two will include other parts of Khan Younis, while phase three aims to develop refugee camps in central Gaza. Phase four will cover Gaza City, which is in the north of the territory.</p><p>Kushner told attendees at Davos that construction of new developments in all these areas will take two to three years.

GDP per capita plummeted to $161 annually, placing it among the lowest in the world.</p><p>“Before the war, the Gaza Strip witnessed economic growth, with the opening of many commercial, tourism, and industrial projects, and it became a haven for many investments in all sectors,” Maher Altabbaa, the director-general of the Gaza Governorate Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told Al Jazeera earlier last month.</p><p>The proposal presented by Kushner claims more than 500,000 jobs in construction, agriculture, manufacturing and services will be created, with a $1.5bn investment in an initiative called “Vocational Schools and (Re)-Training for Full Labor Force”.</p><p>He added that the board aims to use “free market principles” to shift Gaza’s dependence on foreign aid, and unveiled plans for a new “logistics corridor”, a new “trilateral” crossing at Rafah, and roads connecting Gaza’s urban centres in the proposal.

But China has also insisted that TikTok and its algorithm must remain under Chinese control.</p><p>In April 2024, Congress passed a law that would ban TikTok in the US if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to US owners by January 19, 2025. The law specified that TikTok US should cut ties with ByteDance. TikTok sued the US government, but the US Supreme Court <a href=\"/economy/2025/1/17/us-supreme-court-upholds-law-banning-tiktok\">upheld the ban.</a></p><p>The platform voluntarily went offline for about 12 hours on January 18 – the day before the ban was due to come into effect. Its service was restored after then President-elect Trump confirmed that he would extend the deadline once he took office.</p><p>The president extended the deadline for 75 days via an executive order on January 20, the same day he was sworn in. He then signed executive orders periodically to continue putting off the ban.</p><p>In September, Trump <a href=\"/economy/2025/9/17/trump-announces-deal-with-china-to-allow-tiktok-continue-operating-in-us\">said</a> he had reached a deal with China that would allow TikTok to keep operating in the US.

One of the biggest stars in the NWSL, keeping her in the league was considered vitally important as other US national team stars, including Naomi Girma and Alyssa Thompson, opted to play in Europe.</p><p>As the failure to agree to a new deal dragged on last year, with her previous contract ending on December 31, Rodman, too, drew interest from European teams that don’t have a salary cap. Months of speculation ensued, in particular that teams from England were heading the list of suitors on the continent who were prepared to step in and meet her wage demands.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-value-of-rodman-s-new-washington-spirit-deal\">What is the value of Rodman’s new Washington Spirit deal?</h2><p>The financial terms of Rodman’s contract were not disclosed.</p><p>It is understood, however, that Rodman’s deal is worth more than $2m annually, including bonuses.</p><p>“Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly, she represents the future of this club and the future of women’s soccer,” Spirit owner Michele Kang said. “This agreement reflects our belief that elite talent deserves elite commitment.”</p><h2 id=\"how-did-rodman-s-deal-first-court-controversy-in-the-nwsl\">How did Rodman’s deal first court controversy in the NWSL?</h2><p>The Spirit and Rodman had previously struck a multi-year deal that both parties maintained was in compliance with the salary cap, but it was rejected by the league.</p><p>The NWSL’s salary cap is $3.5m for each team for the 2026 season, which brought Rodman’s salary sharply into the spotlight and remains an awkward sum, although the cap will increase each year until it hits $5.1m in 2030.</p><p>NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman, who vetoed the deal at the time, reportedly believed it violated the “spirit” of league salary rules.</p><p>With the initial rejection, the National Women’s Soccer League Players Association filed a grievance claiming that the NWSL’s rejection of the contract violated Rodman’s free agency rights and violated the collective bargaining agreement.</p><h2 id=\"how-was-rodman-s-deal-resolved-with-the-nwsl\">How was Rodman’s deal resolved with the NWSL?</h2><p>To address the salary cap issue, the NWSL in late December adopted a “High Impact Player” mechanism that allowed teams to spend up to $1m over the cap to sign players that meet certain criteria. Those included metrics like national team minutes, inclusion among the 30 candidates for the Ballon d’Or or player rankings by outlets like The Guardian or ESPN.</p><p>The NWSLPA filed a grievance over the rule, claiming it violated the collective bargaining agreement and federal labour law because player compensation must be negotiated. The NWSLPA maintains the league had no authority to “unilaterally create a new pay structure”.</p><p>Spirit President of Soccer Operations Haley Carter said the High Impact Player rule figured into the contract Rodman ultimately agreed to.

Can you say that and feel confident leaving?’” Rodman said.</p><p>“I didn’t even need half a second, and I was like, ‘No, I’m not. I don’t feel ready to make a different decision.’ That’s just, again, getting drafted here and developing and maturing and learning – and failing – at the Spirit, in DC, it’s become so much of my legacy and my story.

Rodman, whose Olympic gold was secured with the United States at the Paris Games in 2024, is the daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman.</p><p>She was drafted at the age of 18 in 2021 and earned Rookie of the Year honours as the Spirit won their first NWSL title.</p><p>Rodman has since won 47 appearances and 11 goals with the US national team, more than any other player on the latest roster. She only played in one US match last year, a 2-0 victory over Brazil in April, because of injuries.</p><p>Rodman is currently with the national team in their annual January training camp in Carson, California.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"1617\">After launching what he called “a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS [ISIL] terrorist scum” in northwest Nigeria on December 25, United States President Donald Trump promised “many more”, reaffirming his stance that the US “will not allow radical Islamic terrorism to prosper”. The strikes occurred less than a week after the newly formed Alliance of Sahel States (AES) commissioned a joint military force comprising a 5,000-strong contingent, presented as a symbol of collective self-reliance and security autonomy, in a concerted effort to combat terrorist groups in its member states. They also followed moves by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to establish an ambitious plan announced in August 2025 to activate a 260,000-strong joint counterterrorism force, backed by a proposed $2.5bn annual budget for logistics and front-line support.</p><p data-start=\"374\" data-end=\"1617\">While these developments may be presented by their proponents as decisive steps against terrorism, there is little evidence that militarised escalation alone can defeat armed groups in the Sahel. Instead, they signal an accelerating militarisation of the region. Not only does this fuel emerging geopolitical tensions in West Africa, but it also, more importantly, edges the Sahel towards interstate armed conflict, posing far graver risks to regional peace and stability.</p><h2 id=\"a-friendship-turned-sour\">A friendship turned sour</h2><p>Until 2021, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in the Sahel were governed by a loosely coordinated, non-hierarchical security architecture built around diplomatic and military collaboration among regional and extra-regional actors. This architecture brought together ECOWAS, the European Union, the United Nations, the African Union, external powers such as the US and France, as well as regional powers such as Algeria and Nigeria, with ECOWAS playing a central coordinating role.</p><p data-start=\"1878\" data-end=\"2435\">A typical example was the 2013 African-led International Support Mission to Mali, organised by ECOWAS in collaboration with the AU, UN and France to confront Tuareg rebels and allied armed groups in northern Mali. More prominent was the EU-financed G5 Sahel counterterrorism force, which brought together African and European troops and operated between 2017 and 2023. While these arrangements were often marked by tension, competition and uneven outcomes, they functioned within a shared security framework that limited direct confrontation between states.</p><p>This balance was disrupted after the 2023 coup in Niger. By threatening the use of force to restore constitutional order, ECOWAS crossed a political threshold that transformed its role from intermediary to perceived adversary in the eyes of the Nigerien junta. That threat was widely interpreted as an act of aggression, and it proved catalytic. In response, Niger’s military rulers, alongside their counterparts in Mali and Burkina Faso, moved to establish the Alliance of Sahel States as a deliberate effort to reclaim security autonomy, dismantle the existing multilateral security regime and <a href=\"/news/2023/12/31/au-revoir-sahel-did-2023-crush-frances-influence-in-africa\">sever ties </a>with longstanding partners including ECOWAS, the EU, the US and France.</p><p data-start=\"3241\" data-end=\"3673\">Notably, the AES institutionalises a mutual defence pact that codifies this break with the previous multilateral security order by explicitly framing ECOWAS and its Western partners as threats to the sovereignty and national security of its member states. Beyond deepening the rift between former allies, this posture signals a dangerous shift towards the securitisation of neighbouring states, raising the spectre of interstate conflict in West Africa, a phenomenon largely absent since the 1990s.</p><h2 id=\"emerging-geopolitical-tensions\">Emerging geopolitical tensions</h2><p>In severing security ties with the West, the AES have pivoted towards Russia as a principal security partner to counterbalance decades of US and European influence in West Africa, signalling a deepening but still evolving security partnership with Moscow. While these strategic choices reflect an emerging self-help posture with new preferences for non-conventional allies, they are also intensifying geopolitical tensions across the region.</p><p data-start=\"4165\" data-end=\"5223\">Nigeria’s military role in countering an attempted coup in neighbouring Benin was praised as a major win for ECOWAS. But when a Nigerian Air Force C-130 aircraft made an emergency landing in Burkina Faso two days later, the AES interpreted this as a violation of its airspace and sovereignty, authorising its air force to neutralise any aircraft involved in further violations. Tensions were heightened by reports that France had provided Nigeria with surveillance and intelligence support during the Benin intervention, fuelling apprehension about France’s potential re-entry into the AES security landscape. With Nigeria now willing to extend security cooperation with the US following the Christmas Day strikes, the stakes have risen further for the AES. Although aimed at militants operating in northwest Nigeria, the strikes appear calculated to bolster US strategic legitimacy as a counterterrorism actor in the region, potentially opening the door to further operations in Nigeria’s northeast, where ISWAP and Boko Haram remain active.</p><p>Given Nigeria’s influence within ECOWAS, this emerging security partnership with the US is likely to shape the operational capacity of the proposed 260,000-strong ECOWAS force. This does not bode well for the AES, which is intent on insulating its member states from Western security influence in the name of sovereignty. Because ECOWAS forces would be deployed in member states at the epicentre of terrorist violence, many combat engagements would take place in locations adjacent to AES territories. With AES troops also operating in these areas, military clashes between the two sides become increasingly likely, particularly given the region’s porous borders and fluid combat environments. Given that the Christmas Day strikes reportedly hit unintended targets, the risk that future air strikes by a US-backed ECOWAS could spill into AES territory cannot be dismissed. For deterrence, the AES may seek to leverage Russia’s military backing, evoking echoes of Cold War-era security brinkmanship.</p><h2 id=\"implications-for-regional-stability\">Implications for regional stability</h2><p data-start=\"6281\" data-end=\"7182\">Without reconciliation between the AES and ECOWAS, two major risks loom for regional peace and stability. First, rising geopolitical tensions could draw AES and ECOWAS member states into direct interstate military confrontations, potentially plunging West Africa into a regional war. Such a conflict would serve neither side’s counterterrorism objectives. Beyond devastating the region, it would create space for armed groups to expand their operations amid fractured and distracted security responses. Second, the standoff risks turning West Africa into a new theatre for global power rivalry, with a Russia-backed AES on one side and a US and France-backed ECOWAS on the other. In the context of an emerging New Cold War, the use of veto power by these global actors at the UN Security Council could further complicate conflict resolution, with profoundly destabilising consequences for the region.</p><p data-start=\"7184\" data-end=\"8260\">The AES and ECOWAS now face a stark choice: to revive Cold War-style bloc politics in West Africa while the region slides towards chaos, or to negotiate a security sub-coalition that prioritises human security alongside national sovereignty. Regardless of how the AES views ECOWAS, the burden lies with the latter to manage the unintended consequences of escalating tensions. While there are few indications that the AES is willing to cooperate directly with a West-backed ECOWAS on counterterrorism, ECOWAS could pursue diplomatic engagement to negotiate a concept of operations that guarantees respect for AES sovereignty. As Africa’s most experienced regional security organisation, ECOWAS possesses the diplomatic capacity to do so. For progress to be made, Francophone ECOWAS member states should take the lead in these efforts, while Nigeria exercises its influence more discreetly. Whether ECOWAS can reclaim ownership of its security agenda and define the terms of external engagement will shape not only West Africa’s future, but that of the continent as a whole.</p><p data-start=\"7184\" data-end=\"8260\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

squarely in control of the prison,” he said, describing the “relative smoothness” of the handover as a “positive development”.</p><p>He described the developments in Raqqa as a “rare occasion where the SDF and the Syrian military … have acknowledged that they have cooperated and they have done so successfully”.</p><p>“It’s the first time that I can remember covering this story for the last couple of weeks that they’ve both acknowledged that they’ve worked together to secure safe passage for SDF fighters,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261475\"

following chaotic standoff</h2><p>The situation at the prison, which has been the site of clashes in recent days, was now “calm”, he said, noting “it wasn’t like this here 24 hours ago.”</p><p>An Al Jazeera team reporting from outside the prison on Thursday witnessed chaotic scenes as large crowds of civilians pushed against the barricades controlled by Syrian soldiers, with SDF fighters remaining inside.</p><p>One soldier told Al Jazeera the Syrian government forces were waiting to see if they would need to retake the prison by force.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Basravi said the civilians were trying to get through the barricades into the prison to find out the condition of their relatives who were detained inside, some of whom they had not heard from in days amid the instability.</p><p>Some claimed their relatives had been detained unjustly by the SDF.</p><p>“My son was going to visit his relatives in Hasakah,” said one man, Mohammad Ali. “The SDF detained him at a checkpoint just because he had a photo of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa.”</p><p>Amid the chaotic scenes outside the prison on Wednesday, gunfire was heard in the distance, Al Jazeera teams on the ground reported.</p><p>Meanwhile, US planes dispatched by CENTCOM were heard overhead as they began flying ISIL detainees out of northeast Syria to Iraq, as part of a push to secure thousands of suspected fighters amid concerns over instability in Kurdish-run prisons.</p><h2 id=\"securely-behind-bars\">Securely behind bars</h2><p>Basravi said that with its takeover of the prison, the Syrian government now found itself answerable to two groups with demands over the detainees, requiring it to strike a delicate balance.</p><p>It had obligations to the international community – specifically the anti-ISIL coalition, which it joined in November last year – to ensure that ISIL detainees remained securely behind bars.</p><p>But it also faced pleas from locals who claimed their loved ones had been unjustly detained by SDF forces who previously controlled the prison.</p><p>He said a visit by senior officials to the prison on Friday, and the Interior Ministry’s statement that it was examining the files held on those inside, was a “positive development” in assuaging the concerns of the latter group.</p><p>But while families remained in the dark over the condition of their detained relatives, a repeat of Thursday’s scenes were possible.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261473\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261473\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

Armenak Tokmajyan said he believed the SDF was being genuine in its negotiations with the Syrian government, as they were now “cornered in a few pockets in northeast Syria”.</p><p>“However, there is still a risk of the ceasefire collapsing and going back to fighting, said Tokmajyan, a nonresident scholar at the Malcolm H Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center. “There are a lot of details that need to be ironed out, specifically relating to Kurdish-majority areas – whether [around] governance, weapons, integration of Kurdish fighters.”</p><p>He said developments in the northeast were being closely watched, particularly by the Druze in the south and Syria’s other minorities, as they held broad implications for whether Syria would be a unified, centralised state or one granting autonomy to minority groups.</p><p>The Syrian army’s rapid advance in the northeast had been “a major step forward for President al-Sharaa and those international backers who want a centralised and a unified Syria”, he said, adding that the battle was “not really over”.</p><p>“It will depend on how the integration of the Kurdish minority in Syria will look like,” he said. “Everyone is watching if Ahmed al-Sharaa will successfully and peacefully be able to offer a model for reintegrating the SDF into Syria.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Fireworks lit up the sky, car horns blared and Syrians gathered in Umayyad Square to dance in jubilation.</p><p>The hope was that the conflict that flared up in the past few weeks in northern Syria was now over, and that the country had resolved one of the major issues still dividing it in the year since the overthrow of longtime leader President Bashar al-Assad.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“It’s a beautiful feeling, and I am sure it exists in every Syrian … we wish for all of Syria to be united,” said one Damascus resident, Saria Shammiri.</p><p>Yet the celebration was short-lived.</p><p>Fighting resumed the next morning as the government’s lightning push <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/us-envoy-meets-sdf-commander-calls-for-syria-ceasefire-to-be-upheld\">forced</a> SDF leader Mazloum Abdi to accept less favourable terms: a withdrawal from Raqqa and Deir Az Zor, in northeastern Syria, further east towards Hasakah, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/syrian-government-sdf-agree-on-a-four-day-ceasefire\">a new ceasefire</a>, and a four-day ultimatum for the SDF to fully integrate into state structures.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"anger-towards-the-sdf\">Anger towards the SDF</h2><p>As the clock ticks down on that deadline, in Damascus and other areas outside SDF control, frustration towards the <a href=\"/features/2026/1/21/syrian-forces-makes-gains-against-sdf-what-it-means-for-countrys-kurds\">Kurdish-led forces</a> has hardened after 15 years of division.</p><p>“The terrorist SDF doesn’t belong to this land … they are not Kurdish. They are occupiers,” said Maamoun Ramadan, a 75-year-old Syrian Kurd living in Damascus.</p><p>For many here, the SDF is no longer seen primarily as a force that fought ISIL (ISIS) at the height of Syria’s war, but as an actor that entrenched a parallel authority backed by foreign powers, such as the United States, keeping large parts of the country beyond the central government’s reach.</p><p>In cafes, taxis and government offices, the language is increasingly blunt. The SDF is accused of delaying reunification, monopolising oil and agricultural resources in the northeast, and shielding itself behind US support while the rest of the country endured sanctions, collapse and war. The renewed fighting has reinforced a belief among many Syrians that the standoff could only ever end through force or submission. But, still, many want a peaceful resolution.</p><p>“Dialogue is the foundation of peace,” said Sheikhmos Ramzi, a butcher, “the solution lies at the negotiation table. Violence only brings more violence.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"anxious-wait\">Anxious wait</h2><p>There is also an undercurrent of anxiety. While the prospect of reunifying territory is popular, few in Damascus are blind to the risks. A prolonged confrontation could draw in regional actors, unsettle fragile border areas, or reignite communal tensions in the northeast, where Arab tribal communities, Kurds, and others coexist uneasily after years of shifting alliances.</p><p>Some residents privately express concern about what integration will actually mean on the ground. Will SDF fighters be absorbed into national forces, sidelined, or prosecuted? Will local administrations be dismantled overnight? And can a central state, stretched thin after years of war and economic crisis, realistically govern and stabilise territory it has not controlled for more than a decade?</p><p>For now, however, those questions are largely drowned out by a dominant mood: impatience. The ceasefire was welcomed not as an endpoint, but as a step towards what many here see as an overdue resolution. The government’s advances are framed as restoring sovereignty, not opening a new chapter of conflict.</p><p>In Damascus, unity is the word repeated most often. But it is a unity shaped by exhaustion, resentment and the desire to finally close one of the last unresolved fronts of Syria’s long war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the shootings in Minnesota are not outliers, and the history of ICE shootings shows that holding officers to account has been next to impossible.</p><p>I know, because I investigated the agency’s practices, obtaining documents that reveal how it operates and how its officers are trained to shield themselves from scrutiny and lawsuits. My<a href=\"https://www.typeinvestigations.org/investigation/2024/08/01/armed-and-untouchable-ices-history-of-deadly-force/\"> 2024 investigation</a> looked at six years of shootings informed by logs I obtained from the agency in a lawsuit. According to The Trace, a US outlet tracking gun violence in the country, ICE agents shot <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/12/immigration-ice-shootings-guns-tracker/\">at least 12</a> people this and last year. From 2015 to 2021, ICE agents discharged a firearm at least 59 times, injuring 24 people and killing 23 others.</p><p>What is the likelihood of an ICE agent facing criminal charges by either federal or state agencies? Slim. None of the shootings I examined resulted in an ICE agent being indicted, even in cases where someone was killed.</p><p>Considered protected law enforcement documents, the agency’s training documents on use of force and firearms are not made public, nor are the agency’s use-of-force policies. What informs how agents operate in the field has largely been spared from scrutiny, but I <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ice-immigration-customs-enforcement-training-deescalation-use-of-force-2024-8\">obtained documents</a> that shed light on what training some ICE agents received from 2007 to 2010.</p><p>Though the documents may now be outdated, they offer the only insight – apart from what little is available on the website of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, where ICE agents receive law enforcement training – into what comprises use-of-force training for ICE agents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261230\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261230\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261230\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-22T183653Z_2079832000_RC2V5JA9YQFA_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-CHURCH-1769154964.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C507&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Federal agents detain locals as immigration enforcement continues after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on January 7 during an immigration raid, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., January 21, 2026.

The annual training is also meant to include “related legal updates” and “discretion in using deadly force and less than lethal force”.</p><p>The policy states that the training must be recorded, but whether or not the officers had actually received this annual training, both before and after the amendment of the policy, is unclear.</p><p>Following a 2016 shooting in which an ICE agent shot and permanently injured a Mexican man in Laurel, Mississippi, a civil lawsuit brought against the ICE agent revealed in a 2020 deposition that the agent only “vaguely” remembered his use-of-force training.</p><p>ICE does not make its Use of Force policy, most recently amended in 2023, available to the public, and no law requires it. The <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/19009.3_firearmsUOF.pdf\">version</a> on its website is almost entirely redacted. But legal representatives in a lawsuit against DHS and ICE cracking down on protests, obtained and made a copy of it <a href=\"https://www.loevy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/284-39-ICE-Directive-19009.3-Firearms-and-Use-of-Force-05.26.2023.pdf\">available on their website</a>.</p><p>This secrecy, say criminal justice experts, is a way for ICE agents to evade scrutiny for lacking policies to ensure or review that the force abides by its own rules.</p><p>“Public access of a complete version of ICE’s use-of-force policy is essential to understanding when agents are permitted to use violence within US cities and equally important to understanding when individual agents are potentially acting in violation of agency policy,” Cesar Cuauhtemoc Garcia Hernandez, a law professor of civil rights and civil liberties at Ohio State University, told Al Jazeera over email.</p><p>“Without access to the complete policy, it is next to impossible for ordinary people to carry out their responsibility in a democracy – decide whether they agree with ICE’s expectations of its officers, then lobby politicians and vote for candidates who embrace their vision of appropriate law enforcement conduct,” he added.</p><p>Gretta Goodwin, the author of a 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office – a nonpartisan research arm of the US Congress – found that ICE’s use-of-force documentation did not always detail when or how agents violated policy in instances of use of force.</p><p>That documentation is critical to improve training, Goodwin said. While researching the report, Goodwin said one of the objectives was to better understand how DHS tracks use-of-force training.</p><p>“We also wanted to know what was documented in relation to the training, because if ICE were documenting who took the training and when, then when use-of-force incidents happened that were counter to the training, it might help them decide to make modifications or better target the training.”</p><p>The lack of proper internal documentation, Goodwin explained, is a huge barrier to the DHS improving agents’ actions in the field.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261323\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261323\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261323\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255824214-1769160201.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ICE\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261323\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Federal agents clash with protesters outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during a demonstration over the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good on January 15, 2026 [Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"evading-lawsuits\">Evading lawsuits</h2><p>The training documents also reveal an emphasis on teaching prospective agents how to get out from under lawsuits if they were to face them.</p><p>I found at least four different instances in which the lessons, quizzes, podcast transcripts or training lessons stressed the US Constitution’s Fourth Amendment rights, which protect people from unwarranted searches and seizures, indicating to the officer how to operate so that they do not violate them or how to articulate so that they can defend themselves.</p><p>In one podcast, a legal instructor said an agent might have to face a lawsuit for a violation of a tort, which is a harm committed either negligently or intentionally.</p><p>“As long as the employee was within the scope of employment [working as a federal agent] when the alleged negligent or intentional tort happened,” referring to a civil wrong, “they get to step out of that lawsuit.”</p><p>ICE agents, like all federal agents, also enjoy qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that protects them from the legal liability of these lawsuits.</p><p>“The law gives all law enforcement officers, including ICE, wide latitude to use force in carrying out their duties,” said Hernandez, the law professor at Ohio State University.</p><p>“The reality is that it is exceedingly difficult to hold individual agents or the agency itself accountable in court.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261321\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261321\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261321\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255856428-1769160180.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ICE\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Federal immigration officers arrest a protester outside Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 15, 2026 [Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h2><p>In the last year alone, the Department of Homeland Security more than doubled its workforce within ICE, bringing the agency from a total of 10,000 officers and agents to 22,000, with more recruiting plans under way.</p><p>How and whether they are receiving training remains unknown.</p><p>An <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/ice-error-meant-recruits-sent-field-offices-proper-training-sources-sa-rcna254054\">NBC investigation</a> based on sources with insider knowledge found that the race to employ new agents at scale entailed using AI tools that improperly processed applications and sent new agents into the field without proper training.</p><p>In Minneapolis, large protests and clashes with immigration agents are still under way, with at least 3,000 federal immigration forces mobilised in the city. Videos have captured ICE agents banging down doors of homes and dragging people out of cars.</p><p>Residents have reported that they are afraid to leave their homes and local efforts have even stepped up for people to do grocery shopping for their neighbours.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have defended ICE agents despite widely criticised conduct. And US President Donald Trump has threatened to enact the Insurrection Act, a federal law that would allow him to deploy the military to the state.

That was pursued in the House impeachment of Trump in the aftermath of January 6, though the president was acquitted of the sole count of incitement of an insurrection by the Senate.</p><p></p><h3>Cassidy Hutchinson</h3><p data-start=\"129\" data-end=\"321\">Republicans have long focused on challenging the testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, which was a key moment in the congressional investigation into the January 6 attack.</p><p data-start=\"328\" data-end=\"538\">Hutchinson told the committee she had been informed that Trump tried to grab the steering wheel of his presidential vehicle as he demanded to go to the US Capitol. Other witnesses later disputed that account.</p><p data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"718\">During the hearing, Republican Representative Jim Jordan, the committee’s chair, pressed Jack Smith on the episode. “Mr Smith, is Cassidy Hutchinson a liar?” Jordan asked.</p><p data-start=\"725\" data-end=\"911\">Smith said Hutchinson’s account was second-hand and that investigators were unable to confirm it. He said the Secret Service agent in the vehicle at the time did not back up the claim.</p><p data-start=\"918\" data-end=\"1105\">Jordan pressed whether Smith would have brought Hutchinson forward to testify anyway, and Smith said he had not made “any final determinations”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1773417\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1773417\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1773417\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Hutchinson.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Cassidy Hutchinson testifies\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1773417\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cassidy Hutchinson, former aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testifies before the January 6 committee [Andrew Harnik/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p data-start=\"1112\" data-end=\"1210\">Jordan seized on that response, arguing it showed prosecutors were determined to go after Trump.</p><p data-start=\"1217\" data-end=\"1404\">In fact, Smith said, one of the “central challenges” of the case was to present it in a concise way, “because we did have so many witnesses” – state officials, Trump campaign workers and advisers – to testify.</p><p data-start=\"1411\" data-end=\"1543\">“Some of the most powerful witnesses were witnesses who, in fact, were fellow Republicans who had voted for Donald Trump, who had campaigned for him and who wanted him to win the election,” Smith added.</p><h3>‘Threats to democracy’</h3><p>One Democrat, Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, asked how he would describe the consequences – for US democracy – of not holding Trump accountable for alleged violations of the law and his oath.</p><p>“If we do not hold the most powerful people in our society to the same standards of the rule of law, then it can be catastrophic,” Smith said.</p><p>“Because if they don’t have to follow the law, it’s very easy to understand why people would think they don’t have to follow the law as well.”</p><p>Smith continued, “If we don’t hold people to account when they commit crimes, that it sends a message that those crimes are OK, that our society accepts that… It can endanger our election process, it can endanger election workers, and ultimately our democracy.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261168\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261168\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261168\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26022564164153-1769150771.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261168\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith [Mark Schiefelbein/AP]</figcaption></figure><h3>‘I don’t get it’</h3><p data-start=\"108\" data-end=\"276\">Smith sharply criticised Trump’s decision to issue mass pardons for people convicted in connection with the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol.</p><p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"464\">On his first day back in office, Trump granted clemency to all those charged over the riot, including hundreds who had been accused or convicted of assaulting police officers.</p><p data-start=\"471\" data-end=\"617\">When asked about the move, Smith said: “The people who assaulted police officers and were convicted after trial, in my view and I think in the view of the judges who sentenced them to prison, are dangerous to their communities. As you mentioned, some of these people have already committed crimes against their communities again, and I think all of us – if we are reasonable – know that there is going to be more crimes committed by these people in the future.</p><p data-start=\"1059\" data-end=\"1199\">“I do not understand why you would mass pardon people who assaulted police officers,” Smith said on Thursday. “I don’t get it. I never will.”</p><p data-start=\"1206\" data-end=\"1314\">According to reports, at least 140 police officers were injured during the Capitol attack.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 id=\"smith-defends-his-work\" data-start=\"1206\" data-end=\"1314\">Smith defends his work</h3><p data-start=\"148\" data-end=\"402\">Republican lawmakers sought to portray Smith as an overly aggressive prosecutor who needed to be restrained by senior Justice Department officials as he pursued cases against Trump before the former president’s potential return to office.</p><p data-start=\"404\" data-end=\"591\">They focused, in particular, on Smith’s decision to obtain phone records for members of Congress, including then–House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, arguing the move amounted to overreach.</p><p data-start=\"593\" data-end=\"768\">In a heated exchange, Republican Representative Brandon Gill of Texas accused Smith of using nondisclosure orders to “hide” subpoenas from both their targets and the public.</p><p data-start=\"770\" data-end=\"956\">Smith rejected those claims, saying the collection of phone records was a routine investigative step aimed at understanding the “scope of the conspiracy” to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p data-start=\"958\" data-end=\"1005\">“My office didn’t spy on anyone,” Smith said.</p><p data-start=\"1007\" data-end=\"1195\">He added that nondisclosure orders were sought because of concerns about witness intimidation, pointing to Trump’s public warnings that he would be “coming after” people who crossed him.</p><p data-start=\"1197\" data-end=\"1328\">“I had grave concerns about obstruction of justice in this investigation, specifically with regards to Donald Trump,” Smith said.</p><p data-start=\"1330\" data-end=\"1463\">Smith said prosecutors are not required “to wait until someone gets killed before they move for an order to protect the proceedings”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261174\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261174\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261174\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-22T150653Z_27206898_RC2F6JABS55T_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-SMITH-1769151130.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Former Special Counsel Jack Smith \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Special Counsel Jack Smith arrives to testify before the House Judiciary Committee [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h3>Trump responds</h3><p data-start=\"112\" data-end=\"290\">Trump appeared to be following Smith’s testimony live, posting on Truth Social as the hearing unfolded and praising Republicans for their attacks on the former special counsel.</p><p data-start=\"297\" data-end=\"593\">“Deranged Jack Smith is being DECIMATED before Congress.
