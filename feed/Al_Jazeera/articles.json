The self-declared republic has established its own currency, flag and parliament, though its eastern territories remain disputed.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“This will never be acceptable or tolerable to our government and people who are united in defending our territorial integrity,” Omar said. “Our government strongly advises the State of Israel to rescind its divisive actions and abide by international law.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known locally as Cirro, had been signalling for weeks that recognition by an unnamed state was imminent, though he didn’t clarify which country. Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa had been dotted with billboards in recent weeks, telling residents that recognition was coming.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Omar said the strategic importance of the Horn of Africa was driving foreign interference and interest. “The importance of this region isn’t new. It is still important for international trade today,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"displacement-of-palestinians\">‘Displacement of Palestinians’</h2><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Omar accused Israel of pursuing Somaliland’s recognition in order to further <a href=\"/news/2025/11/16/man-says-shadowy-group-sending-palestinians-out-of-gaza-has-israeli-support\">displace Palestinians</a> from Gaza. “One of the motivating factors is the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera. “It has been widely known – Israel’s goal on that issue.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Palestine’s foreign ministry backed Somalia, recalling that Israel had previously identified Somaliland as a potential destination for forcibly displacing Palestinians from Gaza, which it described as a “red line”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">On Saturday, Somaliland’s Cirro defended the Israeli move, insisting it was “not directed against any state, nor does it pose a threat to regional peace”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the recognition on Friday, Somalia’s prime minister’s office issued a statement describing Israel’s action as a deliberate attack on Somalia’s sovereignty and an unlawful step, and emphasising that Somaliland remains an integral and “inseparable” part of the Somali territory.</p><p>Netanyahu framed the diplomatic breakthrough with Somaliland as being in the spirit of the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/17/trump-expects-expansion-of-abraham-accords-soon-hopes-s-arabia-will-join\">Abraham Accords</a> and said he would champion Somaliland’s cause during his meeting with United States President Donald Trump on Monday. Netanyahu also invited Cirro to Israel, which the latter has accepted.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But Trump has distanced himself from close ally Netanyahu on the issue, telling The New York Post newspaper he would not follow Israel’s lead.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Somalia’s Public Works Minister Ayub Ismail Yusuf welcomed Trump’s stance, writing on social media: “Thank you for your support, Mr. President.”</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Trump’s comments marked a shift from August, when he told a news conference his administration was working on the Somaliland issue. In recent weeks, the US president has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/from-mogadishu-to-minneapolis-somalis-reject-trumps-bigoted-remarks\">frequently attacked</a> the Somali community in the US and Somalia.</p><p>The US has also expressed frustration with Somalia, saying at a recent UN Security Council meeting that Somali authorities had failed in improving security in the country despite billions in aid, and signalling it will not continue to fund a costly peacekeeping mission.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Meanwhile, the African Union’s chairperson, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, rejected any initiative aimed at recognising Somaliland as an independent nation, warning it would set a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications. The continental bloc cited a 1964 decision on the intangibility of borders inherited at a country’s independence as a fundamental principle.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit also condemned what he described as a provocative Israeli assault on the sovereignty of an Arab and African state. He said the Israeli recognition was a clear violation of international law and a flagrant infringement of the principle of state sovereignty.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Despite the international reactions, thousands poured onto the streets of Hargeisa on Friday to celebrate what many saw as the end of 30 years of diplomatic isolation. The Israeli flag was emblazoned on the national museum as residents welcomed the breakthrough.</p><p>Somalia has historically had contentious relations with Israel, stemming from Israel’s historic ties with Somalia’s regional rival, Ethiopia.</p><p>During the Cold War, Israel provided Ethiopia with military training, intelligence and weapons, while Somalia, aligned with Arab states hostile to Israel, was defeated in the 1977 Ogaden War, a setback that helped fuel decades of civil unrest.</p><p>Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 following persecution under former leader Mohammed Siad Barre, but Somalia has never recognised the breakaway region.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Earlier this month, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel revealed there had been communication with Somalia’s government about shared concerns over Houthi influence in the region.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">But Omar, the Somali state minister for foreign affairs, strongly denied any ties with Israel, stating that the country’s position on Israeli policies remained unchanged.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Since then, the conflict has displaced 9.6 million people internally and forced 4.3 million to flee to neighbouring countries, while 30.4 million Sudanese now need humanitarian assistance, according to UN figures.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">UN Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari told the UNSC this week that fears of intensified fighting during the dry season had been confirmed.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">“Each passing day brings staggering levels of violence and destruction,” he said. “Civilians are enduring immense, unimaginable suffering, with no end in sight.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The conflict has shifted in recent weeks to Sudan’s central Kordofan region, where the RSF captured the strategic Heglig oilfield on December 8. The seizure prompted South Sudanese forces to cross into Sudan to protect the infrastructure, which Khiari warned reflects “the increasingly complex nature of the conflict and its expanding regional dimensions”.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The RSF has also launched a final push to consolidate full control over <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/rsf-says-sudans-army-launches-air-strikes-on-paramilitary-stronghold-nyala\">North Darfur state</a>, attacking towns in the Dar Zaghawa region near the Chad border since December 24. The offensive threatens to close the last escape corridor for civilians fleeing the country to Chad.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The Sudan Doctors Network, a medical advocacy group monitoring the conflict, said more than 200 people, including children and women, were killed on an ethnic basis by the RSF in the Ambaro, Sarba, and Abu Qamra areas in North Darfur during the offensive.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">The violence spilled across Sudan’s borders on Friday when a drone attack killed two Chadian soldiers at a military camp in the border town of Tine.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">A Chadian military intelligence officer told Reuters news agency the drone came from Sudan, though it remained unclear whether it was launched by the army or the RSF. Chad has placed its air force on high alert and warned it would “exercise our right to retaliate” if the strike is confirmed as deliberate.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Despite the intensifying conflict, the UN achieved a rare breakthrough, saying on Friday that it conducted its first assessment mission to el-Fasher since the city fell to the RSF.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">UN Humanitarian Coordinator Denise Brown said the mission followed “months of intense fighting, siege, and widespread violations against civilians and humanitarian workers,” adding that “hundreds of thousands of civilians have had to flee el-Fasher and surrounding areas”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Earlier this month, Yale University released a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/16/yale-report-unveils-rsf-attempt-to-cover-up-sudan-atrocities-mass-burials\">report</a> documenting systematic mass killings by the RSF in el-Fasher, with satellite imagery showing evidence of burning and the burial of human remains on a mass scale.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/us-pushes-for-ceasefire-in-sudans-civil-war-as-kordofan-violence-escalates\">warned</a> last week that the fighting was “horrifying” and “atrocious”, telling a news conference that “one day the story of what’s actually happened there is going to be known, and everyone involved is going to look bad”.</p><p>Rubio said he wanted the war to end before the New Year, but there is no strong indication that progress has been made.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Prime Minister Idris’s peace plan proposed an immediate UN-monitored ceasefire and complete RSF withdrawal from the roughly 40 percent of Sudan it controls.

Of these, 749,000 registrations are new since the previous election in 2020.</p><p>They’ll also be voting for national lawmakers, regional and, for the first time in about 40 years, municipal administrators. Average turnout in past years has been about 62 percent, according to the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). There are about 6,700 polling units across the country.</p><p>The National Elections Authority initially planned to hold the municipal government elections at the end of August, but moved the polls to December at the last minute, blaming insufficient funds as well as technical and organisational challenges. The decision has added to concerns among election observers and opposition politicians about how prepared the electoral body is.</p><p>Campaigning began on December 13, but opposition groups claim that delays in including Touadera’s biggest challengers in the process have favoured the president’s rallies.</p><p>The presidential candidate with an absolute majority is declared the winner, but if there is no outright winner in the first round, a second run-off vote will determine the victor.</p><p>Although presidents were previously limited to two, five-year terms, a controversial <a href=\"/news/2023/8/8/opposition-cries-foul-as-central-african-republic-okays-tenure-elongation\">2023 referendum</a> introduced a new constitution which removed term limits and increased each term to seven years.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-running-for-president\">Who is running for president?</h2><p>The country’s constitutional court approved Touadera’s candidacy alongside prominent opposition leader Anicet-Georges Dologuele, ex-Prime Minister Henri-Marie Dondra, and five others.</p><p>However, delays in approving the two major opponents and concerns around the readiness of the electoral body have led an opposition coalition, the Republican Bloc for the Defence of the Constitution (BRDC), to boycott the election. The group has, therefore, not presented a candidate.</p><p>Here is what we know about the candidates who are standing:</p><h3 id=\"faustin-archange-touadera\">Faustin-Archange Touadera</h3><p>Touadera, 68, is a mathematician and former vice chancellor of the University of Bangui. He is running under the ruling United Hearts Movement (MCU).</p><p>He served as the country’s prime minister from 2013 to 2015 under President Francois Bozize. He was elected as president in 2016 and again in 2020, although opposition groups contested the vote.</p><p>Touadera, who is the favourite to win in these polls, has campaigned on promises of peace, security and new infrastructural development in the country.</p><p>After 10 years in office, the president’s legacy is mixed. His administration has been dogged by accusations of suppressing the opposition and rigging elections.</p><p>Indeed, Touadera would not be eligible to run had he not forced the 2023 referendum through. He sacked a chief judge of the constitutional court in October 2022, after she ruled that his referendum project was illegal.</p><p>Opposition members boycotted the referendum, but that only gave the Touadera camp more “yes” votes. Although a civil society group launched a legal challenge against his candidacy before the polls, the constitutional court threw out the suit.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194976\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194976\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194976\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-23T070158Z_1780493371_RC20BCA53HL1_RTRMADP_3_CENTRALAFRICA-ELECTION-TOUADERA-1766647361.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Touadera\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194976\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russian President Vladimir Putin and Central African Republic’s President Faustin-Archange Touadera shake hands as they meet in Moscow, Russia, January 16, 2025 [File: Evgenia Novozhenina/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p>Touadera is credited with spearheading some economic development, compared with his predecessors. New roads and highways have been built where there were previously none, but the World Bank still ranks CAR’s economy as “stagnant”.</p><p>Touadera has also been praised for achieving relative stability in the conflict-affected country where armed groups hold swaths of territory, especially in the areas bordering Sudan.</p><p>Support from a United Nations peacekeeping force, Rwandan troops and Russian Wagner mercenaries has helped to reduce violence in recent years.</p><p>CAR was the first country to invite the Russian mercenary group to the continent in 2018 in a security-for-minerals deal, before other countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, also secured security contracts.</p><p>CAR was historically closer to former colonial power France, but Paris suspended its military alliances and reduced aid budgets to the country in 2021 following the Russia cooperation.</p><p>At a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023, Touadera praised Russia for saving CAR’s democracy. The two met again in January 2025.</p><p>In advance of the elections, Touadera has also signed a series of peace accords with some armed groups active in the country, although there are fears that the agreements will only hold until after the polls.</p><p>The president launched Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2022, making CAR the second country to do so after El Salvador. The idea drew scepticism, as less than 10 percent of Central Africans can access the internet, and was ultimately abandoned after a year.</p><p>In February 2025, CAR launched the $CAR meme coin, which the government said is an experiment.</p><p>This week, Touadera’s government signed a new contract with Elon Musk’s Starlink to expand internet services to rural and remote regions.</p><h3 id=\"henri-marie-dondra\">Henri-Marie Dondra</h3><p>The 59-year-old is a career banker and former finance minister. He is running under his Republican Unity party (UNIR), which has positioned itself as a reformist party and is not part of the opposition coalition. He <a href=\"/news/2021/6/11/central-african-republic-names-former-finance-minister-as-pm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">served as prime minister</a> under Touadera between 2021 and 2022 but was fired, likely because of his strong pro-France tendencies at a time when the administration was turning towards Russia, according to reporting by French radio, RFI.</p><p>Dondra’s candidacy was not approved until November 14, after Touadera accused him of holding Congolese citizenship, which he denied. The accusations raised fears that he would be barred from the vote. Two of his brothers were reportedly arrested and detained without charge before the vote, Dondra told Human Rights Watch in late November.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4194980\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4194980\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4194980\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-25T070158Z_1199617705_RC29NIAPZ0S2_RTRMADP_3_CENTRALAFRICA-ELECTION-PREVIEW-1766647511.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1159&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dologuele\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4194980\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A campaign billboard of presidential candidate Anicet-Georges Dologuele, of the Union for Central African Renewal (URCA), stands before the presidential election scheduled for December 28, in Bangui, Central African Republic, December 24, 2025 [Leger Serge Kokpakpa/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"anicet-georges-dologuele\">Anicet-Georges Dologuele</h3><p>The main opposition leader of the Union for Central African Renewal (URCA) party broke from the boycotting opposition coalition in order to run in these elections. Dologuele’s candidacy has prompted what some analysts say are xenophobic statements from Touadera’s supporters.</p><p>The 68-year-old dual citizen French-CAR politician first ran for the top job back in 2015 and was the runner-up in the 2020 presidential race. His third bid has faced challenges over his citizenship status. The 2023 referendum limited candidates to CAR citizenship only, and derisive comments from some in the governing camp have suggested some opposition candidates are not “real Central Africans”.</p><p>In September, Dologuele said he had given up his French citizenship; however, in October, a Central African court stripped him of his CAR citizenship, citing a clause in the old constitution disallowing dual citizenship. Dologuele reported the issue as a violation of his human rights to the UN human rights agency. It’s unclear what, if any, action the agency took, but Dologuele’s name on the final candidates list suggests his citizenship was reinstated.</p><p>Dologuele served as prime minister in the 1990s, under President Ange-Felix Patasse, before joining the Bank of Central African States and later heading the Development Bank of Central African States.</p><p>Although he is seen by some as an experienced hand, others associate him with past government failures. Dologuele is promising stronger democratic institutions and better international alliances.</p><h3>Other notable candidates</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>Aristide Briand Reboas</strong> – leader of the Christian Democratic Party, the 46-year-old was a former intelligence official and the sports minister until 2024. He is running on promises of better amenities, including electricity and water. He previously ran in 2020.</li>\n<li><strong>Serge Djorie </strong>– a former government spokesperson until 2024, the 49-year-old is running under his Collective for Political Change for the new Central African Republic party. The medical doctor and published researcher has campaigned on public health reforms, poverty reduction and more pan-Africanism. Djorie ran in the 2020 elections.</li>\n<li><strong>Eddy Symphorien Kparekouti</strong> – The civil engineer helped draft the new constitution that was controversially adopted in 2023. In his campaigns, the independent candidate has emphasised poverty reduction in order to solve political insecurity and other developmental challenges.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-are-the-key-issues-for-this-election\">What are the key issues for this election?</h2><h3 id=\"persistent-insecurity\">Armed groups</h3><p>Protracted political conflict in CAR has continued for more than a decade, with many Central Africans saying they want a leadership that can bring peace.</p><p>Trouble began following a coup in March 2013 by the mainly Muslim Seleka rebel alliance that overthrew President Francois Bozize. In retaliation, Bozize assembled Christian and animist rebel armed groups, known as the Anti-balaka. Both sides attacked civilians and have been accused of war crimes by rights groups. Bozize, who continues to lead a rebel coalition, is now in exile in Guinea-Bissau. His attempted attacks in 2020 were fended off by Touadera’s Russian mercenaries.</p><p>However, killings, kidnappings and displacement continue in many rural communities in the country’s northwest, northeast and southeast regions, despite recent peace deals signed with some groups.

A military Telegram channel said Russian cruise and ballistic missiles were being deployed to target the city.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russia’s Ministry of Defence claimed that its forces captured the Ukrainian village of Kosivtseve in the southeastern Zaporizhia region, adding that it had taken more than 23 square kilometres (9sq miles) of territory to secure the village.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s military has acknowledged that one of its units committed errors in “an unfortunate incident” when a group of just three infiltrating Russian soldiers deceived Ukrainian forces into abandoning a post in Huliaipole town, which encompasses Kosivtseve.</li>\n<li class=\"tr-story-p1\">Russian overnight drone attacks damaged vessels under the flags of Slovakia, Palau and Liberia in ports in Ukraine’s Odesa and Mykolaiv regions, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said in a statement on Telegram.

During the call, Carney “emphasised the need to maintain pressure on Russia to negotiate”, the statement added.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">Putin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitriev participated in talks with members of the US administration along with the Kremlin’s foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov, Reuters reported, citing a source close to the talks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has declared that his nation and Russia had shared “blood, life and death” <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/north-koreas-kim-bestows-hero-titles-on-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-war\">in the Ukraine war</a>, as he sent President Vladimir Putin New Year’s greetings.

Israel has never arrested or charged any of its troops for killing journalists.</p><p>While the targeting of the press intensified during the genocidal war in Gaza, Israel has killed dozens of Arab journalists over the past two decades, including Al Jazeera’s veteran correspondent <a href=\"/features/longform/2023/5/11/shireen-abu-akleh-al-jazeera-reporter-and-daughter-of-palestine\">Shireen Abu Akleh</a> in the occupied West Bank in 2022.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Muhammad al-Lahham, head of the Committee for Freedoms at the syndicate, said the scale and consistency of the attacks amount to international crimes.</p><p>The events of the past year, he said, “constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, and represent a systematic targeting of a protected group, journalists, within the framework of an official policy to silence the media by force”.</p><p>Al-Lahham rejected claims that journalists had been caught accidentally in hostilities, describing instead a deliberate operational logic. What Israel was enforcing, he said, was a “field doctrine based on the principle of ‘no witnesses, no narrative, no image'”.</p><p>In December, a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/israel-the-top-killer-of-journalists-worldwide-once-again-says-rsf-report#:~:text=Nearly%20300%20journalists%20and%20media,Israeli%20forces%20in%20the%20occupied\">report</a> by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) found that Israel killed more journalists in 2025 than any other country.</p><h2 id=\"silencing-witnesses\" data-start=\"1633\" data-end=\"1896\">Silencing witnesses</h2><p>The report described 2025 as “a year of repeated mass targeting, particularly in tents, hospitals, and press gatherings”, warning that Palestine had become one of the most dangerous places in the world to practise journalism.</p><p>Several <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/israel-extends-law-that-banned-al-jazeera-for-two-more-years#:~:text=Many%20Al%20Jazeera%20journalists%20%E2%80%93%20and,during%20the%20two%2Dyear%20war.\">Al Jazeera</a> journalists have been among those killed, in some cases alongside members of their families.</p><p>In August, Israeli attacks killed al-Sharif and three other Al Jazeera journalists. They are among nearly 300 journalists and media workers killed in Gaza during the war over 26 months – an average of about 12 journalists a month – according to Shireen.ps, a monitoring website named after Abu Akleh.</p><p>Beyond fatalities, the committee documented a sharp rise in life-altering injuries. Many journalists suffered amputations, paralysis or blindness after strikes to the head, neck, chest and abdomen. The dangers did not come solely from the Israeli army, the report said, but also from settlers.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3884255\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3884255\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3884255\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000044491-4-1754998856.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"From left: Al Jazeera journalist killed by Israel earlier this.

On April 7 and 8, Israeli strikes hit a <a href=\"/news/2025/4/7/israel-bombs-media-tent-in-gaza-killing-and-wounding-reporters\">journalists’ tent</a> at Nasser Hospital, wounding nine reporters and destroying equipment. Several died of their injuries later.</p><p>This documented and recurring incident occurred and involved the use of heavy weaponry, “amounting to a complex war crime and a collective targeting of the press”, the committee said.</p><p>By mid-2025, patterns of permanent disability had emerged. Journalist Akram Dalloul lost his sight, Jamal Badah had his leg amputated, and Muhammad Fayeq was left paralysed.</p><p>The committee stressed that most attacks occurred while journalists were clearly identifiable, wearing protective gear and press badges, and working in locations long recognised as media gathering points. Many were targeted repeatedly, it added, underscoring what it described as Israel’s sustained assault on the Palestinian press.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it appears that Netanyahu is still not satisfied and will be pushing for more military actions against Iran when he returns to the US on Sunday to visit Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>This time, the focus is on Iran’s missile programme.</p><p>Israeli officials and their US allies are beating the drums of war against Iran once again, arguing that Tehran’s missiles must be addressed urgently.</p><p>But analysts said another clash with Iran would stand in stark opposition to Trump’s stated foreign policy priorities.</p><p>Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy think tank, said that while Trump is pushing to deepen economic cooperation and forge diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states, Netanyahu is seeking military domination over the region.</p><p>“This desire for perpetual US involvement, for perpetual wars against Iran to really break the Iranian state reflects Israel’s aim for unchallenged dominance, unchallenged hegemony and expansionism,” Toossi said.</p><p>“And so I think that’s at the root of Netanyahu’s goals and the direction he wants to push the US into supporting, but that’s going to come to a head with US interests going in another direction and wanting more stability in the region that doesn’t necessitate direct American military involvement.”</p><p>Since brokering a truce in Gaza, which Israel has been violating almost daily, Trump, who portrays himself <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/6/infantinos-peace-prize-to-trump-raises-questions-about-fifas-neutrality\">as a peacemaker</a>, has been claiming that he brought peace to the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years.</p><p>And his administration’s recently released <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">National Security Strategy</a> says the region is “emerging as a place of partnership, friendship, and investment” that is no longer a priority for the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"shifting-the-goal-posts\">Shifting the goal posts</h2><p>As the US promises to diminish its military and strategic footprint in the Middle East, Israel appears to be lobbying for a war that could drag Washington into conflict.</p><p>In past decades, Israel has drummed up Iran’s nuclear programme as the top threat to its security and the world.</p><p>But Trump has been insisting that the US strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities in June wiped out the programme.</p><p>Regardless of the accuracy of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-says-its-strikes-degraded-irans-nuclear-programme-by-one-to-two-years\">Trump’s assessment</a>, his proclamation has pushed Israel to find another boogeyman, analysts said, to avoid contradicting the US president publicly.</p><p>Trita Parsi, executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a US think tank that promotes diplomacy, said that since Trump has declared “rightly or wrongly” the nuclear issue resolved, Israel is switching the focus to missiles to keep the pressure on Tehran.</p><p>“Netanyahu is pushing the United States to join Israel in yet another war with Iran, this time with a focus on the missiles, partly because Trump is not receptive to the idea of addressing the nuclear issue – since he has said that he fixed it, he ‘obliterated’ the programme,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The Israelis will constantly shift the goal posts in order to make sure that they can make the confrontation with Iran an endless, forever war.”</p><p>Iran has always maintained that its nuclear programme is peaceful, unlike Israel, which is widely believed to possess an undeclared <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/6/19/what-are-the-risks-from-israel-and-irans-nuclear-capabilities\">nuclear arsenal</a>.</p><p>Tehran has also never launched missiles at Israel unprompted.</p><p>During the June war, Iran fired <a href=\"/gallery/2025/6/19/iran-launches-missile-attacks-as-israel-strikes-nuclear-sites\">hundreds of missiles</a> towards Israel, dozens of which penetrated the country’s multilayered air defences, but it was Israel that launched the war without apparent provocation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-s-supporters-focus-on-missiles\">Israel’s supporters focus on missiles</h2><p>Still, Israel and its allies have been sounding the alarm about the Iranian missile programme, warning that Tehran is recovering and increasing its production capacity.</p><p>“While Israel’s Operation Rising Lion succeeded in destroying much of Iran’s ballistic missile capabilities, Israel estimates that some 1,500 missiles remain out of the 3,000 Iran had previously,” the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) said in an email to supporters this month.</p><p>“The ballistic missile threat from Iran will be on the agenda when Prime Minister Netanyahu travels to Florida on Sunday and meets with President Trump Monday at Mar-a-Lago.”</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham, an Iran hawk who is close to Trump, visited Israel this month and repeated the talking points about the dangers of Iran’s long-range missiles, warning that Iran is producing them “in very high numbers”.</p><p>“We cannot allow Iran to produce ballistic missiles because they could overwhelm the Iron Dome,” he told The Jerusalem Post, referring to Israel’s air defence system. “It’s a major threat.”</p><p>Israeli Defence Minister <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/israel-will-never-fully-withdraw-from-gaza-defence-minister-says\">Israel Katz</a> has also highlighted Iran’s missile capacity, suggesting that Netanyahu’s government will not tolerate any threats in the region.</p><p>“The defence establishment is closely monitoring developments, and naturally, I cannot elaborate beyond that,” Katz was quoted as saying by The Times of Israel.</p><p>“But on one principle, there is no dispute: What was before October 7 will not be again,” he was quoted as saying in reference to the 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel. “We will not allow threats of annihilation against the state of Israel.”</p><p>But critics said Israel is seeking hegemony in the region, not merely snuffing out existential threats.</p><p>Its ultimate goal is seen as changing Iran’s government or carrying out periodic strikes to keep the country weakened and without meaningful military capabilities.</p><p>“The Israelis will come back every six months with another plan to bomb Iran, and then it will not end until Trump decides to end it,” Parsi told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“So if he acquiesces again, as he did in June, he will face the Israelis once again next June with another war plan, and next December and next June again. It will not stop until he stops it.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-s-base\">Trump’s base</h2><p>Foreign policy hawks who advocate for a change in Iran’s government once dominated Trump’s Republican Party.</p><p>But partly thanks to Trump himself, now large segments of the base staunchly oppose military interventions and favour focusing on US problems.</p><p>That America First movement, represented by influential right-wing media figures like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, pleaded with Trump against attacking Iran in June.</p><p>Even the late Charlie Kirk, a close Trump ally and staunch <a href=\"/news/2025/9/11/israeli-leaders-heap-praise-on-charlie-kirk-as-a-staunch-ally-of-israel\">Israel supporter</a>, spoke out against US involvement in the war.</p><p>Carlson has already slammed Israel’s renewed push for war.</p><p>“It’s been less than six months since Trump risked a war with Iran on Netanyahu’s behalf, but instead of acting grateful, the prime minister is already demanding more,” he wrote in his newsletter this month. “This is the definition of a parasitic relationship.”</p><p>However, the Republican caucus in Congress remains overwhelmingly aligned with Israel, and Trump’s top foreign policy aide, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is an Iran hawk.</p><p><span>Pro-Israel megadonors who helped bankroll Trump’s campaign, like <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/who-is-miriam-adelson-the-pro-israel-donor-trump-lauded-at-the-knesset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miriam Adelson,</a> will also likely exert counterpressure against the America First voices in the Trump movement.</span></p><p>“Those are hugely important factors, but I think it’s important to understand that they go both ways,” Parsi said of the domestic considerations for war with Iran.</p><p>“The voters don’t want this. The donors – at least a large number of them – want this. And come midterm elections [in November 2026], those are going to be two pressures in opposite directions from two groups, both of whom Trump believes that he needs.”</p><p>Toossi said political calculations for a war with Iran are more relevant now than they were in June because we are closer to the 2026 elections, which will decide who controls Congress.</p><p>“Trump’s popularity is very low now with the affordability crisis and this conservative fissure over foreign policy. So I think all of these factors serve as a limitation on Trump’s ability to get into a big war,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"risk-of-escalation\">Risk of escalation</h2><p>Trump was able to claim victory after the US strikes in June.</p><p>He backed Israel, damaged the Iranian nuclear programme and kept his base intact without dragging the US into another protracted conflict.</p><p>After an Iranian <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/hld-irans-attack-on-al-udeid-air-base-in-qatar-all-you-need-to-know\">missile attack</a> against a US base in Qatar, which did not result in American casualties, Trump announced a ceasefire to end the war after 12 days.</p><p>But analysts warned that a second round of bombardment against Iran may not be as easy to end.</p><p>Parsi said the restraint that Iran showed in June is unlikely to be replicated because Tehran’s unwillingness to escalate was perceived as weakness by the Western world.</p><p>“The Iranian response would be much harsher, much quicker because the Iranians understand that unless they strike back hard and dispel the view that Iran is a country that you can bomb every six months – unless they do that – Iran will become a country that Israel will bomb every six months,” he said.</p><p>Parsi warned that Israel may start attacking Iran unilaterally and count on US air defences in the region to come to its aid, slowly pulling the US into the conflict.</p><p>He said Trump must stop Israel from launching an attack from the start.</p><p>“If they don’t want Israel to start that war, you tell Israel, ‘Don’t start that war. And we are completely out.’ That would be the America First position to take,” he said.</p><p>Parsi invoked Trump’s National Security Strategy (NSS), which stated that Washington’s “historic reason for focusing on the Middle East will recede” as the region moves towards greater cooperation and less conflict.</p><p>“Well, then, recede,” Parsi said.</p><p>“So many administrations in a row have said something along these lines, whether in the NSS or outside of it. Then do it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

We have passed the test of confrontation. We may be weak in resources, but our faith and will are strong,” he said, adding that security had improved to the extent that Taliban officials now travel across the country without weapons.</p><p>The Taliban insists that no “terrorist groups” are operating from Afghanistan. However, in a recent report, the United Nations sanctions-monitoring committee cited the presence of multiple armed groups, including ISKP, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, al-Qaeda, the Turkistan Islamic Party, Jamaat Ansarullah and Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan.</p><p>Jamaat Ansarullah is a Tajik group linked to al-Qaeda-aligned networks and active primarily in northern Afghanistan near the Tajik border.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196763\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196763\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196763\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20240517__34PH83M__v1__MidRes__TajikistanAfghanistanDiplomacyTrade-1766749395.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C502&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"taliban\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Afghans travel along a border road as seen from Tajikistan’s Darvoz district [File: Amir Isaev/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-are-relations-between-tajikistan-and-the-taliban\">How are relations between Tajikistan and the Taliban?</h2><p>For decades, the relationship between Tajikistan and the Taliban has been defined by deep ideological hostility and ethnic mistrust with Dushanbe one of the group’s fiercest critics in Central Asia.</p><p>In the 1990s, Tajikistan aligned with the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, led by Afghan military commander and former Defence Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud.</p><p>After the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, Tajikistan stood as the lone holdout among its neighbours in refusing to officially recognise the new government.</p><p>However, pragmatic diplomatic engagement quietly began about 2023, driven by economic necessity and shared security fears over the presence of ISKP. Stepping up the restoration of relations, a high-level Tajik delegation visited Kabul in November, the first such visit since the Taliban’s return to power.</p><p>But the two governments continue to trade accusations that the other is harbouring “terrorists”, the major thorn remaining in their bilateral relationship, and that drug smuggling is occurring across their border.</p><p>The Tajik-Afghan border has long been a major trafficking route for Afghan heroin and methamphetamine into Central Asia and onwards to Russia and Europe, exploiting the area’s rugged terrain and weak policing.</p><p>“The rising frequency [of the clashes] is new and interesting and raises a point: whether we might be seeing a new threat emerging,” Bahiss said.</p><p>Badakshan province, from which Tajik authorities said the attacks on Chinese nationals originate, presents a complex security situation for the Taliban as it has struggled to stem the threat from armed opposition groups, Bahiss added.</p><p>This security issue has been further complicated by the Taliban’s crackdown on poppy cultivation in the province, he said. The Taliban has faced resistance to this policy from farmers in the north. This is largely because the terrain of Badakshan means poppies are the only viable cash crop.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4196745\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4196745\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4196745\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-10-13T143010Z_997153299_RC20BHA2RDCP_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-AFGHANISTAN-1766748858.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"taliban\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4196745\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Afghanistan’s Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi called his Tajik counterpart early this month to express regret about the attacks on Chinese nationals and say his government was prepared to boost cooperation between their border forces [Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-is-the-taliban-faring-with-other-neighbours\">How is the Taliban faring with other neighbours?</h2><p>Since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021, some of its neighbours have maintained a pragmatic transactional relationship while others have not.</p><p>Relations with Pakistan, previously its patron, have <a href=\"/news/2024/12/28/analysis-why-have-pakistans-ties-with-the-afghan-taliban-turned-frigid\">particularly deteriorated</a>.

However, both sides have engaged in fighting since, blaming each other for breaking the fragile truce.</p><p>The Taliban denies Islamabad’s allegations and has blamed Pakistan for its “own security failures”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Taliban is now invested in <a href=\"/features/2025/1/11/why-is-india-courting-the-taliban-now\">developing a new relationship</a> with Pakistan’s archrival, India, with delegations visiting Indian cities for trade and security discussions.
