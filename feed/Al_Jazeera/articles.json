They have built echo chambers where people live cut off from other narratives, and from the true complexity of the world,” Sheikh Nasser bin Faisal Al Thani said at the Web Summit Qatar 2026 on Tuesday.</p><p>Journalism, the Al Jazeera director general, said, is “not an alternative to technology, or in opposition to it, but rather a valuable force capable of adding context to events, connecting diverse voices, and revealing the human stories behind the news”.</p><p>“The evolution of journalism cannot be separated from profound changes driven by digital platforms and artificial intelligence within the public sphere,” he said.</p><p>But he called on the global technology sector to fundamentally rethink the design of digital platforms, warning that algorithmic models prioritising “shock” and “outrage” are eroding shared human understanding.</p><p>Sheikh Nasser argued that humanity has entered an era where the challenge is no longer accessing information, but making sense of its “over-abundance”.</p><p>Addressing a packed audience at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center, Sheikh Nasser cautioned that while technology has democratised storytelling, it has also given rise to “troubling realities” where attention-based economic models deepen division instead of fostering dialogue.</p><p>“Many are now surrounded by cascades of content, yet they feel more isolated, more alienated,” Sheikh Nasser said. He warned that current digital systems often “flatten complex truths into harsh binary choices”, creating fragmented worlds where “disagreements never meet.”</p><h2 id=\"the-core-project\">The ‘Core Project’</h2><p>Amid the fast-paced technological changes, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Al Jazeera has embarked on a comprehensive initiative dubbed the “Core Project” to review its role, responsibility, and purpose in the digital age.</p><p>Describing it as a “re-evaluation of the fundamental ideas that underpin our journalism”, rather than just a technical upgrade, Sheikh Nasser outlined a strategy to combine technology with “ethical and professional responsibility”.</p><p>“We plan to combine technology with ethical and professional responsibility, to give journalists the tools to provide context, to report responsibly on breaking news, to separate facts from biases, and to maximise the power of objective analysis and understanding,” he said.</p><p>The initiative aims to automate repetitive tasks to free up journalists for high-value analysis, centred on three guiding principles: The “Now”, “Meaning or Context”, and “People”.</p><p>“The ‘Now’ alone cannot guide us,” he noted, explaining that while speed and accuracy are vital, journalism must provide the “Meaning” by linking events to their root causes.</p><p>Most critically, he redefined the audience not as passive consumers or data points, but as “conscious actors” capable of engaging responsibly with the world.</p><p>“Resilient journalism – swift but not shallow, modern without abandoning its values – can restore context to the news, create space for debate, and a human dimension to disagreements,” Sheikh Nasser said.</p><p>The director general concluded with a direct appeal to the tech leaders and innovators gathered in Doha, calling for a partnership where “responsible journalism meets ethical technology”.</p><p>“The challenge we face today is not a battle between journalism and technology,” Sheikh Nasser said. “It is rather an opportunity to align them through shared responsibility … to bridge divides, and empower a world capable of dialogue.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Last month during the violent clashes between Kurdish forces and the Syrian army, the United States delivered a devastating message to Syria’s Kurds: Their partnership with Washington had “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/us-envoy-says-sdfs-role-in-syria-has-largely-expired-after-isil\">expired</a>“. This was not merely a statement of shifting priorities – it was a clear signal that the US was siding with Damascus and abandoning the Kurds at their most vulnerable moment.</p><p>For the Kurds across the region watching events unfold, the implications were profound. The US is no longer perceived as a reliable partner or supporter of minorities.</p><p>This development is likely to have an impact not just on the Kurdish community in Syria but also those in Iraq, Turkiye and Iran.</p><h2 id=\"fears-of-repeat-marginalisation-in-syria\">Fears of repeat marginalisation in Syria</h2><p>US support for Damascus under interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa paves the way for a centralised Syrian state – an arrangement that Kurds throughout the region view with deep suspicion. Their wariness is rooted in bitter historical experience.</p><p>Centralised states in the Middle East have historically marginalised, excluded and assimilated Kurdish minorities. The prospect of such a system emerging in Syria, with US backing, represents a fundamental divergence from Kurdish hopes for the region’s future.</p><p>The approach the Assad regime to the Kurdish question was built on systematic denial. Kurds were not recognised as a distinct collective group within Syria’s national fabric; the state banned the public use of the Kurdish language and Kurdish names. Many Kurds were denied citizenship.</p><p>Al-Sharaa’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">presidential decree</a> of January 16 promised Kurds some rights while the January 30 agreement between Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) included limited recognition of Kurdish collective identity, including acknowledgment of “Kurdish regions” – terminology conspicuously absent from Syria’s political vocabulary and government documents in the past.</p><p>These represent incremental gains, but they are unfolding within a transitional government structure that aims for centralisation as its ultimate objective. That is why Syrian Kurds remain suspicious of whether the promises made today will be upheld in the future.</p><p>While a consensus has emerged among the majority of Kurdish groups that armed resistance is not strategically viable at this stage, any future engagement with the US will be perceived with mistrust.</p><h2 id=\"possibility-of-renewed-shia-kurdish-alliance-in-iraq\">Possibility of renewed Shia-Kurdish alliance in Iraq</h2><p>After years of power rivalries between Shia and Kurdish parties in Iraq, both groups are now observing developments in Syria and potential changes in Iran with a shared sense of threat and common interests. If in 2003, their alliance was driven by a shared past – the suffering under Saddam Hussein’s regime – today it is being guided by a shared future shaped by fears of being marginalised in the region.</p><p>At both the political and popular levels, Shia and Kurdish parties and communities have had much more in common over the past few weeks than in the past. This convergence is evident not only in elite political calculations but also in public sentiment across both communities.</p><p>For the first time in recent memory, both Kurdish elites and ordinary citizens in Iraq are no longer enthusiastic about regime change in Iran, a position that would have been unthinkable just a few weeks ago.</p><p>In addition, last month, Iraq’s Shia Coordination Framework, an alliance of its Shia political parties, nominated Nouri al-Maliki for prime <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/iraq-shia-alliance-nominates-former-pm-nouri-al-maliki-as-its-candidate\">minister</a>, the most powerful position in the Iraqi government. Remarkably, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the dominant Kurdish political force, welcomed the nomination.</p><p>The KDP’s support for al-Maliki was not solely a reaction to anger over US policy in Syria. It was also rooted in Iraqi and Kurdish internal politics. The endorsement is part of an ongoing rivalry between the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) over Iraq’s presidency, an office reserved for the Kurds. The KDP needs allies in Baghdad to ensure its candidate, rather than the PUK’s, secures the position.</p><p>However, Washington might see an alignment between the KDP-led Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq and an al-Maliki-led government or a similar government in Baghdad as not conducive to its interests in Iraq, especially its efforts to curb Iranian influence.</p><p>Before casting blame, Washington should ask itself why the Kurds feels compelled to adopt this position. The Kurdish stance cannot be fully understood without factoring US policy in Syria into the discussion. From a Kurdish perspective, the US has not been a neutral arbiter in Syria.</p><h2 id=\"the-peace-process-in-turkiye\">The peace process in Turkiye</h2><p>Over the past year, many believed that the sustainability of Turkiye’s peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) hinged on a resolution of the Kurdish question in Syria and the fate of the SDF.</p><p>The violent clashes between Damascus, backed by Ankara and Washington, and the SDF threatened to close the door on negotiations. Remarkably, however, not all avenues have been shut.</p><p>It now appears the two issues are being treated as separate files. Negotiations with the PKK are likely to continue within Turkiye’s borders, and crucially, PKK leaders have not translated their disappointment over the weakening of the SDF into a definitive rejection of talks with Ankara.</p><p>What sustains this dynamic is that the SDF has not been entirely dismantled, leaving some breathing room for continued dialogue between Ankara and the PKK.</p><h2 id=\"the-iranian-kurds\">The Iranian Kurds</h2><p>The Iranian Kurds, although farther away from Syria, have also observed events there and made their conclusions. The abandonment of the SDF reveals the unpredictable nature of US support for the region’s minorities.</p><p>In light of this and given continuing US incitement against the Iranian regime, it is quite significant that the Iranian Kurds collectively and deliberately decided not to be at the forefront of the recent protests or allow themselves to be instrumentalised by Western media.</p><p>The Kurdish community in Iran is not enthusiastic about a potential return of Reza Pahlavi, who clearly enjoys support from Washington, and the restoration of the shah’s legacy, which was also oppressive. Iranian opposition groups – many of them based in the West – have not offered a better prospect for the Kurdish question. There is widespread fear that the current regime could simply be replaced by another with no guarantee for Kurdish rights.</p><p>Some Iraq-based Iranian Kurdish armed groups did carry out attacks on Iranian positions near the Iran-Iraq border. But the main Iranian Kurdish armed actors chose not to engage directly or escalate militarily. Their calculations are based on the uncertainty about the endgame envisioned by Israel and the US and the reality that any escalation would provoke Iranian retaliation against Iraqi Kurds.</p><p>With each abandonment of its Kurdish allies, the US further erodes the foundation of trust upon which its local partnerships rest. Iraqi and Syrian Kurds have learned to live with American unreliability, but this arrangement may not endure indefinitely. When it fractures, the consequences for US influence in the region could be profound.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

It makes no promises, pays no interest, and is not dependent on political decisions. It simply exists. And that is precisely why it provides security,” Diego Franzin, head of portfolio strategies at Plenisfer Investments, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“In a system based on record levels of public and private debt, this characteristic takes on unprecedented value.”</p><p>Another factor driving demand has been purchases by central banks in emerging economies, including China and Turkiye, which have been seeking to lessen their dependence on the dollar.</p><p>On Thursday, gold hit a record peak of almost $5,595 an ounce, while silver hit an all-time high of nearly $122.</p><p>The blistering rally came to a sudden halt on Friday when gold and silver prices plunged about 10 percent and 28 percent, respectively.</p><p>The slide continued into Monday, with gold ending the day about 4.5 percent lower and silver down about 6.5 percent.</p><p>On Tuesday, the precious metals clawed back some of their gains, with gold up about 3.5 percent and silver up about 4.5 percent as of 06:00 GMT.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-gold-and-silver-prices-crash\">Why did gold and silver prices crash?</h2><p>Analysts are not united on the cause of the fall.</p><p>Some have suggested that Trump was responsible for bringing prices back to earth just as he was for driving the surge.</p><p>On Friday, Trump announced he would nominate Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve, a pick that was widely seen as relatively conventional compared with other names on his shortlist.</p><p>The choice of Warsh, a former member of the Fed’s seven-member board of governors, was welcomed by investors who had feared that Trump would tap an ally who would slash interest rates without paying heed to inflation risks. The US president has been pressuring the outgoing Fed chief, Jerome Powell, to cut rates.</p><p>Trump on Friday also expressed hopes that he would reach a deal with Iran, following weeks of threats of military action against the Middle Eastern country.</p><p>Some analysis has suggested that the prospect of more stable economic conditions and a rising dollar led investors to sell off precious metals.</p><p>Many analysts, however, have cast doubt on that explanation, arguing that the drop simply reflected the fact that prices had become overvalued.</p><p>“The more likely explanation is that precious metals prices collapsed simply because they had already gone parabolic in the previous week. Once profit-taking started, it just snowballed,” Mark Matthews, head of research for Asia at Bank Julius Baer, told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-to-gold-and-silver-prices-next\">What will happen to gold and silver prices next?</h2><p>Predicting the market is famously a fool’s errand, but some analysts see precious metals continuing to gain over the medium-to-long term.</p><p>In a note on Sunday, JP Morgan analysts said they expected gold to reach $6,300 an ounce – a 30 percent gain from current prices – by the end of 2026.</p><p>“Gold remains a dynamic, multi-faceted portfolio hedge and investor demand has continued to come in stronger than our previous expectations,” Gregory Shearer, Jason Hunter, Ali Ibrahim and Ananyashree Gupta said in the note.</p><p>Bank Julius Baer’s Matthews said investors are likely to pick up their purchases of gold and silver once they believe the market has stabilised.</p><p>“Their two fundamental drivers remain unchanged – namely, the US dollar should continue to depreciate, and central banks should increase their holdings in gold,” Matthews said.</p><p>“The price ascent probably won’t be as steep as it was before, but that’s a good thing.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

And how?</h2><p>Most drones in Sudan are smuggled in by a network of foreign backers via land, sea and air, bypassing official embargoes, as foreign states exploit the situation to their advantage.</p><p>The SAF is believed to have drone technology and military support from Egypt, Russia, Iran and Turkiye, using Eritrea as a transit hub to Port Sudan, according to Krieg and Critical Threats, a project established by the American Enterprise Institute to analyse national security threats globally.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/are-iranian-drones-turning-tide-sudans-civil-war-2024-04-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters</a>, the SAF has received Iranian drones and parts with Iranian Mohajer-6s reportedly arriving in late 2023 and 2024, often via cargo flights arriving in Port Sudan, which the army has not confirmed. Turkiye has provided Bayraktar drones via Egypt, according to Critical Threats.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/drones-over-sudan-foreign-powers-in-sudans-civil-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Critical Threats</a> and the <a href=\"https://static.rusi.org/pb-russia-red-sea-final-web-version.pdf\">Royal United Services Institute</a> defence think tank have found that several of the foreign actors supplying drones to the SAF, such as Iran and Russia, have done so in exchange for a regional presence. Iran reportedly hopes to secure a Red Sea naval base while Russia is said to have switched from supporting the RSF via the Kremlin-funded Wagner Group to supporting the SAF in 2024 in exchange for reinstating a 2017 agreement for a Red Sea naval base.<strong> </strong></p><p>The RSF, on the other hand, has reportedly received drone technology and military support from the UAE through various transit points, including eastern Chad, South Sudan, southeastern Libya, northeastern Somalia and the Central African Republic.</p><p>Sudan's UN ambassador, Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed, has repeatedly and publicly accused the UAE at the UN Security Council of arming the RSF. While Abu Dhabi denies these claims, open-source analysis has documented dozens of UAE-operated cargo flights flying into eastern Chad since April 2023. According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/uae-flights-flood-airstrip-un-says-supplies-weapons-sudan-rebels-2024-12-12/#:~:text=At%20least%2086%20flights%20from,corporate%20documents%20reviewed%20by%20Reuters.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters</a>, at least 86 UAE flights suspected of carrying weapons for the RSF landed at Chad’s Amdjarass airstrip.</p><p>“The UAE sits at the hub because it can combine procurement capacity, permissive commercial infrastructure, aviation connectivity and a dense layer of intermediaries that can move dual-use systems without a clear state signature,” Krieg said.</p><p>“From there, the spokes run through jurisdictions that offer cover, weak oversight or useful geography.”</p><p>Krieg said Amdjarass matters because of its proximity to Darfur and its mix of humanitarian and commercial traffic that provides cover.</p><p>According to Reuters, satellite images showed UAE-branded pallets being unloaded near RSF supply routes. From Chad, arms are trucked into Darfur or through areas controlled by eastern Libya military commander Khalifa Haftar. The RSF is also said to operate out of Somalia with Bosaso airport, located in Somalia’s semiautonomous Puntland region, being developed by the UAE. However, the UAE has denied this.</p><p>Eastern Libya is another route, drawing on Haftar-aligned networks already experienced in smuggling and convoy protection. Further afield, hubs like Bosaso and Entebbe, Uganda, are staging points where shipments can be broken down, redocumented and moved onwards in smaller consignments, “preserving plausible deniability”, according to Krieg.</p><p>“The drones themselves rarely need to travel as complete aircraft. The most resilient model is modular transport: airframes, engines, datalinks, optics, batteries, ground control components and munitions moving separately under commercial cover.</p><p>“When you add the commodity layer, especially gold, the network becomes self-financing. The same corridors that move drone parts can move bullion, cash and high-value goods back out [of Sudan],” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Then he paused. “But honestly, what matters more is a healthy job market and recruitment on merit.”</p><p>Rafi was among the wave of young people who joined the 2024 protests that began over a job reservation system many saw as unfair and later spiralled into a nationwide uprising that toppled then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government.</p><p>Now, Bangladesh is heading to an election on February 12.</p><p>With Hasina’s Awami League barred from the ballot, the race is expected to largely revolve around a Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led coalition and a bloc led by the Jamaat-e-Islami, which has courted liberal allies, including the uprising-born National Citizen Party.</p><p>Senior figures from both camps are crisscrossing the country, headlining rallies and stage programmes as campaigning enters its final stretch. From platforms to doorsteps to social media, candidates and party activists are tapping familiar anxieties: jobs, price relief, tax cuts, and an end to corruption and discrimination.</p><p>But analysts and voters say that while many of the promises go to the heart of people’s insecurities, the scale of what is being offered might be difficult for any government to realistically deliver at a time when Bangladesh is grappling with multiple economic challenges.</p><p>“Everyone is promising jobs and social security like it’s a switch they can turn on overnight,” Rafi said.</p><p>The promises land in an economy in which growth has slowed to about 4-5 percent in<a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/04/23/strong-economic-and-fiscal-reforms-will-help-bangladesh-sustain-growth-amid-global-uncertainty\"> recent years</a> – after expanding above 8 percent before the pandemic in 2019 – while food and overall inflation have remained in the high single digits for a prolonged period, squeezing people’s purchasing power and driving up the cost of living.</p><p>Private investment has remained largely stuck at roughly 22–23 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and the nation’s<a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/endpovertyinsouthasia/how-can-bangladesh-increase-domestic-revenues-for-development-?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> tax-to-GDP ratio</a> is still under 7 percent. This is compared with roughly 12 percent in India and 10 percent in Pakistan, and is far short of the roughly 15 percent many economists cite as a minimum for a state to sustainably fund basic services without chronic fiscal stress.</p><p>Hossain Zillur Rahman, an economist and the executive chairman of the Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC), a nonprofit think tank based in Dhaka, said the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus that took over after Hasina’s ouster brought “some measure of immediate stability to macro indicators”.</p><p>But the Yunus administration, he added, has been “extraordinarily inattentive to economic distress at [the] household level” and to “engaging with the business community to jumpstart the economy”.</p><p>“The economic reality at this moment is marked by persistent inflation, poverty reversals, employment emergencies, stagnant wages,” he said, adding that the government has “failed to generate business confidence, which is why the investment rate is at a standstill”.</p><p>Against that backdrop, he added, an election matters because it may end the uncertainty freezing decisions. “Bangladesh urgently needs a restart,” Rahman said. “[The] election opens the possibility of that, but it is unlikely to produce any dramatic improvements.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4284461\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4284461\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4284461\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2024-11-11T072252Z_41946265_RC2S2BADGWT2_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ECONOMY-1770085586.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People purchase groceries from a government-subsidised Open Market Sales (OMS) point in Dhaka, Bangladesh, November 11, 2024.

The parties are yet to release manifestos, but officials from both camps told Al Jazeera that policies unveiled at separate recent high-profile events in Dhaka, and now circulating throughout the campaign, will feature prominently.</p><p>The BNP’s flagship pledge is a “family card” issued in the name of a woman in each household. The party says it would initially cover 4 million households, providing either 2,000 to 2,500 Bangladeshi taka (about $16–$20) a month in cash, usable at designated stores, or an equivalent monthly basket of essentials such as rice, pulses, oil and salt.</p><p>Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, a BNP leader and former minister of commerce, said that if elected, the BNP plans to govern by investing in people, “in health, in education, and upskilling”, and by supporting “artisans, the weavers” and small industries with credit, as well as helping them access international markets, including by helping them with their branding.</p><p>Economists say the challenge lies in scale and delivery. Bangladesh currently spends about 1.16 trillion taka a year (roughly $9.5bn) – about 2 percent of GDP – on social protection across more than 130 programmes, such as old-age allowances and widow benefits.</p><p>The BNP’s family card pledge, if fulfilled nationwide, would cost roughly 1.2 trillion taka (about $9.8bn) a year, assuming 2,500 taka ($20) per card. Bangladesh’s current outlay on social sector protections would effectively need to double to make this work.</p><p>“You cannot ensure quality social security with just 2 percent of GDP,” Towfiqul Islam Khan, additional director (research) at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said.</p><p>For Rahman of the PPRC, social protection pledges amount to an “acid test” for the parties. “The key challenge here is not just extra budget”, he said, “but avoiding leakage and ensuring delivery to the right target groups”.</p><p>The BNP argues its answer lies in shrinking the bureaucracy and digitising services. Khasru described Bangladesh as “an over-regulated country” where layers of permissions raise the “cost of doing business”. Moving services online and eliminating physical contact with officials, he said, would reduce opportunities for corruption.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jamaat’s principal welfare pitch is a “smart social security card”, a unified system the party says would connect the National ID card, health access, taxation, and social safety services.</p><p>Mokarram Hossain, a Swansea University professor who helped coordinate Jamaat’s plan, said the party’s focus rests on “good governance, zero tolerance to corruption, zero tolerance to extortion, and efficiency gains”.</p><p>Hossain said Jamaat’s plan is not to “hand out token cash”, but to build a single system through which people can access services, something he argued would also reduce “leakage” in how benefits are delivered.</p><p>Khan of the CPD said that “if revenue collection improves, these long-term plans [of both coalitions] can be implemented… and they should be”.</p><p>But for the moment, he said, both the BNP and Jamaat have questions to answer.</p><p>“They need to clearly explain how the financing will be arranged, how long implementation will take, through what process it will be done, and how institutional capacity will be strengthened [to enable the execution of these policies],” Khan said.</p><p>Still, there is a reason why these promises, irrespective of how realistic they are, resonate with many voters, said Asif Shahan, a Dhaka University professor and senior research fellow at the BRAC Institute of Governance and Development, a social science research and academic institute in Dhaka.</p><p>“People don’t like complicated messages,” he said. “You have to give people a very simplified message.” This is why the idea of a “family card” and a “social security card” works better than detailed policy blueprints, he said.</p><p>But it is not that the everyday voter is not discerning, he said. Voters are watching to see whether a party will deliver benefits fairly to everyone, or “only give them to party loyalists”, he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4284467\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4284467\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4284467 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2021-07-06T100707Z_1919557652_RC2VEO9WVM1Y_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ECONOMY-EXPORTS-1770085654.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Garment workers come out of a factory during the lunch break as factories remain open despite a countrywide lockdown, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, July 6, 2021.

It has pledged to train 10 million youth within five years, saying it would establish a “youth tech lab” in every sub-district and set up district-level “job banks” to connect people to 5 million jobs within the same period.</p><p>It also promises to create 500,000 entrepreneurs, develop 1.5 million freelancers, and design “separate skills programmes for young people with lower formal education”.</p><p>But Jamaat has also offered unemployed graduates interest-free monthly loans of up to 10,000 taka (about $80) for up to two years.</p><p>Hossain, the Swansea University professor, stressed that the support would need to be repaid. “We are not ‘giving’ the money,” he said. “We are giving a loan, but interest-free.”</p><p>But economists say delivering the job creation both sides are promising would require sustained GDP growth of 8 to 10 percent and a considerable surge in domestic and foreign investment.</p><p>The PPRC’s Rahman said he was sceptical about interest-free loans as a fix. “Interest-free loans tend to be populist measures without much proven impact,” he said, arguing that “the solutions for unemployed graduates are their skilling and actual employment opportunities”.</p><p>Education has also become central to campaign promises.</p><p>BNP’s education proposals include a “one teacher, one tab” initiative, under which the party says it would provide tablet computers to primary and secondary teachers to support teaching and training. It also plans to expand multimedia classrooms, introduce compulsory vocational education at the secondary level, and strengthen technical and skills-based training alongside general education.</p><p>The party has further pledged to expand midday meals for students. Bangladesh currently runs a school feeding programme in parts of the primary and elementary school system, but coverage remains limited and uneven, and there is no nationwide scheme at the secondary level.</p><p>The BNP has also said it would expand sport, arts and cultural education, as well as introduce third-language learning – including Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and German, alongside Bengali and English – from the secondary stage, which party leaders argue would improve employability at home and abroad.</p><p>BNP leader Chowdhury said Bangladesh’s education system pushes too many students towards advanced degrees, which “creates more jobless people”, and that the BNP wants vocational schools “all around the country”, so more students move into skills tracks after high school. He pointed to China, where he said that “60 percent go to vocational education”, which helps young people find work “at home… [and] abroad”.</p><p>Jamaat’s education platform includes interest-free education loans of up to 10,000 taka (about $80) per month for 100,000 students selected on merit and need, annual support for 100 students a year to study at top global universities, and upgrading large colleges into full universities.</p><p>Hossain said Jamaat’s overseas-study pledge is limited. Students admitted to “fixed top universities… MIT, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge” would “get all the money”, while others would receive support for “the first two semesters” and repay the rest as an interest-free loan.</p><p>Rahman urged caution over student loan-style pledges. “The idea of student loans also needs to be thought through with care,” he said. “The burden of student loans hangs like a baleful cloud over the large swath of youth in the developed world.”</p><p>He argued that expanded scholarship schemes with strict targeting and compliance conditions could be a safer approach.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4284470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4284470\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4284470 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2023-07-19T042553Z_649109556_RC2262AI0GNR_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-ECONOMY-1770085753.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tangled network cables are seen in front of the Dhaka Stock Exchange Limited building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, July 19, 2023.

It has also proposed reopening closed factories through public-private partnerships, with 10 percent ownership allocated to workers.</p><p>Rahman, the economist, said that “among the promises made by Jamaat, the one which has most merit is to freeze utility tariffs for the industrial sector for three years”.</p><p>The BNP’s pitch to business is less about a single pledge and more about a structural reset.</p><p>Chowdhury framed it as moving away from an “oligarchic economy” tied to businesses with political power and towards what he called a “democratisation of the economy”, with a level playing field for all firms.</p><p>In agriculture, the BNP has proposed a “farmer card” offering “subsidised fertiliser, seeds and pesticides, access to machinery, easier loans, crop insurance, fair-price sales and mobile access to market and weather information”.</p><p>Jamaat has promised interest-free loans for small and medium farmers.</p><p>But agriculture policy is already tied to a heavy subsidy bill. In the current fiscal year, the government allocated about 400 billion taka (roughly $3.2bn) for agriculture, fisheries, livestock and food security.</p><p>Economists caution that expanding support further will be difficult amid high inflation and revenue constraints. Rahman said both parties’ agriculture focus is welcome, but warned that “the same issues of leakage and mistargeting will be critical here, too”.</p><p>Health has also featured prominently.</p><p>The BNP has pledged to recruit 100,000 healthcare workers, 80 percent of them women, to deliver door-to-door primary care. The party is also promising free primary-care medicines and low-cost treatment for critical diseases through public-private partnerships.</p><p>Jamaat’s policies include free healthcare for citizens over 60 and children under five, building 64 specialised hospitals, one in each Bangladeshi district, and expanding maternal and child health support through a “first thousand days” programme, covering the period from the start of pregnancy through a child’s first two years.</p><p>For Rahman, the contest moving on is not only about big promises, but whether a new government can deliver without straining the economy.</p><p>He said this means breaking with the interim government’s “governing style”, one he argues has failed to “meaningfully engage with the business community” and curb the “institutionalised corruption” entrenched under Hasina’s government.</p><p>Rafi, the job seeker, put it more simply: Promises come easily, he said.</p><p>“But if the culture of extortions for business, and bribes for a job, doesn’t disappear”, he added, “then we’re back where we started”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
