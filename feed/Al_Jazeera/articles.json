towards the local government building, attempting to storm it and remove the national flag.</p><p class=\"p1\">The attack came days after the Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), Yemen’s internationally recognised government, announced a <a href=\"/news/2026/2/8/hope-and-scepticism-as-yemens-saudi-backed-govt-announces-a-new-cabinet\">new cabinet</a> with diverse political and

Saudi and Yemeni leaders, from southern Yemen.</p><p class=\"p1\">The security committee in Shabwah said it would take action against anyone proven to be involved in inciting or planning action, or

But surely it’s nothing that can’t be solved by more business as usual.</p><p>Indeed, it seems the winds are just right for the resurgence of the “<a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2019/08/the-long-disturbing-voyage-of-the-u-s-s-honduras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USS Honduras</a>” – the endearing nickname that was bestowed on the country in the 1980s on account of its outstanding service as an imperial military base from which to terrorise neighbouring Nicaragua, which had committed the outrageous offence of telling the gringos to take their capitalist system and shove it.</p><p>Some 50,000 Nicaraguans perished in the US-backed Contra war, while CIA mercenaries aided the war effort by raking in <a href=\"https://fair.org/home/20-years-after-his-death-gary-webbs-truth-is-still-dangerous/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">profits from the drug trade</a>, speaking of the US track record on that front.</p><p>Nor was life on board the USS Honduras anything to write home about. Throughout the 1980s, a CIA-trained death squad by the name of <a href=\"/opinions/2021/6/28/memories-of-a-honduran-coup\">Battalion 316</a> made life hell for hundreds of Honduran citizens who were suspected of improper political orientation and were kidnapped, tortured, and killed.</p><p>And the US was calling the shots for just about everything. Writing in The New York Times in 1988, journalist Stephen Kinzer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/25/world/hondurans-trust-of-military-leaders-plummets-with-drug-arrest.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">offered</a> the lowdown on imperial machinations in Honduras with a straightforwardness uncharacteristic of the US newspaper of record: “Behind the guise of formal democracy [in Honduras], military leaders make all important decisions, and they respond to direction from the United States Embassy.”</p><p>This embassy, Kinzer noted, was “one of the largest State Department outposts in the world”, adding that “American diplomats exercise more control over domestic politics in Honduras than in any other country in the hemisphere.”</p><p>And yet there were rough waters ahead for the USS Honduras – particularly with the 2006 election of ever-so-slightly-left-leaning President Manuel Zelaya, who had the nerve to raise the urban minimum wage to <a href=\"/opinions/2015/6/28/the-honduran-meltdown-made-in-usa\">$290 a month</a> and otherwise stab international corporations in the back.</p><p>The metaphorical naval vessel having been thus definitively blown off course, there was no choice but for the Honduran military to – very democratically – kidnap Zelaya in the wee hours of June 28, 2009, and whisk him off to Costa Rica in his pyjamas, never to be reinstated to his elected post.</p><p>The US-validated coup d’etat ushered in an era of intensified impunity in Honduras, as the domestic forces of law and order responded sadistically to unarmed anti-coup protesters, <a href=\"/opinions/2016/3/29/hillary-clintons-faux-feminism\">femicides skyrocketed</a>, and the small nation embarked on its path to becoming the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/06/13/190683502/honduras-claims-unwanted-title-of-worlds-murder-capital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">murder capital</a> of the world.</p><p>In other words, all was dandy from a capitalist point of view, and, once illegitimate elections had been staged by the Honduran coup regime, the Democratic regime of then-US President Barack Obama wasted no time in signing off on the electoral triumph of the right-wing Porfirio Lobo, who quickly <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/salvos/cities-of-the-night\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">declared</a> Honduras “Open for Business.”</p><p>Things then got even better with the reign of the aforementioned narco-President Juan Orlando Hernandez, whose re-election in 2017 amid ubiquitous fraud allegations was swiftly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/united-states-government-general-news-6a90990250ef43c4b1a036d393c785f2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recognised</a> by the first Trump administration – and never mind the ensuing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/02/us-silent-as-honduras-protesters-killed-in-post-election-violence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slaughter</a>, by US-funded security forces, of Hondurans protesting the election results.</p><p>Now that Trump is back at the helm of the USS Honduras with Asfura as first mate, it would have been remiss had Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not turned up on deck, as well.</p><p>During a January <a href=\"https://www.gov.il/en/pages/spoke-meet180126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visit</a> to Jerusalem to kiss Israel’s <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/26/israels-genocide-wiped-out-over-2700-families-in-gaza\">genocidal</a> backside, Asfura made a downright disgusting mockery of his own Palestinian origins, responding with enthusiasm to Netanyahu’s declaration that he looked “forward to working with your government, both in economic fields and agriculture and technology in any of the areas that I think are laid before us”.</p><p>The man with the blood of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/unispal/document/press-briefing-francesca-albanese-16sep25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">potentially many hundreds of thousands of Palestinians</a> on his hands proceeded to reassure the Palestinian-descended Honduran head of state, “You should know that as far as Israel is concerned, the sky is the limit.”</p><p>Under Asfura, Honduras is, no doubt, on course to renew its status as a key node of US power and influence in the hemisphere, giving Trump even greater leeway to wreak havoc in <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/3/venezuela-american-regime-change-with-a-trumpian\">Venezuela</a>, <a href=\"/opinions/2026/1/29/if-cuba-falls-the-global-south-is-to-blame-too\">Cuba</a>, and wherever else he sees fit – and probably guaranteeing a lot more spectacular violence to come in Honduras itself.</p><p>And as the USS Honduras sets off with vigour on its latest voyage of imperial servitude, you might say the sea is the limit, too.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The long-running disagreement has been a recurring obstacle to <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/ukraines-security-guarantees-what-are-they-and-why-might-they-fall-short\">Ukraine’s EU relations</a> during wartime.</p><h2 id=\"a-dispute-shaped-by-law-politics-and-war\">A dispute shaped by law, politics and war</h2><p>Hungary’s objections were initially anchored in genuine minority-rights concerns, particularly between 2014 and 2019, as Ukraine moved to strengthen the use of Ukrainian as the state language following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Dr Krisztina Lajosi-Moore, a senior lecturer and research coordinator in the Department of European Studies at the University of Amsterdam, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She said that tensions grew in 2017, when Kyiv passed an education law making Ukrainian the main language of instruction after primary school, significantly reducing the role of minority languages – including Hungarian – and prompting protests from Budapest and criticism from the Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe.</p><p>From a minority-rights perspective, Lajosi-Moore said the laws created both “tangible and symbolic anxieties”, particularly in education, and that Kyiv was slow to recognise how deeply these concerns were felt.</p><p>While Ukrainian authorities defended the reforms as essential for state cohesion and protection against Russian influence, the impact on minorities was underestimated.</p><p>Ukraine’s 2019 state language law and amendments adopted in 2023 during EU accession talks have failed to resolve the dispute, with Hungary arguing that minority-language education remains restricted beyond the primary level.</p><p>However, since 2022, Lajosi-Moore said, the issue has become increasingly politicised, with minority rights turned into “a tool within wider domestic and foreign policy strategies related to Ukraine.”</p><p>Rather than pursuing agreements or diplomatic means, Budapest increasingly used the issue as a veto over Ukraine’s EU path, she said, while its leader Viktor Orban used the Russia-Ukraine war for domestic politics, which helped “foster fear and resentment”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298782\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298782\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4298782 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSCF4149-1770576489.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine, Hungary, NATO\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4298782\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man looks out over the Uzh River, which runs through the city of Uzhorod, Ukraine, February 1, 2026 [Nils Adler/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"political-tensions-and-everyday-reality\">Political tensions and everyday reality</h2><p>Kornelia, a 17-year-old student of Hungarian ethnicity, seamlessly switched between Ukrainian and Hungarian as she served tables at a traditional restaurant in Uzhhorod.</p><p>“I have friends in Hungary and friends in Ukraine; it has never been an issue for me,” she said.</p><p>Hungarian-language instruction is fully permitted in preschool and primary school in Zakarpattia.</p><p>From lower secondary school onward, with children aged between 11 and 17, Ukrainian becomes the main language of instruction. Hungarian is taught as a subject and, in some cases, used for a limited number of classes or subjects.</p><p>Kornelia said that using more Ukrainian at school had made it her dominant language, but only by a small margin – something she said she could easily address with practice.</p><p>Sofia, a 15-year-old student from Uzhhorod of Ukrainian heritage who knows only a few Hungarian phrases, said political tensions are not reflected on the ground.</p><p>“I have friends who speak with each other all the time in Hungarian – the idea that we would have a problem with it simply is not true,” she said.</p><p>Yulia, a 20-year-old assistant in a bookshop, described life in Uzhhorod – the region’s largest city and capital, which is shielded by the Carpathian mountains and close to several NATO states – as “multicultural and warm, where everyone lives in peace”.</p><p>She said since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, locals, rather than squabbling over small differences, have focused on dealing with the influx of people now visiting the area due to its relative safety, compared with the rest of Ukraine.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4298784\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4298784\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4298784 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/A-child-aboard-a-train-headed-for-Poland-1770576553.jpg?resize=770%2C530&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4298784\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A child looks out of a train headed to western Ukraine during the first weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine [File: Nils Adler/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Lajosi-Moore said <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/ukraines-zelenskyy-calls-on-hungarys-orban-to-stop-blocking-eu-bid\">Budapest</a> has “increasingly chosen escalation” over mediation – a strategy she argued does not serve the interests of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine.</p><p>She added that this approach aligns with Orban’s support for nationalist and far-right politicians elsewhere in the region, including George Simion in Romania and Robert Fico in Slovakia, both of whom are associated with contentious debates over nationalism, minority rights and democratic standards.</p><p>If Budapest genuinely cared about minority rights,” Lajosi-Moore said, it would rely on European Union minority-protection mechanisms, preserve stable relations with neighbouring states, and consistently foreground human and minority rights – rather than allowing the issue to become entangled in wartime geopolitics.</p><p>Budapest could soften its stance, she said, if it were able to show domestic audiences concrete progress – framing it as: “We secured safeguards, now we support the next step.”</p><p>She added that in this scenario, Kyiv would be required to deliver “tangible, measurable results” on minority protections.</p></div></div></body></html>"

who claimed to have been detained by Pima County Sheriff’s deputies. “They didn’t even tell me what’s going on until the detectives got here… They told me I was being detained for kidnapping, and I asked them, ‘Kidnapping of who?’,” he said.</p><p>The Pima County Sheriff’s Department had earlier said that deputies arrested a person for questioning during a traffic stop south of Tucson, adding that it was conducting a court-authorised search along with the FBI at a location in Rio Rico, about an hour’s drive south of Guthrie’s home and about 24km (15 miles) north of the US-Mexico border.</p><p>News of Tuesday’s arrest came shortly after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released surveillance videos of a person in a balaclava wearing a handgun holster outside Nancy Guthrie’s front door on the night she vanished from her home in the city of Tucson, Arizona.</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel said the “armed individual” in the black and white videos, which offered the public a first glimpse of who was involved in the February 1 kidnapping, appeared to have “tampered” with a front-door camera outside the 84-year-old’s home.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4304686\"

against her will, with DNA tests revealing blood on her porch was hers, but until Tuesday’s arrest and the release of the footage, they appeared to be making little headway on the case.</p><p>Savannah Guthrie, co-host of the NBC News’ Today show, posted the new surveillance images on social media Tuesday, saying she and her two siblings, who have already indicated a willingness to pay ransom, believed their mother was still alive.</p><p>Until now, authorities have left it unclear whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic.</p><p>Connor Hagan, a spokesperson for the FBI, which has posted digital billboards about the case in major cities from Texas to California, said Monday that the agency was not aware of ongoing communication between Guthrie’s family and any suspected kidnappers.</p><p>Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said repeatedly that Nancy Guthrie takes several medications, prompting concerns from the start that she could die without them.</p><p>Former FBI agent Katherine Schweit told The Associated Press news agency that the released footage would “get the phone ringing for lots of potential leads” even if the individual’s face was covered.</p><p>“Even when you have a person who appears to be completely covered, they’re really not.

On that point, we have made it clear to the company that we expect it to shed light on the situation and take the necessary actions.”</p><p>La Caisse’s announcement comes after the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/struggling-to-navigate-the-epstein-files-here-is-a-visual-guide\">release of millions of files</a> by the US Justice Department last week, which revealed years of communications between bin Sulayem and Epstein, including discussions about the Emirati businessman’s relationships with women and his plans to visit Epstein’s home.</p><p>In a speech on the floor of the US House of Representatives on Tuesday, Democratic lawmaker Ro Khanna named bin Sulayem as one of six men whose identities had been previously redacted from the so-called Epstein files.</p><p>Khanna did not allege any specific criminality by bin Sulayem, and inclusion in the files does not by itself suggest wrongdoing.</p><p>Khanna also named the American billionaire Les Wexner and four other men whose identities have not been confirmed.</p><p>Wexner, the founder of the retail empire that includes Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Victoria’s Secret, has denied having knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and said that the disgraced financier stole from him when he was employed to manage his finances.</p><p>Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking, is the only person to have been charged in the case apart from the financier, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial.</p><p>DP World, which is based in Dubai, and bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>DP World operates more than 60 ports and terminals worldwide and counts La Caisse as a major investment partner through its joint venture DP World in Canada.</p><p>In September, DP World in Canada announced plans to build a container terminal at the Port of Montreal, adding to its port operations in Vancouver, Fraser Surrey, Nanaimo, Prince Rupert and Saint John.</p><p>La Caisse, which managed 473.3 billion Canadian dollars ($350bn) in assets as of December 2024, has also invested in various DP World projects outside of Canada.</p><p>In 2022, the pension fund invested $2.5bn in Jebel Ali Port, the Jebel Ali Free Zone and the National Industries Park, three of the firm’s flagship assets in the UAE.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

A seventh victim died while being taken to hospital. Officers also found the suspected attacker dead at the school.</p><p data-start=\"412\" data-end=\"529\">Two more victims’ bodies were found at a nearby house, which police believe is connected to the attack.</p><p data-start=\"531\" data-end=\"765\">Authorities described the suspect as a “female in a dress with brown hair”. They said they had identified the attacker but have not yet publicly released the name or confirmed the sex of the suspect.</p><p data-start=\"531\" data-end=\"765\">They did not confirm whether the victims at the school included children.</p><p data-start=\"249\" data-end=\"407\">Darian Quist, a student at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, said an alarm sounded shortly after he arrived in class, announcing a lockdown and instructing students to shut classroom doors.</p><p data-start=\"409\" data-end=\"624\">Quist told Canada’s CBC Radio that students initially remained inside, not knowing what was happening. He said he later began receiving photos from the scene on his phone.</p><p data-start=\"626\" data-end=\"781\">“We got tables and barricaded the doors,” he said, adding that students remained inside for more than two hours until police arrived and escorted them out.</p><p data-start=\"626\" data-end=\"781\">About 100 students and staff members were evacuated from the school after police arrived.</p><p>Trent Ernst, a local journalist and publisher of local news site Tumbler RidgeLines, told the Canadian broadcaster CBC: “I got a message on Facebook saying there were reports of an active shooter down at the Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. These things occasionally happen, but I hopped in my car, grabbed my camera, went down there and discovered all the roads to the school were blocked off.”</p><p>Ernst also saw RCMP vehicles driving quickly in the direction of a home near the town centre, where reports said the second shooting had taken place.</p><h2 id=\"where-is-tumbler-ridge\">Where is Tumbler Ridge?</h2><p>Tumbler Ridge is a remote municipality with a population of about 2,400.</p><p>It is located in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia, approximately 1,155km (717 miles) northeast of Vancouver.</p><p>Tumbler Ridge Secondary School is a Grade 7-12 school with 160 students, according to its website.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“I will know every victim.

Experts often attribute this to the country’s strict gun laws, which make it difficult to obtain assault-style weapons like those which have been used in many US school shootings.</p><p>Some of the deadliest include:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>April 2020</strong>: <strong>Portapique, Nova Scotia –</strong> An attacker, who at one point masqueraded as a police officer, killed 22 people in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia during a 12-hour rampage, in the country’s worst modern-era mass shooting.</li>\n<li><strong>January 2017:</strong> <strong>Quebec City, Quebec </strong>– A man opened fire during evening prayers at a mosque, killing six people and wounding five. Twelve others were treated for minor injuries.</li>\n<li><strong>January 2016:</strong> <strong>La Loche, Saskatchewan</strong> – A student killed his two cousins at home before opening fire at a remote community high school, killing two more people and wounding seven others.</li>\n<li><strong>June 2014:</strong> <strong>Moncton, New Brunswick</strong> – An attacker killed three RCMP officers and wounded two others.</li>\n<li><strong>March 2005: Mayerthorpe, Alberta</strong> – A man shot dead four RCMP officers who had arrived at his home to execute a warrant to repossess property. He then killed himself.</li>\n<li><strong>April 1999: Ottawa, Ontario –</strong> A former employee of Ottawa’s urban transit service shot dead four of his colleagues and wounded two before taking his own life.</li>\n<li><strong>April 1996: Vernon, British Columbia</strong> – A man killed nine relatives gathered for the wedding of his estranged wife’s sister and wounded two others before killing himself.</li>\n<li><strong>December 1989: Montreal, Quebec –</strong> An attacker killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the Ecole Polytechnique before dying by suicide in Canada’s worst school attack.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

becoming the seventh batch of returnees to make the journey since the partial reopening of the key transit point earlier this month, a painfully slow process riven by Israeli military control.</p><p>The group of returnees arrived on Tuesday evening in World Health Organization buses, and were taken to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, an Al Jazeera team on the ground reported.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Like those who have previously made the journey, the returnees described being subjected to <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/palestinian-women-recount-journey-of-horror-at-gazas-rafah-crossing\">humiliating searches and interrogations</a> by the Israeli military, which controls the Palestinian side of the key crossing point.</p><p>The Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt – the only way in or out of the enclave for nearly all of Gaza’s more than two million residents – was kept shut by Israeli authorities for most of its genocidal war and only partially reopened on February 2.</p><p>With its reopening, a key condition of the United States-brokered “ceasefire” deal intended to end the war, Israel is allowing a limited number of pre-approved and heavily vetted people to travel, allowing Palestinians who had left during the war and been <a href=\"/news/2026/2/5/gaza-patients-head-to-rafah-crossing-as-people-return-amid-israeli-attacks\">stranded outside</a> to return, and enabling the transfer of patients desperately needing medical treatment in other countries.</p><p>With the latest arrivals, 172 Palestinians have returned to the Gaza Strip since the crossing’s reopening, while a mere 250 people – patients requiring medical treatment abroad, and their companions – have left, Gaza’s Government Media Office says.</p><p>The pace of medical evacuations since the crossing’s partial reopening has been slower than the numbers promised – the “ceasefire” agreement mentioned 50 patients leaving the Strip each day, each accompanied by two family members – far short of what was required to meet the needs of the approximately 20,000 patients in need of medical treatment in other countries.</p><p>Gaza’s healthcare system <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/how-israel-destroyed-gazas-health-system-deliberately-and-methodically\">has been decimated</a> by Israel’s genocidal war on the enclave, with 22 hospitals put out of service and 1,700 medical workers killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.</p><h2 id=\"israeli-attacks-continue\">Israeli attacks continue</h2><p>Meanwhile, despite the supposed “ceasefire” agreement implemented in October,  Israeli attacks have continued to target the Strip on a near-daily basis.</p><p>On Wednesday, Israeli air strikes and artillery shelling targeted areas under Israeli military control east of Khan Younis in the south of the Strip, an Al Jazeera team on the ground reported.</p><p>The latest violations of the “ceasefire” came after at least seven Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza on Tuesday.</p><p>Among the victims were at least three people killed by Israeli shelling and gunfire in central Gaza, and another killed by Israeli army fire north of Khan Younis.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israel-approves-forced-expulsions\">Israel approves forced expulsions</h2><p>The attacks came as Israel announced it had approved the forced expulsion of two Palestinians convicted of crimes in Israel to Gaza, in an unprecedented move that has been condemned by rights groups.</p><p>The move is the first implementation of a law passed in February 2023 that allows for the revocation of citizenship and the deportation of those convicted of “terrorism”.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on X that he signed the revocation of citizenship and deportation orders for two Palestinian citizens of Israel who allegedly carried out stabbing and shooting attacks.</p><p>“I thank the coalition leader [Ofir Katz] for leading the law that will expel them from the State of Israel, and many more like them are on the way,” Netanyahu wrote.</p><p>The two men to be deported were identified in a statement from Katz as Mahmoud Ahmad, sentenced to 23 years in prison for shooting Israeli soldiers and civilians, and Mohammed Ahmad Hussein al-Halsi, sentenced in 2016 to 18 years for stabbing elderly women in Armon HaNatziv.</p><p>Israeli media reported that the two will be sent to Gaza once their sentences are complete.</p><h2 id=\"move-destroys-protection-of-citizenship\">Move ‘destroys protection of citizenship’</h2><p>Adalah, a legal centre for Palestinian rights in Israel, has condemned the move.</p><p>“These deportation orders allow Palestinian citizens of Israel to be physically exiled from their homeland,” Adalah said in a statement.</p><p>“The government has transformed the most fundamental human right into a conditional permit that can be revoked at will,” the group said.</p><p>Describing the move as “unprecedented”, Adalah said Israel’s action “violates the absolute international prohibition against statelessness and destroys the most foundational basic protection of citizenship”.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh said that while Palestinians have previously been deported to Gaza under prisoner exchange deals, this situation was different.</p><p>That was because the move would strip the men of their only form of identification, the Jerusalem IDs given to Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem by Israeli authorities.</p><p>“If that citizenship is revoked, they are essentially people without any form of identification. They would not be able to go to a hospital, to register their kids in school … they won’t exist,” Odeh said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The NCP was that very alternative: A centrist force with the promise of a “new political settlement”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>For Bangladeshis weary of the country’s two dynastic poles – Hasina’s Awami League, now <a href=\"/features/2026/1/30/can-bangladeshs-awami-league-survive-election-ban-ex-pm-hasinas-exile\">barred from upcoming polls</a> for its role in the bloody crackdown on protesters that killed an estimated 1,400 people in 2024; and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – Islam and his colleagues briefly appeared as a plausible break from the same old gravitational pull.</p><p>That hope, however, began to fade for some when the party opted to enter into an alliance anchored by Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamic party whose opposition to the nation’s independence in 1971 sticks in people’s memories, and whose social positions are a cause for concern among social activists and minorities.</p><p>The alliance has caused a rift inside the party. As it took shape, the NCP shed many from its liberal wing, including several senior figures and women leaders, who said the party was “drifting from its founding commitments”.</p><p>But Islam defends his decision to team up with Jamaat. “It’s an electoral alliance, not ideological,” he tells Al Jazeera. “We do have some common issues: Reform, combating corruption, good governance, sovereignty protection, and opposing hegemony.”</p><p>NCP candidates are standing in 30 seats as part of a seat-sharing deal within the alliance, out of 300 constituencies being contested in the election, which, observers say, is poised to be one of the country’s most consequential votes in years. By contrast, Jamaat gets 222 candidates, with the remaining seats divided among nine other partners.</p><p>As well as voting for the next parliament, Bangladeshis will cast votes in a national referendum on a package of reforms drawn up by a consensus process launched under Yunus’s interim government after the uprising.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4299721\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4299721\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299721\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb2026_3MARIUM_Political-barometer-1770627533.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Bangladesh_elections_Feb_9_2026_Political barometer\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4299721\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>Polling suggests a close contest between <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/bangladesh-election-who-are-the-key-players-and-parties\">two main blocs</a>: The BNP and a Jamaat-led alliance.</p><p>A survey released by the United States-based International Republican Institute (IRI) in early December last year put the BNP at 33 percent, with Jamaat close behind at 29 percent, and projected 6 percent support for the NCP.

He has been walking the streets all day, he says, going door-to-door and crisscrossing the neighbourhoods he hopes to represent in parliament. The fatigue is visible in his eyes as he talks about what voters have told him they want.</p><p>“People wanted change then; they want change now,” he says. “They don’t want Bangladesh to be run the way it was before.”</p><p>They want “solutions to their day-to-day problems”, he adds, and they want “their true representatives”.</p><p>He, himself, is running for member of parliament in Dhaka-11 – a constituency which was previously an Awami League stronghold and includes Badda, Vatara and Rampura. He was born and raised there, but he faces a heavyweight BNP candidate, MA Quayum, a longtime party leader and former local commissioner with a strong base in the area.</p><p>Despite that, Islam says, he has enjoyed a warm reception during his canvassing. “The people’s response is visible… They trust me as one of their own. They seem proud of me… There is immense love.”</p><p>He is betting on his popularity and the alliance’s political machinery to carry his side across the line. “I am hopeful our alliance will secure the required seats to form the government, and the ‘waterlily bud’ symbol will win in this constituency,” he says.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Asif Shahan, a political analyst and Dhaka University professor, says Islam’s path is not straightforward against a BNP rival, but he argues Islam has two advantages that could give him an edge on election day.</p><p>“Nahid is the face of the July uprising,” Shahan says, adding that Badda and adjacent neighbourhoods were among the hotspots of the 2024 protests.</p><p>And, he points out, Islam will benefit from Jamaat’s ground operation: “In his area, Jamaat’s apparatus has been working long-term, he has their workforce, and a full vote bank.”</p><p>But his campaign is not just about him, supporters say. It is about whether a party built around the spirit of uprising can survive its first encounter with electoral reality and whether its strategic alliance will save it or swallow it.</p><p>Islam says the Jamaat partnership is, above all, therefore, a practical bridge over the NCP’s organisational weakness.</p><p>“This coming together is primarily for the election, involving seat-based adjustments,” he says. The NCP, he argues, “in a short time … was not ready for electoral politics”, and an alliance with an “experienced political party” was the price of competing at all.</p><p>“If it could be done alone, that would have been the best,” he says. “Since that wasn’t possible, we think an alliance is a win-win situation for everyone.”</p><p>In return, Islam says, the NCP gains election experience, organisational support and access to Jamaat’s vote bank, while Jamaat benefits from the NCP’s popular appeal. “Jamaat has a vote bank that is being shared with NCP, and NCP’s vote share will also be received by Jamaat,” he says.</p><p>He also insists the 11-party alliance changes the coalition’s public character, broadening what was once a more overtly Islamist bloc.</p><p>“Before, this alliance was completely an Islamic alliance,” Islam says. “But now it’s not a total Islamic bloc. It’s Islamic plus youth and other patriotic forces [which] have come together on some common grounds.”</p><p>For critics, however, that is precisely the point – and precisely the danger.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301858\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301858\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301858\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2260071500-1770712925.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nahid Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301858\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters gather during an election campaign by the National Citizen Party (NCP) and Dhaka-11 constituency candidate Nahid Islam in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on February 8, 2026 [Syed Mahamudur Rahman/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"they-re-the-trophies\">‘They’re the trophies’</h2><p>Samina Luthfa, a Dhaka University sociology professor and social activist, says she does not view the Jamaat-NCP arrangement as mutually beneficial.</p><p>“It gives Jamaat an edge, but not too much to NCP,” she says. “Jamaat is claiming the credit for the uprising fully by tagging the front faces of the movement with them, which helps Jamaat, not NCP as a political party.</p><p>“It’s an attempt to sell the idea that only they own July [movement],” she said. “It wasn’t Jamaat or Nahid Islam. It was thousands of ordinary people who came to the streets and gave their blood.”</p><p>Luthfa argues that when Islam sits beside Jamaat’s amir [leader], <a href=\"/features/2026/2/9/bangladeshs-jamaat-leader-shafiqur-rahman-the-man-everyone-wants-to-meet\">Shafiqur Rahman</a>, it lends Jamaat credibility. “But”, she adds, “it won’t be good for NCP as a party or for Bangladesh.</p><p>“They’re the trophies.”</p><p>Luthfa adds that the NCP’s identity has remained largely “reactive”, shaped more by “hasty responses to events and power moves” than by a coherent programme. “People don’t understand any more what their ‘new settlement’ meant,” she says.</p><p>Shahan, the Dhaka University professor, makes a similar argument, but grounds it in electoral maths.</p><p>“From different surveys, my sense is NCP’s vote nationwide is around 2 to 4 percent, highest maybe 5 percent,” he says, adding that for a party born less than a year ago, that is “not nothing”.</p><p>But he also argues that Jamaat’s motives for the alliance with NCP are clear: To soften its image and claim the uprising’s “full brand value”, given that many Jamaat activists also prominently participated in the protest, but “all the leading figures are in NCP.”</p><p>Jamaat, he says, “needed some faces” that would help it signal a shift: “‘We’re not that extreme; we are moving toward the centre.’”</p><p>Aligning with July’s young leaders, then, gives Jamaat a public-facing argument that “it is more flexible than its reputation,” especially after months when parts of its broader membership “argued for Sharia-based governance, even pointing to Afghanistan as a model”.</p><p>While Jamaat and NCP present themselves as the “pro-reform force that owns July”, they portray their main rival, the BNP, as “anti-reform”, Shahan says.</p><p>It is true that the BNP was sceptical about the July National Charter referendum for months during the transitional government, at times signalling a “no”, until party chief Tarique Rahman publicly endorsed a “yes” vote on January 30.</p><p>Islam tells Al Jazeera that his party had also explored a coalition with the BNP but failed to reach an understanding. “In the reform issue, we did not find BNP that sincere, and there is the issue of seat sharing,” he says.</p><p>Ultimately, he says, “BNP was not interested in doing an alliance. If you want an alliance, you have to agree on at least some political programmes. It seemed to us they wanted to remain standalone.”</p><p>The BNP is contesting the election with its own candidates in 292 of 300 constituencies, leaving just eight seats for allies the party described as partners in past “democratic movements”. At the same time, as many as 92 party “rebels”, overlooked or un-nominated parliamentary aspirants and former BNP figures the party could not accommodate, are also contesting the election independently.</p><p>Analysts say the numbers underline why the NCP was unlikely to secure anything like a 30-seat arrangement with the BNP, but some question whether the NCP needed to pay court to an established party at all.</p><p>“I totally see the benefit of NCP-Jamaat alliance going to Jamaat,” Shahan says. “Whether they succeed in image-cleaning is another issue, but that’s what they’re trying to do.”</p><p>The issue, however, is more complex. It is not simply that “NCP is not just allied with Jamaat,” but that “it is dependent on it.</p><p>“NCP has no organisational basis, except in a few places,” he says. “Jamaat is running their campaign, doing meetings, and going door-to-door. In most places, their votes are basically Jamaat’s except for one or two seats.”</p><p>Shahan argues that NCP, buoyed by “youth support and voters weary of dynastic politics”, could have used this election as a test to build an apparatus: Volunteers, polling agents, and constituency machinery. “But they didn’t,” he says. “They handed their entire system to Jamaat and completely depended on Jamaat.”</p><p>That creates a trap, Shahan says. “If the NCP wins using Jamaat’s machinery and later tries to leave, Jamaat can paint it as betrayal. If it stays, it risks being co-opted.</p><p>“Movement parties have two futures,” he adds. “Either they expand and survive, or they get co-opted by a bigger party. So far, NCP’s future looks like co-optation.”</p><p>Sabbir Ahmed, a political science professor at Dhaka University, says he initially had high expectations of the NCP emerging as an independent force that could promise a new political order, but he now wonders what kind of party it will become in this process.</p><p>“They should have fielded candidates in all 300 seats, not that they had to win, but to stand the party up and reach people. They missed that opportunity.”</p><p>And, he says, “by going into an alliance with Jamaat, they got themselves into more controversy and weakened their position.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301860\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301860\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301860\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257934764-1770712989.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nihad Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301860\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nahid Islam of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) and a candidate for the national election, waves as he canvasses in the Rampura area, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on January 27, 2026 [Kazi Salahuddin Razu/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"jamaat-s-social-stance-and-dilemmas\">Jamaat’s social stance and dilemmas</h2><p>The Jamaat-NCP partnership collides most directly with anxieties about women’s rights and minority rights, areas in which Jamaat’s record and rhetoric have provoked alarm among secular activists.</p><p>Jamaat was a junior partner in an alliance with the BNP when the late <a href=\"/features/2025/12/30/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-woman-pm-a-life-of-power-and-resistance\">Khaleda Zia</a> returned to power for a third term, and has worked with women leaders in the past</p><p>But in a recent interview with Al Jazeera, its leader, Shafiqur Rahman, was asked whether a woman could lead the party.</p><p>“Allah has made everyone with a distinct nature. A man cannot bear a child or breastfeed,” Rahman said. “There are physical limitations that cannot be denied. When a mother gives birth, how will she carry out these responsibilities? It is not possible.</p><p>“That is Jamaat’s party position, not the position of our alliance,” Islam tells Al Jazeera.</p><p>He has also tried to turn the critique outward, arguing that the NCP is structurally more open to women’s leadership than the traditional, mainstream parties.</p><p>“In NCP, the priority or opportunity for a woman to come to the topmost party position is the greatest,” he says, arguing that in older parties, women have historically reached leadership through dynastic family lineage, a reference that inevitably points to Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the BNP’s Khaleda Zia, wife of Ziaur Rahman.</p><p>Luthfa, the social activist, disputes the claim that the NCP has demonstrated a markedly stronger commitment to women’s rights or minority rights, however.</p><p>“And I don’t think NCP is any better on women’s rights or minority rights; they’ve shown what they’re going to do,” she says. “They nominated only two women; we expected better.”</p><p>Those two nominations, however, put the NCP just above the July Charter’s 5 percent bar – about 6 percent of its 30 candidates – while the BNP nominated 10 women, roughly 3.4 percent, and Jamaat fielded none, Shahan says.</p><p>The NCP is doing some things on its own terms, then.</p><p>It also announced a 36-point election manifesto this week, separate from Jamaat-e-Islami. And many supporters since have framed the party’s alliance with Jamaat as a “blessing in disguise”: If the NCP leaders enter parliament or cabinet, they argue, the manifesto could act as a restraining force against any attempt by Jamaat to advance more hardline interpretations of Islamic law in governance.</p><p>Nevertheless, Luthfa doubts the NCP can “keep Jamaat in check”. “They don’t have the numbers.”</p><p>Shahan points to nominations as proof of NCP’s limited leverage. “Jamaat nominated zero women,” he says. “If you can’t pressure Jamaat now, if you win later with their help, how will you keep them in line?”</p><p>Sabbir Ahmed is more optimistic about the NCP’s potential to restrain Jamaat. “If NCP gets even five seats out of 30, then they could make a difference in parliament,” he says. Restraining Jamaat, in his view, becomes possible only if the NCP has a real bloc.</p><p>“They will,” he said. “If Jamaat crosses the limit, then I see them resisting or walking out of that bloc.”</p><p>Five seats may not be enough, but Jamaat’s Rahman said on Sunday at a Dhaka rally that Islam would “definitely” be made a minister if their alliance forms a government.</p><p>And Islam says there are boundaries the NCP will not cross. “If our core positions, especially on women and minorities, are compromised,” he tells Al Jazeera, “the alliance will not continue.”</p><p>“If an alliance government is formed, policies will not be controlled by the ideology of any one party. Rather, work will be done based on the unity of the parties,” Islam says.</p><p>Ahmed argues that Jamaat has “shifted significantly” from its earlier positions and has publicly stated that it will not govern based on its old core ideology, which is to establish the Islamic way in all aspects of life based on Sharia, instead “speaking of inclusivity and even a national government”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4301865\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4301865\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4301865\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257938055-1770713047.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nihad Islam\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4301865\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">National Citizen Party (NCP) Convener and Dhaka-11 candidate Nahid Islam greets voters before the upcoming national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on January 27, 2026 [Rehman Asad/NurPhoto via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-good-boy-but-a-powerful-leader\">‘A good boy’ but a powerful leader?</h2><p>Islam says his brief time inside the Yunus caretaker government stripped away any illusions about how power works.</p><p>He credits the interim government under Muhammad Yunus with initiating the reform referendum process, but criticises its failures: It “tried to stabilise the economy but failed in law and order and managing public expectations”.</p><p>He describes the obstacles he faced while inside government, not only on sweeping changes, but in the everyday resistance of institutions.</p><p>“We wanted to change the president, change the constitution … big big things, and also in small things such as bureaucratic reform and many such things, we faced a lot of obstacles,” he says now.</p><p>Such was his apparent disillusion with the apparatus of government, Islam has previously suggested that it would be more effective to remain on the streets than to be in power. Now, he says that was said in a different context and insists that governing is where “parties gain the capacity to deliver for the nation meaningfully.</p><p>“Of course, being in power makes it more possible to work,” he says. “With the state, a lot can be done … in five years.”</p><p>Islam’s sharpest language is reserved for two issues: India and the Awami League.</p><p>Sheikh Hasina remains holed up in India while facing a death sentence for her order to kill protesters in Bangladesh, and, so far, India shows no sign of willingness to extradite her. But Islam argues that Bangladesh needs a relationship with its mighty neighbour based on “national dignity and national interest”. He lists grievances, though: “border killings, water disputes, political interference”.</p><p>“India has to change its policy,” he says, warning that a relationship shaped as warmly as during the Hasina era will not be accepted by “this generation”.</p><p>On the Awami League – Hasina’s former party, which is barred from the upcoming vote – he is uncompromising.</p><p>“We think the Awami League has no right to do politics,” he says. He says he wants “reconciliation and civic rights” for <a href=\"/features/2026/1/30/can-bangladeshs-awami-league-survive-election-ban-ex-pm-hasinas-exile\">supporters of the party</a>, but “not under the Awami League banner”.</p><p>There have been times when his party members have hailed the soft-spoken Islam as the “imam of democracy”. And some public figures, including veteran journalist and Yunus’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam, have floated Islam as someone who could be “the prime minister of this country [Bangladesh] … one day”.</p><p>Analysts say this election will test whether that aura can survive electoral reality.</p><p>Shahan warns that Islam is currently reaping the benefits of his role in the uprising, but a weak election result could trigger internal blowback and deepen what he refers to as an identity crisis.</p><p>“If NCP wins not even five seats, or only five, Nahid will face an internal challenge,” he predicts. “A towering figure needs a distinct party identity… If at the end of the day, Nahid equals Jamaat, Nahid’s value as a towering figure is gone.”</p><p>Ahmed is also sceptical about Islam’s leadership credentials. “He lacks political foresight and control over the party.</p><p>“He is a good boy, a polite boy,” he adds, “but good people don’t necessarily become good leaders; you need certain charismatic qualities, which I don’t see in Nahid.”</p><p>Islam himself has set a 10-year horizon: If the NCP cannot develop the capacity to form government within a decade, he said he would leave politics, during an interview with Dhaka Stream, a local news outlet, on November 5, 2025.</p><p>Talking to Al Jazeera now, he reaffirms this, but describes it as “a target and a challenge” for what he says should be enough for his party, the NCP, to bring a new political order.</p></div></div></body></html>"
