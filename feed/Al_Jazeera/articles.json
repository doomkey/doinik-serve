But once she left the flat, the corridor and stairs were all filled with smoke, and it was all dark, so she had no choice but to go back to the flat,” he said.</p><p>The death toll from the disaster stands at 65, including one firefighter, according to the Hong Kong Fire Services Department. More than 70 people have been injured, according to the Hospital Authority, many suffering from burns and smoke inhalation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said people in mainland China “have been watching aghast” as the tragedy unfolds.</p><p>“I think many people in China feel a lot of sympathy and empathy for those who are affected. Hundreds of millions of them live in dense urban settings, in high-rise buildings not unlike those that caught fire in Hong Kong’s Tai Po district,” Yu said.</p><h2 id=\"construction-directors-arrested-on-suspicion-of-manslaughter\">Construction directors arrested on suspicion of manslaughter</h2><p>The blaze <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/at-least-13-dead-as-fire-engulfs-hong-kong-high-rise-residential-buildings\">began midafternoon on Wednesday</a> on <a href=\"/news/2025/11/27/what-is-bamboo-scaffolding-and-how-did-it-worsen-the-hong-kong-fire\">bamboo scaffolding</a> and construction netting and then spread across seven buildings in the complex.</p><p>Authorities suspected some materials on the exterior walls of the high-rise buildings did not meet fire resistance standards and led to the unusually fast spread of the fire.</p><p>Police also said they found styrofoam, which is highly flammable, attached to the windows on each floor near the elevator lobby of the one unaffected tower.</p><p>Three men from a construction company handling maintenance at the site have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.

The identity of the suspect was confirmed by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which spelled his surname as Lakamal. He was shot and injured by law enforcement responding to the attack.</p><p>The suspect sustained wounds that were described as not being life threatening, The Associated Press news agency reported, quoting an anonymous law enforcement official who had not been authorised to publicly discuss the matter.</p><p>The DHS said he arrived in the US in 2021 through the Biden administration’s Operation Allies Welcome programme.</p><p>The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021 as the US withdrew its forces there and then-President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.</p><p>Biden immediately launched the Open Allies Welcome programme to allow vulnerable Afghan nationals, particularly those who might be viewed as US “collaborators” by the Taliban, to enter the US for two years without a permanent immigration status.</p><p>According to Congressional Research Service estimates, about 77,000 Afghans came to the US under the programme, which remained in place for one year until the US moved to its longer-term resettlement plan known as Operation Enduring Welcome.</p><p>“The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden Administration,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in an X post on Wednesday.</p><p>“This program let in thousands of unvetted Afghan nationals including terrorists into our country,” Noem said in a statement published on the DHS website.</p><p>Quoting multiple unnamed law enforcement officials, CNN reported that Lakamal had applied for asylum in 2024 and was granted it in 2025 under the Trump administration.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-the-us-government-responded-to-the-attack\">How has the US government responded to the attack?</h2><p>In a video address from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump called the shooting a “monstrous ambush-style attack” and “an act of evil and act of hatred and an act of terror”.</p><p>“As president of the United States, I am determined to ensure that the animal who perpetrated this atrocity pays the steepest possible price,” Trump added.</p><p>He continued: “I can report tonight that based on the best available information, the Department of Homeland Security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan, a hellhole on Earth. He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021.”</p><p>Trump alleged that during the Biden administration, “nobody knew who was coming in” on the flights from Afghanistan to the US. He said Lakamal’s status “was extended under legislation signed by President Biden”.</p><p>“This attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation. The last administration let in 20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from places that you don’t want to even know about.”</p><p>Trump announced: “We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden. And we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.”</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/9/14/fbis-patel-faces-us-congressional-hearings-after-kirk-death-probe-missteps\">Patel</a> said the shooting in the US capital “is a matter of national security”.</p><p>“We have assembled the full force of both the federal and state and local law enforcement agencies to bring all of our resources to make sure we find the perpetrators responsible for this heinous act,” Patel added.</p><p>The White House filed an emergency motion in federal court in the District of Columbia to halt an earlier ruling that would have seen the National Guard removed from Washington, DC.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-came-to-the-us-from-afghanistan-under-operation-allies-welcome\">Who came to the US from Afghanistan under Operation Allies Welcome?</h2><p>According to the DHS website, more than 40 percent of the Afghans who arrived in the US through the programme were eligible for special immigrant visas (SIVs), a visa granted to Afghans who assisted the US military during its 20 years of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>Afghans worked with the US military in several support roles, including as interpreters, guides, drivers, engineers and medics. They often placed themselves in direct danger from the Taliban, which viewed them as collaborators. Many also were exposed to active combat zones, were forced to flee their homes and risked losing their livelihoods when the US pulled out of the country.</p><p>In August 2021, <a href=\"/news/2021/8/16/afghans-cling-to-plane-defining-image\">video footage</a> emerged of Afghans clinging to a taxiing US Air Force plane in a desperate attempt to flee the country. A clip showed two people falling from the sky as the plane took off.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have fled Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, fearing persecution and economic collapse. Many have tried to escape to neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan and Iran, while others have gone to the US, United Kingdom and Europe.</p><h2 id=\"how-were-afghan-immigrants-vetted-during-the-biden-administration\">How were Afghan immigrants vetted during the Biden administration?</h2><p>The Trump administration claims Afghans were allowed into the US without proper vetting.</p><p>But the DHS webpage detailing the Operation Allies Welcome programme at the time stated: “The US government is working around the clock to conduct the security screening and vetting of vulnerable Afghans before they are permitted entry into the United States, consistent with the dual goals of protecting national security and providing protection for our Afghan allies.”</p><p>The website added that the DHS sent about 400 personnel from multiple agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service to Bahrain, Germany, Kuwait, Italy, Qatar, Spain and the United Arab Emirates to work with the Departments of Defense (DOD) and State and other federal partners to process, screen, vet and interview Afghan nationals.</p><p>The DHS added that the screening process was “rigorous” and “multi-layered”. It involved biometric and biographic screenings conducted by intelligence, law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals from DHS and DOD alongside the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and other intelligence community partners.</p><p>Biometric data, such as fingerprints and photos, were reviewed for every single Afghan before they were cleared to travel to the US, it said.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-countries-face-visa-restrictions-under-the-trump-administration\">What other countries face visa restrictions under the Trump administration?</h2><p>In June, Trump signed a presidential proclamation banning <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-announces-travel-ban-on-people-from-12-countries\">citizens of 12 countries</a> from entering the US. Later that month, US media reported that the Trump administration was planning to add 36 more countries to the list, <a href=\"/news/2025/6/20/is-trump-planning-an-africa-visa-ban\">26 of which are in Africa</a>. However, the travel ban list has not yet been officially expanded.</p><p>The countries on the list are: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.</p><p>Citizens from these countries face a full ban on travel to the US and a suspension of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. However, people with existing visas or who are lawful, permanent residents of the US are exempt from this ban. Holders of Afghan SIVs are also exempt.</p><p>In the same proclamation, Trump placed partial restrictions on citizens from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.</p><p>Based on Trump’s proclamation, citizens from these countries may no longer apply for immigrant visas or nonimmigrant temporary visas covering permanent immigration, student visas and tourism visas. They may still apply for some other temporary visas.</p><p>In October, Trump announced a new refugee cap for the US of 7,500 for the 2026 fiscal year with priority given to white South Africans, who he <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/is-south-africa-confiscating-land-targeting-some-groups-as-trump-claims\">claims</a> are the subject of a “white genocide”.</p><p>On Monday, the Trump administration announced it would <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/trump-administration-ends-temporary-immigration-status-for-myanmar-citizens\">cancel temporary asylum</a>, including temporary protected status (TPS), for Myanmar nationals living in the US. TPS is a legal immigration pathway for foreign nationals whose home country is considered unsafe to return to, and 3,969 citizens of Myanmar currently have it. In 2021, the military took over in Myanmar, and the country has been at civil war since.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Twenty-eight individuals are appointed directly by him, with the remaining 568 seats carefully engineered to ensure the status quo.</p><p data-start=\"352\" data-end=\"507\">These 568 seats are divided into individual seats, contested by candidates running on their own, and list-based seats, allocated through party lists.</p><p data-start=\"509\" data-end=\"724\">In practice, almost all of the individual seats are accessible only to candidates with substantial financial resources or strong connections to state-aligned networks, as documented by <a href=\"https://zawia3.com/en/money-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigative reporting</a>.</p><p data-start=\"726\" data-end=\"873\">The remaining list-based seats are selected through an absolute closed-list system rather than through a proportional representation arrangement.</p><p data-start=\"875\" data-end=\"1020\">The absolute closed-list system is a winner-takes-all method, whereby voters choose only one party list from a notional collection of lists.</p><p data-start=\"1022\" data-end=\"1118\">Any list that attains 50 percent of the vote in a given district wins 100 percent of the seats in that district.</p><p>Importantly, only approved party lists are allowed to compete.</p><h2 id=\"no-suspense-and-a-predetermined-result\">No suspense and a predetermined result</h2><p data-start=\"3616\" data-end=\"3718\">The results of all elections and referendums in el-Sisi-era Egypt have been more or less predetermined.</p><p data-start=\"3720\" data-end=\"3974\">Since 2014, the regime has consistently <a href=\"/news/2018/2/7/egypt-curbs-opponents-of-presidential-election\">eliminated</a> potential presidential candidates preemptively, intimidated and arrested opposition campaigners, engaged in manipulation of voting processes, and used media crackdowns to ensure electoral dominance.</p><p data-start=\"3976\" data-end=\"4293\">The ongoing parliamentary elections have followed the expected pattern. With competition already tightly controlled through the individual-seat and list-seat systems, the National Elections Authority further narrowed the field by eliminating all but one list — el-Sisi’s <a href=\"/news/2025/11/9/egyptians-set-to-head-to-the-polls-in-parliament-vote\">National List for Egypt</a> — from contention. It has been alleged that between 30 million and 70 million Egyptian pounds ($629504-$1.4m) were required for candidates to access the preferred el-Sisi list.</p><p data-start=\"4443\" data-end=\"4648\">During the first round of voting, held on November 10 and 11, widespread irregularities were alleged and some clearly <a href=\"https://zawia3.com/en/2025-egypt-elections-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documented</a>, including vote buying, illegal campaigning, and various other forms of voter manipulation.</p><p data-start=\"4650\" data-end=\"4859\">Embarrassing videos showing inducements being offered were circulated online, and el-Sisi ultimately had to cancel and reschedule a small number of individual seat elections for some districts.</p><p data-start=\"4861\" data-end=\"5095\">The second round of voting was carried out on November 25-26, with violations appearing to continue unabated despite the National Election Authority’s claims of having implemented preventive measures.</p><p data-start=\"5097\" data-end=\"5211\">Throughout both rounds of voting, el-Sisi’s media apparatus faithfully repeated the official government line.</p><p data-start=\"5213\" data-end=\"5403\">Media highlighted what they portrayed as regime successes — organisation, law and order, and high voter turnout — even as videos emerged on social media showing chaos and clear evidence of low turnout.</p><p data-start=\"5405\" data-end=\"5589\">Results will be announced next month, but there is no suspense — observers widely expect el-Sisi’s coalition to dominate the House, just as it dominates the Senate.</p><p data-start=\"5591\" data-end=\"5669\">Unsurprisingly, early results suggest el-Sisi’s coalition is performing well.</p><h2 id=\"buying-time\">Buying time</h2><p>El-Sisi has essentially rewritten the authoritarian playbook for modern Egypt.</p><p>His programme of widespread state violence, mass arrests, opposition party and media bans, and draconian legislation far surpasses the repression of his dictatorial predecessors.</p><p>His system of repression is perhaps the main reason why el-Sisi finds the idea of surrendering power, even in a pseudo-democratic handover, completely untenable — letting go of power could place him at risk of accountability.</p><p>The risk is real, in part because he has also created rivals from within the power structure.</p><p>El-Sisi will stand victorious at the conclusion of the ongoing House elections, and he will almost certainly be granted his wish: at least one additional six-year term as president.</p><p>If nothing else, this will buy el-Sisi time.</p><p>But the elections will also likely add to growing frustrations over Egypt’s one-man-show political system and the economy, which has long been in shambles.</p><p>The mix of economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression is a dangerous and familiar one.</p><p>It is reminiscent of the last years of Hosni Mubarak’s tenure in Egypt.</p><p>He, too, thought he was firmly in control.</p><p>Indeed, it could be just a matter of time before there is another popular uprising, or before the military empire decides to sacrifice el-Sisi the same way it sacrificed Mubarak in 2011.</p><p>It is paradoxical, but leaders often lose control even as the grip of their iron fist tightens.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The history he had heard unfold on TV and over the radio suddenly became very real, very present.</p><p>“I couldn't believe that we were actually going to the island,” he recalled.</p><p>One of the early ceremonies they held there was in February 1978, to launch a protest known as The Longest Walk.</p><p>Simmons had volunteered to be one of the 24 activists who trekked on foot from California to Washington, DC, as a way of drawing attention to violations of Indigenous rights.</p><p>After five months and more than 4,800km (3,000 miles) of walking, Simmons reached the nation’s capital, where he and his fellow activists were greeted by thousands of supporters.</p><p>But the following year, at one of the first Thanksgiving ceremonies at Alcatraz, less than a hundred people showed up.</p><p>“We couldn’t even give all the comp tickets away,” Simmons laughed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4133299\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4133299\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\" wp-image-4133299\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UnThanksgiving-1764184407.jpeg?w=770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A poster for \" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4133299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A poster for one of the original sunrise gatherings [Courtesy of Morning Star Gali]</figcaption></figure><p>Still, he remembers how the beating pulse of the ceremonial drum carried him across the bay. As his ferry sidled up to the island, Simmons joined the drummer at the front of the group.</p><p>“That was always a big thing for me,” he said. “I was always in the lead there with the drum, walking, leading the people up there to where we were going to circle up and have our fire.”</p><p>Marching up the island’s steep incline, they reached the parade grounds, a flat lip of land extending southward. The island’s lighthouse, tall and austere, loomed overhead. There, with San Francisco’s skyline hazy on the horizon, they lit a sacred fire.</p><p>“It's an everlasting fire. It's a fire that we carry inside us,” Simmons explained. “You carry a fire, which is your spirit. And so, to me, every time that fire is lit, you're taking care of that spirit.”</p><p>Medicine men, sun dancers and other spiritual leaders brought sacred items, including ceremonial pipes, to share. Everyone offered prayers.</p><p>For Simmons, it was a nourishing experience. It kindled a shared sense of resistance.</p><p>“For me, spirituality has a lot to do with who we are and what we become,” he said.</p><p>“Alcatraz has been that beacon of light that attracts a lot of people to our struggles and movement. When people come to Alcatraz, they walk away with a different understanding of being, of who they are.”</p><p>Those first Thanksgiving celebrations would stretch late into the night, well after the sunrise ceremony on the island ended.</p><p>One poster for the 1979 “un-Thanksgiving” advertised events until midnight, including speeches, dancing and a potluck dinner — as well as a tongue-in-cheek contest for the best Pilgrim costume.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Sometimes, the scaffolding can remain up for a year or more.</p><p>Bamboo scaffolding is built by speciality workers known as “spiders”. They lash together bamboo poles to build intricate grid-like scaffolding that is then typically covered in additional netting to catch construction materials.</p><p>While the use of bamboo has faded in other parts of Asia, it has been hard to replace it completely in Hong Kong, even with options such as metal scaffolding, said experts.</p><p>“It’s light, cheap and fast to build with,” Ehsan Noroozinejad, a senior researcher and construction expert at Western Sydney University, Australia, told Al Jazeera. “Crews carry poles by hand, cut them on site, and wrap awkward facades without cranes. That speed and flexibility keep projects moving and costs down.”</p><p>Because it is “light and easy to cut”, bamboo scaffolding also fits the narrow living environment of Hong Kong, said Xinyan Huang, deputy director of the Research Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.</p><p>But there are other reasons, too, why bamboo is hard to replace.</p><p>“It [Hong Kong] has a long history, so it is a tradition, and it is not easy to change tradition,” Huang told Al Jazeera by email. “Any change in the construction industry will meet much resistance from current players.”</p><p>There are 4,000 bamboo scaffolding workers in the city, Hong Kong Free Press reported, citing union figures, although the industry is on the decline thanks to increased competition from metal scaffolding and an ageing cohort of workers.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4134597\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4134597\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4134597\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/6083543-1764223401.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"a worker in a hard hat stands on bamboo scaffolding near a high rise building\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4134597\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A worker builds bamboo scaffolding in Hong Kong [File: Jerome Favre/EPA]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"is-bamboo-scaffolding-dangerous\">Is bamboo scaffolding dangerous?</h2><p>Prior to the fire, most concerns around bamboo scaffolding have focused on worker safety.</p><p>There were 22 fatal workplace accidents involving bamboo scaffolding in Hong Kong between 2018 and 2024, according to government figures. Six accidents occurred while new scaffolding was being built, while the rest took place during repairs.</p><p>Besides the fact that bamboo is by its very nature combustible, it is also structurally weaker and less stable than steel, according to Huang. He told Al Jazeera that it should be phased out for larger projects.</p><p>“I think the bamboo scaffolding can be used for small-scale applications, such as installing an air conditioning unit and replacing a window of a room. However, the large-scale usage such as covering the entire building facade should be stopped. Perhaps, a maximum area of bamboo scaffolding can be defined in future regulation,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4134604\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4134604\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4134604\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1472297917-1764223541.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"workers stand on bamboo next to a red neon sign\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4134604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workers set up bamboo scaffolding in preparation for removing the neon signs of a pawn shop in Sham Shui Po district in Hong Kong [File: Anthony Kwan/Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-role-did-bamboo-scaffolding-play-in-the-tai-po-fire\">What role did bamboo scaffolding play in the Tai Po fire?</h2><p>The fire is the deadliest in Hong Kong in more than a century, since a blaze in 1918 at the Happy Valley Racecourse in British Hong Kong led to the deaths of more than 600 people.</p><p>Bamboo scaffolding played a big role in spreading the fire, according to experts like Anwar Orabi, a lecturer in fire safety engineering at the University of Queensland, although it was helped by other materials in the estate.</p><p>The fire broke out on the scaffolding of one of the estate’s towers on Wednesday, but the speed with which the fire spread took many observers by surprise. Orabi said the design of the scaffolding made it difficult to keep the blaze limited to just a few floors.</p><p>“In my point of view, the scaffolding presented a path for the fire to spread vertically which compromised compartmentation. The fire ‘climbed’ the scaffolding, and ignited the multiple fuel sources in people’s homes,” he told Al Jazeera by email.</p><p>“Fire can break windows by imposing a strong heat flux [flow of heat] which heats up the glass and breaks it. It is also possible that many people left their windows open resulting in ingress of the fire. This resulted in a multi-storey fire,” he said. Heat radiation and embers from one building helped spread the fire to the next, he said, ultimately engulfing seven towers.</p><p>Hong Kong officials also say substandard construction materials were another contributing factor. The South China Morning Post reported that the netting placed over the scaffolding did not adhere to the fire code, citing local officials.</p><p>Senior police superintendent Eileen Chung said highly flammable Styrofoam boards had also been placed in windows in the housing estate’s lifts, public broadcaster RTHK reported, helping the fire spread.</p><p>Two directors and one engineering consultant from the company behind the construction have been detained, Chung confirmed.</p><p>Hong Kong’s leader, John Lee Ka-chiu, has promised that all housing estates undergoing significant improvements will now be inspected.</p><p>“The government has immediately arranged for inspections of all housing estates across the city undergoing major repairs, to examine the safety of scaffolding and building materials,” he wrote on Facebook.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"461\" data-end=\"1482\">When Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia congresswoman who rose to prominence as one of his most loyal allies, on November 15, many dismissed it as just another episode of political theatre. But the moment marks something far more significant than a personal falling-out. It reveals a deepening civil war inside the Republican Party over who will lead the conservative movement after Trump, and over what “America First” should really mean.</p><p data-start=\"461\" data-end=\"1482\">The dividing issue is no longer simply immigration or the economy. It is foreign policy, and at the heart of it lies Israel. For the first time in recent decades, the Republican Party is publicly fighting over whether Washington’s unconditional support for Israel truly serves American interests. This fight is reshaping the American right and could redefine how the United States engages with the Middle East. For countries in the region, especially those seeking a just peace for Palestine, this split offers a rare opportunity to engage with a changing political landscape in Washington.</p><h2 id=\"the-post-trump-struggle-maga-vs-america-first\" data-start=\"1484\" data-end=\"1531\">The post-Trump struggle: MAGA vs America First</h2><p data-start=\"1533\" data-end=\"2257\">Marjorie Taylor Greene’s career mirrors the trajectory of the movement she helped create. She rose to prominence as one of Trump’s most loyal supporters, a symbol of MAGA populism and anti-establishment anger. But as the movement matures, Greene has rebranded herself as an “America First” champion, positioning herself for a future beyond Trump’s personal shadow. Her break with Trump signals more than a political rivalry. It represents a deeper ideological battle between two emerging factions: the MAGA loyalists, who see Trump as the indispensable leader of the movement, and the America First nationalists, who want to build on his populist legacy but pursue a more independent, non-interventionist foreign policy.</p><p data-start=\"2259\" data-end=\"3419\">The MAGA wing, driven by Christian nationalism and cultural resentment, remains closely tied to the pro-Israel establishment that has dominated Republican politics for decades. Its leaders, including Mike Johnson and Lindsey Graham, frame Israel not only as a strategic ally but as a sacred cause. Their rhetoric blends religion and geopolitics, viewing Israel’s survival as central to their understanding of Christian prophecy and Western civilisation. The America First camp, on the other hand, questions these assumptions. Figures like Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon – and recently Greene – argue that the United States should end its role as the world’s policeman. They believe endless wars and foreign entanglements have drained America’s resources and undermined its moral credibility. For them, supporting Israel unconditionally contradicts the core nationalist principle that America’s interests come first. This disagreement is tearing at the foundations of the Republican Party. It is no longer a debate between “hawks” and “doves”, but between those who see American power as a tool for global domination and those who see it as a burden.</p><h2 id=\"israel-as-the-fault-line\" data-start=\"3421\" data-end=\"3445\">Israel as the fault line</h2><p data-start=\"389\" data-end=\"1168\">For decades, support for Israel was the one issue that unified Republicans and Democrats alike. It was untouchable, protected by a powerful lobby and a bipartisan consensus. But the war on Gaza and the growing humanitarian outrage have begun to erode that unity, especially on the right. The America First faction views Israel as another example of Washington’s costly and one-sided alliances. They argue that sending billions in aid to Israel while American infrastructure crumbles violates the same logic that led them to oppose funding Ukraine. Their stance is not driven by sympathy for Palestinians so much as scepticism towards what they call the “foreign policy establishment” – a network of defence contractors, think tanks and lobbyists that profits from perpetual war.</p><p data-start=\"1170\" data-end=\"1934\">MAGA conservatives, however, see Israel as part of their identity politics. Evangelical leaders and Christian Zionists exert enormous influence in Republican circles, framing support for Israel as a matter of faith. Their messaging to voters is moral and emotional, not strategic: to stand with Israel is to stand with God. This ideological clash is increasingly public. When figures like Greene or Carlson question the US–Israel alliance, they are condemned by fellow conservatives as traitors to the cause. And Greene’s recent decision to describe Israel’s assault on Gaza as a “genocide” – condemned by pro-Israel lobbyists as a “<a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/aipac-slams-trump-ally-marjorie-taylor-greene-over-gaza-genocide-remark\">betrayal of American values</a>” – shows how sharply these once-unthinkable critiques are now entering mainstream Republican discourse. Their message resonates with a younger, more sceptical generation of Republican voters who are tired of global wars and foreign aid. According to detailed <a href=\"https://sadat.umd.edu/sites/sadat.umd.edu/files/Young%20Republicans%20Final.pdf\">findings</a> from a March 2025 Pew survey, negative views of Israel among Republicans under 50 rose from 35 percent in 2022 to 50 percent in 2025 – a dramatic 15-point shift. This marks a historic transformation in a party once defined by its unconditional loyalty to the Israeli state.</p><h2 id=\"the-end-of-republican-foreign-policy-consensus\" data-start=\"5527\" data-end=\"5573\">The end of Republican foreign policy consensus</h2><p data-start=\"5575\" data-end=\"7131\">The Republican Party is no longer guided by the old neoconservative worldview that dominated under George W Bush. That doctrine, which justified endless wars in the name of democracy and security, has lost legitimacy among the conservative base. Trump’s rise in 2016 was the first major rebellion against it. But while Trump rhetorically attacked the “forever wars”, he remained personally loyal to Israel and the Christian Zionist base. His decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognise Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights cemented his standing among pro-Israel conservatives. Yet it also revealed the contradictions of his nationalism: America First in rhetoric, but still beholden to many of the same foreign lobbies in practice.</p><p data-start=\"5575\" data-end=\"7131\">Now, as Trump’s influence wanes, those contradictions are coming to the surface. Figures like Greene and Bannon see themselves as the next generation of nationalist leadership – determined to separate America First from the personality cult of Trump and from the global commitments that defined previous Republican administrations. This struggle is already reshaping the party’s identity. The MAGA camp clings to Trump’s charisma and the evangelical base, while America First nationalists seek to ground the movement in anti-interventionism, economic protectionism, and scepticism towards Israel’s influence in Washington. For decades, Republican candidates competed to prove who was more loyal to Israel. In the post-Trump era, they may compete over who is less beholden to it.</p><h2 id=\"what-this-means-for-the-middle-east\" data-start=\"7133\" data-end=\"7168\">What this means for the Middle East</h2><p data-start=\"7170\" data-end=\"8701\">For countries in the Middle East, this Republican divide presents both risk and opportunity. The risk lies in unpredictability: the United States could swing between isolationism and aggression depending on who controls the White House. But the opportunity lies in the growing number of American conservatives who are beginning to question unconditional military aid to Israel. This moment offers a strategic opening for Arabs and Muslims, both in the region and in the diaspora, to engage new voices on the American right. Historically, outreach to Republicans has been limited to formal diplomacy or lobbying focused on security and trade. Now, there is a chance to shape the conversation around values and interests. Engaging with the America First movement does not mean endorsing its broader nationalist agenda. It means recognising that a segment of the US right is finally questioning the logic of endless military aid and intervention in the Middle East. That scepticism can align, even if temporarily, with calls for justice and peace in Palestine. Middle Eastern countries, civil society groups and advocates should seize this opportunity to communicate directly with these emerging factions. They can highlight how ending unconditional support for Israel would benefit not only Palestinians but also American taxpayers and global stability. A discourse centred on shared interests, reducing conflict, ending endless wars and promoting fair diplomacy could resonate with voters across ideological lines.</p><h2 id=\"a-strategic-moment-for-change\" data-start=\"8703\" data-end=\"8732\">A strategic moment for change</h2><p data-start=\"8734\" data-end=\"9791\">The Republican split over Israel is not just an internal power struggle. It reflects a broader rethinking of America’s global role. As the United States turns inward, the myths that sustained its foreign policy for decades are beginning to crumble. For the Middle East, this is a historic moment. The bipartisan consensus that protected Israel for generations is weakening. The cracks are appearing first inside the Republican Party, where nationalism and scepticism of foreign entanglements are reshaping political priorities. If Arabs, Muslims and pro-Palestinian advocates can understand and engage these shifts intelligently, they can help push US politics towards a more balanced and just approach to the region. The struggle between MAGA and America First may determine not only the future of the Republican Party but also the future of US foreign policy. The question is whether the Middle East will remain a passive observer of this transformation – or seek to use it to advance peace, justice and self-determination in the region.</p><p data-start=\"8734\" data-end=\"9791\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Sunday’s attack, however, has left many in the country worried that another intensification may soon take place.</p><p>Standing on his balcony, a man in his mid-30s called over to his neighbour, “Do you think they’ll launch a wider war?”</p><p>The other, a stocky man with greying hair, shrugged with uncertainty. “May God protect us,” he said, before turning around and heading inside his apartment.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"retaliation-would-be-suicide\">Retaliation would be suicide</h2><p>Last year’s war left deep scars on Lebanon.</p><p>Many villages in the south were razed to the ground during the fighting, while others suffered heavily from Israeli <a href=\"/features/2025/2/18/israeli-just-wanted-to-destroy-in-southern-lebanon-despite-the-ceasefire\">destruction</a> during the ceasefire period. More than 4,000 people in Lebanon have been killed since October 2023, mostly from September to November of last year, and more than 1.2 million people were displaced. Many have yet to return to their homes, even a year later. The World Bank estimated Israel left Lebanon with approximately $11bn in needs for reconstruction and recovery.</p><p>The war also left Hezbollah, a Lebanese political and military group, badly weakened. In August, under United States and Israeli pressure, the Lebanese government <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/lebanese-cabinet-holds-more-talks-on-disarming-hezbollah-under-us-pressure\">approved</a> a plan to have the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) disarm the group. But the group has <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/hezbollah-to-treat-lebanons-disarmament-decision-as-if-it-does-not-exist\">rejected</a> calls for its disarmament based on Israel’s failure to uphold its side of the ceasefire. Israel has not withdrawn from at least five points it occupies in south Lebanon, nor has it stopped its near-daily attacks on the country’s territory, killing more than 120 civilians since last year’s ceasefire was announced.</p><p>Meanwhile, this latest attack has come amid warnings from Israeli officials and reports in the country’s media of a military <a href=\"/features/2025/11/12/israel-intensifying-attacks-on-lebanon-is-it-planning-another-war\">escalation</a> in Lebanon. Israeli officials claim Hezbollah is <a href=\"/features/2025/9/28/after-war-with-israel-how-is-lebanons-hezbollah-regrouping\">regrouping</a> and blame the Lebanese government and LAF for failing to move quickly enough to disarm the group.</p><p>Senior Hezbollah official Mahmoud Qomati said the latest strike crossed a “red line” and that the party’s leadership was considering a response.</p><p>Analysts, however, say the group is not currently in a position to attack Israel. In addition to its losses as an organisation, Lebanon’s Shia Muslim population, the sect from which it derives the majority of its support, also suffered from the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/26/israels-destruction-in-lebanon-should-be-probed-as-war-crimes-amnesty\">indiscriminate</a> nature of Israel’s attacks, and many fear the return of the war.</p><p>“Retaliation by Hezbollah would be suicide with no military or political value,” Michael Young, a Lebanese analyst and writer, told Al Jazeera. Young said the Israelis could be “overplaying the threat” of Hezbollah’s regrouping, giving themselves a latitude to do what they want in retaliation to Hezbollah”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"we-are-used-to-this\">‘We are used to this’</h2><p>Last Friday, President Joseph Aoun said Lebanon is willing to sit with Israel in internationally-sponsored <a href=\"/features/2025/11/23/israel-attacks-beirut-suburb-two-days-after-lebanon-agreed-for-talks\">negotiations</a>. It wasn’t enough to stop Israel’s attack last Sunday.</p><p>The atmosphere has left many in Lebanon deeply fearful of another round of intense Israeli attacks.</p><p>“Things are very bad, unfortunately,” Khaled Muhanaya, a Syrian man living in Beirut’s <a href=\"/news/2024/11/26/israel-escalates-violence-on-beirut-as-lebanon-awaits-ceasefire\">Basta neighbourhood</a>, an area that suffered numerous Israeli attacks last year, told Al Jazeera. “People are afraid to see a new war from Israel.”</p><p>“I am worried about anything happening to my family. My kids are afraid to sleep alone.”</p><p>In Burj al-Barajneh, some locals showed bravado in the face of increased attacks.</p><p>“We are used to this,” said Ali, a barber in his mid-20s, as he sat outside his barbershop.</p><p>Ali was at his shop when Israel hit the Haret Hreik neighbourhood on Sunday. He said the attack wasn’t as loud as many locals heard during last year’s war.</p><p>Still, Ali and others said the recent Israeli <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/un-calls-for-probe-into-israels-strikes-on-lebanon\">attack</a> on Lebanon’s largest refugee camp, Ein el-Hilweh, that killed 13 people, including 11 children, had people speculating that Israel could target other camps, including Burj al-Barajneh.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"parts-of-the-south-practically-empty\">Parts of the south ‘practically empty’</h2><p>The brunt of the war’s damage, however, was done, and is still being done, in south Lebanon.</p><p>Parts of the south are still inaccessible to locals. Attempts to access such areas have been met by <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/lebanese-pm-condemns-wave-of-israeli-attacks-on-southern-lebanon\">Israeli military aggression</a>, including gunfire from the five occupied points.</p><p>Ali Noureddine is from a southern town called al-Habbariyeh, where seven young first responders were <a href=\"/features/2024/6/3/no-one-will-hold-them-accountable-israel-targets-medics-in-south-lebanon\">killed in an Israeli strike</a> in March 2024. He told Al Jazeera that his town is filled with displaced people from villages closer to the border who cannot access their homes.</p><p>“There are areas [in the south] that are practically empty,” Noureddine said.</p><p>“Every day and every night there are drones in the sky and warplanes,” he said.</p><p>There are areas, however, where people have returned and started to rebuild their lives. Many have sunk their savings into repairing their homes. But that doesn’t mean the fear has left them.</p><p>“People are afraid at night,” he said. And not just of air strikes. “They feel that at any moment the Israelis might enter again.”</p><p>Talk of war is everywhere in Lebanon. Should an intensified war come, some southerners say they won’t leave their land again this time. Many have invested their remaining finances into rebuilding or repairing their homes. Others dread going through the living conditions they experienced during the war, such as living in shelters or tents.</p><p>“People are afraid of the idea that they will leave again because they suffered a lot during the war,” Noureddine said.</p><p>“Today, if there’s another war again, people will be very devastated, and it will be much more difficult than the first time.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
