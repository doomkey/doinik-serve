But the shootings in Minnesota are not outliers, and the history of ICE shootings shows that holding officers to account has been next to impossible.</p><p>I know, because I investigated the agency’s practices, obtaining documents that reveal how it operates and how its officers are trained to shield themselves from scrutiny and lawsuits. My<a href=\"https://www.typeinvestigations.org/investigation/2024/08/01/armed-and-untouchable-ices-history-of-deadly-force/\"> 2024 investigation</a> looked at six years of shootings informed by logs I obtained from the agency in a lawsuit. According to The Trace, a US outlet tracking gun violence in the country, ICE agents shot <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/12/immigration-ice-shootings-guns-tracker/\">at least 12</a> people this and last year. From 2015 to 2021, ICE agents discharged a firearm at least 59 times, injuring 24 people and killing 23 others.</p><p>The likelihood of an ICE agent facing criminal charges by either federal or state agencies? Slim. None of the shootings I examined resulted in an ICE agent being indicted, even in cases where someone was killed.</p><p>Considered protected law enforcement documents, the agency’s training documents on use of force and firearms are not made public, nor are the agency’s use of force policies. What informs how agents operate in the field has largely been spared from scrutiny, but I <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ice-immigration-customs-enforcement-training-deescalation-use-of-force-2024-8\">obtained documents</a> that shed a light on what training some ICE agents received from 2007 to 2010.</p><p>Though the documents may now be outdated, they offer the only insight – apart from what little is available on the website of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, where ICE agents receive law enforcement training – into what comprises use-of-force training for ICE agents.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261230\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261230\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261230\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-22T183653Z_2079832000_RC2V5JA9YQFA_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-CHURCH-1769154964.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C507&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Federal agents detain locals as immigration enforcement continues after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on January 7 during an immigration raid, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., January 21, 2026.

The annual training is also meant to include “related legal updates” and “discretion in using deadly force and less than lethal force”.</p><p>The policy states that the training must be recorded, but whether or not the officers had actually received this annual training, both before and after the amendment of the policy, is unclear.</p><p>Following a 2016 shooting in which an ICE agent shot and permanently injured a Mexican man in Laurel, Mississippi, a civil lawsuit brought against the ICE agent revealed in a 2020 deposition that the agent only “vaguely” remembered his use-of-force training.</p><p>ICE does not make its Use of Force policy, most recently amended in 2023, available to the public, and no law requires it. The <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/policy/19009.3_firearmsUOF.pdf\">version</a> on its website is almost entirely redacted. But legal representatives in a lawsuit against DHS and ICE cracking down on protests, obtained and made a copy of it <a href=\"https://www.loevy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/284-39-ICE-Directive-19009.3-Firearms-and-Use-of-Force-05.26.2023.pdf\">available on their website</a>.</p><p>This secrecy, say criminal justice experts, is a way for ICE agents to evade scrutiny for lacking policies to ensure or review that the force abides by its own rules.</p><p>“Public access of a complete version of ICE’s use-of-force policy is essential to understanding when agents are permitted to use violence within US cities and equally important to understanding when individual agents are potentially acting in violation of agency policy,” Cesar Cuauhtemoc Garcia Hernandez, a law professor of civil rights and civil liberties at Ohio State University, told Al Jazeera over email.</p><p>“Without access to the complete policy, it is next to impossible for ordinary people to carry out their responsibility in a democracy – decide whether they agree with ICE’s expectations of its officers, then lobby politicians and vote for candidates who embrace their vision of appropriate law enforcement conduct,” he added.</p><p>Gretta Goodwin, the author of a 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office – a nonpartisan research arm of the US Congress – found that ICE’s use of force documentation did not always detail when or how agents violated policy in instances of use of force.</p><p>That documentation is critical to improve training, Goodwin said. While researching the report, Goodwin said one of the objectives was to better understand how DHS tracks use of force training.</p><p>“We also wanted to know what was documented in relation to the training, because if ICE were documenting who took the training and when, then when use-of-force incidents happened that were counter to the training, it might help them decide to make modifications or better target the training.”</p><p>The lack of proper internal documentation, Goodwin explained, is a huge barrier to DHS improving agents’ actions in the field.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261323\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261323\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261323\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255824214-1769160201.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ICE\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261323\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Federal agents clash with protestors outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during a demonstration over the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good on January 15, 2026 [Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"evading-lawsuits\">Evading lawsuits</h2><p>The training documents also reveal an emphasis on teaching prospective agents how to get out from under lawsuits if they were to face them.</p><p>I found at least four different instances in which the lessons, quizzes, podcast transcripts or training lessons stressed the US Constitution’s Fourth Amendment rights, which protect people from unwarranted searches and seizures, indicating to the officer how to operate so that they do not violate them or how to articulate so that they can defend themselves.</p><p>In one podcast, a legal instructor said an agent might have to face a lawsuit for a violation of a tort, which is a harm committed either negligently or intentionally.</p><p>“As long as the employee was within the scope of employment [working as a federal agent] when the alleged negligent or intentional tort happened,” referring to a civil wrong, “they get to step out of that lawsuit.”</p><p>ICE agents, like all federal agents, also enjoy qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that protects them from the legal liability of these lawsuits.</p><p>“The law gives all law enforcement officers, including ICE, wide latitude to use force in carrying out their duties,” said Hernandez, the law professor at Ohio State University.</p><p>“The reality is that it is exceedingly difficult to hold individual agents or the agency itself accountable in court.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261321\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261321\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261321\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255856428-1769160180.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"ICE\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4261321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Federal immigration officers arrest a protester outside Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, on January 15, 2026 [Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h2><p>In the last year alone, the Department of Homeland Security more than doubled its workforce within ICE, bringing the agency from a total of 10,000 officers and agents to 22,000, with more recruiting plans under way.</p><p>How and whether they are receiving training remains unknown.</p><p>An <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/ice-error-meant-recruits-sent-field-offices-proper-training-sources-sa-rcna254054\">NBC investigation</a> based on sources with insider knowledge found that the race to employ new agents at scale entailed using AI tools that improperly processed applications and sent new agents into the field without proper training.</p><p>In Minneapolis, large protests and clashes with immigration agents are still under way, with at least 3,000 federal immigration forces mobilised in the city. Videos have captured ICE agents banging down doors of homes and dragging people out of cars.</p><p>Residents have reported that they are afraid to leave their homes and local efforts have even stepped up for people to do grocery shopping for their neighbours.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have defended ICE agents despite widely criticised conduct. And US President Donald Trump has threatened to enact the Insurrection Act, a federal law that would allow him to deploy the military to the state.

Trump was indicted on four counts, including conspiracy to defraud the US and conspiracy against the rights of voters.</p><p data-start=\"853\" data-end=\"1169\">Smith did not accuse Trump of directly inciting the Capitol riot.

Where that led us was to an indictment of an unprecedented criminal scheme to block the peaceful transfer of power,” Smith said.</p><p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpm7j3d000f3b6pj6u2sq3j@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">“Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity. If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Republican or a Democrat,” Smith said in his opening remarks.</p><p data-start=\"699\" data-end=\"890\">“No one should be above the law in this country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,” Smith added.</p><p>Still, the special counsel said he stopped short of filing a charge of insurrection against Trump. That was pursued in the House impeachment of Trump in the aftermath of January 6, though the president was acquitted of the sole count of incitement of an insurrection by the Senate.</p><p></p><h3>Cassidy Hutchinson</h3><p data-start=\"129\" data-end=\"321\">Republicans have long focused on challenging the testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, which was a key moment in the congressional investigation into the January 6 attack.</p><p data-start=\"328\" data-end=\"538\">Hutchinson told the committee she had been informed that Trump tried to grab the steering wheel of his presidential vehicle as he demanded to go to the US Capitol. Other witnesses later disputed that account.</p><p data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"718\">During the hearing, Republican Representative Jim Jordan, the committee’s chair, pressed Jack Smith on the episode. “Mr Smith, is Cassidy Hutchinson a liar?” Jordan asked.</p><p data-start=\"725\" data-end=\"911\">Smith said Hutchinson’s account was second-hand and that investigators were unable to confirm it.

Even martyrdom has a shelf life in public memory. Ordinary people, burdened by survival, do not grieve indefinitely. Mourning fades and life intrudes.</p><p>Bangladesh has seen this before. Take Abu Sayeed, the first martyr of the July uprising of 2024 that led to then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ouster. The image of him standing with outstretched arms, absorbing police [rubber] bullets as if to arrest history itself, has already entered the country’s visual canon. It is painted on walls, reproduced in murals, stylised in art and embalmed in textbooks. Sayeed’s image is immortal. His grief is not.</p><p>Today, the sorrow surrounding his death likely lives on only within his family and a small circle of intimates. For everyone else, it has been crowded out by the daily grind — by inflation, insecurity, and the numbing demands of life in a harshly transactional world that steadily drains people of the luxury of sustained emotion.</p><p>There is also a harsher truth. Abu Sayeed’s death, in every grimly practical sense, achieved closure. His martyrdom sparked the mass uprising that eventually toppled Hasina’s dictatorial regime, which had ruled for more than a decade and a half through force, and the systematic stripping of political and human agency. Sayeed’s sacrifice served a utilitarian purpose. History moved. His chapter, however tragic, is complete.</p><p>Hadi’s death is not.</p><p>More than a month after he was killed, his martyrdom remains unfinished, unresolved—and that is precisely why the public response has been so fervent, so emotionally unspent. The honours conferred upon him, the intensity of the mourning, and the almost unprocessed grief point to something deeper than the catalytic role of yet another fallen hero. To understand it, one must first understand what might now be called the “Hadi effect”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261208\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261208\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261208\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-20T102529Z_856798641_RC2WJIAVYPT5_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-POLITICS-FUNERAL-1769153081.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People reacts as they attend the funeral prayer for Sharif Osman Hadi, a student leader, who died after being shot in the head, at Manik Mia Avenue, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 20, 2025.

He was physically unassuming: short with dishevelled hair and beard, but sharp-eyed. His power lay in language. He spoke in an unapologetically plebeian Bangla, tinged with the rural cadences of southern Bangladesh, far removed from the polished, patrician diction of Dhaka’s urban elite. It was a voice that sounded familiar, even intimate, to millions.</p><p>With a modest madrasa education, time at Dhaka University, and roots in a lower-middle-class family, Hadi embodied a volatile combination: the subaltern with just enough access to threaten established hierarchies. He was neither fully inside the system nor wholly outside it. His religiosity – unapologetic and deeply Islamic – resonated powerfully in a country where roughly 90 percent of the population is Muslim and where faith remains one of the few enduring sources of collective identity.</p><p>After the 2024 uprising, Hadi began to attract sustained attention from mainstream media. As remnants of the Awami League’s cultural and political establishment cautiously tested the waters for a comeback, he confronted them head-on. His language was blunt, often abrasive, and deliberately so. Again and again, Hadi warned of the danger of allowing the party back into public life through its cultural and social networks, long before it could re-enter formal politics.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261210\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261210\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261210\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-20T130906Z_2078976463_RC28KIAD9C2N_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-POLITICS-FUNERAL-1769153132.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People mourn as they join the funeral prayer for Sharif Osman Hadi, a student leader, who died after being shot in the head, at the Parliament building area of Manik Mia Avenue, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 20, 2025.

Hadi’s fight – if it can be called that – was aimed squarely at culture. For decades, Hasina’s Awami League had exercised near-hegemonic control over Bangladesh’s cultural sphere, saturating media, academia and the arts with its preferred narratives. In principle, this was unsurprising. As a centre-left party that led the 1971 liberation war, the Awami League rooted its legitimacy in language, identity, culture and a particular vision of Bengali nationalism. Much of the country’s intellectual class found that vision both familiar and institutionally rewarding.</p><p>But under Hasina’s four consecutive terms – three of them secured through elections widely regarded as rigged or non-participatory – that cultural project metastasised. What had once been advocacy hardened into dogma. Bengali nationalism was narrowed, history was revised and the liberation war was increasingly reframed to elevate Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – Hasina’s father and the leader of the independence struggle – into a near-mythic figure. Cultural production ceased to be pluralistic. It became devotional.</p><p>The consequences were profound. Dominant media outlets and influential intellectuals did more than amplify this narrative. They enforced it. In the process, they marginalised the worldview of a large majority of Bangladeshis, many of whom are religiously moderate Muslims who could not recognise themselves in the imposed version of “secular” nationalism. Over time, reverence for Mujib, as Rahman is widely remembered, crossed from respect into ritual, leaving little room for dissent without social or professional penalty.</p><p>That resentment did not disappear. It waited.</p><p>After the 2024 uprising, it erupted, most visibly in the demolition of Mujib’s statues and murals across the country. It is a mistake to portray these acts merely as vandalism or iconoclasm; they were an attempt, however raw, to reclaim cultural agency from a state-sanctioned orthodoxy. At their core was a demand to reassert a sociopolitical identity grounded in religious moderation rather than enforced secular symbolism.</p><p>No figure came to embody that rupture more clearly than Sharif Osman Hadi.</p><p>Hadi’s rise in the collective consciousness followed a clear arc. Without apparent calculation, he first emerged on social media and then broke into mainstream platforms, methodically exposing the hypocrisy of a media-intellectual complex that had enabled Hasina’s authoritarianism while cloaking itself in moral superiority. His refusal to temper his critique, his insistence on naming collaborators rather than abstractions, struck a nerve.</p><p>For many Bangladeshis in the immediate aftermath of July 2024, Hadi sounded like the voice they aspired to hear. He said aloud what others had whispered or forced themselves to suppress entirely. He appeared sincere – perhaps even recklessly so. And in a political culture exhausted by doublespeak, that honesty proved magnetic.</p><p>Hadi did not stop at critique. With public funding, he went on to establish the Inqilab Cultural Center, an explicit attempt to build an alternative cultural infrastructure. Its mission was clear: to promote a Bangladesh-rooted cultural idiom grounded in Islamic values, one that resonated with the social instincts of the majority rather than the narrow, urban, secular aesthetic long amplified by elite institutions. For many Bangladeshis who had viewed the dominant version of Bengali cultural expression as exclusionary or imposed, the Inqilab Center felt less like a provocation than a correction.</p><p>Yet post-uprising Bangladesh was not a laboratory for cultural experimentation alone. Under an interim government, the country lurched from economic anxiety to political uncertainty, and the public mood increasingly gravitated towards one demand: stability through elections. Hadi grasped this quickly. Cultural resistance, he concluded, would remain vulnerable unless it was anchored in formal political power. Parliament was where lasting leverage lay.</p><p>His decision to contest a seat in the heart of Dhaka, in the upcoming elections, elevated him almost overnight. Running without the backing of any major political machine, Hadi positioned himself against a seasoned, well-financed candidate from a party widely expected to return to power. The asymmetry was stark. It was a David and Goliath contest in a city – and a country – hungry for rupture. Attention was inevitable.</p><p>What followed was not a media strategy so much as a studied refusal to have one. Hadi allowed the symbolism of the contest to grow organically. His campaign was conspicuously bare-boned: leaflets instead of billboards, handshakes instead of motorcades. He prayed Fajr with voters, walked through working-class neighbourhoods, and spoke in the same unpolished vernacular that had first made him recognisable. Social media did the rest, amplifying what appeared unscripted and therefore credible.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4261213\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4261213\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4261213\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-20T101444Z_584340785_RC28KIA2OSV8_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-POLITICS-FUNERAL-1769153210.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"People mourn as they join the funeral prayer for Sharif Osman Hadi, a student leader, who died after being shot in the head, at the Parliament building area of Manik Mia Avenue, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 20, 2025.

After 16 years of Hasina’s rule – sustained by alliances with crony capitalists, a compliant bureaucracy, and selective patronage – corruption had become one of the regime’s defining signatures. Hadi offered himself as its antithesis. He did not promise technocratic reform or institutional overhauls. He promised something simpler and, for many, more persuasive: that he would be brave enough to confront power without flinching.</p><p>In the early days after the July uprising, that same faith had briefly been invested in student leaders who had ignited the 21-day mass movement against systemic discrimination. They, too, were seen as untainted and fearless. But that confidence eroded quickly as politics reasserted its old habits. Almost by default, the burden of preserving that belief, of proving that integrity could survive proximity to power, shifted to Hadi.</p><p>Interestingly, Hadi, by no measure, had been the architect of the July uprising. Yet in its aftermath, he became one of its most consequential inheritors. The Hadi of television debates occupied minds but the Hadi of the campaign trail reached somewhere deeper.</p><p>That explains why his killing produced a palpable sense of loss, why so many ordinary Bangladeshis felt, without irony, that something essential had been taken from them.</p><p>In death, Hadi has grown larger — but whether he has grown stronger remains unresolved. History offers no guarantees. His killing has already created opportunities for others to speak in his name, to trade on his image, to convert sacrifice into political currency. Martyrdom has always been an easily appropriated asset.</p><p>Still, it would be a mistake to assume that fading grief will render Hadi irrelevant in time. Public emotion inevitably ebbs but unfinished struggles do not. The idea he carried – the insistence on reclaiming cultural agency, on confronting corruption without accommodation, on refusing elite permission – has not been settled, let alone defeated.</p><p>Hadi’s project remains incomplete. That is the real source of his persistence in the national imagination. And anyone who believes otherwise misunderstands both the moment and the man.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The aim: To “whitewash RSF atrocities in the diplomatic framing of the war”.</p><p>Asked about its approach to Sudan, the UK Foreign Office told Al Jazeera: “The crisis in Sudan is the worst we have seen in decades – the UK government is working with allies and partners to end the violence and prevent further atrocities from occurring.</p><p>“We need both the parties to support a ceasefire; this means unrestricted humanitarian access and a peace process with transition to a civilian government.”</p><h2 id=\"recognise-somalia-do-business-with-somaliland\">Recognise Somalia, do business with Somaliland</h2><p>The Foreign Office did not respond to questions about the UK’s role in Somalia or its commercial engagement in Somaliland, where scrutiny has increasingly centred on the port of Berbera.</p><p>The British government co-owns the port through its development finance arm, British International Investment (BII). The port is jointly owned by the UAE-based logistics firm DP World and the government of Somaliland – even though the UK does not officially recognise that government. The UAE, too, formally does not recognise Somaliland.</p><p>Berbera sits near one of the world’s most important maritime corridors linking the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. An impact assessment commissioned by the UK Foreign Office described it as “a strategic gateway” to Somaliland and a potential alternative trade corridor for Ethiopia, language that places it firmly within the region’s geopolitical architecture.</p><p>The port’s strategic value is not new. Matthew Sterling Benson, a social and economic historian of Africa at the London School of Economics (LSE), noted that Berbera has repeatedly been treated by external powers as strategic infrastructure first, and a political community second. It has served at different points as a British coaling station, a Soviet naval base during the Cold War, and now a commercial logistics hub shaped by Gulf and Western interests.</p><h2 id=\"the-sudan-somaliland-link\">The Sudan-Somaliland link</h2><p>That wider architecture has become more politically charged as Sudan’s war has spilled across borders.</p><p>Observers have suggested that Berbera is part of a broader Emirati logistics network that United Nations experts and international media have linked to alleged supply routes used to arm the RSF. The UAE has consistently denied these allegations.</p><p>For critics, the UK’s commercial entanglement with that alleged network raises uncomfortable questions. While London publicly calls for accountability in Sudan, it remains financially tied, via the BII, to a port operated by the UAE, a close regional partner accused of backing one side in the war next door.</p><p>Abdalftah Hamed Ali, an independent Horn of Africa analyst, said this highlights what many critics see as “a gap between principle and practice”.</p><p>“Even if London disputes those linkages,” he said, “the perception problem remains.”</p><p>The sensitivity has deepened as Somaliland’s political status has returned to the diplomatic spotlight. Last month, Israel became the only country to <a href=\"/features/2026/1/16/what-does-israel-want-in-somaliland\">formally recognise</a> Somaliland’s independence, a move condemned by Mogadishu and rejected by the wider international community.</p><p>For analysts, these developments underscore why claims that economic engagement can be kept separate from politics are increasingly difficult to sustain.</p><p>Ali said Berbera cannot be treated as a neutral commercial asset.</p><p>“Ports in the region are not just economic assets; they are nodes in a security and influence ecosystem,” he said. “When investment touches ports, free zones, and long-term trade access, it becomes politically legible. People interpret it as strengthening one authority’s bargaining position, whether that is the intention or not.”</p><p>In Somaliland’s case, that political legibility cuts several ways: Reinforcing its de facto autonomy, reshaping regional alliances, and entangling external actors, the UK included, in a dispute London – officially – says should be resolved through dialogue rather than external alignment.</p><p>Ali described the UK’s approach as a “dual-track” policy.</p><p>“Britain maintains its formal diplomatic line with the recognised Somali state, but it also works with Somaliland as a de facto authority because it is stable and functions and controls territory,” he said.</p><p>LSE’s Benson explained that after declaring independence in 1991, Somaliland was excluded from international recognition and large-scale foreign aid. Early governments were forced to rely on locally raised revenue, particularly taxation linked to Berbera port, a dependence that gave domestic actors leverage to demand representation and accountability.</p><p>In 1992, when a transitional government attempted to seize control of Berbera by force, local clan authorities resisted. The standoff ended in compromise, helping to entrench Somaliland’s power-sharing system.</p><p>Benson, who also serves as Sudan’s Research Director at LSE, described this dynamic as a “revenue complex”, in which fiscal control and political legitimacy are tightly intertwined.</p><p>Large external infrastructure investments, he warned, risk undermining that bargain.</p><p>“When states can finance themselves through deals with external investors rather than negotiations with local constituencies, the fiscal contract changes,” Benson said.</p><p>Such projects, he added, reconfigure who controls revenue flows, who benefits from the port economy, and who gains political leverage. In territories with unresolved political status, infrastructure investment can enable what he described as “governance through commercial presence” – allowing external actors to extract strategic value while avoiding explicit political responsibility.</p><h2 id=\"ambiguity-by-choice\">Ambiguity by choice</h2><p>The UK’s position, Benson argued, exemplifies this ambiguity.</p><p>British formal support for Somalia’s territorial integrity, paired with deepening commercial and security engagement with Somaliland, he said, gives it port access, counterterrorism cooperation and commercial returns, while avoiding the political costs of a clear position.</p><p>Over time, this can undermine institutional consolidation on both sides: Allowing Mogadishu to avoid meaningful negotiations over Somaliland’s status, while weakening Somaliland’s domestic accountability mechanisms by bypassing local political bargaining.</p><p>The UK’s posture in Somaliland has drawn scrutiny before. In 2023, Declassified UK reported that the British government suppressed the release of a report into the killing of civilians during clashes in Somaliland, a decision critics then said prioritised political relationships over transparency and accountability. British officials said at the time that decisions around the report were taken in line with diplomatic and security considerations.</p><p>Read together, analysts say the UK’s decisions in Sudan and Somalia reflect a single approach applied in different contexts: Preserving access and partnerships while avoiding moves – diplomatic pressure, public confrontation or policy shifts – that would narrow its room for manoeuvre.</p><p>Ali argued that while this approach may secure short-term influence, it carries longer-term costs, particularly in a region as politically entangled as the Horn of Africa.</p><p>“In the Horn, where alliances overlap with regional rivalries and the conflict economy, mixed signals can quickly become a liability,” he said. “You lose the moral authority to press for political compromise if local actors think your incentives lie elsewhere.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The drills have caused controversy in the country and drawn the ire of the United States.</p><p>Although South Africa regularly holds drills with Russia and China, the latest maritime training comes amid heightened tensions between the US and many of the group’s members, particularly Iran, which until last week was grappling with mass protests at home that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/19/narrative-war-who-killed-thousands-during-irans-nationwide-protests\">turned deadly</a>.</p><p>Pretoria said the exercise, named Will for Peace 2026, was essential for ensuring maritime safety and international cooperation. The training “brings together navies from BRICS Plus countries for … joint maritime safety operations [and] interoperability drills”, a statement from the South African military noted before the exercises.</p><p>However, US President Donald Trump’s administration, which has previously accused BRICS of being “anti-American” and has threatened its members with tariffs, has strongly criticised the naval exercises.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the exercises and why they were controversial:</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-were-the-drills-for\">What were the drills for?</h2><p>South Africa hosted the BRICS naval exercise, which included warships from participating countries, on January 9-16.</p><p>China led the training, which took place near the southwestern coastal city of Simon’s Town, which is home to a major South African naval base.</p><p>Exercises in rescue and maritime strike operations as well as technical exchanges were planned, according to China’s Ministry of National Defense. All BRICS countries were invited.</p><p>Captain Nndwakhulu Thomas Thamaha, South Africa’s joint task force commander, said at the opening ceremony that the operation was not just a military exercise but a statement of intent by BRICS countries to forge closer alliances with each other.</p><p>“It is a demonstration of our collective resolve to work together,” Thamaha said. “In an increasingly complex maritime environment, cooperation such as this is not an option. It is essential.”</p><p>The purpose, he said, was to “ensure the safety of shipping lanes and maritime economic activities”.</p><p>South African Deputy Defence Minister Bantu Holomisa told journalists that the drills had been planned before the current tensions between some BRICS members and the US.</p><p>While some BRICS countries may face issues with Washington, Holomisa clarified that they “are not our enemies”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4230490\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4230490\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4230490\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26009517448249-1768115408.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"iran\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4230490\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Iranian navy ship Naghdi is seen docked at Simon’s Town Harbour near Cape Town, South Africa, on January 9, 2026 [Nardus Engelbrech/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-participated-and-how\">Who participated and how?</h2><p>China and Iran deployed destroyer warships to South Africa, while Russia and the United Arab Emirates sent corvettes, traditionally the smallest warships.</p><p>South Africa, the host country, dispatched a frigate.</p><p>Indonesia, Ethiopia and Brazil joined the exercises as observers.</p><p>India, the current chair of the group, chose not to participate and distanced itself from the war games.</p><p>“We clarify that the exercise in question was entirely a South African initiative in which some BRICS members took part,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. “It was not a regular or institutionalised BRICS activity, nor did all BRICS members take part in it. India has not participated in previous such activities.”</p><h2 id=\"why-is-south-africa-facing-us-backlash-over-the-drills\">Why is South Africa facing US backlash over the drills?</h2><p>The US is angry that South Africa allowed Iran to participate in the drills at a time when Tehran was accused of launching a violent crackdown on <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/iran-just-getting-started-on-punishing-rioters-arrested-during-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">antigovernment protests</a> that had spread across the country.</p><p>The protests broke out in late December, when shopkeepers in Tehran closed up their businesses and demonstrated against inflation and the falling value of the rial. These protests swelled into a broader challenge to Iran’s rulers, as thousands of people took to the streets nationwide to demonstrate over a few weeks.</p><p>Security forces in some areas cracked down on the crowds, resulting in the deaths of “several thousands”, according to a statement on Saturday by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. While activists said thousands of protesters were killed, the Iranian government said this was an exaggeration and claimed police officers and security service members formed a significant chunk of those who were killed.</p><p>The Iranian authorities also claimed the US and Israel had armed and funded “terrorists” to inflame the protests. They said agents affiliated with foreign powers, and not state forces, were responsible for the deaths of civilians, including protesters.</p><p>The mass uprising is one of the most disruptive the country has witnessed since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been arrested.</p><p>Before the BRICS drills, the US warned South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that Iran’s participation would reflect badly on his country, according to a report by the Daily Maverick, a South African newspaper.</p><p>Ramaphosa subsequently ordered Iran to withdraw from the exercises on January 9, the paper reported.</p><p>However, three Iranian vessels that had already been deployed to South Africa continued to participate.</p><p>In a statement on January 15, the US embassy in South Africa accused the South African military of defying orders from its own government and said it was “cozying up to Iran”.</p><p>“It is particularly unconscionable that South Africa welcomed Iranian security forces as they were shooting, jailing, and torturing Iranian citizens engaging in peaceful political activity South Africans fought so hard to gain for themselves,” the statement read.</p><p>“South Africa can’t lecture the world on ‘justice’ while cozying up to Iran.”</p><p>South African political analyst Reneva Fourie said Washington was merely fishing for reasons to criticise South Africa for bringing a genocide case against Israel before the International Court of Justice for its war in Gaza.</p><p>“The US is looking for an entry point,” she said.</p><p>The US “is facing increased infringement on freedom of expression and association, democracy and human rights as well as increased militarisation. The US should focus on its own dire state instead of meddling in the affairs of others.”</p><p>Tensions over the military drills are only the latest point of contention between the US and Iran.</p><p>During the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in 2025, Washington sided with Israel, and on June 22, the US bombed three nuclear sites in Iran. Initial assessments from US officials noted that all three were severely damaged. Iran retaliated by bombing a military base in Qatar where US troops are positioned, in what was largely seen as a face-saving exercise.</p><h2 id=\"which-other-brics-members-have-tensions-with-the-us\">Which other BRICS members have tensions with the US?</h2><p>Nearly all members of BRICS have problems with the current US government.</p><p>Besides the dispute over Iran joining the naval drills, South Africa is also caught up in a battle of narratives with the Trump administration, which alleges, without any evidence, that the country’s minority white population is being subjected to a “<a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/fact-check-do-trumps-white-genocide-claims-to-ramaphosa-hold-up\">genocide</a>“. In 2025, Trump established a <a href=\"/features/2025/5/15/theyll-be-back-white-afrikaners-leave-south-africa-to-be-refugees-in-us\">refugee programme</a> for white Afrikaners wishing to “flee” to the US.</p><p>The US has also condemned South Africa’s decision to take Israel to the International Court of Justice in December 2023.</p><p>The US currently levies tariffs on South African exports of up to 40 percent as a result.</p><p>China has been locked in a tense trade war with the US for more than a year. After slapping each other with tariffs exceeding 100 percent early last year, these were suspended pending trade talks. But China then restricted exports of its rare earth metals, which are required for technology crucial for defence, and Trump again threatened more tariffs before the two sides reached an <a href=\"/news/2025/6/27/trump-says-us-has-signed-trade-deal-with-china\">agreement</a> in late October, under which China agreed to “pause” restrictions on the export of some metals.</p><p>Russia is also on Washington’s radar because of its war in Ukraine.</p><p>Just three days before the drills began, the US seized a Venezuela-linked Russian oil tanker in the North Atlantic due to its sanctions on both countries.</p><p>On January 3, the US military <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abducted</a> Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from the capital, Caracas. Both now face drugs and weapons charges in a New York federal court. In September, the US had begun a campaign of air strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, claiming they were trafficking drugs to the US, but providing no evidence.</p><p>India has been hit with 50 percent tariffs on its exports to the US, partly as <a href=\"/news/2025/8/27/us-imposes-50-percent-tariff-on-india-over-russian-oil-purchases\">punishment</a> for continuing to buy Russian oil.</p><p>This month, the US withdrew from the India-led International Solar Alliance, although this withdrawal was part of a broader move to pull the US out of several international bodies.</p><p>Harsh V Pant, a geopolitical analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, told Al Jazeera that, for India, keeping out of the naval drills was “about balancing ties with the US”.</p><p>Pant added that in India’s opinion, “war games” were never part of the BRICS mandate.</p><p>While BRICS was founded as an economic bloc, it has widened its mandate to include security.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3823022\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3823022\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3823022\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-06T142428Z_1117404647_RC22HFACJHQ0_RTRMADP_3_BRICS-SUMMIT-BRAZIL-1751885241.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"brics\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3823022\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Leaders and top diplomats from Brazil, China, Russia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Iran meet at the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 6, 2025 [Pilar Olivares/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2>What has the response been in South Africa?</h2><p>Ramaphosa’s government has also faced some backlash over the drills at home.</p><p>The Democratic Alliance (DA), a former opposition party that is now part of the governing coalition and largely represents the interests of the white minority, blamed Minister of International Relations Ronald Lamola for failing to hold the Department of Defence to account.</p><p>Lamola is from the African National Congress (ANC) party, which, until 2024, governed South Africa alone.</p><p>“By allowing the Department of Defence to proceed unchecked in these military exercises, Minister Lamola has effectively outsourced South Africa’s foreign policy to the whims of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), exposing the country to serious diplomatic and economic risk,” the DA said in a statement two days after the exercises started.</p><p>“South Africa is now perceived not as a principled non-aligned state, but as a willing host for military cooperation with authoritarian regimes.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-south-african-government-saying-now\">What is the South African government saying now?</h2><p>South African officials have shifted from initially justifying the drills to distancing themselves from the Iran debacle.</p><p>Despite initial statements from officials that the drills would go ahead as planned, Ramaphosa eventually appeared to bow to US pressure and, on January 9, ordered that Iran be excluded, local media reported.</p><p>Those instructions do not seem to have been followed by the South African Defence Department or the military, however.</p><p>In a statement on January 16, Defence Minister Angie Motshekga’s office said Ramaphosa’s instructions had been “clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and adhered to as such”.</p><p></p><p>The statement went on to say that the minister had established an inquiry board “to look into the circumstances surrounding the allegations and establish whether the instruction of the President may have been misrepresented and/or ignored as issued to all”.</p><p>A report on the investigation is expected on Friday.</p><p>This is not the first time South Africa has been criticised for its military relations with Iran.</p><p>In August, its military chief, General Rudzani Maphwanya, prompted anger from the DA when he embarked on a trip to Tehran and affirmed that South Africa and Iran had “common goals”.</p><p>His statement came just weeks after the Iran-Israel war.

It has destroyed the majority of its housing and infrastructure, and killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, leaving the rest of Gaza’s population facing a harsh winter with inadequate food, medicine, and shelter.</p><p>And yet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – for whom the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for war crimes committed in Gaza – this week <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">joined</a> US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”, established to oversee the reconstruction and governance of Gaza.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>It opens up the question of what Netanyahu – and Israel – actually want from the Palestinian territory, and whether they want the territory to rebuild or just want a continuation of the status quo.</p><p>Ahead of Netanyahu lies a difficult journey, observers say. With Israeli elections looming later this year, he must appear to the world and the Israeli public as working with US ambitions for Gaza.</p><p>But he also needs to maintain his governing coalition, which relies in part on elements, such as his Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who are not just opposed to the reconstruction of Gaza, but also opposed to the ceasefire in a territory that he and his allies – as religious Zionists – regard themselves as divinely entitled to settle upon.</p><p>So far, things do not seem to be going entirely Netanyahu’s way. He has failed to delay the transition to the second phase of Trump’s three-phase ceasefire plan, despite Hamas’s refusal to disarm. Similarly, despite his objections, Gaza’s Rafah crossing is due to open in both directions, allowing people in and out of the enclave, next week. Lastly, his protestations against Turkiye and Qatar <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/trumps-board-of-peace-who-has-joined-who-hasnt-and-why\">joining</a> the Board of Peace, and potentially deploying forces to Gaza as part of a proposed International Stabilisation Force, also appear to have been overruled by the US.</p><h2 id=\"settlement-or-security\">Settlement or security</h2><p>At home, Netanyahu’s cabinet remains divided on Gaza. On Monday, Smotrich not only slammed US proposals as “bad for Israel”, but on Monday, called for the US base in southern Israel responsible for overseeing the ceasefire to be dismantled. Meanwhile, others in the Israeli parliament have primarily focused on the upcoming elections, aiming only to galvanise their political base, regardless of ideology.</p><p>Netanyahu continues to insist that Hamas will be disarmed, and the Israeli military is working on razing territory all along the border with Gaza, creating a buffer zone deep into the coastal enclave.</p><p>Even if Hamas does not completely lose all its weapons, it has been weakened, and pushing Palestinians further away from the Israeli border allows the Israeli government to project the image of security for its population.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Israeli public, exhausted after more than two years of war, largely relegates the consequences of Israel’s actions to the back pages of national media.</p><p>“The public is deeply divided on Gaza and the Board of Peace,” said American-Israeli political consultant and pollster Dahlia Scheindlin. “Though there’s a minority bloc favouring resettling Gaza, most of Israeli society is splintered. People typically view Gaza with a mixture of fear and a need for security, driven entirely by the events of October 2023. They want Israel to remain in Gaza in some form and don’t trust outsiders to handle it. At the same time, there’s hope that US involvement could achieve what two years of war couldn’t.”</p><p>“However, nearly everyone starts from the same point: Anything is better than going back to war,” Scheindlin said.</p><p>“They don’t have a strategy, and everything is chaos,” peace campaigner Gershon Baskin said, referring to Israel’s leaders. “They’re in election mode and only speaking to their base. I went to the Knesset yesterday. It’s like watching lunatics in a house of madness. It’s a disaster.”</p><p>For much of the public, Palestinians remain invisible. “They don’t exist. Israel has probably killed more than 100,000, but the majority of Israelis don’t know or care what’s going on the other side of the border. We even dispute there’s a border; it’s just ours,” Baskin said. “We don’t even see it on TV. All they show are old clips on loop. You can find images of Gaza on social media, but you have to go looking for it.</p><p>“Most Israelis don’t.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4057773\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4057773\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4057773\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ap_68fbbc307bec0-1761328176.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Palestinians walk through the destruction caused by the Israeli air and ground offensive in the Al-Shati camp, in Gaza City, Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.

Currently, according to analysts within Israel, there appears to be no plan for the coexistence that geography dictates, only the unspoken suspicion that outside powers, in this case the US, are not really capable of determining how best to achieve it.</p><p>Even Israel’s commitment to US plans is open to question, with Netanyahu – when safely outside of Trump and his team’s earshot – framing the ceasefire’s second phase as a “declarative move”, rather than the definite sign of progress described by US envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p>“The genocide hasn’t stopped. It’s continuing; it’s just moved from active to passive,” said Israeli lawmaker Ofer Cassif. “Israel is not bombing Gaza as before, but now it is leaving the people there to freeze and starve. This isn’t happening on its own.

The Iran attack in June, for instance, coincided with a pending vote of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/18/iran-war-gives-netanyahu-political-breathing-room-in-israel\">no confidence</a> in the government, while the Qatar strike in September may have been an attempt to refocus public attention away from Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“There is no plan.

Everything is short-term.”</p><h2 id=\"uncertain-future\">Uncertain future</h2><p>“I’m more optimistic than I have been for a long time,” Baskin, whose mediation between Israel and the PLO in the ’90s proved pivotal during the Oslo Accords, “There’s a new factor in play that hasn’t been there before: a US president that the Israeli government can’t say no to,” he continued, referring to the US decision to override Israeli objections against moving into phase two before Hamas’s disarmament, the inclusion of Qatar and Turkiye in the Board of Peace and the decision to open the Rafah crossing.</p><p>Cassif was less hopeful. “I don’t have any faith in this Board of Peace,” he said, “I think it’s now government policy to keep frustrating and delaying plans to form a stabilisation force; to just let people die while that happens.</p><p>“People accuse me of saying these things for politically cynical reasons, but of course, that’s not true,” he said, “I wish I didn’t have to say them at all.”</p><p>“It’s painful,” he continued, “And it’s painful to me not just as a humanist and a socialist, but as a Jew.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

As he grieves, he worries about whether there will be anyone left to offer him a decent burial when the time comes, as severe hunger ravages a large swath of his village in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region.</p><p>“We have little humanitarian support,” laments the octogenarian whose frail appearance is mirrored by many others in his village of Hitsats, near the Eritrean border. “It’s not conflicts that will ultimately kill us, but famine,” he says.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Once a proud farmer from Humera – currently a disputed area within the Amhara region – Wubet took shelter in Hitsats four years ago, after fleeing conflicts and ethnic strife that uprooted him and others in the region.</p><p>He was first displaced in the middle of the <a href=\"/features/longform/2024/11/2/two-years-on-tigray-war-survivors-hope-time-will-heal-the-scars-of-war\">Tigray war</a>, which started in 2020, killing thousands of people and displacing millions more. He has not been able to return and reclaim his life even as the conflict ended in 2022.</p><p>Hitsats is a destitute village that has been sustained mostly by humanitarian organisations, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) – once Ethiopia’s largest source of humanitarian aid.</p><p>But that changed abruptly a year ago when US President Donald Trump took office and promptly demolished the agency’s work and cut funding across the globe.</p><p>Across Tigray province, humanitarian organisations including the World Food Programme (WFP) say that up to 80 percent of the population is in need of emergency support. But the USAID cuts mean there is less humanitarian funding available overall, and what remains is often directed towards hotspots and global conflict zones that are considered worse emergencies.</p><p>Medical aid organisation Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, which assists vulnerable populations in Ethiopia and across the Horn of Africa region, notes that the US cuts “upended global health and humanitarian programs around the world” in 2025.</p><p>“The human costs [around the world] have been catastrophic,” MSF said in a statement this week.</p><p>It said in Somalia, aid disruptions caused shipments of therapeutic milk to stop for months, leading to a rise in child malnutrition cases at the MSF clinic there; in Renk in South Sudan, funding cuts forced an aid organisation to stop supporting hospital staff, which left gaps in maternity care; and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the dismantling of USAID caused the cancellation of an order of 100,000 post-rape kits, which included medication for preventing HIV.</p><p>In Ethiopia, which used to be the largest recipient of USAID funds in sub-Saharan Africa prior to Trump’s cuts, the funding shortfalls have created critical gaps and put more pressure on other organisations.</p><p>In Tigray, “donor funding cuts have placed additional strain on an already fragile public health system,” Joshua Eckley, MSF head of mission for Ethiopia, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“As aid actors scale back or suspend activities in the region due to funding constraints, the most vulnerable are experiencing reduced access to medical care, water and sanitation services … while overall humanitarian needs continue to exceed the collective capacity.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4257902\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257902\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4257902\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tigray1-1769018494.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4257902\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nireayo Wubet, 88, and his community are struggling with a worsening hunger crisis and little humanitarian aid [Amanuel Gebremedhin Berhane/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"like-pouring-a-glass-of-water-in-a-lake\">‘Like pouring a glass of water in a lake’</h2><p>Wubet and others in his community are living through the impact of the cuts to humanitarian aid, which have brought more devastation to already struggling communities.</p><p>Terfuneh Welderufael was displaced from the town of Mai Kadra during the Tigray war.</p><p>The 71-year-old has lived in Hitsats since 2022. He says hunger runs deep in the village, and that it’s rare to find anyone who has not buried a loved one in the last year because of it.</p><p>Abraha Mebrathu, the coordinator of a government-run camp housing about 1,700 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Hitsats, says he has witnessed minimal humanitarian aid entering the village. He confirms many civilians are dying, and that there seems to be little support forthcoming even as the situation worsens.</p><p>He says that they no longer keep data on the people who have died since the numbers are too high, and they are now more focused on helping advocate for those surviving in a desperate situation.</p><p>“We have had little support, and the need is overwhelming,” he told Al Jazeera. Most of the land is not arable, and displaced people don’t have the option to grow food. The majority, he says, are “waiting for their turn to die.”</p><p>To make matters worse, many local humanitarian workers have not been paid for the last year, and Mebrathu says most are starving like many of their neighbours.</p><p>At the same time, the situation in Hitsats has been made worse by the abrupt closure of the WFP office in nearby Shire, which is host to one of the largest IDP populations in Ethiopia, because of budget cuts linked to USAID’s reduced role in Ethiopia.</p><p>Months after suspending USAID in Ethiopia, the US government announced the resumption of some of its support to the country, but many say little has come to regions like Tigray, whose economy, as well as population, remain devastated after years of conflict.</p><p>“While little support is starting to come to Hitsats, with close to 2,000 people in dire and urgent need, it’s like pouring a glass of water in a lake,” Mebrathu says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4257894\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257894\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4257894\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG-20260121-WA0011-1769018484.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4257894\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Most villagers say it has been a slow death as aid sharply declines in Hitsats [Samuel Getachew/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"watching-people-die-from-a-distance\">Watching people ‘die from a distance’</h2><p>In the absence of USAID support, some Ethiopians decided they wanted to help.</p><p>Last month, there was a wave of support for internally displaced and vulnerable civilians initiated by online influencers from Tigray’s provincial capital Mekelle and from Addis Ababa.</p><p>However, the Ethiopian authorities said they were already sending ample resources to support the vulnerable community there, and warned citizens – including influencers – against raising funds and directly donating to those affected in such places, including Hitsats. The government has yet to officially acknowledge that there is a severe hunger crisis occurring. Observers say its focus is on presenting a positive, aspirational image of Ethiopia and avoiding narratives that may depict it as destitute or aid-dependent.</p><p>One influencer called Adonay, with millions of followers, had joined others to help raise funds for the residents of Hitsats – but their effort was aborted midway, fearing reprisal from the authorities.</p><p>Another influencer involved in the fundraiser, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera, “We went to the area most affected by the famine, we had the will and ability to save lives and collect scarce resources, and it hurts that we cannot do that and we are forced to watch them die from a distance.”</p><p>The Ethiopian government maintains that the Horn of Africa nation has become wheat self-sufficient and able to feed its vulnerable populations, but that is challenged by critics.</p><p>In 2024, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told parliamentarians that “there are no people dying due to hunger in Ethiopia,” while WFP claimed more than 10 million Ethiopians were facing famine.</p><p>Last year, Abiy announced the creation of EthioAid, similar to USAID, to help neighbouring nations facing famine, including war-torn Sudan, which received $15m from the Ethiopian government.</p><p>The Ethiopian Disaster Risk Management Commission, a federal government agency in charge of disaster relief, has denied claims of massive starvation in villages like Hitsats and around the country. However, according to the latest outlook by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, more than 15 million Ethiopians are in need of emergency food aid amid shrinking international humanitarian support.</p><p>The government agency said it recently distributed food aid worth the equivalent of $1.8m to the Tigray provincial government, blaming them for misappropriation and distribution problems. The provincial government, however, denies receiving such support.</p><p>The head of the Tigray Disaster Risk Management Commission, Gebrehiwot Gebre-Egziahber, told Al Jazeera the provincial government has been forced to cut humanitarian support in most places across the region, mainly in rural areas where severe hunger affects a large population.</p><p>Despite Addis Ababa’s insistence that the situation is stable, with dwindling international humanitarian aid and an overwhelming hunger crisis causing people to flee in desperation, this month the government belatedly announced that it will soon launch a new tax system on fuel and telecommunications to help fund local initiatives to curb the impending famine that many say is in Ethiopia’s future.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4257896\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4257896\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4257896\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG-20260121-WA0012-1769018486-e1769113405287.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Tigray\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4257896\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chronically ill, Marta Tadesse believes hunger will ultimately kill her [Samuel Getachew/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"running-short-of-burial-space\">Running short of burial space</h2><p>Almaz Gebrezedel, 71, has lived in Hitsats for four years.

government data showed the country’s inflation rate slowed in December, largely thanks to government subsidies for electricity and gas.</p><p>The 2.4 percent year-on-year rise in consumer prices, which excludes volatile fresh food, compared with 3 percent in November, was a notable slowdown, although higher than the central bank’s 2 percent target.</p><p>Rice has become a <a

Experts have told PolitiFact that Greenland’s status as part of Denmark is not in question, and has not been for more than a century.</p><p>Denmark’s colonisation of Greenland dates to the 1720s. In 1933, an international court settled a territorial dispute between Denmark and Norway, ruling that as of July 1931, Denmark “possessed a valid title to the sovereignty over all Greenland”.</p><p>After the 1945 approval of the United Nations Charter – the organisation’s founding document and the foundation of much of international law – Denmark incorporated Greenland through a constitutional amendment and gave it representation in the Danish Parliament in 1953. Denmark told the UN that any colonial-type status had ended; the UN General Assembly accepted this change in November 1954. The US was among the nations that voted to accept Greenland’s new status.</p><p>Since then, Greenland has, incrementally but consistently, moved towards greater autonomy.</p><p>Greenlandic political activists successfully pushed for and achieved home rule in 1979, which established its parliament. Today, Greenland is a district within the sovereign state of Denmark, with two elected representatives in Denmark’s Parliament.</p><h2 id=\"what-about-iceland\">What about Iceland?</h2><p>Four times in the Davos speech, Trump referred to Iceland instead of Greenland.</p><p>“Our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland,” Trump said. “So Iceland has already cost us a lot of money, but that dip is peanuts compared to what it’s gone up, and we have an unbelievable future.”</p><p>US markets reacted negatively to Trump’s Greenland comments the day before his Davos speech, falling about 2 percent in value.</p><p>But in recent weeks, Trump has said nothing about acquiring Iceland, an independent island nation with nearly 400,000 residents, located east of Greenland.</p><p>In an X post following Trump’s Davos address, the White House press secretary criticised a reporter for posting that Trump “appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland” several times. Karoline Leavitt said Trump’s “written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is”. Although Trump did call Greenland a “very big piece of ice”, he also separately mentioned “Iceland”.</p><p>Traditionally, Icelanders have maintained strong ties to the US, dating back to World War II, when Reykjavik invited US troops into the country. In 1949, Iceland became a founding member of NATO, and in 1951, the two countries signed a bilateral defence agreement that still stands.</p><p>Its location – between the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans, a strategic naval choke point in the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap – means that Iceland, despite its lack of a standing military, is geographically important for both North America and Europe.</p><p>In 2006, the US gave up its permanent troop presence at the Keflavík airbase – a 45-minute drive south of the capital, Reykjavik – but US troops still rotate through. Icelandic civilians now handle key NATO tasks such as submarine surveillance and operations at four radar sites on the nation’s periphery. Iceland also makes financial contributions to NATO trust funds and contributes a small number of technical and diplomatic personnel to NATO operations.</p><p>Trump’s pick for ambassador to Iceland, former Republican Congressman Billy Long, attracted criticism earlier this month when he was overheard saying Iceland should become a US state after Greenland, and that he would serve as governor.</p><p>Long apologised during an interview with Arctic Today.</p><p>“There was nothing serious about that. I was with some people, who I hadn’t met for three years, and they were kidding about Jeff Landry being governor of Greenland, and they started joking about me. And if anyone took offence to it, then I apologise,” Long told the publication. Trump has tapped Landry, Louisiana’s Republican governor, to be the US envoy to Greenland.</p><p>Silja Bara R Omarsdottir, an international affairs professor who now serves as rector, or president, of the University of Iceland, told the Tampa Bay Times in August that newfound attention to Iceland’s security, including concerns over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for the rest of Europe, is “definitely very noticeable at the political level”.</p><p>Multiple analysts in Iceland told the daily, only half-jokingly, that the key to surviving the Trump era has been to remain out of sight, something Greenland, for whatever reason, was unlucky enough not to be able to do.</p><p>“You could say Icelandic policy towards the US has been to try to keep under the radar,” said Pia Elisabeth Hansson, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the University of Iceland.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Families reported that their children were malnourished, extremely ill, and suffering profoundly from prolonged detention,” Welch said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, US Vice President JD Vance said he heard the “terrible story” about Liam, but said he was not sure what the federal agents could have done differently.</p><p>“Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?” said Vance, noting that he was also the parent of a five-year-old.</p><p>US federal agents have arrested some 3,000 people in immigration raids across Minnesota in recent weeks, according to Greg Bovino, a US Customs and Border Protection official.</p><p>Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.</p><p>Also on Thursday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said that three people have been arrested in Minneapolis after they protested at Cities Church in St Paul, where they alleged one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director for the St Paul ICE field office. Those arrested included Minneapolis civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong and St Paul school board member Chauntyll Louisa Allen, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper.</p><p>In a post on X, Bondi said that Armstrong had played a “key role” in organising the protest on Sunday.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His statement, however, failed to identify the precise circumstances that prompted the warning.</p><p>“The US would consider anyone supporting such a disruptive step favoring the gangs to be acting contrary to the interests of the United States, the region, and the Haitian people and will act accordingly,” Landau said.</p><p>Haiti continues to struggle with the ravages of widespread gang violence, instability and corruption in its government.</p><p>But the US threat is likely to send shudders throughout the region, particularly in the aftermath of the January 3 attack on Venezuela.</p><p>The administration of President Donald Trump has repeatedly advanced the notion that the entire Western Hemisphere falls under its sphere of influence, as part of a policy it dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine”, a riff on the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine.</p><p>Trump has referenced that premise to justify the use of US military force to abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, as well as to claim the US needs to control Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"a-political-crisis\">A political crisis</h2><p>Located some 11,000 kilometres (800 miles) southeast of the US, Haiti has long struggled with instability. It is considered the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, as it continues to suffer from the legacy of foreign intervention, dictatorship and natural disasters.</p><p>But in 2021, the country faced a new crisis when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home in the capital, Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Federal elections have not been held since, leading to a crisis of confidence in the government. The last federally elected officials saw their terms expire in 2023.</p><p>Experts say the lack of leadership has allowed Haiti’s gangs to flourish, and since the Moise assassination, they have taken control of vast stretches of the territory, including up to 90 percent of the capital.</p><p>The resulting violence has forced more than 1.4 million Haitians from their homes. Millions more suffer from food insecurity, as thoroughfares are often restricted by gang-led roadblocks.</p><p>This week, a United Nations report found that, between January and November of last year, an estimated 8,100 people were killed in the violence. That marks an escalation from 2024, when the yearly total was 5,600.</p><p>But efforts have been made to restore the country’s stability. The Transitional Presidential Council was designed as a temporary governing structure to set the framework for new federal elections. Established in 2024, it has nine members who rotate to serve as chair.</p><p>Very quickly, however, the council faced criticism for its membership – largely selected from the country’s business and political elite – and allegations of corruption swirled. Infighting has also broken out among the members.</p><p>The US too has added to the tensions on the council. In November, it <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/us-imposes-visa-sanctions-against-haitian-official-on-governing-council\">announced visa restrictions</a> against an unnamed government official, later identified in the media as one of the council’s members, economist Fritz Alphonse Jean.</p><p>While the council had been slated to hold tiered elections starting last November, it failed to meet that benchmark, and the first vote has been postponed to August.</p><p>In the meantime, the council’s mandate is set to dissolve on February 7, and the panel’s future remains unclear.</p><h2 id=\"un-calls-for-action\">UN calls for action</h2><p>In this week’s report on Haiti, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres linked Haiti’s ongoing humanitarian crisis to the vacuum in its government.</p><p>“Violence has intensified and expanded geographically, exacerbating food insecurity and instability, as transitional governance arrangements near expiry and overdue elections remain urgent,” Guterres said.</p><p>Another UN representative – Carlos Ruiz-Massieu, who leads the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) – was also emphatic about the immediate need for transparent democratic processes and unified governance.</p><p>“Let us be clear: the country no longer has time to waste on prolonged internal struggles,” he said.</p><p>Still, in a speech on Wednesday to the UN Security Council, Ruiz-Massieu added that there have been “encouraging” signs ahead of this year’s scheduled elections. He applauded efforts to increase voter registration, including in Haiti’s diaspora, and encourage political participation among women.</p><p>But Ruiz-Massieu underscored that security concerns, including gang violence, could impede the democratic process, and that there was more work to be done before elections could be held.</p><p>“Achieving this goal will require sustained coordination among relevant institutions, predictable financing of the electoral process and security conditions that allow all voters and candidates to participate without fear,” he said.</p><p>The UN also signalled it would bolster its multinational security support mission in Haiti with more troops later this year.</p></div></div></body></html>"
