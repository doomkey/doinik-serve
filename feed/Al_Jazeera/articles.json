This was something he never imagined possible while growing up in his village in the Indian state of Gujarat, where his family survived on small fields of fennel, castor and cumin, with their earnings barely enough to cover basic needs.</p><p>He had studied in a public school, where, he recalled, “teachers were a rarity, and English almost didn’t exist”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Maybe if I knew English, I would have been some government worker. Who knows?”, he said, referring to the dream of a majority of Indians, as government jobs come with tenure and benefits.</p><p>His finances improved once he joined the diamond cutting industry in Surat, a city perched along India’s Arabian Sea coast, where nearly 80 percent of the world’s diamonds are cut and polished. Monthly earnings of 35,000 rupees ($390) for the first time brought Alpesh a sense of stability, and with it, the means to give his children the education he never had.</p><p>“I was determined that at least my children would get the kind of private education I was deprived of,” he said.</p><p>But that dream did not last. The first disruption to business came with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The sanctions on Russia hurt supply chains, as India sourced at least a third of its raw diamonds from Russia, leading to layoffs.</p><p>Alpesh’s earnings fell to 18,000 rupees ($200) a month, then to 20,000 rupees ($222). Soon, the 25,000 rupees ($280) annual school fee became unmanageable. By the time his older daughter reached grade three, just as his younger child started school, the pressure became impossible.</p><p>Earlier this year, he pulled both children out of private school and enrolled them in a nearby public one. A few months later, when new United States tariffs deepened the crisis as demand slumped further, his polishing unit laid off 60 percent of its workers, Alpesh among them.</p><p>“Seems like I’ve come back to where I started,” he said.</p><p>Surat, India’s diamond hub, employs more than 600,000 workers, and hosts 15 large polishing units with annual sales exceeding $100m. For decades, Surat’s diamond‑polishing industry has offered migrant workers from rural Gujarat, many with little or no education, higher incomes, in some cases up to 100,000 rupees ($1,112) a month, and a path out of agrarian hardship.</p><p>But recent shocks have exposed the fragility of that ladder, with close to 400,000 workers having faced layoffs, pay cuts, or reduced hours.</p><p>Even before Russia’s war on Ukraine began in February 2022, Surat’s diamond industry faced multiple challenges: disrupted supplies from African mines, weakening demand in key Western markets, and inconsistent exports to China, the second-largest customer. With the onset of the war, India’s exports of cut and polished diamonds in the financial year ending on March 31, 2024, fell by 27.6 percent, with sharp declines in its top markets – the US, China, and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>The <a href=\"/features/2025/8/13/will-trumps-india-tariffs-shut-down-worlds-biggest-cut-diamond-supplier\">50 percent tariffs</a> imposed by US President Donald Trump have worsened the downturn.</p><p>Alpesh now works loading and unloading textile consignments for about 12,000 rupees ($133) a month, barely enough to cover food and rent.</p><p>“If I had kept them in the private school, I don’t know how I would have survived,” Alpesh said. “People here have killed themselves over debts and school fees. When you don’t have enough to eat, how will you think of teaching your children well?”</p><p>His daughters are still adjusting. “They sometimes tell me, ‘Pupa, the studies aren’t as good now’. I tell them we’ll put them back in the private school soon, but I don’t know when that will happen.”</p><h2 id=\"an-exodus\">‘An exodus’</h2><p>Some workers have returned to their villages, as many migrant families in Surat can no longer afford rent or find alternative work.</p><p>Shyam Patel, 35, was among them. When exports slowed and US tariffs hit in August, the polishing unit where he worked shut down. With no other work available, he returned to his village in the Banaskantha district the following month.</p><p>“What other option was there?” he said. “In the city, there’s rent to pay even when there’s no work.”</p><p>He now works as a daily-wage labourer in cotton fields in his village. His son, who was in the final year of high school, dropped out after four months of the new academic session.</p><p>“We’ll put him back in school next year,” Shyam said. “The government school said they can’t take new students in the middle of the term. Till then, he helps me in the fields.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Across the city, the disruption is evident in government data. More than 600 students left school mid-session last year as their parents lost work or returned to their villages, mostly in Saurashtra and north Gujarat.</p><p>“Most migrants come to Surat to settle – the city has entire [neighbourhoods] and housing clusters built for diamond workers,” said Bhavesh Tank, vice president of the Diamond Workers Union Gujarat. “An exodus in the middle of the year is unprecedented, and the drop in school enrolment suggests many are not coming back soon.”</p><p>The union estimates that about 50,000 workers have left Surat over the past 12 to 14 months.</p><p>The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu nationalist group allied with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has been closely observing the diamond industry crisis in Surat.</p><p>“The number of dropouts has reached a point where even government schools are struggling to take in new students, said Purvesh Togadia, a VHP representative in the city. “The poor quality of education is making the transition even more disheartening for families.”</p><p>The poor quality of education in public schools is well established. In 2024, only 23.4 percent of grade three students could read at a grade two level, compared with 35.5 percent in private schools. By grade 5, the gap persisted – 44.8 percent in government schools versus 59.3 percent in private ones.</p><p>Kishor Bhamre, director at Pratham, an organisation working on children’s rights across education and labour, said the setback is not just academic but psychological.</p><p>“Children moving from private to government schools lose the environment they grew up in – their friends, familiar teachers, and a sense of community. For many, it also means shifting from an urban to a rural setting, which makes the adjustment even harder and affects their learning,” he said.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the Surat Municipal Corporation and the state’s education minister for comment, but did not receive a response.</p><h2 id=\"limited-help\">Limited help</h2><p>The Diamond Workers Union has repeatedly appealed to the state government to provide an economic relief package and revise salaries in line with inflation. The union has also urged authorities to address the equally pressing situation of the growing number of school dropouts among workers’ children.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Gujarat government in May introduced a special assistance package for affected diamond workers – a rare move in the industry.</p><p>Under the scheme, the state government committed to paying for one year of school fees for diamond polishers’ children, up to 13,500 rupees ($150) annually. To qualify, workers must have been unemployed for the past year and have at least three years of experience in a diamond factory. The fees will be paid directly to the schools.</p><p>The government received nearly 90,000 requests from diamond workers across Gujarat, including about 74,000 from Surat alone.  After a slow start – it had provided assistance to only 170 children by July – officials reported disbursing 82.8 million rupees ($921,000) towards school fees for 6,368 children of jobless diamond workers in Surat by mid-September.</p><p>But about 26,000 applicants were rejected, reportedly due to “improper details mentioned” in the forms, leading to frustration and anger among workers. In the past few days, nearly 1,000 diamond polishers have filed applications with the local government, demanding to know who rejected their forms and on what grounds, and alleging opacity in the process.</p><p>The scheme’s rigid eligibility criteria have also excluded workers.</p><p>“The scheme only covers those who have completely lost their jobs, but it leaves out many who are facing partial cuts or reduced work,” said Tank. “They’re struggling just as much and need support equally.”</p><p>Tank added that education remains one of the most common concerns among workers reaching out to the union’s suicide prevention helpline, which was set up by the Diamond Workers Union after Surat had already recorded at least 71 suicides among diamond workers by November 2024. It has received more than 5,000 calls so far.</p><p>Divyaben Makwana, 40, lost her 22-year-old son, Kewalbhai, who had been working as a diamond polisher for three years. On June 14, he died by suicide.</p><p>Kewalbhai had been under immense mental stress after losing his job in the diamond market, his mother told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He was earning around 20,000 rupees ($220) a month, and when even that collapsed,” he took his life, she said. “We took him to the hospital and did everything we could. I borrowed 500,000 rupees ($5,560) from relatives and friends, but we couldn’t save him. Now, I don’t have a son – only a loan.”</p><p>She lives in Surat with her husband, who has been unable to work due to prolonged illness, and their younger son, Karmdeep, 18. With no means to return to their village in Saurashtra, Divyaben has begun working as a domestic worker to make ends meet. Karmdeep dropped out after grade 11, and now attends a local coaching centre, where he is learning diamond faceting while looking for work.</p><p>“Education has become so expensive,” Divyaben said. “At least with coaching, he’ll learn a skill. By the time the market recovers, if he’s trained as a craftsman, maybe we’ll be able to repay some of our debts.”</p><p>She paused, her voice low. “I don’t know if education, whether taken on loan or given free, can really change our fate. Our only hope is still the diamond.”</p><p><strong><em>If you or someone you know is at risk of suicide, <a href=\"https://findahelpline.com/i/iasp\">these organisations</a> may be able to help.</em></strong></p><p><em><strong>You can access the Diamond Workers Union helpline at +91-92395 00009.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

A month later, a Waymo reportedly crushed a dog.</p><p>Amid the pictures of the cat, a visitor had placed a poster that said, “save the cat, kill the car”. That’s when Zeidan knew Kit Kat, his bodega cat, had become the face of the simmering discontent over San Francisco’s growing number of self-driving cars.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Two years since it got approved to ply its driverless cars, Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, has become a part of San Francisco’s landscape.</p><p>Residents became increasingly comfortable riding one, costumed Halloween parade goers clambered on its rooftops and danced, and pedestrians occasionally banged its bonnet to get it to give way to them.</p><p>In November, Waymo got approvals for its biggest expansions so far – to ply on the Bay Area’s freeways and pick up passengers from San Jose International Airport. Waymo also started, or is about to start, services in Dallas, Houston, Orlando, Miami and Washington, DC, in the last few weeks.</p><p>But the expansion comes with heightened safety concerns and new competition. Amazon’s Zoox driverless vehicle has begun running in the Mission, too. And Zeidan says the Kit Kat incident opened pent-up resentment over the melding of the new entrants into the city’s hilly, colourful streets.</p><p>Around Kit Kat’s memorials is a poster with a barcode to sign a petition, moved by Jackie Fielder, the area’s representative to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, that autonomous vehicles should have oversight from city authorities and not just state authorities.</p><p>“Waymo is operating in something of a laissez-faire environment right now,” says California State Senator Dave Cortese, who chairs the state assembly’s transportation committee and whose district encompasses San Jose and other Silicon Valley cities where Waymo services recently began.</p><p>Currently, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) regulate the testing and approval process for autonomous vehicles.</p><p>“My sense is that Waymo’s ability to grow without legislation will not last too long. I just hope it doesn’t take a tragedy for it to happen,” says Cortese, who had also tabled a bill in the California State Assembly to bring autonomous vehicles under the ambit of local authorities, including firefighters and police.</p><p>Waymo’s website says its vehicles have been in 91 percent fewer accidents, and 92 percent less accidents involving pedestrian injuries than vehicles driven by people. Waymo did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Kit Kat, Waymo said in a statement at the time of the cat’s death, “darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away. We send our deepest sympathies to the cat’s owner and the community who knew and loved him.”</p><p>Steve Larson, a former executive director of the CPUC, says Waymo’s stellar safety record and successful rollout is at least partly because regulators “gave Waymo good advice and [the two organisations] took their time in getting things right”.</p><p>Karl Brauer, an automation writer and analyst with iSeeCars.com, says he was “sceptical” that before the end of the decade, self-driving cars would be as widespread as they are now. Better sensors and an improved ability to process information from videos have led to the success of Waymo, in particular, Brauer says.</p><p>But Waymo’s biggest expansion so far will be tested as more autonomous vehicles hit the road and Waymo itself drives further afield into uncharted territory.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4160735\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4160735\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25317007727959-1765216564.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4160735\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25317007727959-1765216564.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Waymo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4160735\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Waymo is allowed to ply on the Bay Area’s freeways and pick up passengers from San Jose International Airport [File: Godofredo A Vasquez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"no-driver-to-scream-at\">‘No driver to scream at’</h2><p>Zeidan had kept Kit Kat in his grocery store, Randa’s Market, for six years. “He recognised regular customers and followed them around,” Zeidan recalled. “They rubbed his tummy.” From his bed, Kit Kat kept an eye on the store’s entryway on busy 16th Street, with its independent movie theatre, bars and restaurants. He became known as “mayor of 16th Street”.</p><p>“I would rub his butt and his tail would go up,” recalled one regular customer, at Randa’s to buy beer on credit. “He would affectionately paw at us.”</p><p>On October 27, Zeidan got a call a little before midnight from a bartender at a neighbourhood bar saying Kit Kat had been in an accident. A Waymo had stopped outside his closed store and Kit Kat had crouched under it. A lady nearby spotted Kit Kat and called her to come out, but she didn’t. She tapped the car so it would not move.</p><p>“There was no driver to scream at,” Zeidan says. Soon, the car moved, crushing the cat underneath. On Thursday, Zeidan released security footage confirming how Kit Kat had died.</p><p>Scott Moura, professor and director of the Energy, Controls, &amp; Applications Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, says the Kit Kat accident represents a challenge for autonomous vehicle software development.</p><p>“Perception, prediction and planning are the key aspects of this software, and the bodega cat incident is indicative of perception since the car could not make out the cat was there,” Moura says.</p><p>“The hardest part, though, might be predicting what to do when it does know.”</p><p>This may have been the case with the dog, since it was said to be unleashed and may have run onto the street, according to media reports, which said the dog had died.</p><p>Waymo said in a public statement, “Unfortunately, a Waymo vehicle made contact with a small, unleashed dog in the roadway. We are dedicated to learning from this situation and how we show up for our community as we continue improving road safety in the cities we serve.”</p><h2 id=\"driving-is-social\">‘Driving is social’</h2><p>Moura expects perception and prediction issues to come up more as more autonomous vehicles come onto city streets and freeways and more cities with different weather.</p><p>Brauer of iSeeCars.com says that while Waymo has been in San Francisco and expanded mostly to warmer cities such as Dallas and Miami, being in cities with snow could clog its sensors and make perception hard. “Weather will be a big factor for Waymo sensors and its expansion plans,” he says.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4151447\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4151447\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-2.43.11-AM-2-1764914212.jpeg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4151447\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-05-at-2.43.11-AM-2-1764914212.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"kitkat\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4151447\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The death of Kit Kat has revealed the pent-up anger against self-driving cars and how they are changing San Francisco’s streets [Saumya Roy/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>As for prediction, “driving is social”, Moura says, noting, “we want cars to anticipate and act accordingly”.</p><p>He has looked at what kinds of signals autonomous vehicles can give people, leading to better coordination between the two. This could include LED lights or voice announcements that the car is turning or dropping off passengers – signals that Moura found to be valuable.</p><p>This could lead self-driving cars to look and feel quite different from conventional cars. Some such unique features have been included in the Amazon-backed Zoox vehicle that is also running in a few San Francisco areas, including the Mission, since November. There is a waitlist of customers to try it. Zoox, which does not resemble a traditional car, does not have a steering wheel and can seamlessly move forward and backward.</p><p>Waymo is also adding custom-made vehicles from Zeekr, a Chinese carmaker, and Hyundai, along with its more than 1,500-car-strong fleet from Jaguar.</p><h2 id=\"cuts-to-public-transport\">Cuts to public transport</h2><p>But the entry of Zoox, along with the expansion of Waymo, has also raised concerns about the nature of San Francisco streets and the city itself.</p><p>“All the issues we’ve had will now be exacerbated,” says Claire Amable, director of advocacy at the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, which pushes for the city to encourage sustainable transport.</p><p>In 2023, she wrote to the CPUC after an incident when she was leading a children’s cycling trip and a Waymo came up close to the children at the back of the group. The organisers had to bang on the roof of the car to stop it before it hit the children.</p><p>Even as self-driving cars become more common, public transport is underfunded and needs to be prioritised, Amable told Al Jazeera.</p><p>In August, for instance, city authorities allowed autonomous cars and ride-hailing services on Market Street, the city’s commercial hub, after three years of it being car free. At the same time, bus services have been reduced on the street due to budget cuts.</p><p>A  spokesperson for the city’s transit authority declined a request to comment for this story.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4160742\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4160742\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25322506981765-1765216885.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4160742\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25322506981765-1765216885.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zoox\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4160742\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amazon’s Zoox self-driving vehicle is posing some competition to Waymo [File: John Locher/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>Amable and others have pushed for a phased rollout of self-driving cars. But easy availability of Robotaxis may in fact hurt an already underfunded public transit system as well as sustainable transportation such as cycling.</p><p>Joel Smith had always cycled to work at a well-known city grocery store. But when he sent his bike for repairs last month, Smith downloaded the Waymo app and took his first ride. “It was such a comfortable ride and the best thing is I could play whatever music I want, at the volume I want.” He plans to mix Waymo rides with biking now that his bike is back.</p><p>Brauer says the rapid development of artificial intelligence to quickly process not just language but video in real time has led to the faster-than-expected success of self-driving cars. It meant Waymo could see incoming traffic or people very well and drive accordingly without mishaps. Cruise autonomous vehicles from General Motors – cars that launched along with Waymo – had been in an accident with a pedestrian in 2023 , and have since discontinued service. But Waymo’s safety record allowed it to expand, and it has done so in a measured way.</p><p>“They may be safer, but that doesn’t mean the government should not do its job,” says Senator Cortese, who is considering bringing back a version of a previous bill asking for more local regulation for Robotaxis. “Regulation helps companies to develop products safely and reduce liability.”</p><p>Brauer believes that constant improvement in the ability to see and process input from the road means that by 2028-2030, “we will be surprised to see the number of non-human cars across the US”, and “this will be the inflexion point where this became possible”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zeidan has made baseball caps and T-shirts that say #Remembering Kit Kat to sell at his store. He believes the merchandise memorialises Kit Kat but also brings together the city’s bubbling opposition to the rapid growth of self-driving cars.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”</p><p>Her departure is the latest setback for the administration of President Donald Trump, which has clashed with the judicial branch of government as it seeks to expand executive power.</p><p>But even as Habba announced her departure, the Trump administration warned it would continue its efforts to overturn the court’s ruling.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1998102734680318084\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, Attorney General Pam Bondi hinted that Habba could still be restored to the high-level post, even as she accepted the prosecutor’s resignation.</p><p>“The Department of Justice will seek further review of this decision, and we are confident it will be reversed,” Bondi wrote.</p><p>“Alina intends to return to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey if this occurs.”</p><h2 id=\"from-personal-lawyer-to-prosecutor\">From personal lawyer to prosecutor</h2><p>The controversy over Habba’s appointment stretches back to the first months of Trump’s second term, when the Republican leader began naming some of his close associates to high-level roles in the Department of Justice.</p><p>US attorneys serve as the top law enforcement officers in a given district, prosecuting cases on behalf of the federal government.</p><p>They also oversee vast networks of prosecutors. In the case of the New Jersey district, there are approximately 170 lawyers under the local US attorney’s command.</p><p>Normally, the post is filled once the US Senate approves a candidate. But Habba has been serving in an interim capacity. She has no previous prosecutorial experience.</p><p>She was, however, employed as a personal lawyer to Trump between his terms in office, representing him in various civil matters.</p><p>Those cases ranged from a <a href=\"/news/2023/9/26/trump-found-liable-for-deceiving-businesses-banks-in-new-york-fraud-suit\">civil fraud complaint</a> brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James to <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/us-court-upholds-sexual-assault-defamation-order-against-trump\">a defamation lawsuit</a> brought by the writer E Jean Carroll. Trump lost both cases and has since appealed.</p><p>Nevertheless, Habba was one of several personal lawyers Trump handpicked to join the Justice Department.</p><p>They included <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/why-critics-fear-emil-boves-confirmation-will-start-a-maga-judicial-shift\">Emil Bove</a>, who defended Trump against <a href=\"/news/2023/8/1/trump-charged-in-federal-election-probe-his-third-criminal-indictment\">two federal indictments</a> from 2023 to 2024. Trump named Bove acting deputy attorney general in the Justice Department before successfully nominating him to a lifelong position on the Third Circuit Court.</p><p>Another example is Lindsey Halligan, an insurance lawyer who represented Trump in legal actions against the seizure of classified documents from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p><p>Halligan herself was appointed as an acting US attorney, serving in the Eastern District of Virginia.</p><p>But last month, Halligan too found herself in legal jeopardy, after a federal judge found <a href=\"http://aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/us-judge-dismisses-criminal-charges-against-james-comey-letitia-james\">she had been illegally appointed</a>.</p><p>The judge also tossed the criminal charges Halligan had filed against two prominent Trump critics: Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, and James Comey, a former director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p><h2 id=\"political-prosecutions\">Political prosecutions?</h2><p>Habba had similarly overseen controversial prosecutions during her time as acting US attorney, feeding criticism that the Justice Department has been carrying out Trump’s political vendettas.</p><p>In March, she was sworn into office. By April, she had announced on the TV network Fox News that she was opening a probe into New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin, both Democrats.</p><p>She accused them of trying to “get in the way” of federal immigration enforcement operations.</p><p>Then, on May 9, she <a href=\"/news/2025/5/9/newark-mayor-ras-baraka-arrested-during-ice-detention-centre-protest\">decided to charge</a> Newark Mayor Ras Baraka with trespassing after he was involved in a protest in front of a local immigration detention facility.</p><p>By May 19, Habba <a href=\"https://x.com/USAttyHabba/status/1924610971919622210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had reversed course</a>, dropping the charges against Baraka. But in the same statement, she announced new charges against another participant in the protest, US Congress member LaMonica McIver.</p><p>Both McIver and Baraka are Democrats, and <a href=\"/news/2025/6/3/malicious-new-jersey-mayor-ras-baraka-sues-us-attorney-after-arrest\">they alleged</a> that their prosecutions were politically motivated. McIver’s case remains ongoing.</p><p>Still, Judge Andre Espinosa scolded Habba’s office for its short-lived prosecution against Baraka, calling it a “worrisome misstep” and “hasty”.</p><p>“Your role is not to secure convictions at all costs, nor to satisfy public clamour, nor to advance political agendas,” Espinosa told a federal prosecutor representing Habba’s office in May.</p><p>By July, Habba had reached the end of her legal mandate. According to the <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:28%20section:546%20edition:prelim)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US Code</a>, interim US attorneys are limited to a 120-day period, after which time the matter of temporary staffing goes to the district courts to decide.</p><p>On July 22, a panel of federal judges in New Jersey <a href=\"/news/2025/8/21/judge-rules-trump-lawyer-alina-habba-is-unlawfully-serving-as-us-attorney\">ruled not to extend Habba’s term</a>. Instead, they called upon Habba’s second-in-command, Desiree Grace, to replace her.</p><p>That triggered a power struggle between the executive and judicial branches.</p><h2 id=\"a-legal-fight\">A legal fight</h2><p>Attorney General Bondi and Trump himself pledged to keep Habba in the US attorney role, denouncing July’s judicial panel as a collection of “rogue judges”. They took the matter to the courts and fired Grace.</p><p>But in August, the Trump administration faced another setback. A federal judge ruled that Habba’s continued presence as acting US attorney was unlawful and that her actions in the role were “void”.</p><p>The judge also reprimanded the Trump administration for using “a novel series of legal and personnel moves” to keep Habba in the temporary office.</p><p>The Trump administration’s case hit another stumbling block on December 1, when the Third Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its judgement.</p><p><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818.81.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Writing</a> for the majority, Judge D Michael Fisher issued a 32-page decision, finding that Habba had run afoul of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA).</p><p>He affirmed the lower court’s decision in favour of her “disqualification”.</p><p>“As it stands, Habba alone is exercising all the powers of a U.S. Attorney, making her an Acting U.S. Attorney whose appointment is not FVRA compliant,” wrote Fisher, who was appointed under former Republican President George W Bush.</p><p>The appeals court’s decision prompted the Trump administration to renew its attacks against the judges involved in the case, dismissing them as partisan.</p><p>“The court’s ruling has made it untenable for [Habba] to effectively run her office, with politicized judges pausing trials designed to bring violent criminals to justice,” Bondi wrote on Monday.</p><p>“These judges should not be able to countermand the President’s choice of attorneys.”</p><p>Bondi added she was “saddened” to learn of Habba’s resignation. In a separate post, Bondi also defended Halligan, whose ability to continue as US attorney also remains in question.</p><p>She accused the district courts of “engaging in an unconscionable campaign of bias and hostility” against the acting prosecutors Trump appointed.</p><p>“This Department of Justice has no tolerance for undemocratic judicial activism,” she <a href=\"https://x.com/TheJusticeDept/status/1998026918591946865\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>, promising to fight the mounting number of court decisions against the Trump administration.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It leads the field with nine nominations overall.</p><p>Anderson was not the only cinematic “auteur” to receive laurels from the Golden Globe Foundation.</p><p>Chloe Zhao’s historical tear-jerker Hamnet — based on the relationship between playwright William Shakespeare and his wife Agnes — nabbed six nominations in various drama categories.</p><p>And Ryan Coogler’s springtime crowd-pleaser Sinners — a vampire film and cultural commentary, wrapped in one — scored seven nods, including Best Drama, Best Director and Best Cinematic Achievement.</p><p>While the Golden Globes are often seen as a cozy, champagne-clacking affair for Hollywood titans, this year’s nominations also suggest an ever-more international scope for its honourees.</p><p>The meditative Norwegian drama Sentimental Value scooped up eight nominations, and the French nominee It Was Just an Accident, by Iranian director Jafar Panahi, earned four.</p><p>South Korea and Brazil also broke free from the Non-English Language Film category, scoring nominations in the acting, songwriting and animation competitions for films like KPop Demon Hunters, No Other Choice and The Secret Agent.</p><p>Some pieces of award bait, meanwhile, failed to deliver on their potential. Director Luca Guadagnino’s slippery, post-MeToo drama After the Hunt, for example, only scored a single nomination for star Julia Roberts.</p><p>Likewise, the musical film Wicked: For Good — the sequel to last year’s award-season juggernaut — disappointed its expectations. While it scored nods in acting and song categories, it failed to land in contention for some of the biggest prizes, including Best Motion Picture: Comedy or Musical.</p><p>The 83rd annual Golden Globes are scheduled to air on January 11, 2026.
