After Warner Bros accepted the streaming giant’s offer, Paramount launched a hostile offer to outdo that bid.</p><p>“It does not, and never has,” the board wrote of the guarantee of Paramount’s offer, noting that the offer posed “numerous, significant risks”.</p><p>The board said it found Paramount’s offer “inferior” to Netflix’s $27.75 per share offer, which is a binding agreement that requires no equity financing and has robust debt commitments, the board wrote.</p><p>The board also said the offer could be terminated or amended at any time before the deal’s completion, which is not the same as a binding merger agreement.</p><p>Warner Bros has not yet set a date for a shareholder vote on the deal, but it is expected to happen sometime in spring or early summer, its chairman, Samuel Di Piazza, said in an interview with CNBC.</p><p>The Ellisons have cited their relationship with United States President Donald Trump as a reason why the deal would face an easier regulatory path.</p><p>“The Warner Bros Discovery Board reinforced that Netflix’s merger agreement is superior and that our acquisition is in the best interest of stockholders,” its co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement.</p><p>Netflix is already talking with the US Department of Justice and the European Commission, its other co-CEO, Greg Peters, told CNBC while expressing confidence in how regulators would view the deal.</p><p>Netflix has told Warner Bros it would keep releasing the studio’s films in cinemas in a bid to ease fears that the deal would eliminate another studio and major source of theatrical films, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><h2 id=\"paramount-s-case\">Paramount’s case</h2><p>Paramount last week took its case directly to Warner Bros shareholders, arguing it had arranged “air-tight financing” to support its bid with $41bn in new equity assured by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54bn of debt commitments from the Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.</p><p>The board decision came a day after Affinity Partners, a fund backed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and one of the funding sources of the Paramount offer, pulled out of the deal. The amount Affinity Partners was contributing to the offer was not disclosed in Paramount’s latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>“With two strong competitors vying to secure the future of this unique American asset, Affinity has decided no longer to pursue the opportunity,” the firm said in a statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“The dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October. We continue to believe there is a strong strategic rationale for Paramount’s offer.”</p><p>The Warner Bros board countered that Paramount’s latest offer included an equity commitment “for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind” but rather the backing of “an unknown and opaque” Lawrence J Ellison Revocable Trust, whose assets and liabilities are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change.</p><p>“Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was, … the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer,” the Warner Bros board wrote.</p><p>“A revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling shareholder.”</p><p>Paramount had submitted a total of six bids to acquire the entire Warner Bros studio, including its television networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports.</p><p>It has previously said the Ellison family trust – which Paramount says contains more than $250bn in assets, including about 1.16 billion shares of Oracle – is more than adequate to cover the equity commitment.</p><p>Warner Bros had raised questions about Paramount’s financial condition and creditworthiness. The offer relied on a seven-party, cross-conditional structure with the Ellison Revocable Trust providing 32 percent of the required equity commitment while capping its liability at $2.8bn, Warner Bros said. It noted that the trust’s assets could have been withdrawn at any time.</p><p>On Wall Street, Paramount Skydance’s stock tumbled on the news. It was down 3.8 percent from the market open. Warner Bros Discovery was down 0.4 percent while Netflix was surging – up 2.8 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But one 2019 report from George Mason University found that there were 857,200 immigrants among the country’s 8.1 million teachers, in roles ranging from pre-school to university.</p><p>For the 2023-2024 school year alone, the US government <a href=\"https://j1visa.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Teacher-Exchange-Visitors-Flyer-2023-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brought</a> 6,716 full-time teachers to the country on temporary exchange visas to fill openings in pre-kindergarten, primary and secondary school education.</p><p>Many hailed from the Philippines, as well as countries like Jamaica, Spain and Colombia.</p><p>The uncertainty for immigrants under Trump’s second term, however, has proven disruptive to schools that rely heavily on foreign-born teachers.</p><p>That is the case for the pre-school where Susanna worked, CommuniKids, which offers language immersion programmes in Washington, DC.</p><p>Cofounder and president Raul Echevarría estimates that immigrants — both citizens and non-citizens working with legal authorisation — comprise about 90 percent of CommuniKids’s staff.</p><p>But Echevarría told Al Jazeera that the push to rescind legal pathways to immigration has jeopardised the employment of several faculty members.</p><p>Five other teachers at the school have seen their ability to work affected by changes to the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme.</p><p>All five, Echevarría explained, were originally from Venezuela. But in October, the Trump administration ended TPS status for more than 350,000 Venezuelan citizens, including the teachers at CommuniKids.</p><p>Their authorisation to work legally in the US will expire on October 2, 2026, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.</p><p>“These teachers lost their ability to make a living,” Echevarria said, noting that his school requires educators with expertise in languages like Spanish, French and Mandarin.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4172070\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4172070\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4172070\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image005-1765679104.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A classroom hall at CommuniKids\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4172070\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CommuniKids, a language immersion school in Washington, DC, helps young children develop skills in French, Mandarin and Spanish [Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"strong-bonds\">‘Strong bonds’</h2><p>For the schools themselves, the losses can be devastating. Every state in the US has reported teacher shortages to the federal government.</p><p>But advocates say the high stress and low pay of education make teachers difficult to recruit and keep.</p><p>That leads some states to look abroad for education workers. In North Carolina, for example, 1,063 foreign nationals worked full-time as grade-school teachers on temporary J-1 visas during the 2023-2024 school year.</p><p>The top destinations for such recruits were all southern states: North Carolina was followed by Florida with 996 teachers on J-1 visas, and Texas with 761.</p><p>But Echevarria said some of the biggest impacts of the deportation drive are felt by the students themselves.</p><p>“Our students develop strong bonds with their teachers, and all of a sudden, overnight, they lost their teachers,” said Echevarría.</p><p>“Their number one superpower”, he added, “is their ability to empathise and to create strong, effective bonds with people from any background”.</p><p>But when those bonds are broken, there can be mental health consequences and setbacks for educational achievement, particularly among younger children.</p><p>A 2024 study published by the American Educational Research Association found that, when teachers leave midyear, children’s language development takes a measurable hit.</p><p>In other words, the loss of a familiar teacher — someone who knows their routines, strengths and fears — can quietly stall a child’s progress. The consequences extend to a child’s sense of self and stability.</p><h2 id=\"mental-health-consequences\">Mental health consequences</h2><p>For parents like Michelle Howell, whose child attends CommuniKids, the loss of teachers has also made the classroom environment feel fragile.</p><p>“The teachers there aren’t just teachers for these young kids,” Howell said of CommuniKids. “They’re like extended family.</p><p>“They hug them, they hold them, they do the things a parent would do. When those people disappear, it’s not just hard for the kids. It’s hard for everyone.”</p><p>Howell, who is Chinese American, said the sudden disappearances reminded her of her own family’s history.</p><p>“I used to read about things like this happening in China, the place my family left to find safety,” she said. “It’s very disturbing to know that what we ran from back then is our reality now. People disappear.”</p><p>School psychologist Maria C, who asked to remain anonymous to protect her work in the Texas public school system, has noticed the children she works with struggling with instability caused by the deportation push.</p><p>The disappearance of a loved one or mentor — say, a favourite teacher — could flood a child’s body with cortisol, the hormone meant to protect them in moments of danger, she explained.</p><p>But when that stress becomes chronic, the same hormone starts to hurt more than it helps. It interferes with memory, attention and emotional regulation.</p><p>“For some, it looks like anxiety. For others, it’s depression or sudden outbursts,” Maria said. “They’re in fight-or-flight mode all day.”</p><p>She added that selective mutism, an anxiety disorder, is on the rise among the children she sees, who range in age from five to 12.</p><p>“It used to be rare, maybe one case per school,” she said. “Now I see it constantly. It’s a quiet symptom of fear.”</p><h2 id=\"preparing-for-the-worst\">Preparing for the worst</h2><p>Back at CommuniKids, Echevarría explained that he and other staff members have put together contingency plans, just in case immigration enforcement arrives at the pre-school.</p><p>The aim, he said, is to make both employees and students feel safer coming to class.</p><p>“We put those steps in writing because we wanted our staff to know they’re not alone,” he said. “We have attorneys on call. We’re partners with local police. But above all, our job is to protect our children.”</p><p>But as an added precaution, teachers are advised to carry their passports or work permits with them.</p><p>Even Echevarría, a US citizen born in Virginia, said he carries his passport wherever he goes. The fear of deportation has a way of lingering.</p><p>“I’m bilingual and of Hispanic descent,” he said. “Given how things are, I want to be able to prove I’m a citizen if anyone ever questions it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

She is the first woman in history to hold this position.</p><p>In 2015, Wiles was invited to Trump Tower in New York to meet Trump as he was transitioning from being a real estate developer to a presidential candidate.</p><p>In the Vanity Fair piece, Whipple described her as “the most powerful person in Trump’s White House other than the president himself”.</p><p>Whipple quoted an unnamed former Republican Party leader as saying: “So many decisions of great consequence are being made on the whim of the president. And as far as I can tell, the only force that can direct or channel that whim is Susie.”</p><p>Wiles has risen from a Capitol Hill intern in the 1970s to a top Republican strategist. At the age of 23, she landed a job as a scheduler in the White House when Republican Ronald Reagan was president.</p><p>Wiles’s childhood was difficult. Her father, Pat Summerall, a well-known American football announcer, was an alcoholic. She was raised in Stamford, Connecticut and Saddle River, New Jersey, according to the Vanity Fair article.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-did-wiles-say-about-trump-and-his-aides\">What did Wiles say about Trump and his aides?</h2><p>Here’s what Wiles told Vanity Fair about Trump and his aides, and here is how some of them reacted:</p><h3>Trump</h3><p>According to the Vanity Fair report, Wiles said she never doubted Trump would win the presidential election in November 2024.</p><p>She added that she was going to present a “new Trump” to the public and even told Hakeem Jeffries, the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, before Trump’s inauguration that he would see a different side of Trump in his second term. Trump would be calmer and without a temper, she said.</p><p>“I’ve not seen him throw anything, I’ve not seen him scream. I didn’t see that really horrible behaviour that people talk about and that I actually experienced years ago,” Whipple quoted Wiles as saying in his article.</p><p>Although Trump is a teetotaller, Wiles was quoted as saying Trump “has an alcoholic’s personality” and he “operates [with] a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing”.</p><p>In an interview with the New York Post published on Tuesday, Trump defended Wiles.</p><p>About the alcoholic comment, Trump said: “She meant that I’m – you see, I don’t drink alcohol. So everybody knows that, but I’ve often said that if I did, I’d have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself. I do. It’s a very possessive personality.”</p><p>Talking about Whipple’s report, Trump said, “I didn’t read it, but I don’t read Vanity Fair, but [Wiles has] done a fantastic job.”</p><p>“I think from what I hear, the facts were wrong, and it was a very misguided interviewer, purposely misguided,” the New York Post quoted Trump as saying.</p><p>Leavitt also backed Wiles during a Fox News appearance on Tuesday.</p><p>“I would just echo my boss, Susie Wiles, who is the best chief of staff in our nation’s history, working for the greatest president in our nation’s history,” Leavitt said. “This was, unfortunately, another attempt at fake news by a reporter who was acting disingenuously and really did take the chief’s words out of context.</p><p>“The reporter omitted all of the positive things that Susie and our team said about the president and the inner workings of the White House.”</p><h3>JD Vance</h3><p>Wiles said the vice president went from opposing Trump to fully supporting him mostly for political reasons. She also described Vance as being into conspiracy theories for about 10 years.</p><p>Vance, who also said he had not read the Vanity Fair article, backed Wiles during an address in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania on Tuesday.</p><p>“You know why I really love Susie Wiles? Because Susie is who she is in the president’s presence [and] she’s the same exact person when the president isn’t around,” Vance said.</p><p>“I’ve never seen her be disloyal to the president of the United States, and that makes her the best White House chief of staff that the president could ask for,” he said.</p><h3>Elon Musk</h3><p>Wiles also expressed opinions about billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, CEO of the private space exploration company SpaceX and the electric car company Tesla.</p><p>During the first few months of Trump’s second term, Musk was his close aide, overseeing the Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was meant to slash US government bureaucracy. DOGE became known for carrying out mass layoffs of federal government workers and abruptly shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p><p>Wiles described Musk as a “solo actor”, telling Whipple that “the challenge with Elon is keeping up with him.”</p><p>“He’s an avowed ketamine [user]. And he sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB [Executive Office Building] in the daytime. And he’s an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are. You know, it’s not helpful, but he is his own person,” Wiles was quoted in the Vanity Fair article as saying.</p><p>Musk has not publicly reacted to the article. In March, he posted on X – formerly known as Twitter, the social media platform he bought in 2022 – saying, “I’m a big fan of Susie Wiles,” in response to a video of him helping Wiles out with a bag.</p><p>When Trump named Wiles his chief of staff after winning the November 2024 election, Musk posted a screenshot of news about the announcement and wrote: “Susie Wiles is great.”</p><p> </p><h3>Pam Bondi</h3><p>In the interview, Wiles also criticised Attorney General Pam Bondi’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The wealthy convicted paedophile died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell. Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>Conspiracy theorists claim, however, that he might have been murdered because he maintained a secret client list of powerful individuals, including politicians, who allegedly abused underage girls. In July, the US Department of Justice, which Bondi heads, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/7/epstein-no-client-list-died-suicide-justice-department-says\">concluded</a> that Epstein had no client list.</p><p>The Justice Department memo angered right-wing conspiracy theorists and a section of the US president’s base of supporters because it was seen as a retreat from a narrative once promoted by members of the Trump administration.</p><p>When Bondi was asked in an interview with Fox News in February about a supposed list of Epstein’s clients, she responded: “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.”</p><p>The same month, political commentators and far-right influencers were invited to the White House and presented with documents called “The Epstein Files: Phase 1”. Bondi released these documents, which did not contain anything revelatory about the Epstein case.</p><p>Whipple wrote that Wiles said Bondi “completely whiffed” on understanding that the conservative influencers she invited to the White House were exactly the audience most interested in the documents.</p><p>Wiles was quoted as saying Bondi gave the influencers “binders full of nothingness”. Wiles emphasised: “There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn’t on her desk.”</p><h2 id=\"what-was-wiles-s-opinion-on-other-issues\">What was Wiles’s  opinion on other issues?</h2><h3>Trump’s January 6 pardons</h3><p>On January 6, 2021, thousands of rioters, fuelled by false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged, stormed the US Capitol to try to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory over Trump.</p><p>More than 2,000 people broke into the seat of the US Congress, vandalised offices and fought with police, leaving at least five people dead and many injured.</p><p>About 1,270 people were convicted of federal crimes over the riot, and their prison sentences ranged from a few years to more than two decades for leaders of far-right groups.</p><p>On the day he was inaugurated for his second term, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of 1,500 people who were convicted or indicted in the riots, calling their treatment “outrageous”.</p><p>Wiles told Whipple that she questioned Trump pardoning all 1,500.</p><p>She was quoted in Vanity Fair as saying: “I said, ‘I am on board with the people that were happenstancers or didn’t do anything violent. And we certainly know what everybody did because the FBI has done such an incredible job.'”</p><p>She added that Trump asserted that even the violent offenders were unfairly treated.</p><h3>The USAID shutdown</h3><p>Wiles said she was “aghast” when she learned USAID had been shut down.</p><p>“I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,” she was quoted as saying by Whipple.</p><h3>Attacks on alleged drug boats</h3><p>Since September, US military strikes on more than 20 boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have killed <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2025/11/15/us-confirms-four-people-killed-in-20th-strike-on-vessel-in-the-caribbean\">more than 80 people</a>. The Trump administration has alleged, without evidence, that these boats belong to drug cartels and carry drugs. It has also accused Venezuela’s left-wing government of being involved in drug trafficking.</p><p>“We save 25,000 people every time we knock out a boat,” Trump claimed during an interview with Politico published last week.</p><p>Wiles was quoted by Whipple as saying: “The president believes in harsh penalties for drug dealers, as he’s said many, many times. … These are not fishing boats as some would like to allege.</p><p>“The president says 25,000. I don’t know what the number is. But he views those as lives saved, not people killed.”</p><p>Wiles also affirmed that Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/12/17/trump-stands-by-chief-of-staff-after-shock-remarks-about-vance-bondi-musk\">wants to keep bombing alleged drug boats</a> in the waters off the coast of Venezuela until that country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, “cries uncle”.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-wiles-react-to-the-vanity-fair-piece\">How did Wiles react to the Vanity Fair piece?</h2><p>Wiles criticised the Vanity Fair article as a “disingenuously framed hit piece”.</p><p>“The article published early this morning is a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history,” she wrote on X on Tuesday.</p><p>“Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,” she added.</p><p>She then went on to claim that Trump has achieved more in his second term in 11 months than any president in eight years.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Months later, a senior US Navy admiral said the US had carried out what he said was the “largest air strike in the history of the world” from an aircraft carrier, marking a sharp departure from the previous administration’s approach.</p><p>The strike total this year already surpasses the combined number carried out under Presidents George W Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and it puts Trump on track to potentially exceed even his own first-term record of 219 strikes.</p><p>The intensified campaign targets both al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate that has fought Somalia’s government since 2007 and controls large areas of the south-central regions, and ISIL (SIS) in Somalia, a smaller offshoot concentrated in the northeast with an estimated 1,500 fighters.</p><p>Somalia’s war with armed groups was Africa’s third-deadliest over the last year, killing 7,289 people, according to the US-based Africa Center for Strategic Studies.</p><p>The United States has been allied with Somalia’s federal government, training elite forces and conducting air strikes in support of local operations. US troops have also been based in the country.</p><p>The surge in strikes follows a directive by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that reversed Biden-era restrictions requiring White House approval for strikes outside warzones, giving AFRICOM commanders greater authority to launch attacks.</p><p>David Sterman, a senior policy analyst at the New America Foundation, told Al Jazeera there appeared to be “a demand signal from the White House for escalation” and “a willingness to allow more clearly offensive uses of strikes with less scrutiny and regulation”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Sterman, who has monitored the strikes, identified two main drivers behind the increase.</p><p>More than half the strikes have supported a US-backed campaign by Somalia’s autonomous Puntland region against ISIL-Somalia, launched after the group attacked a military convoy in December 2024.</p><p>The strikes have shifted from occasionally targeting senior figures to sustained operations aimed at members of the group who have hemmed themselves into the caves in the mountains in northern Somalia, Sterman added.</p><p>The remainder focus on al-Shabaab’s advances against Somali government forces in the south, as US strikes support a Somali National Army that has faced setbacks on the ground this year.</p><p>The February 1 operation that opened the campaign saw 16 F/A-18 Super Hornets launch from the USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea, dropping 60 tonnes of munitions on cave complexes in the Golis Mountains. The strike killed 14 people, according to Africa Command.</p><h2 id=\"somali-civilians-under-us-fire\">Somali civilians under US fire</h2><p>However, the intensified operations have raised concerns about civilian casualties.</p><p>The investigative outlet Drop Site News reported in December that US air strikes and Somali forces killed at least 11 civilians, including seven children, during a November 15 operation in the Lower Jubba region, citing witnesses.</p><p>Africa Command confirmed conducting strikes to support Somali troops, but did not respond to Drop Site requests for comment on the civilian deaths.</p><p>The US military recently stopped providing civilian casualty assessments in its strike announcements.</p><p>According to the military publication Stars and Stripes, the pace of operations now exceeds even the US’s claimed counter-narcotics strikes in the Caribbean.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In the meantime, Trump launched racist verbal attacks earlier this month on Somali immigrants in the US state of Minnesota, as federal authorities prepared to launch a major immigration crackdown targeting hundreds of undocumented Somalis in the state of Minnesota.</p><p>His comments have been <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/from-mogadishu-to-minneapolis-somalis-reject-trumps-bigoted-remarks\">denounced</a> in several quarters, from Mogadishu to Minneapolis.</p></div></div></body></html>"

capitalism triggered demand for Ukrainian steel slabs and iron ore, corn and sunflower oil.</p><p>However, the most prized export items from impoverished Ukraine were the Soviet-era arsenal of weapons it did not think it needed any more.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Kyiv sold Beijing aerospace components, helicopter and tank engines, and technology transfers for the manufacturing of radars, naval gas turbines and jet engines, helping to reshape China’s defence industry.</p><p>It even admitted to illegally shipping six nuclear-capable Kh-55 cruise missiles.</p><p>The pinnacle of military-industrial exports was the 1998 sale of the Soviet-era Varyag aircraft carrier, whose construction began but never finished on the wharves of the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv.</p><p>Beijing pledged to use the 306-metre (1,004-foot) long vessel for training but turned it into its first aircraft carrier, Liaoning.</p><h2 id=\"china-can-end-the-war\">‘China can end the war’</h2><p>The tables have turned during the Russia-Ukraine war, when China became the side that profits the most from the fierce competition between Russian and Ukrainian drone developers.</p><p>It is “always” a Chinese manufacturer of unmanned aircraft “who earns the most”, Andrey Pronin, one of the drone warfare pioneers in Ukraine, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He was standing in the storeroom of his school for drone pilots on the outskirts of Kyiv – next to a dozen drones that ranged from what looked like a tiny replica of a World War I biplane to a jet-driven mini-missile to tiny first-person-view drones.</p><p>Each of them consisted of Chinese-made components – engines, flight controllers, batteries, thermal cameras and navigation modules.</p><p>These components have been the backbone of Ukraine’s drone industry, which churns out millions of loitering munitions annually.</p><p>They are also one of the reasons why Ukraine has not lost the war.</p><p>“China can end the war in one day by just turning off the export [of drone parts] either to us or to Russians,” Pronin said.</p><p>Ukrainian drone manufacturers work frantically to localise the production of key components, such as frames, avionics, engines and radios, according to a report by Snake Island, a military research group in Kyiv.</p><p>And yet, “the industry still depends on a narrow set of critical imports – lithium salts, neodymium magnets, navigation chips, and thermal sensors – where China holds disproportionate leverage”, it said in a report released in October.</p><h2 id=\"should-the-strategic-partnership-be-restored\">Should the strategic partnership be restored?</h2><p>What is even more important to Kyiv is how, not if, it will rebuild ties with Beijing after the war is over.</p><p>In 2011, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Kyiv and signed a strategic partnership agreement with his then-Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor Yanukovych, who was staunchly pro-Russian.</p><p>Before the 2013 launch of its Belt and Road Initiative, a mammoth project to build transport infrastructure from China to Europe, Beijing counted on Ukraine to become its focal point.</p><p>Ukraine has a Black Sea coast and borders the delta of the Danube River, an ancient trade route that flows through or borders nine European nations.</p><p>But in early 2014, Yanukovych fled to Russia after a months-long popular uprising – and weeks later, Moscow annexed Crimea and spurred a separatist revolt in southeastern Ukraine.</p><p>Seeing Beijing as Russia’s main international backer, Kyiv cooled ties with China.</p><p>“These days, our ties, political ties, are at point zero – at a moment when China is Ukraine’s main economic partner,” Kyiv-based analyst Vadym Denysenko told a news conference earlier this month.</p><p>In 2020, the China-Ukraine trade turnover reached $15.4bn, amounting to about one-seventh of Kyiv’s foreign trade.</p><p>Despite the war, China still has not lost its appetite for Ukrainian grain, steel, vegetables, oil and soya beans – and these exports help keep Ukraine’s economy afloat.</p><p>After the war, Kyiv will have to rebuild and expand ties with Beijing – at least because its geographic position between the Black Sea and the European Union is still “very interesting” to the Belt and Road Initiative, Denysenko said.</p><h2 id=\"not-beneficial-for-russia\">‘Not beneficial for Russia’</h2><p>Ukraine will need to replace its czarist-era railways with Western ones that have a narrower track gauge and expand its port on the Danube to give China better access to the EU, according to a detailed report by Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevich.</p><p>Irrespective of Beijing’s post-war ties with Moscow, Kyiv will need to boost its export of steel and foodstuffs to China, allow Beijing to open plants to assemble Chinese cars and machine tools, and use Ukrainian steel, the report said.</p><p>“We need localisation with the possibility of buying out rights to certain brands,” Tyshkevich said.</p><p>Ukraine could use its Soviet-era expertise to create joint projects to develop aircraft, pharmaceuticals and nuclear energy.</p><p>“Because Ukraine’s participation not only as a recipient, but as a transit country, as a key player that also influences the development of these projects, of course, is not beneficial for Russia,” he said.</p><p>Other analysts agree that China’s sphere of interest is too large to ignore and that Ukraine should become part of it.</p><p>Kyiv’s failure to restore ties with China “will cost our nation dearly”, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Essentially, our diplomacy didn’t just write off China, but the entire Global South, or more than half of the globe,” he said, referring to the nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America that were once European colonies and are opposed to Western domination.</p><p>Ukraine should become part of “the Eurasian Steppe Corridor” from northeast China via Kazakhstan, the Southern Caucasus to the Black Sea nations – Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine, he said.</p><p>It implies Ukraine joining Eurasian logistical routes and a conception of Ukraine as “a hub nation, a bridge nation, a plastic link nation”, he said.</p><p>“Everything should be done so that goods move across the Eurasian Steppe Corridor, not foreign troops,” Kushch said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
