If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”</p><p>Trump repeated the idea to reporters on August 6, saying he was “going to look at” revoking the city’s home rule, citing the attack on Coristine.</p><p>Data shows that in recent years, the district has had a significant crime problem, but offences such as homicide, gun-related and aggravated assault, carjacking, vehicle theft, robbery and sexual assault have declined from COVID-19-era peaks.</p><p>But a big question remains: can Trump undertake a federal takeover of the District of Columbia?</p><p>Experts say it’s possible, but not necessarily simple – he’d have to get Congress to agree.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-dc-s-home-rule\">What is DC’s ‘home rule’?</h2><p>The United States Constitution created the District of Columbia as a 10-square-mile seat of the federal government.</p><p>Because the district is not a state, its residents lack full congressional representation; it has one House delegate who cannot vote on the floor, and no senators.</p><p>For about a century until 1973, the city was run by three presidentially appointed commissioners. That year, President Richard Nixon signed the Home Rule Act, enabling district residents to elect a mayor and city council.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>While the home rule law granted the district significant autonomy for local governance, the city still answers to Congress on certain matters, including budgetary oversight and the ability to overturn local legislation.</p><p>“Since 1974, and indeed for all of DC history, members of Congress have interfered in city affairs to fiddle with everything from how long pools are open to banning the city from using its own tax money for a needle exchange programme,” said George Derek Musgrove, a University of Maryland-Baltimore County historian.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-to-federalise-dc\">What does it mean to federalise DC?</h2><p>Trump hasn’t detailed how federalisation would work, or said whether there are specific services he wants to take over.</p><p>Legal scholars agreed, given the explicit language in the Constitution, that Trump cannot simply take over the district and oust its home rule-elected leadership. He would have to work with Congress, the entity entrusted with overseeing the capital.</p><p>“Congress may exercise this authority, not exercise it, or delegate it,” Musgrove said. “With the Home Rule Act of 1973, it delegated a good bit of that authority – though not all – to a local government. It would have to act to reclaim that authority, or to delegate it to another entity, like the executive branch.”</p><p>Congress’s Republican majorities have so far supported Trump’s agenda with near-unanimity, but a repeal of home rule isn’t a sure thing.</p><p>It would need to win passage in the House, which the Republicans narrowly control and where Trump might be able to enforce his will with the majority. But it would also need to clear the Senate, which would take 60 votes, including at least seven Democratic votes, to proceed to final consideration. Democrats have generally been supportive of home rule for the district.</p><p>In February, Senator Mike Lee and Representative Andrew Ogles introduced legislation to repeal home rule. But the measure has only three Senate co-sponsors and three House co-sponsors.</p><p>“According to the Constitution, Congress makes the laws for the district,” said University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt. If Trump wants to “federalise DC in order for him to wipe out its Democratic leadership and replace it with people who are loyal only to him, that strikes me as precisely what the framers did not want”.</p><p>Short of a law, the president has other ways to exert influence in the district, including the authority to mobilise the DC National Guard without local consent. That’s a possibility he floated in remarks to reporters on August 6.</p><p>The Home Rule Act also allows the president to assume temporary control over the city’s police department in an emergency – something Trump threatened to do in 2020 amid nationwide protests over the killing of <a href=\"/news/2020/6/11/a-timeline-of-the-george-floyd-and-anti-police-brutality-protests\">George Floyd</a>.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-trump-said-over-time-about-this\">What has Trump said over time about this?</h2><p>Trump has talked broadly since his 2024 campaign about expanding the federal government’s powers over the district, including enhanced oversight and direct management.</p><p>During the March 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump spoke about driving through the district, lamenting dirty roads. “It looked like somebody just took their garbage and just threw it all over the highways, the Beltway. It’s so disgraceful, so disgusting,” Trump said. “… Frankly, the federal government should take over control and management of Washington, DC.”</p><p>During a July 2024 Florida campaign rally, Trump promised to “take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, DC, and clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city so that it is no longer a nightmare of murder and crime, but rather it will become the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world”.</p><p>Trump echoed this in February, again focusing on blight and crime: “I think the federal government should take over the governance of DC and run it really, really properly.”</p><p>In March, Trump signed an executive order establishing the “DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force”. It mandates beautification efforts such as graffiti removal and enhanced park maintenance, and it includes provisions to address violent crime and issues related to homelessness.</p><p>In a July Cabinet meeting, Trump pitched the idea again: “We have tremendous power at the White House to run places where we have to. We could run DC. I mean, we’re … looking at DC. We don’t want crime in DC. We want the city to run well.”</p><h2 id=\"has-home-rule-been-revoked-before\">Has home rule been revoked before?</h2><p>There is precedent for removing home-rule powers, but not recently.</p><p>In 1874, local conservatives angry about voting rights for local Black and working-class white residents teamed up with opponents of Reconstruction-era voting in the South and some of their Northern allies to roll back democratic laws in the district, Musgrove said.</p><p>The changes lasted until Nixon signed the home rule bill a century later.</p><p>A repeal of home rule would not be popular with Washingtonians. In 2024, Trump won less than 6.5 percent of the district’s vote.</p><p>While no city is perfect, the district has built a functioning city government under home rule, Musgrove said.</p><p>“There is no question that people would be mad,” Musgrove said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The sheer volume of books, articles, and seminars on this subject has become overwhelming to the point of saturation. Muslims entered this debate seeking to understand how to regain global relevance, if not influence. They struggled to pinpoint exactly where and how the Muslim agenda went off course. The colonisation of Muslim countries became the nearest and most convenient target to criticise and demonise. As a result, Muslim thinkers of the 20th century were deeply absorbed in the process of decolonisation. Analysing the root causes of our decline and disintegration is undoubtedly an essential step towards self-correction and revival. The question, however, is how much progress have we made as an Ummah by endlessly repeating age-old analyses that leave behind only a bitter aftertaste? Where has all this talk of decolonisation actually taken us?</p><p data-start=\"1127\" data-end=\"1985\">I dare say it has led us to pursue aggressive efforts to further secularise Muslim values and promote misplaced priorities, such as pushing for a nation’s entry into the World Cup, building the tallest skyscraper, hosting music festivals, spending billions to recruit the world’s top football players, and staging Formula One races. As an afterthought, there is also an appreciation for education, often reduced to importing Western universities into the Muslim world. The significant contribution of Ismail al-Faruqi, a prominent Muslim philosopher who championed the concept of the Islamisation of knowledge, defined as the integration of Islamic principles into all fields of learning to realign modern knowledge with a monotheistic worldview, has quietly faded from focus. It has been increasingly overshadowed by an apologetic stance towards liberalism.</p><p data-start=\"1987\" data-end=\"2109\">In striving to regain global standing, we seem to have replaced meaningful reform with superficial displays of progress.</p><p data-start=\"2111\" data-end=\"2702\">In Western academia, discussions on decolonisation began with examinations of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s paradox of founding and later expanded to ideas such as Frantz Fanon’s theory of spontaneity, Sukarno’s concept of guided democracy, and Ali Shariati’s paradox of colonisation. With Ismail al-Faruqi’s call for the Islamisation of knowledge, Muslims came to recognise that true self-determination must also involve a revival of Muslim epistemology. This aligns with the Peruvian scholar Anibal Quijano’s argument that decolonisation requires a critical challenge to Eurocentric control over knowledge.</p><p data-start=\"2704\" data-end=\"3112\">The Eurocentric and Western dominance over global knowledge, particularly in areas where they have little legitimacy to lead, is evident in many examples. Curators who oversee vast collections of Muslim manuscripts often claim the authority to narrate their history according to their own interpretations, which frequently diverge from the perspectives of the original authors and traditional commentators.</p><p data-start=\"3114\" data-end=\"3539\">As the founder and director of Darul Qasim, an Islamic seminary dedicated to advanced studies in the classical Islamic sciences, I witnessed this here in Illinois in the United States at an exhibition of rare Qur’anic manuscripts, where a non-Muslim woman had been appointed to “tell the stories” of the texts. When a student from Darul Qasim corrected several inaccuracies in her account, her only reply was a dismissive: “I’m in charge here.”</p><p data-start=\"3541\" data-end=\"3918\">Another example involves a scholar from Darul Qasim who submitted a manuscript on classical Arabic grammar to a prominent Western publisher who refused to publish it, stating: “We cannot accept this work as you have not cited any Western sources.” Such incidents highlight how Western academic gatekeeping continues to reinforce Eurocentric control over knowledge.</p><p data-start=\"3920\" data-end=\"4636\">Ismail al-Faruqi sought to rescue Muslim knowledge from Western dominance. His vision was to “Islamicise” knowledge by cleansing the sciences of concepts that are fundamentally incompatible with Islam. His theories were grounded in a monotheistic approach that integrated all sciences with the worldview of the Ummah. The concept gained traction and was promoted by the International Institute of Islamic Thought, a research organisation founded to advance the Islamisation of knowledge and embed it within academic discourse. While al-Faruqi’s call to reevaluate our system of knowledge was undoubtedly a step in the right direction, it does not fully lead us to the ultimate goal of comprehensive decolonisation.</p><p data-start=\"4638\" data-end=\"5194\">What is needed is a theory that goes beyond the Islamisation of knowledge. I propose digging deeper into what scholars call the coloniality of knowledge, the persistent dominance of Eurocentric frameworks that continue to shape global intellectual thought, and advancing a theory of the desecularisation of knowledge. This requires realigning knowledge at the level of its epistemology, not merely in terms of politics or economics. Muslim scholars must take on the task of presenting and re-presenting a coherent and effective theory of our epistemology.</p><p data-start=\"5196\" data-end=\"5599\">In summary, Islamic epistemology recognises three primary sources of knowledge: that which comes through the five senses, that which is derived from human intellect, and that which is conveyed through authentic and true reports, such as revelation to a Prophet. These three encompass every source of knowledge known to humankind, with intuition and dreams also understood as products of the intellect.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"5601\" data-end=\"6083\">Historically, Muslims played a leading role in mastering these sources of knowledge and disseminating them across the world. In Islam, knowledge is never separated from Allah, who is the original source of all knowledge. Unlike Western intellectual traditions that sought to separate knowledge from God in pursuit of modernity and prosperity, Islam affirms that true creativity flows from Allah, and that inventions and innovations arise from honouring Allah’s knowledge of the world.</p><p data-start=\"6085\" data-end=\"6749\">Unfortunately, there is today a deep tension in the Muslim world over how to distinguish between Islamic and secular knowledge. Many seem to believe that Muslims must undergo a Western-inspired renaissance to reclaim past glory, doing so without regard for the afterlife, or akhirah. The problem is that Muslims do believe in the akhirah, and this has created a self-imposed and false dichotomy, born of misunderstanding Islamic principles, that suggests Muslims must compete with the West while simultaneously upholding the rules of salvation. This perceived conflict forces an artificial wedge between what is considered Islamic and what is considered secular.</p><p data-start=\"6751\" data-end=\"7525\">I believe this dichotomy is false, and anyone familiar with Islamic law, or fiqh, would recognise that. Islamic law governs how Muslims act, react, and interact with the mundane world in ways that have direct implications for their afterlife. Human actions in this world have consequences in the next. While this is not a treatise on Islamic law, this observation alone should address the doubts of sceptics. Muslims are generous not only because it helps those in need, but because they believe such acts bring immense reward in the akhirah. Charity, therefore, is not merely a humanitarian value, but a profoundly religious one. Belief in the akhirah desecularises even the simplest acts of kindness, reaffirming how Islamic thought integrates the material and spiritual.</p><p data-start=\"7527\" data-end=\"8280\">I propose that Islamic epistemology views all knowledge not as secular or sacred, but as either beneficial (nafi’) or more beneficial (anfa’). Any knowledge that benefits an individual, human or non-human, in this world is considered beneficial. The Quran itself provides examples of such knowledge: Allah taught Nuh (Noah) the craft of building an ark from wooden planks that withstood a massive storm, and taught Dawud (David) the skill of forging armour from iron. In both cases, the knowledge is described as coming directly from Allah, and therefore, cannot be considered secular. Building bridges, highways, hospitals, and schools also falls into this category of beneficial (nafi’) knowledge, as these works serve human welfare in this life.</p><p data-start=\"8282\" data-end=\"8610\">Knowledge that benefits human beings in the akhirah is anfa’, or more beneficial. This includes knowledge of reciting the Quran, understanding ritual worship, and knowing how to serve Allah. Establishing religious schools (madrassas), mosques, and zakat foundations, for instance, belongs to this category of anfa’ knowledge.</p><p data-start=\"8612\" data-end=\"9135\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Muslims do not need to create a false dichotomy in knowledge, for tawheed, the oneness of Allah, also encompasses the unity of knowledge. With this understanding, there is no need to desecularise knowledge; rather, we must appropriate it correctly according to its utility in this world and the next. The key lies in affirming the existence of the other world. I dare say that, in an age where belief in parallel universes is entertained, life beyond this world is not as far-fetched as secularists might have us believe.</p><p data-start=\"8612\" data-end=\"9135\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Bit by bit, she built a wooden house. Eventually, she plucked up the courage to phone her father.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘Come and see the work I do. See that it is not something to feel bad about.'”</p>\n<p>When he saw the yard and the tricycle teams that had become Bamfo’s business, Nkosoo Waste Management (\"nkosoo\" is Twi for \"progress\"), he couldn’t help but be impressed.</p>\n<p>“You are not a woman, you are a man,” she recalls him telling her once, half admiring and half accusing. “The heart that you have - even your brother doesn’t have that heart.”</p>\n<p>Now she hopes to pass on some of her resilience.

But talks keep collapsing, particularly on the issue of introducing a cap on plastic production.</p><p>Campaigners blame petrostates whose economies depend on oil – the raw ingredient for plastics – for blocking the treaty negotiations.</p><p>This week, the <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/08/1165563\">UN is meeting</a> in Switzerland in the latest attempt to reach an agreement. But, even if the delegates find a way to cut the amount of plastic the world makes, it could take years to have a meaningful effect.</p><p>In the meantime, institutions like the World Bank are turning to the markets for alternative solutions. One of these is plastic offsetting.</p><p>So what is plastic offsetting? Does it work? And what do programmes like this mean for vulnerable communities who depend on plastic waste to make a living?</p><h2 id=\"what-is-plastic-offsetting-and-how-do-credits-work\">What is plastic offsetting, and how do credits work?</h2><p>Plastic credits are based on a similar idea to carbon credits.</p><p>With carbon credits, companies that emit greenhouse gases can pay a carbon credit company to have their emissions “cancelled out” by funding reforestation programmes or other projects to help “sink” their carbon output.</p><p>For each tonne of CO2 they cancel out, the company gets a carbon credit. This is how an airline can tell customers that their flight is “carbon neutral”.</p><p>Plastic credits work on a similar model. The world’s biggest plastic polluters can pay a plastic credit company to collect and re-purpose plastic.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>If a polluter pays for one tonne of plastic to be collected, it gets one plastic credit.</p><p>If the polluter buys the number of plastic credits equivalent to its annual plastic output, it might be awarded “plastic neutral” or “plastic net zero” status.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3873503\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3873503\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img

are already worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with their value set to grow to billions.</p><p>But in 2023, SourceMaterial, a nonprofit newsroom, <a href=\"https://www.source-material.org/vercompanies-carbon-offsetting-claims-inflated-methodologies-flawed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revealed</a> that only a fraction of nearly 100 million carbon credits result in real emissions reductions.</p><p>“Companies are making false claims and then they’re convincing customers that they can fly guilt-free or buy carbon-neutral products when they aren’t in any way carbon-neutral,” Barbara Haya, a US carbon trading expert, said at the time.</p><p>The same thing could happen with plastics. Analysis by SourceMaterial of the world’s first plastic credit registry, Plastic Credit Exchange (PCX) in the Philippines, found that only 14 percent of PCX credits went towards recycling.</p><p>While companies that had bought credits with PCX were getting “plastic neutral” status, most of the plastic was burned as fuel in cement factories, in a method known as “co-processing” that releases thousands of tonnes of CO2 and toxins linked to cancer.</p><p>A spokesperson for PCX said at the time that co-processing “reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and is conducted under controlled conditions to minimise emissions”.</p><p>Now, the World Bank is also pointing to plastic credits as a solution.</p><p>In January last year, the World Bank launched a $100m bond that “provides investors with a financial return” linked to the plastic credits projects backed by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, an industry initiative that supports plastic credit projects, in Ghana and Indonesia.</p><p>At the UN talks in December last year, a senior environmental specialist from the World Bank said plastic credits were an “emerging result-based financing tool” which can fund projects that “reduce plastic pollution”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-do-companies-think-of-plastic-credits\">What do companies think of plastic credits?</h2><p>Manufacturers, petrostates and the operators of credit projects have all lobbied for market solutions, including plastic credits, at the UN.</p><p>Oil giant ExxonMobil and petrochemicals companies LyondellBasell and Dow Chemical are all members of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste in Ghana and Indonesia – both epicentres of plastic pollution that produce plastic domestically and import waste from overseas.</p><p>But those companies are also members of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a lobby group that has warned the UN it does “not support production caps or bans”, given the “benefits of plastics”.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-critics-and-affected-local-communities-say\">What do critics and affected local communities say?</h2><p>Critics like Anil Verma, a professor of human resource management at the University of Toronto who has studied waste pickers in Brazil, call plastic offsetting a “game of greenwashing”.</p><p>Verma argues that offsetting lets polluters claim they are tackling the waste problem without having to cut production – or profit.</p><p>Patrick O’Hare, an academic at St Andrews University in Scotland, who has attended all rounds of the UN plastic treaty negotiations, said he has “noticed with concern the increasing prominence given to plastics credits”.</p><p>Plastic credits are being promoted in some quarters “despite the lack of proven success stories to date” and “the evident problems with the carbon credit model on which it is based”, he added.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3873494\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3873494\" class=\"wp-caption

plastic credits.</p><p>Nestle, which had previously bought plastic credits, said last year that it does not believe in their effectiveness in their current form.</p><p>Coca-Cola and Unilever are also “not convinced”, according to reports, and like Nestle, they back government-mandated “extended producer responsibility” schemes.</p><p>Yet the World Bank has plans to expand its support for plastic offsetting, calling it a “win-win with the local communities and ecosystems that benefit from less pollution”.</p><p>Some of the poorest people in Ghana eke out a living by collecting plastic waste for recycling.</p><p>Johnson <a href=\"/features/longform/2025/8/7/ghanas-waste-pickers-brave-mountains-of-plastic-and-big-industry\">Doe</a>, head of a refuse collectors’ group in the capital, Accra,

The US president, the White House said, was open to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/6/white-house-says-trump-is-open-to-talks-with-putin-and-zelenskyy\">meeting both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a>.</p><p>Trump, who during his re-election campaign had promised he would be able to end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours if he came to power, has so far <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/trump-says-he-is-not-happy-with-russias-putin-considering-sanctions\">failed to mediate a truce</a> despite months of hectic diplomacy, direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv, and phone calls with Putin.</p><p>Increasingly <a href=\"/news/2025/8/2/why-is-trump-moving-nuclear-submarines-after-spat-with-medvedev\">frustrated</a> by Putin’s unwillingness to agree to a pause in fighting without imposing conditions unacceptable to Ukraine or the West, Trump has threatened a new wave of <a href=\"/news/2025/7/8/trump-says-he-is-not-happy-with-russias-putin-considering-sanctions\">economic measures</a> punishing Russia if it does not accept a ceasefire.</p><p>Since Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US and its allies, including the United Kingdom and the European Union, have imposed more than 21,000 sanctions on Russia’s economy.</p><p>The new tariffs Trump has threatened are unlike any of those earlier sanctions, however. They target Russia by hitting out against its trading partners, in the hope that they will stop buying from or selling to Moscow.</p><p>But these secondary tariffs also carry risks for the US and its allies.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-secondary-tariffs-trump-is-threatening\">What are the secondary tariffs Trump is threatening?</h2><p>In mid-July, as peace talks stalled despite Trump’s efforts, the US president threatened Russia with 100 percent <a href=\"/news/2025/7/15/trump-threatens-tariffs-in-50-days-what-harm-will-it-do-to-russia\">secondary tariffs</a> if it did not work towards a ceasefire. He gave the Kremlin a 50-day deadline to cooperate.</p><p>After Moscow suggested that it wouldn’t bow to US pressure, Trump moved up the deadline, which now expires on August 8. It is unclear if Trump’s openness to talks with Putin and Zelenskyy following Witkoff’s Moscow visit has changed that deadline.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>On Wednesday, Trump doubled the tariff rate on Indian imports from 25 percent – which he had announced in late July – to 50 percent, as punishment for New Delhi’s refusal to stop buying Russian oil. That makes India the country facing the highest US tariffs at present – along with Brazil.</p><p>If Trump’s secondary tariffs go into effect, goods that the US imports from countries still trading with Russia would face duties of 100 percent on top of the tariffs Trump has already imposed on those nations.</p><p>That would at least double the price of those products, making them less competitive in the US market.</p><p>The idea behind these tariffs is to persuade Russia’s trading partners to stop buying and selling with the country, isolating its economy and depriving it of revenue it earns from exports, especially from energy.</p><p>Despite the sanctions it already faces, Russia has consistently earned more than 500 million euros ($580m) a day from energy exports since 2022. That will be disrupted if countries stop buying all oil and gas from Russia.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-could-trump-s-secondary-tariffs-hit\">Which countries could Trump’s secondary tariffs hit?</h2><p>The countries most affected by such secondary tariffs would be:</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li><strong>China:</strong> Russia’s most important ally, China is by far the largest consumer of its northern neighbour’s exports. In 2023, China bought almost a third of all Russian exports. It also bought almost half of Russia’s oil exports.</li>\n<li><strong>India:</strong> An old friend, India has been buying up large volumes of Russian crude since 2022, including almost 40 percent of Russia’s total oil exports in 2023. That year, 17 percent of Russia’s overall exports went to India. Trump had already imposed a 25 percent tariff on Indian goods. On Wednesday, he doubled that rate as punishment for India’s continued oil purchases from Russia.</li>\n<li><strong>Turkiye:</strong> The third-largest buyer of Russian energy, 8 percent of Russia’s exports in 2023 went to Turkiye. It is a NATO ally of the US.</li>\n</ul><p>Turkiye isn’t the only ally that could be hit if Trump truly targets all those who trade with Russia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"could-us-allies-be-hit\">Could US allies be hit?</h2><p>Pushing back against Western threats over its ties with Russia, India has pointed to the EU’s own trade with Moscow. And while that trade has plummeted since 2022, it is still substantial.</p><p>According to the EU, its total trade with Russia was worth 67.5 billion euros ($77.9bn) in 2024. India’s total trade with Russia in 2024-25, by contrast, was <a href=\"https://indianembassy-moscow.gov.in/overview.php#:~:text=Bilateral%20trade%20between%20India%20and,amounting%20to%20USD%2063.84%20billion.\">worth $68.7bn</a>.</p><p>The bloc still relies heavily on Russia for its liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies. In fact, its import of Russian LNG has been rising: In 2024, EU imports of Russian LNG were 9 percent higher than the year before.</p><p>Europe has already been hit with a 15 percent tariff from Trump. Will Trump punish his closest supporters to pressure Russia to end the war?</p><h2 id=\"could-the-us-face-risks-too\">Could the US face risks, too?</h2><p>It is not just allies – secondary tariffs on those who trade with Russia carry risks for the US itself, too.</p><p>Trump’s team is currently working on a trade deal with China, and those talks have led to a pause in a tariff war between the world’s two largest economies.</p><p>That detente would break down if Trump imposes 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods simply because Beijing also trades with Russia.</p><p>China, Europe and India are all major suppliers of goods to the US: If the cost of those products – from clothes to lamps to iPhones – doubles, American consumers will feel the pinch.</p><p>The US also buys chemicals, including uranium hexafluoride – used in uranium enrichment – from Russia.</p><h2 id=\"will-india-and-china-stop-buying-russian-energy\">Will India and China stop buying Russian energy?</h2><p>That looks unlikely. China continues to buy oil from Iran, despite US sanctions – and Russia is arguably its closest strategic partner.</p><p>India has also shown no sign of loosening its ties with Russia. Witkoff isn’t the only foreign envoy visiting Moscow at the moment. India’s national security adviser, Ajit Doval, is also in the Russian capital. India’s foreign minister, S Jaishankar, is expected to visit Russia later this month, and India has announced that it intends to host Putin later this year.</p><p>On Wednesday, India described Trump’s 50 percent tariff as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”, adding that its purchase of Russian oil was rooted in its desire for energy security for its 1.4 billion people.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The move caught most experts by surprise as New Delhi was one of the first to start trade negotiations with Washington, DC, and Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have repeatedly admired each other in public statements and called each other friends. Brazil is the only other country facing tariffs as high as India’s.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>“The breakdown of the trade negotiations was a surprise,” said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of strategy and research at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada.</p><p>“This is a very difficult moment, arguably the worst in many, many years in their relationship and puts India in a very small group of countries that find themselves without a deal and with the highest tariff rates. They now need some pragmatic path forward and need to find a way to rebuild trust,” Nadjibulla said.</p><p>While the 50 percent tariffs, set to kick in in three weeks, have come as a shock, there has been a series of events in the past few weeks that hinted at disagreements between the two countries.</p><p>Just last week, Trump threatened that he would penalise New Delhi for buying Russian oil and arms, venting his frustration over an impasse in trade talks and referred to both countries as “dead economies”.</p><h2 id=\"negotiations-deadlock\">Negotiations deadlock</h2><p>Last year, <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/south-central-asia/india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bilateral trade</a> between India and the US stood at approximately $212bn, with a trade gap of about $46bn in India’s favour. Modi has said in the past that he plans to more than double trade between the two countries to $500bn in the next five years.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>As part of the tariff negotiations, New Delhi had offered to remove levies from US industrial goods and said it would increase defence and energy purchases, the Reuters news agency reported. It also offered to scale back taxes on cars, despite a strong auto lobby at home pressuring it not to.</p><p>But it refused to remove duties from farm and dairy products, two politically sensitive sectors that employ hundreds of millions of predominantly poor Indians, and a stance similar to some other countries like Canada.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>There are also geopolitical layers to what was supposed to be a trade conversation, pointed out Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.</p><p>A very public one was the difference in perception on how the latest clash between India and archenemy Pakistan in May was brought to an end. Trump has repeatedly said that he mediated a ceasefire. India has repeatedly said that Trump had no role in bringing about a truce and has said that Modi and Trump never spoke during the conflict.</p><p>Pakistan, on the other hand, has said it will nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize and has so far walked away with deals with the US to explore its reserves of critical minerals and oil as its efforts to reset ties with the US play out after years of ambivalence under former US President Joe Biden, said Aamer.</p><p>All of this has caused unease for New Delhi, which is now trying to navigate a tough road. “This will test India’s foreign policy,” said Aamer, “and the question is if we will see it grow with the US even as it maintains its ties with Russia,” its longstanding defence and trade partner.</p><p>New Delhi has called Wednesday’s tariff “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable” and said its imports of Russian oil are based on its objective of securing the energy needs of its nation of 1.4 billion people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But beyond that, “India doesn’t want to look weak”, said Aamer. “India has this global standing, and Modi has this global standing, so it has to hold its own. It will maintain its stance that its national security is driving its foreign policy.”</p><p>Robert Rogowsky, a professor of international trade at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said he expected “very creative diplomacy” in the “near term” as India and the US try to reset ties despite tensions.</p><p>“Strong-arming individuals like Modi will inevitably lead to shifts and counter-shifts,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"adding-instability\">Adding instability</h2><p>For now, India can focus on strengthening its bilateral trade agreements, said Aamer, such as the one it <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/uk-and-india-sign-free-trade-agreement-during-modi-visit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signed with the United Kingdom</a> last month and another with the European Union, which is currently in the works.</p><p>India is also trying to stabilise relations with China –  just as Australia, Canada and Japan have done in recent months since Trump took office and hit allies with tariffs. Modi is planning to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit at the end of the month. It would be his first visit to China since the two countries had a face-off in 2020 in the Galwan River valley.</p><p>But the trade blow from the US also comes at a time when India has been trying to position itself as a manufacturing hub and as an option for businesses that were looking to add locations outside China.</p><p>In April, Apple, for instance, said all iPhones meant to be sold in the US would be <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/25/apple-to-move-assembly-of-us-phones-to-india-in-shift-away-from-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assembled in India</a> by next year. While electronics are exempt for now from the tariffs, a country with a 50 percent tariff tag on it is hardly attractive for business, and this just “adds to the instability and uncertainty that businesses were already feeling” because of all the Trump tariffs, Nadjibulla said.</p><p>“Trump has made it clear that he’s interested in onshoring rather than friend-shoring.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
