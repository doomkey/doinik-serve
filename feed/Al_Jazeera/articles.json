News reports said Tamura, a former high school football player, had a note that said he had CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is associated with head injury.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 1 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 2 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 3 of 4</span></article><article class=\"more-on__article\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list 4 of 4</span></article><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></div><p>New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said on July 28 that police had heard about Tamura’s mental health history from Las Vegas officials. She provided no further details.</p><p>News reports, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said Tamura had two mental health crisis “holds”, which allow someone to be held involuntarily for evaluation and treatment for up to 72 hours, in Nevada in 2022 and 2024.</p><p>Tisch said Tamura had a Nevada gun licence and used an AR-15 style assault rifle. Tamura legally purchased a revolver in June using his concealed carry permit, Tisch said. CBS and CNN published a photo of Tamura’s 2022 permit issued by Las Vegas police.</p><p>“Red flag” <a href=\"/news/2023/3/14/biden-issues-new-order-in-effort-to-curb-us-gun-violence\">laws</a> are intended to remove weapons from unstable people before a violent act occurs. Sometimes the laws have different names, such as “extreme risk protection orders” or, in Nevada, “high risk protection orders”.</p><p>The state attorney general does not list a mental health crisis hold as a reason for a high-risk protection order. Nevada’s law allows law enforcement or family members to ask a court to issue an order to temporarily remove a person’s firearms or the right to possess a gun if the person poses a threat to themselves or others.</p><p>We asked the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department if it had taken steps to use that law to remove Tamura’s access to firearms and received no reply to that question.</p><p>Nevada’s high-risk protection orders are part of a growing number of state laws that aim to prevent firearm injuries and deaths.</p><p>The Nevada law has been little used since it took effect in 2020. Experts said it’s not unusual for states to implement their red flag laws slowly, with some exceptions. Florida, for example, issued about 2,500 orders during the first 18 months after its 2018 law went into effect, said Veronica Pear, an expert on violence prevention and University of California, Davis assistant professor.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-red-flag-laws\">What are red flag laws?</h2><p>Twenty-one states and Washington, DC, have passed red flag laws since 1999, many with Republican support.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>State laws specify who can start a civil petition process to remove or restrict access to weapons. Some states allow only law enforcement to request the orders. Other states allow family members or close contacts, such as coworkers or teachers, to file a petition. Most petitions are filed by law enforcement and are usually granted by courts.</p><p>The application used by Nevada law enforcement asks the petitioner whether the person has a firearm and requests a detailed description of conduct and acts of high-risk behaviour.</p><p>Nevada has weeklong and longer-term orders. The seven-day order comes after a hearing in which only one party’s argument for action has been heard. An extended order can last up to a year.</p><p>The 2022 <a href=\"/news/2022/6/25/president-biden-signs-first-major-federal-gun-reform-in-decades\">Bipartisan Safer Communities Act</a>, signed by former President Joe Biden, provided funding for states to implement red flag laws.</p><p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness said when “appropriately implemented, these laws can be lifesaving”. The organisation also said it is a harmful stereotype to link mental illness and violence.</p><p>About 3 percent to 5 percent of violent acts are committed by people with serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression. People living with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than members of the general population.</p><h2 id=\"nevada-s-red-flag-law\">Nevada’s red flag law</h2><p>Nevada Democratic State Representative Sandra Jauregui, who was at a 2017 music festival where a gunman killed 58 people, sponsored Nevada’s 2020 law.</p><p>Former Governor Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, signed the legislation, which Republicans opposed. Former Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the current Republican governor, campaigned in 2022 on a promise to “remove antiquated laws”, including Nevada’s red flag law. But the law remains on the books with Democrats controlling the Legislature.</p><p>Nationwide, these laws have been used more than 49,000 times through 2023, Everytown for Gun Safety found.</p><p>Law enforcement attitudes and knowledge about red flag laws can affect how often they are used. Florida, New York, California and Connecticut filed orders a few thousand times each year.</p><p>Nevada got off to a slow start, but has increased its use of the law in recent years.</p><p>The Nevada attorney general’s website shows 28 high-risk protection orders in 2024, and 20 in 2023. An office spokesperson said there were six orders so far in 2025.</p><h2 id=\"are-red-flag-laws-effective\">Are red flag laws effective?</h2><p>Analyses about whether red flag laws work as intended are mixed.</p><p>The Rand Corp, a nonprofit public policy research organisation, reviewed studies about red flag laws in July 2024. Researchers found that evidence of the laws’ effects on mass shootings and violent crime was inconclusive, and limited for suicide.</p><p>Most of the laws have been implemented in the past decade, Rand found, so it is difficult to determine the effects of the laws. Also, there are state and local differences in how often the laws are used.</p><p>Other researchers point to studies showing some benefits of red flag laws in reducing crime or suicide.</p><p>In an August 2024 study, Columbia University public health researchers found that Florida’s red flag gun law, passed in response to the 2018 Parkland mass shooting, was associated with an 11 percent reduction in firearm homicide rates from 2019 to 2021. One of the authors said the study did not find a significant reduction in firearm suicides and called for further study.</p><p>Extreme risk protection orders are one important law in a network of laws that work to prevent people who may harm themselves or others from accessing firearms, Pear, the University of California, Davis professor, told PolitiFact in 2022. “But there are other laws that are supported by evidence as well, such as prohibiting the purchase and possession of firearms after a violent misdemeanour conviction, waiting periods and firearm licensing laws.”</p><p><em>Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this article.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

But now, herders report that precipitation patterns have grown unpredictable, diminishing the grass available for their yaks.</p><p>“Earlier, it used to snow and rain, but now it has reduced a lot,” the 32-year-old says. “Even the winters are getting warmer than before.”</p><p>In Ladakh, a region near Tibet that once formed part of the ancient Silk Route, women primarily handle the herding, milking, and wool gathering – labour that remains largely manual.</p><p>In a neighbouring valley, 73-year-old Kunzias Dolma prepares yak milk tea and inspects her yak butter while simultaneously spinning her Buddhist prayer wheel with her right hand.</p><p>Unrelated to Tsering Dolma, she has dedicated her life to working with yaks, spending countless hours creating products from their milk and crafting blankets from their wool.</p><p>“We wake up early morning, about 5am every day,” she says. “My husband and I milk the yaks and do all of the other yak-related work until about lunch.

We have been doing this all our life.”</p><p>This traditional lifestyle now faces dual threats: Climate change making Ladakh increasingly inhospitable for yaks, and younger generations pursuing alternative livelihoods.</p><p>Rising temperatures and irregular rainfall have made nutritious vegetation scarcer while subjecting the shaggy, cold-adapted animals to greater physical stress.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>At the transit camp in Islam Qala in western Afghanistan, Fatima steps out of the bus into the blazing heat and an uncertain future. She is one of 10,000 people who has arrived from Iran that day and one of 800,000 who has arrived over the last six months. She hurries her three children to an empty spot, slumps onto the dusty ground, and shelters her family with bed sheets. When asked where she goes from here, she says a brother might take them in in her home town.</p><p>The IFRC supports the Afghan Red Crescent Society to provide hot food and healthcare at the camp. UN agencies provide some cash. But within a day, it’s time to leave. Bus drivers call out the names of Afghan cities and towns. Fatima lugs her cases towards a bus to Owbeh, in Herat province. Her three children trail behind her. She explains that she learned carpet weaving in Iran, but wasn’t allowed to bring any materials or instruments with her. How can she start from scratch without money, she asks. And who would buy her carpets in her village anyway? They have nothing. Not even to eat.</p><p>The departure from Iran has been traumatic, but her real challenges start now. When she arrives in her hometown, there will be no jobs in the public sector for her. Men will be reluctant to hire her because of the rules and regulations associated with employing women. Her one chance to cope will be to get her own enterprise going. For that, she’ll need start-up capital. She may also need assistance from her brother to access markets. It will be a struggle, but increasing numbers of Afghan women are rising to this challenge. Fatima could, too. If only she could get access to credit.</p><p>But will anyone in her community be able to buy her products? Like most Afghans, her neighbours will largely depend on agriculture, which will depend on irrigation and rain. In much of Herat province, and across the country, irrigation is becoming impossible because of drought. Rivers are dust. Underground water sources are drying up. With no possibility to farm, men are pouring into the cities in search of daily labour, only to find the battle for water is raging there, too. Mercy Corps has claimed that half of the boreholes in Kabul have dried out and the city could run out of accessible groundwater in five years. This trajectory could be slowed down or reversed, but only with major investment in water conservation, rain vats, storage dams, and check dams. Just the sort of investment that Afghanistan is struggling to raise.</p><p>If Fatima can earn a little money and live close to water, then she can focus on her children’s schooling. Her daughter will have to attend a madrassa. This will be a significant downgrade from her education in Iran. But if she’s lucky, it will be one of the many madrassas that are already introducing more varied subjects and offering classes until 12th grade. If she’s resourceful and can invest some funds, there may be other options too, including vocational training and online courses. The restrictions she will have to navigate are extreme, but not new. They reflect a long-running struggle between cities and the countryside, between desires for self-realisation and deeply rooted patriarchy. Foreign aid may help by quietly creating multiple and flexible opportunities to exchange and learn, while recognising that the ideological battles are for the Afghans themselves and will take time. Some organisations are trying to do this, but not to scale.</p><p>It will take a lot of luck for Fatima to get investment in her social enterprise, to access clean drinking water and to get an education for her children. The alternative is grim, and sadly, much more likely. Like most new arrivals, she will probably be destitute within weeks. She won’t access the rare opportunities for business support. Lack of water will empty the villages around her. If she stays put, her health will fail. Medical care will be too far to reach or too expensive. She may be forced to marry her daughter off early and nudge her boys away from school into some cheap, daily labour. This is what is happening across the country. If she can, to avoid such a terrible fate, she will try to get back to Iran.</p><p>Can foreign aid play a role in supporting Fatima and the millions like her? Despite all the reservations, humanitarian funding has been generous in the last four years. More than $7bn has been spent on assistance. Enough to have helped tens of thousands of women to start small businesses. Enough to have irrigated farms, deepened bore holes and stored water across the country. Enough to have created thousands of alternative learning options for children. Humanitarian agencies have tried to assist in all these areas, but the demand for emergency relief has taken the bulk of the funds, and many donors have been reticent to invest in anything longer term for fear of appearing to legitimise those in power.</p><p>The need for a new approach is compelling. There is less money available now due to aid cuts, but what little is left can still be invested into locally led strategies for livelihoods, water infrastructure, health and learning. This may give people like Fatima a spark of hope in their futures. This is what IFRC will focus on, as much as its resources allow.</p><p>If the moral case for that is not compelling enough, it is worth reflecting that on the current trajectory, the historic repatriation to Afghanistan taking place this year is likely to be a prelude to a much bigger exodus in the years to come. It would be far wiser to invest now and give people a chance to thrive in their home country than to invest much more in refugee camps and anti-trafficking work in the near future.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Equally though, it could be “a grip-and-grin style summit, where nothing substantive is discussed”, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Sampson added that US-China negotiations are more complex than those with other Asian countries, owing to China’s grip on rare earth minerals, in addition to the fact that China “has long been a target of Trump’s”.</p><p>For now, Sampson said he believes that the “mood around the [Sweden] talks seems more positive than earlier this year. Both sides, it seems, have stepped back from the brink”.

A 30 percent combined tariff will, however, be applied, following an agreed pause until August 12. That followed an earlier escalation to a 145 percent tariff on imports.</p><h2 id=\"taiwan\">Taiwan</h2><p>Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te has called its 20 percent tariff announced by Trump “temporary … with the possibility of further reductions should an agreement be reached”.</p><p>The US president had threatened to hit the island with a 32 percent tax and possible duties on its huge semiconductor shipments.</p><h2 id=\"japan\">Japan</h2><p>A tariff of 15 percent agreed last week between Japan and Washington – down from a threatened 25 percent – is due to be applied from August 7.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“We continue to urge the US to take prompt measures to implement the agreement, including lowering tariffs on automobile and auto parts,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Friday.</p><p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ), however, warned that profits of Japanese firms are likely to fall this year because of US tariffs, leading them to downgrade capital expenditure plans.</p><p>Automakers have swallowed the rising costs from the tariffs instead of passing them on to US consumers, as seen in a fall of roughly 20 percent in export prices since April, the BOJ said in a full version of its quarterly outlook report.</p><p>“This suggests Japanese automakers are averting price hikes that may lead to falling sales volume, at the cost of seeing profitability worsen,” the BOJ added.</p><h2 id=\"south-korea\">South Korea</h2><p>The US tariff on South Korean imports will be 15 percent, Trump said on Wednesday, down from a threatened 25 percent. But there is no written agreement yet on a trade deal, the Asian nation’s trade minister said on Friday.</p><p>Speaking to reporters as he arrived home from a visit to Washington, Minister Yeo Han-koo said the two sides had an oral negotiation because of time constraints.</p><p>“What we felt during this negotiation is that the US trade environment is fundamentally changing. This is completely different from the first Trump term,” Yeo said of the deal.</p><p>“I think we are entering a new normal era. So, although we have overcome this crisis, we cannot be relieved, because we do not know when we will face pressure from tariffs or non-tariff measures again.”</p><h2 id=\"malaysia\">Malaysia</h2><p>Malaysia’s Trade Ministry has said its rate, down from a threatened 25 percent, was a positive outcome without compromising on what it called “red line” items.</p><h2 id=\"thailand\">Thailand</h2><p>Thailand’s finance minister said the reduction from 36 to 19 percent in tariffs, would help his country’s struggling economy face global challenges ahead.</p><p>“It helps maintain Thailand’s competitiveness on the global stage, boosts investor confidence and opens the door to economic growth, increased income and new opportunities,” Pichai Chunhavajira said.</p><h2 id=\"cambodia\">Cambodia</h2><p>The US on Friday slashed the tariff rate for Cambodia to 19 percent from earlier levies of 36 percent and 49 percent, a major boost for its crucial garments sector, its biggest economic driver and source of about a million manufacturing jobs.</p><p>“If the US maintained 49 percent or 36 percent, that industry would collapse, in my opinion,” Cambodia’s Deputy Prime Minister and top trade negotiator Sun Chanthol told the Reuters news agency in an interview.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"european-union\">European Union</h2><p>The EU’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, said the bloc’s exporters now benefit from a “more competitive position” following a framework agreement between the EU and the US, although he added that “the work continues.</p><p>“The new US tariffs reflect the first results of the EU-US deal, especially the 15 percent all-inclusive tariff cap,” Sefcovic wrote in a post on social media platform X.</p><p>“This reinforces stability for businesses as well as trust in the transatlantic economy,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"switzerland\">Switzerland</h2><p>Switzerland expressed “great regret” that it was hit with 39 percent – up from the threatened 31 percent – despite its “very constructive position”.</p><p>The levy – more than double the EU’s 15 percent – appeared to catch the rich Alpine nation off guard.</p><p>Switzerland ranks sixth in terms of direct investment in the US, with pharma giants Roche and Novartis announcing major spending plans in recent months.</p><p>Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis said on Friday that his country will continue to strive for an agreement with the US. “We are not discouraged and continue to strive for an agreement in the interests of both sides,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"sri-lanka\">Sri Lanka</h2><p>Sri Lanka expressed relief that it will face a 20 percent hit – a sharp reduction from the 44 percent originally floated – and expressed hope of a further cut.</p><p>“We are happy that our competitiveness in exports to the US has been retained,” Finance Ministry official Harshana Suriyapperuma told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"bangladesh\">Bangladesh</h2><p>Bangladesh negotiated a 20 percent tariff on exports to the US, down from the 37 percent initially proposed by Trump.</p><p>Muhammad Yunus, the head of the country’s interim government, called it a “decisive diplomatic victory”.</p><h2 id=\"pakistan\">Pakistan</h2><p>Pakistan secured a tariff rate of 19 percent with the US on Thursday.</p><p>“This deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration, especially in energy, mines and minerals, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors,” the Pakistani Finance Ministry said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"india\">India</h2><p>Trump on Wednesday said Indian goods would face a 25 percent US tariff starting August 1, slightly below an earlier threatened level.</p><p>The country would also face an unspecified “penalty” over New Delhi’s purchases of Russian weapons and energy, Trump said on social media.</p><p>India is engaged in trade talks with the US, an Indian government source with knowledge of the discussions told the Reuters news agency on Friday.</p><p>“We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"south-africa\">South Africa</h2><p>South Africa will use the weeklong delay in the US’s imposition of 30 percent tariffs to negotiate, to avoid the penalty and save jobs, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday.</p><p>“Intensive negotiations are now under way,” Ramaphosa told journalists.</p><p>“Our task is to negotiate as strongly and as hard as we can with the United States,” he said. “Our objective, really, is to save jobs.”</p><h2 id=\"australia\">Australia</h2><p>Australian products could become more competitive in the US market, helping businesses boost exports, Trade Minister Don Farrell said.</p><p>Trump has the minimum tariff rate of 10 percent for Australia.</p><h2 id=\"canada\">Canada</h2><p>Trump said on Thursday that the US would raise tariffs on certain Canadian goods from 25 percent to 35 percent.</p><p>He had warned of trade consequences for Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September.</p><p>Unlike the new levies hitting dozens of other economies, there is no delay, and these begin on Friday, according to a White House fact sheet.</p><p>Carney said his government is “disappointed” by Trump’s decision.</p><p>Trump’s order also cited Canada’s failure to “cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs” as well as its “retaliation” against his measures.</p><p>Carney outlined Ottawa’s efforts to crack down on fentanyl and to increase border security. “Canada accounts for only 1 percent of US fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,” he said.</p><p>Products covered by the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – which covers a wide swath of items – will, however, be exempt from the tariff rate.</p><h2 id=\"markets\">Markets</h2><p>European stocks hit a three-week low as investors worried about the effect of the new US levies on dozens of countries.</p><p>Asian shares were also headed for the worst week since April after the tariffs were announced.</p><p>Oil prices have, however, changed very little, heading for a weekly gain.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

According to Oxfam, this figure exceeds the total wealth of approximately 750 million Africans, roughly half of the continent’s population.</p><p data-start=\"402\" data-end=\"549\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Moreover, the top 5 percent of Africans now control nearly $4 trillion in wealth, more than double the combined assets of the remaining 95 percent.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"509\">Titled Africa’s Inequality Crisis and the Rise of the Super‑Rich, the report profiles the four wealthiest individuals on the continent. At number one is Aliko Dangote of Nigeria, estimated to be worth $23.3bn. Next is Johann Rupert and his family from South Africa, with about $14.2bn in wealth. Following them are Nicky Oppenheimer and his family, also South African, with a fortune of $10.2bn. Finally, Egyptian Nassef Sawiris holds approximately $9.4bn in net worth.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"932\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">I find myself among the bottom 95 percent, the hopeful yet under‑resourced individuals who have laboured for modest incomes while yearning for socioeconomic transformation. At the dawn of the 21st century, in 2000, Africa had no billionaires. Today it is home to 23 billionaires, predominantly male, whose combined wealth has soared by 56 percent over the past five years, reaching an astounding $112.6bn.</p><p data-start=\"44\" data-end=\"281\">Today, no two nations better illustrate Africa’s stark wealth disparity and oligarchic dominance than Nigeria and South Africa, and no business leader exemplifies the rise of crony capitalism on the continent more than Aliko Dangote.</p><p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"299\">Here is why.</p><p data-start=\"301\" data-end=\"340\">Twenty‑five years ago, Dangote was simply an ambitious multimillionaire businessman. Then, on February 23, 1999, he made a substantial donation to General Olusegun Obasanjo’s presidential campaign. That seemingly benign investment proved decisive for his business trajectory.</p><p data-start=\"342\" data-end=\"379\">A year later, the Obasanjo administration embarked on a sweeping privatisation of state‑owned enterprises, aiming to liberalise the economy, attract private investment and foster domestic entrepreneurship under the Backward Integration Policy (BIP). Dangote acquired Benue Cement in 2000 and Obajana Cement in 2002, laying the foundations for Dangote Cement, now Africa’s largest cement producer.</p><p data-start=\"381\" data-end=\"418\">Between 2010 and 2015, Dangote Cement reportedly paid an effective tax rate of less than 1 percent on profits of approximately 1 trillion Nigerian naira (about $6bn at 2015 exchange rates). Dangote himself became Nigeria’s richest entrepreneur in 2007, attaining billionaire status amid the company’s rapid expansion.</p><p data-start=\"420\" data-end=\"457\">Since then, the quid pro quo strategies between Dangote and the Obasanjo administration have become a conventional aspect of Nigerian politics and business, albeit a controversial one.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"459\" data-end=\"496\">Critics argue that the BIP has stifled competition and fostered monopolistic practices in key sectors like sugar and cement, disproportionately benefitting politically connected elites – including Dangote – at the expense of smaller enterprises and ordinary Nigerians.</p><p data-start=\"2476\" data-end=\"2935\">Nigeria is richly endowed with natural resources and possesses world-class human capital. Nevertheless, more than 112 million people, nearly half of Nigeria’s population, live in poverty, based on the most recent population estimates of around 227 million. At the same time, the country’s five wealthiest individuals, dominating sectors such as oil and gas, banking, telecommunications, and real estate, have amassed a combined fortune of $29.9bn.</p><p data-start=\"2937\" data-end=\"3194\">The dysfunctional system that has enabled Nigeria’s “big five” entrepreneurs and fostered oligarchic patterns is not unique to Nigeria. South Africa, Africa’s most industrialised nation, confronts similar but distinct challenges in its post-apartheid era.</p><p data-start=\"3196\" data-end=\"3526\">After apartheid ended on April 27, 1994, the African National Congress (ANC) introduced Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and Broad-Based BEE initiatives (BBBEE). These policies aimed to advance the effective participation of Black people in the economy, achieve higher growth, increase employment and ensure fairer income distribution.</p><p data-start=\"3528\" data-end=\"3908\">However, over time, the ANC itself acknowledged that these affirmative action programs have not appreciably benefitted most Black South Africans, especially Black women. In the 31 years since apartheid, economic conditions have only marginally improved. While a few Black business leaders have emerged, they continue to succeed within a system engineered to favour a narrow elite.</p><p data-start=\"3910\" data-end=\"4427\">One such example is Patrice Motsepe, a mining magnate and among Africa’s richest individuals, with an estimated net worth of approximately $3bn. Supporters view him as a tangible beneficiary of post-apartheid economic transformation, but critics, including economist Moeletsi Mbeki, argue that his wealth reflects crony capitalism rather than broad-based entrepreneurship. Motsepe, who is also the brother-in-law of President Cyril Ramaphosa, remains a rare exception in a system marked by elite capture.</p><p data-start=\"4429\" data-end=\"4771\">By April 2025, South Africa’s official unemployment rate stood at 32.9 percent, equating to about 8.2 million people actively seeking work, while the broader rate, including discouraged jobseekers, rose to 43.1 percent. Around the same time, approximately 34.3 million South Africans, or more than half the population, were living in poverty.</p><p data-start=\"4773\" data-end=\"5188\">Meanwhile, the Oppenheimer family, whose immense fortune in diamond mining has deep historical roots tied to South Africa’s colonial past, continues to expand its wealth. A Harvard Growth Lab study published in November 2023 concluded that three decades after the end of apartheid, the economy is defined by stagnation and exclusion, and current strategies are not achieving inclusion and empowerment in practice.</p><p data-start=\"5190\" data-end=\"5490\">Unsurprisingly, the most prominent beneficiaries of BEE initiatives have been ANC insiders and aligned business elites, including President Ramaphosa, former Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale, Saki Macozoma, a former ANC MP, and Bridgette Radebe, sister to Motsepe and wife of ANC stalwart Jeff Radebe.</p><p data-start=\"5492\" data-end=\"5799\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">This distinct class of elites starkly contrasts with BEE’s intended beneficiaries, everyday South Africans. Instead, these individuals are grappling with the lingering consequences of oligarchic state capture, widespread corruption, poor service delivery, and sustained cuts to education and health budgets.</p><p data-start=\"84\" data-end=\"564\">Nigeria shares this pattern. At the very least, Dangote’s vast wealth should represent the pinnacle of success in a thriving African economy. Instead, he exemplifies Africa’s most prominent and wealthiest oligarch, demonstrating how proximity to political power can create controversial paths to fortune. Regrettably, almost every African country has its own Dangote or Motsepe whose influence hinders fair and inclusive economic development.</p><p data-start=\"566\" data-end=\"903\">Crony capitalism is a sharp break from free market ideals, where political connections override merit and innovation. This distortion breeds corruption, economic inefficiency and social inequality. It also weakens democratic norms by allowing private interests to gain excessive influence over public policy.</p><p data-start=\"905\" data-end=\"1293\">A 2015 study by Columbia University concluded that wealth accumulated by politically connected oligarchs has a strongly negative impact on economic growth, while the fortunes of unconnected billionaires have little effect. This finding suggests African economies could grow more rapidly if the enormous influence of politically connected elites was curtailed.</p><p data-start=\"1295\" data-end=\"1337\">Now is the time for meaningful reform.</p><p data-start=\"1339\" data-end=\"1497\">African nations must implement a wealth tax on high-net-worth individuals and direct the revenue towards essential services in impoverished areas.</p><p data-start=\"1499\" data-end=\"1806\">According to Oxfam, a modest tax increase consisting of a 1 percent levy on wealth and a 10 percent income tax on the richest individuals could generate $66bn annually, equivalent to 2.29 percent of Africa’s gross domestic product, and help close critical funding gaps in education and electricity access.</p><p data-start=\"1808\" data-end=\"1937\">Above all, African countries must adopt economic policies focused on equity to reduce poverty and improve wellbeing.</p><p data-start=\"1939\" data-end=\"2017\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">We, the neglected and disenfranchised 95 percent, stand against oligarchy.</p><p data-start=\"1939\" data-end=\"2017\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In June, in the centre of Torun, central-north Poland, a Venezuelan man stabbed 24-year-old Klaudia, a Polish woman, to death as she was walking home from work through a park.</p><p>That horrific incident led to a silent march by thousands of protesters through Torun on Sunday, July 6. Local media reported that the march had been organised by supporters of the far-right Konfederacja political alliance and people carried signs saying “stop illegal immigration”.</p><p>Then came the rumours and misinformation. On July 14, someone in Walbrzych, southwestern Poland, called the police to report a Paraguayan man who had allegedly taken pictures of children on a playground.</p><p>The police stopped the man but did not find anything incriminating on his phone. That didn’t stop two Polish men from beating him up soon afterwards. And, the next day, a group of about 50 people stormed the hostel he and other migrants were living in. Some people threw flares into the building, and the owner has since been forced to close the hostel down.</p><p>In recent weeks, anti-migrant sentiment in Poland has been on the rise, spurred by far-right rhetoric, which asserts that Poland has been flooded with “unconstrained illegal migration”. Claims that migrants take local jobs and that they pose a threat to Poles both physically and figuratively, with their “foreign lifestyle”, are common and even encouraged by lawmakers.</p><p>One MP from Konfederacja – Konrad Berkowicz from Krakow – told TOK FM radio: “Xenophobia is an important element of our national unity. Condemning xenophobia and stifling it in the West has led to rapes and terrorist acts, that’s why we should cherish xenophobia.”</p><p>Elmi Abdi, 62, a Somali who came to Poland in 1996 as a refugee, told Al Jazeera: “Today, migrants are seen as responsible for all of Poland’s problems; we are scapegoats that all parties attack, even though politicians know it’s all untrue.” Today, Abdi is head of the Good Start foundation, which supports migrants, offering help with access to language classes, legal assistance and other matters.</p><p>“It is sad because we [immigrants] do everything to work safely here, pay taxes, and integrate into society.”</p><p>As misinformation – such as in the Walbrzych incident – about immigrants spreads, the Polish Migration Forum, a rights group, has called the atmosphere in Poland “pre-pogrom-like”.</p><p>“What distinguishes today’s situation is the violence. We are in a very bad place,” said Agnieszka Kosowicz, head of the forum. “Acts of violence already take place, people are subject to insults, threats and displays of hostility and contempt. This is a very alarming situation that requires a decisive response from the state.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3867404\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3867404\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3867404\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25202530527656-1-1753963975.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Belarus border\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3867404\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Border guard officers stand guard at the Polish-Belarusian border, in Polowce, Poland, on Monday, July 21, 2025 [Czarek Sokolowski/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"rumours-of-illegal-returns\">Rumours of ‘illegal returns’</h2><p>On July 7, Poland reinstated border controls with Germany and Lithuania.

These are people who arrived in Poland from outside the EU before crossing to Germany.</p><p>These returns of migrants by the German authorities are legal, but as rumours on the internet about “illegal returns” of migrants continue to spread, unofficial, far-right patrols have appeared at the borders to monitor the situation and make “citizen arrests” of individuals they believe to be entering the country illegally – so far without much success.</p><p>The EU <a href=\"/news/2021/11/21/poland-says-belarus-still-bringing-migrants-to-its-border\">accused</a> Belarusian and Russian authorities of fomenting the EU’s migration crisis to destabilise the continent, by encouraging people from the Global South to travel to Belarus and then onwards into Europe via Poland.</p><p>In 2022, Poland built a fence along the border with Belarus to prevent migrants from entering the country irregularly. The fence, however, did little to physically stop migrants from coming in.</p><p>So, in March this year, Poland suspended the right to claim asylum altogether in a bid to deter people from coming.</p><p>All of this has served to stir up anti-migrant fear in Poland, which has been further amplified by far-right groups for their own political purposes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3854179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3854179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Far-right-groups-on-Saturday-march-through-central-Krakow-1753342339.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Anti-migrant protests in Poland\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3854179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Far-right groups march through central Krakow on Saturday, July 19 [Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"we-are-being-humiliated\">‘We are being humiliated’</h2><p>The hysteria reached a new high nearly two weeks ago, when, on Saturday, July 19, anti-migrant marches organised by the far-right Konfederacja party and football fans swept through 80 Polish towns and cities, shouting racist slurs and slogans.</p><p>Sixteen-year-old Nikola, who did not want to give her surname, told Al Jazeera that she had travelled 125km (80 miles) from her home in Gorlice, southern Poland, to attend the march in Krakow. She said she came along after watching videos on YouTube claiming that, in Western Europe, people are “afraid to leave their homes” because of the number of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>She said it was important to her to join a cause that “unites Poles today”.</p><p>“I wanted to be part of a community. People are showing those at the top that they care about security and that Poland is our country. We should do everything we can to prevent what’s happening in Western Europe,” she said.</p><p>“I’d like to feel safe in my city, and I’ve already seen a few people who looked like they are not from here,” she added.</p><p>On the march, Nikola joined a large column of several hundred people, many of them wearing Polish patriotic T-shirts and emblems of the Wisla football club, walking to Market Square. On the way, they passed tourists, some of whom were filming the protesters.</p><p>Three elderly women proudly waved white-and-red Polish flags among the football fans. “The nation has had enough of what’s happening. It’s waking up because we’re living under terror, being humiliated,” said Danuta, 60, who also did not want to give her full name. “The borders are not sealed and have to be defended by civilians,” she added, referring to the right-wing groups who patrol the Polish-German border.</p><p>On Market Square in the centre of the city, the march crossed paths with a smaller counterdemonstration organised by local left-wing groups, and the two groups exchanged insults while separated by the police.</p><p>The police did not record any major incidents during the day. But Abdi and other migrants Al Jazeera spoke with by telephone said they did not dare to leave their homes on Saturday.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3867418\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3867418\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3867418\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25200488216520-1-1753964344.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Krakow demo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3867418\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police officers try to separate and secure a small group of counter-demonstrators who attempt to block an anti-immigration demonstration in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday, July 19, 2025 [Czarek Sokolowski/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fake-news-fans-the-flames\">Fake news fans the flames</h2><p>According to experts, anti-migrant sentiment in Poland has been spurred by misinformation and fake news about the number of people entering the country, which does not reflect reality.</p><p>“Poland is not experiencing any large-scale irregular migration,” said Kosowicz. “Within the Dublin procedure [under EU rules], Germany returns people who claimed asylum in Poland and then crossed into Germany. In 2024, there were 688 such people, and this year – 318. This is nothing new.”</p><p>According to the International Migration Outlook report for 2024 from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2.2 percent of Poland’s population was foreign-born in 2023. This is low compared with other European countries such as the UK (15.4 percent), Germany (18.2 percent) and France (13.8 percent).</p><p>In 2022, 152,000 immigrants obtained residence permits for more than one year in Poland, the OECD said.</p><p>At the Polish-Belarusian border, which has been used by migrants from Global South countries trying to reach Europe since 2021, incoming numbers of migrants have not been particularly high, either. According to official data, from January to late June this year, 15,022 illegal crossing attempts were recorded, of which only 5 percent were successful.</p><p>In 2024, there were nearly 30,000 attempts, out of which, by contrast, one-third (10,900) were successful. In 2021, before Poland built a fence at the border with Belarus, the number of attempts reached 52,000.</p><p>Kosowicz also blames the government, which she says has failed to build awareness about the costs and benefits of development and migration, making all foreigners potential victims of hate attacks.</p><p>“A study by Deloitte and UNHCR says that 2.7 percent of Polish GDP comes solely from the work of Ukrainian refugees. But this isn’t the information we hear from politicians,” she said.</p><p>Abdi, who is married to a Polish woman with whom he has two children, worries greatly about their future.</p><p>“When I arrived here, the Poles welcomed me wonderfully, and I care deeply about Poland; it’s my home. I want it to be safe for everyone,” he told Al Jazeera in fluent Polish.</p><p>“At the marches, people shout that they want a white Poland. I’m old enough, I’m not afraid of anything. But I am worried about my children.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
