The next thing he knew, Himanshu Pal, 21, stood there, helpless, looking over the body of his colleague, rammed by a car.</p><p>His friend, Ankush, was “just 18, and just out of high school,” Pal told Al Jazeera. It was Ankush’s first day in a metropolitan city, after he came from his village in eastern Bihar, more than 1,000km (600 miles) away; he rented a cheap electric bike and signed up with Swiggy, one of India’s quick commerce giants.</p><p>Ankush packed his first order and tried to figure out how to reach the location – mandatorily within 10 minutes – when Pal held his hand and showed him the way around the app. “He was trying his best: looking at the phone, then on the road, a customer calling back; then on the phone, a traffic light, and then on the road again,” Pal recalled, from October last year.</p><p>“That was all.

Workers ride long hours outdoors in extreme heat, alongside deadly exposure to toxic air in cities like Delhi and Bengaluru. Payouts are influenced by a star-based rating system, which means that riders can’t push back against misbehaving customers.</p><p>In early January, the Indian government intervened and asked all quick commerce platforms to stop promising “10-minute deliveries” after a nationwide strike by the gig workers over dangerous working conditions.</p><p>But experts and workers toiling within India’s mammoth quick commerce engine say that the reality remains largely unchanged — the intense competition for speedy deliveries means that with or without a formal 10-minute promise, riders are under pressure to do whatever it takes to get packages to customers as fast as possible.</p><p>“The Indian middle class is literally riding on the back of the poor,” said Vandana Vasudevan, the author of OTP Please!, a 2025 book on the lives of gig workers. “They sit at home, and are extremely pampered by this rather innovative tech model,” she told Al Jazeera, “but all these privileges are coming at the cost of workers.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4248764\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4248764\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248764\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2021-07-13T111814Z_853912162_RC2KJO944EB1_RTRMADP_3_ZOMATO-IPO-1768732554.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C528&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gig worker\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4248764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Delivery workers of Zomato, an Indian food-delivery startup, check their phones as they wait to collect orders outside a restaurant in Kolkata, India, on July 13, 2021 [Rupak De Chowduri/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"rise-of-10-minute-delivery\">Rise of 10-minute delivery</h2><p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, which paved the path for digitising grocery services in India, quick commerce platforms have leveraged small “dark stores” — a warehouse exclusively meant to store goods for online shopping — in neighbourhoods to deliver thousands of products, from groceries and skincare to the latest iPhone.</p><p>As companies like Walmart’s Flipkart, Swiggy, or IPO-bound Zepto raced for even faster deliveries, they also redefined how urban India bought into the psychological appeal of instant gratification. Where many Indians previously planned and purchased, a <a href=\"https://ijsred.com/volume8/issue5/IJSRED-V8I5P142.pdf\">study</a> last year found that quick commerce had turned several of them into more impulsive buyers.</p><p>India’s gig economy, a $11.5bn market, has been ballooning: gig workers are projected to rise from 7.7 million in 2021 to 23.5 million by 2030, according to Niti Aayog, a government think tank.</p><p>In the last financial year, quick commerce platforms had a record-high year, with gross orders worth $7bn, more than double the previous year. The sector has been an investment darling, recording a staggering 142 percent compound annual growth rate from 2022.</p><p>But driving this apparent success story are two darker demographic factors, say experts. Middle-class neighbourhoods in Indian cities, while crammed together, are often segregated communities, making it easier for companies to rent a cheap warehouse near a posh locality. Meanwhile, the gap between the rich and the poor has reached a historic high, visible in everything from stagnant wages to the concentration of vast wealth. This allows companies to keep hundreds of riders idle, at every single store, waiting in line to pick the next order and race to deliver, without providing social security or minimum wages.</p><p>After the direction from officials of India’s labour ministry, quick commerce companies appear to have replaced the marketing promise of instant delivery within 10 minutes with other features like the availability of products.</p><p>But experts say that won’t change much – for the companies, or their workers.</p><p>The removal of the 10-minute delivery catchline is largely “optics-driven rather than business-altering,” Karan Taurani, executive vice president at securities firm Elara Capital, told Al Jazeera, adding that the proposition of quick commerce continues to be anchored in speed and convenience that remains structurally superior to horizontal e-commerce timelines.</p><p>A week after the government direction, platforms were often still showing a delivery time of less than 10 minutes, when Al Jazeera checked in three different cities in the national capital region, which also includes New Delhi.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4248781\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4248781\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248781\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-13T134545Z_857944782_RC2Z2S9F8FPI_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ECOMMERCE-1768732683.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C510&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gig worker\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4248781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A bird flies over a hoarding featuring an advertisement of the SoftBank-funded Blinkit, an Indian company which is offering 10-minute deliveries for groceries, in New Delhi, India, on January 20, 2022 [Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-inherent-design-problem\">‘The inherent design problem’</h2><p>Quick commerce companies maintain that the new direction would have no material impact on their business model.</p><p>Delivery riders agree.</p><p>“We deliver groceries to doorsteps, keeping our lives on [the] line every single time,” said Pal, waiting outside a dark store near a wealthy neighbourhood in Noida, just outside New Delhi, for his next order. “This instant delivery idea is so rubbish; what could one possibly need within 10 minutes?”</p><p>The riders say the problem is inherent in the design. “The system works on simple maths for us: the more orders you deliver, the more you earn,” added Pankaj Kumar, another delivery rider, hovering over Pal’s shoulder.</p><p>“If we want to earn money on these platforms, we need to ride faster – all the while, flying my bike on the wrong side [of the road] and jumping signals,” Kumar said.</p><p>However, Vasudevan, the author, said that “the government’s intervention is a welcome step that has come as a relief to some workers.”</p><p>“The 10-minute problem comes with customer expectations; once you do away with the promise, the act of speed becomes at least voluntary,” she said.</p><p>“The architecture of a faster delivery is not a wrong thing in itself,” argued Vasudevan. “But a tight deadline is an architectural imposition on the riders that became the norm, unfortunately.”</p><p>And India’s quick commerce model has little regard for its workers’ welfare, Vasudevan added.</p><p>The Indian government is also introducing new labour laws that formally recognise gig workers for the first time, propose social security benefits, including pensions and accident insurance, and plans to establish a social security fund, partly funded by companies.</p><p>But for now, those plans exist just on paper – and workers say that they learned that there’s only one way for them to be heard: through collective action.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4248772\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4248772\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4248772\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-10-14T134136Z_862568660_RC2BKAAJMEI3_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-RETAIL-QUICK-COMMERCE-1768732602.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C533&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"gig worker\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4248772\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Swiggy gig workers assist another worker as he parks an electric three-wheeler delivery scooter during a promotional event in Mumbai, India, on October 14, 2024 [Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"you-snooze-you-lose\">You snooze, you lose</h2><p>In the face of worsening working conditions and fluctuating wages, several workers’ groups coordinated a strike on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>Shaik Salauddin, national general secretary of the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT) that led the stoppage, told Al Jazeera that their demands from the platform companies were met with “corporate flexing power muscles, from PR games to intimidating riders”.</p><p>Salauddin, who is also part of a committee interacting with the Indian government on regulations, said that the demands included making companies’ algorithms, which dictate payouts, transparent and reliable. The workers are also asking for an end to “arbitrary blocking of workers’ IDs” and the right to organise protests.</p><p><span>Delivery riders say platforms use automated algorithms to deactivate a worker’s account, essentially firing them without notice, for a range of reasons, including lower ratings, frequent order cancellations, or customer complaints. The riders involved in protests have also faced police investigations in some cases.</span></p><p>In a statement on the strike, which sparked a fierce debate in the country on workers’ working conditions, one of the quick commerce leaders, Deepinder Goyal, who until recently headed Eternal, Zomato’s parent company, called the complaining workers “miscreants” who caused law and order problems.</p><p>The government appeared to disagree.</p><p>Welcoming the government’s intervention, Salauddin said, “Our collective voice reached the CEOs and the government; it is a win for those unionising.</p><p>“Thousands of riders logged off during peak hours in a protest for the right to life and dignity at the workplace,” said Salauddin.</p><p>But, “if the companies cheat us, then we will not sit silently,” he said, referring to the issue that the platforms are still delivering orders within 10 minutes after the government’s intervention.</p><p>Kumar, the delivery rider in Noida, said none of the riders were informed of any change by the platforms.</p><p>After the government intervention, Kumar said, the onus of riding quickly lies with them, now.</p><p>He fractured his right shoulder while delivering an order last year. Kumar said he was not provided with financial assistance in his treatment. Three days later, with a plaster on, he returned to the store, willing to ride with one hand. The manager had no problem, he said.</p><p>“If we lose a streak – of say hours in a day, days in a week – then we lose incentives,” said Kumar, standing dejected outside the dark store.</p><p>“What are we for the company?

Things aren’t going well. He needs a big win ahead of the November midterms,” said Angelos Syrigos, a professor of international law at Panteion University in Athens.</p><p>The US president has spent his first year in office looking for foreign policy triumphs he can sell at home, said Syrigos, citing the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the bombing of Iran and his efforts to end the Ukraine war.</p><p>Trump has invited board members to contribute $1bn each for a lifetime membership, but has not spelled out how the money will be spent.</p><p>His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a member of the executive board.</p><p>“How will this thing function? Will Trump and his son-in-law <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/trumps-board-of-peace-appears-to-seek-wider-mandate-beyond-gaza\">administer</a> it?” asked Syrigos.</p><p>Catherine Fieschi, a political scientist and fellow at the European University Institute, believed there was a more ambitious geopolitical goal as well.</p><p>“It’s as though Trump were gathering very deliberately middle powers … to defang the potential that these powers have of working independently and making deals,” she said.</p><p>Much like Bush’s 2003 “coalition of the willing” against Iraq, Trump’s initiative has cobbled together an ensemble of countries whose common traits are difficult to discern, ranging from Vietnam and Mongolia to Turkiye and Belarus.</p><p>Fieschi believed Trump was trying to corral middle powers in order to forestall other forms of multilateralism, a pathway to power that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney outlined in his speech at Davos, which so offended Trump.</p><p>“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: [to] compete with each other for favour, or to combine to create a third path with impact,” Carney had said, encouraging countries to build “different coalitions for different issues” and to draw on “the power of legitimacy, integrity and rules”.</p><p>He decried the “rupture in the world order … and the beginning of a brutal reality where geopolitics among the great powers is not subject to any constraints”.</p><p>After the speech, Trump soon rescinded Canada’s invitation.</p><p>Countering agglomerations of power and legitimacy was Trump’s goal, Fieschi believed.</p><p>“Here you bind them into an organisation that in some ways offers a framework with Trump in it and the US in it, and implies constraints,” said Fieschi. “It’s not so much benign multilateralism as stopping the middle powers getting on with their hedging and with their capacity to have any kind of autonomy, strategic and otherwise.”</p><p>At the same time, she said, Trump was suggesting that the Board of Peace “might give them more power than they have right now in the UN”.</p><p>“Trump thinks this is like a golf club and therefore he’s going to charge a membership fee,” Fieschi said.</p><p>“If it was a reconstruction fee [for Gaza], I don’t think people would necessarily baulk at that,” she noted, adding that the fee smacked of “crass oligarchic motivation”.</p><p>The Board of Peace is called into existence by last November’s UN Security Council Resolution 2803 to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.</p><p>It is defined as “a transitional administration” meant to exist only “until such time as the Palestinian Authority (PA) has satisfactorily completed its reform program … and [can] effectively take back control of Gaza.”</p><p>Trump’s charter for the board makes no mention of Gaza, nor of the board’s limited lifespan. Instead, it broadens the board’s mandate to “areas affected or threatened by conflict”, and says it “shall dissolve at such time as the Chairman considers necessary or appropriate”.</p><p>China, which has presented itself as a harbinger of multipolarity and a challenger of the US-led world order, rejected the invitation.</p><p>“No matter how the international landscape may evolve, China will stay firmly committed to safeguarding the international system with the UN at its core,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun last week.</p><p>The UN itself appears to be offended by Trump’s scheme.</p><p>“The UN Security Council stands alone in its Charter-mandated authority to act on behalf of all Member States on matters of peace and security,” wrote UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on social media on Monday, January 26.</p><p>“No other body or ad-hoc coalition can legally require all Member States to comply with decisions on peace and security,” he wrote.</p><p>Guterres was calling for a reform that would strengthen the legitimacy of the UN Security Council by better reflecting the balance of power in the world as it is, 81 years after the body was formed. But his statement can also be read as a veiled criticism of Trump’s version of the Board of Peace.</p><p>Transparency and governance are problematic, too.</p><p>Trump is appointing himself chairman of the board, with power to overrule all members. He gets to appoint the board’s executive, and makes financial transparency optional, saying the board “may authorise the establishment of accounts as necessary.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The network’s town hall with Erika Kirk — wife of the murdered far-right provocateur Charlie Kirk, saw a 11 percent decline in viewership compared to typical viewership in the same time slot.</p><p>Weiss has also been behind several other missteps in her short tenure at the network thus far. She delayed the airing of a 60 Minutes segment about the notorious CERCOT mega prison in El Salvador. Weiss claimed that the segment, which was already set for air, needed more reporting, which correspondent <a href=\"/news/2025/12/23/backlash-after-cbs-pulls-60-minutes-report-on-salvadors-cecot-prison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sharyn Alfonsi criticised, </a>calling it a “political decision” in an email.</p><p>She also oversaw the relaunch of the CBS Evening News with a new host, former CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil, who has been with the network since 2016. The show has gone through five different anchor teams since he joined the network.</p><p>“We put too much weight on the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you,” Dokoupil said in a video promoting his new spot.</p><p>But that was not well received.</p><p>“You wouldn’t want ‘academics and elites’ who have actually studied a subject to outweigh the off-the-cuff opinions of village idiots. This is how we’re seeing the resurgence of measles, and the widespread belief in almost non-existent vote fraud, among many other great leaps backward in the Trump era,” Larry Sabado, director of the Center For Politics at University of Virginia, said in a post on X.</p><p>And that message has not won over viewers either. While CBS has been last place among broadcast evening news programmes for decades, it continues to lose its market share under Weiss. The network’s flagship news show lost more than a million viewers during its inaugural week under the new host compared to the same time the year before.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It comes as the network’s parent company <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/22/paramount-skydance-extends-warner-bros-takeover-bid-offer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">continually lobs hostile takeover bids</a> to Warner Bros Discovery, which would include another news network often in the White House’s crosshairs – CNN.</p><p>In December, <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/paramounts-warner-bros-discovery-bid-faces-conflict-of-interest-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ellison visited</a> the White House, as per media reports, and told Trump that Paramount would execute “sweeping changes” if it acquired CNN’s parent company.</p><p>On Wall Street, CBS parent Paramount Skydance is down 2.6 percent in midday trading.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Al Jazeera examines the scale of destruction.</p><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content u-hidden\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In late November 2025, a powerful cyclone unleashed days of extreme rainfall across three provinces on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.</p><p>At least 1,100 people were killed, and more than 100 remain missing. Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed, and many public facilities were badly damaged. Entire villages have been wiped out by muddy floodwaters.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Indonesia team has followed the story on the ground, hearing firsthand accounts from survivors, as emergency services fight to reach those in need. Weeks after the disaster, the struggle continues. People shelter in flimsy tents, which offer little protection from the extreme heat. Illnesses continue to spread. Survivors and political analysts alike question whether the government’s response has been efficient and coordinated enough.</p><p>Over several weeks, our cameras captured not just the immediate aftermath, but the systemic challenges as well. Intense deforestation, high rates of poverty, and budget cuts all combined to make communities more vulnerable when disaster struck.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 27 Jan 2026</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">27 Jan 2026</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"
