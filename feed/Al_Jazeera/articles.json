Many people have been fighting against racism in football; Vinicius is one of them. I’m proud of him and his great game.”</p><p>The Associated Press news agency reported that television cameras picked up Vinicius Junior telling the referee that Prestianni had called him a “monkey”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Benfica began the game on the front foot, but the visitors gradually assumed control while the hosts appeared content to counterattack, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois producing a stunning one-handed save to keep out a 25th-minute strike from Fredrik Aursnes.</p><p class=\"p1\">Real finished the first half strongly, and only goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin’s brilliance kept ⁠the score goalless at the break as he produced stunning saves to deny Kylian ⁠Mbappe and Arda Guler.</p><p class=\"p1\">The breakthrough came five minutes after the restart. Mbappe burst forward and fed Vinicius on the left. The Brazilian cut diagonally towards the box, shifted inside and unleashed an unstoppable curling shot into the far top corner.</p><p class=\"p1\">Vinicius celebrated by dancing with the corner flag and ⁠was booked by Letexier for excessive celebration.</p><p class=\"p1\">As the forward argued with the referee, he became involved in a heated exchange with Prestianni, with Vinicius and several teammates suddenly running towards ⁠the referee.</p><p class=\"p1\">Letexier crossed his arms in front of his face to activate ⁠FIFA’s protocol and stopped the match. Real’s players threatened to leave the pitch as tensions flared, before play eventually resumed 11 minutes later.</p><p class=\"p1\">The atmosphere turned hostile, with Vinicius loudly booed whenever he touched the ball, and the broadcast camera appeared to show an outraged Mbappe calling Prestianni “a bloody racist” to ‌his face several times after the game resumed.</p><p class=\"p1\">Tempers flared again in the 85th minute, when Vinicius fouled Richard Rios. Benfica manager Jose Mourinho stormed towards the fourth official, demanding a second booking for the Brazilian, but was himself cautioned ‌for ‌his protests.</p><p class=\"p1\">An incensed Mourinho continued remonstrating, and was promptly shown a second yellow card.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4320967\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4320967\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4320967\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_6994e1b47f-1771364788.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"LISBON, PORTUGAL - FEBRUARY 17: Jose Mourinho, Head Coach of Benfica, is shown a red card by referee Francois Letexier during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Knockout Play-off First Leg match between SL Benfica and Real Madrid C.F. at Estadio do SL Benfica on February 17, 2026 in Lisbon, Portugal.

There is no place for it in football or society. It is disgusting.”</p><p>Mourinho criticised Vinicius Junior’s celebration and defended the club – if not Prestianni – against allegations of racism.</p><p>“Words were exchanged. I want to be independent. I don’t want to say I believe in Prestianni or believe in Vinicius,” he said.</p><p>“I told [Vinicius], ‘When you score a goal like that, you just celebrate in a respectful way’. When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was Black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"galatasaray-thrash-juve-5-2\">Galatasaray thrash Juve 5-2</h2><p>Elsewhere on Tuesday, Dutch midfielder Noa Lang scored a brace as Galatasaray thumped Juventus 5-2 in a pulsating contest in Istanbul in the first leg of a Champions League playoff.</p><p class=\"p1\">In a nerve-shredding atmosphere, Luciano Spalletti’s Juventus actually led 2-1 at half-time after Teun Koopmeiners replied to Brazilian midfielder Gabriel Sara’s opener with a brace of his own.</p><p class=\"p1\">But Colombian full-back Juan Cabal was dismissed for two bookings in a calamitous second half for the Italian side, as Lang’s brace and goals from Davinson Sanchez and Sacha Boey sunk Juventus.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, Champions League holders Paris Saint Germain overcame a horror start and a two-goal deficit to beat 10-man Monaco 3-2 away in the first leg of their knockout round ⁠playoff tie.</p><p class=\"p1\">Desire Doue came off the bench to engineer an impressive turnaround for PSG, who conceded a goal in the opening minute and were 2-0 down after 18 minutes as Folarin Balogun grabbed a double for ⁠the hosts.</p><p class=\"p1\">The 20-year-old Doue replaced Ballon d’Or winner Ousmane Dembele, who went off injured after 27 minutes, and proved decisive for the visitors as he struck two superb goals, as well as setting one up for Achraf Hakimi.</p><p>In Germany, striker Serhou Guirassy ⁠scored one ⁠goal and created another as hosts Borussia Dortmund claimed a ⁠2-0 victory over Italian visitors Atalanta in the first leg ⁠of their Champions League playoff tie on Tuesday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He also shared multiple photos of himself and Jackson together at social events.</p><p data-start=\"851\" data-end=\"969\">“He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and ‘street smarts.’ He was very gregarious – Someone who truly loved people!” the president said.</p><p data-start=\"851\" data-end=\"969\">In the <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116086206069142759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">post</a>, Trump also used his acquaintance with Jackson to defend himself against allegations of racism, after he shared a video depicting Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president, as an ape earlier this month.</p><h3 id=\"barack-obama\">Barack Obama</h3><p>Obama released a statement explaining that he is “deeply saddened to hear about the passing of a true giant”.</p><p>He said that he and his wife, Michelle, were directly inspired by Jackson, writing: “Michelle got her first glimpse of political organizing at the Jacksons’ kitchen table when she was a teenager.</p><p>“And in his two historic runs for president, he laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"joe-biden-former-us-president\">Joe Biden, former US president</h3><p>Biden remembered the civil rights activist as “determined and tenacious”.</p><p>“I’ve seen how Reverend Jackson has helped lead our Nation forward through tumult and triumph. He’s done it with optimism, and a relentless insistence on what is right and just,” he shared on a post in X.</p><p>“Whether through impassioned words on the campaign trail, or moments of quiet courage, Reverend Jackson influenced generations of Americans, and countless elected leaders, including Presidents.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"kamala-harris-former-us-vice-president\">Kamala Harris, former US vice president</h3><p>Harris, who ran as the Democratic nominee in the 2024 presidential election, shared her own tribute on social media.</p><p>“His presidential runs in 1984 and 1988 electrified millions of Americans and showed them what could be possible,” she wrote.</p><p>“From Washington, DC to the Bay Area, from the Mississippi Delta to Appalachia, from South Africa to the South Side of Chicago, Reverend Jackson gave a voice to people who were removed from power and politics.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"bill-and-hillary-clinton-former-us-president-and-former-secretary-of-state\">Bill and Hillary Clinton, former US president and former secretary of state</h3><p>In a social media statement, the Clintons said they became friends with Jackson after meeting him in 1977, during events marking the 20th anniversary of the integration of Little Rock Central High School.</p><p>That effort was seen as a pivotal moment in the US civil rights movement.</p><p>Nine Black students, later known as the Little Rock Nine, had enrolled at the previously all-white high school during the country’s desegregation, but their arrival at the school faced such heated opposition that then-President Dwight Eisenhower deployed the Arkansas National Guard.</p><p>The Clintons said that after meeting Jackson at the anniversary event, they continued to maintain a relationship with him for nearly 50 years.</p><p>They remembered him as someone who “championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives”.</p><p></p><h3>Cyril Ramaphosa, South African president</h3><p>Ramaphosa expressed his condolences and described Jackson as a “global moral authority” who stood firm in the fight for justice and equality.</p><p>“Rev Jesse Jackson’s irrepressible campaigns against apartheid and his support for the liberation struggle was a towering contribution to the global anti-apartheid cause,” Ramaphosa wrote.</p><p>“He has fought a good fight and run the race which his Baptist ministry inspired him to run. He made the world a better place but he has also influenced us to maintain his good fight in places where injustice and inequality persist.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"david-lammy-uk-deputy-prime-minister\">David Lammy, UK deputy prime minister</h3><p>Lammy, a Labour Party politician, currently serves as deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, and the secretary of state for justice in the United Kingdom.</p><p>He is the first Black man to hold these roles, and in Tuesday’s remembrances, he cited Jackson as a source of support.</p><p>Lammy began his post with a reference to the wave of protests and violence that erupted in 2011 after the death of a mixed-race man in north London. Lammy was a member of parliament at the time, representing the Tottenham area, where the killing took place.</p><p>“Jesse Jackson was one of the first people to call after the riots of 2011,” Lammy wrote. “It was a privilege to share such precious time with him in Chicago and London over the years.”</p><p>“May his legacy live on.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"reverend-al-sharpton-us-civil-rights-and-social-justice-activist\">Reverend Al Sharpton, US civil rights and social justice activist</h3><p>Sharpton also paid tribute to Jackson on X. Their history together stretches back to the 1960s, when a 12-year-old Sharpton would meet Jackson for the first time.</p><p>He would later serve as a youth coordinator for Jackson’s Operation Breadbasket, and the two would continue to collaborate over the course of their careers as civil rights leaders.</p><p>“The Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson was not simply a civil rights leader; he was a movement unto himself. He carried history in his footsteps and hope in his voice. One of the greatest honors of my life was learning at his side,” Sharpton wrote.</p><p>“He reminded me that faith without action is just noise. He taught me that protest must have purpose, that faith must have feet, and that justice is not seasonal, it is daily work.”</p><p></p><h3 id=\"diane-abbott-the-first-black-woman-to-be-a-british-member-of-parliament\">Diane Abbott, the first Black woman to be a UK member of parliament</h3><p>On social media, Abbott praised Jackson for the support he gave when she was first elected to the UK’s Parliament.</p><p>“He was very smart, warm and hugely charismatic. A direct connection to the great era of civil rights,” Abbott wrote on X.</p><p>Separately, in an interview with The Guardian, Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said that Jackson’s legacy was his uncompromising commitment to addressing racism.</p><p>She contrasted his fearless approach to the UK’s current leadership.</p><p>“Labour party and Keir Starmer don’t talk about racial equality at all,” she said.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"hakeem-jeffries-top-democrat-and-house-minority-leader\">Hakeem Jeffries, top Democrat and House Minority Leader</h3><p>Jeffries, the House of Representatives minority leader for the Democratic Party, called Jackson “a legendary voice for the voiceless, powerful civil rights champion and trailblazer extraordinaire”.</p><p>“For decades, while laboring in the vineyards of the community, he inspired us to keep hope alive in the struggle for liberty and justice for all,” he said.</p><h3>JB Pritzker, governor of Illinois</h3><p>Pritzker, a Democrat, called Jackson a “giant of the civil rights movement”.</p><p>Illinois, Pritzker’s state, had served as a base of operations for Jackson for decades, and it is where the civil rights leader died on Tuesday. Pritzker acknowledged his contribution to Illinois – and the US as a whole – in a social media post.</p><p>“He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive,” Pritzker wrote. “Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service.”</p><p>He ordered flags to fly half-staff across Illinois in honour of Jackson.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"bernice-king-the-daughter-of-martin-luther-king-jr\">Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr</h3><p>King posted a photo of Jackson with her late father, Martin Luther King Jr. The two men were both icons of the US civil rights movement.</p><p>“Both now ancestors,” she wrote on social media.</p><p>Martin Luther King Jr and Jackson worked together as part of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and it was with King’s backing that Jackson went on to lead programmes like Operation Breadbasket.</p><p>Jackson was also present at Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination in 1968.</p><p>In a separate post, Bernice paid tribute to those deep family ties: “My family shares a long and meaningful history with him, rooted in a shared commitment to justice and love. As we grieve, we give thanks for a life that pushed hope into weary places.”</p><p></p><h3>Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple</h3><p>Cook shared a post on X paying tribute to Jackson and recalling one of his quotes:</p><p>“Never look down on anybody unless you’re helping them up.”</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

CEO David Ellison allegedly promised United States President Donald Trump “sweeping changes” to Warner Bros Discovery’s CNN, which Trump has long alleged is too critical of him, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>At the same time, CBS News, which is owned by Paramount, has made several moves that have been seen as efforts to appease the Trump administration. These include: <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/27/cbs-news-bari-weiss-unveils-new-strategy-amid-backlash-viewership-lags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appointing Bari Weiss</a>, a conservative opinion writer with no television experience, to lead the storied broadcast network; appointing a former Trump appointee to oversee and address allegations of bias, and settling a lawsuit with Trump amid allegations that the network’s news magazine programme, 60 Minutes, doctored an interview with then-Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris.</p><p>On Monday, CBS late-night show host Stephen Colbert claimed that the network also barred him from airing an interview with Texas Democratic State Representative James Talarico, who is currently running for the Democratic nomination to represent the state in the US Senate.</p><p>“Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV,” Colbert said on Monday’s broadcast of The Late Show.</p><p>The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission said last month that daytime and late-night television talk shows are no longer considered “bona fide” news programmes, exempt from equal time rules that require them to give airtime to the views of opposing candidates.</p><p>A merger between Warner Bros and Paramount “would also put CNN and CBS under the same parent company, along with dozens of additional TV stations, and that consolidation creates serious concerns about the types of content we will see in a more traditional TV format going forward,” Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, an economic think tank, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Paramount’s revised offer, which included a personal guarantee on $40bn in equity from Oracle founder Larry Ellison, father to Paramount’s CEO, was turned down in early January. Larry Ellison has been a long-time supporter of Trump.</p><p>Congressional leaders have raised concerns about both deals.</p><p>“With either merger, another corporation will have that increased control over what we see, what we hear and what news we consume,” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in a US Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing earlier this month.</p><p>“I will not be surprised if this gets thwarted,” Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who also chairs the committee, told the outlet Semafor in December.</p><p>The Writers Guild raised concerns about the <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/5/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-raising-antitrust-concerns\">Netflix deal in December</a>, when the potential merger was originally announced.</p><p>“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the guild said in a statement. “This merger must be blocked.”</p><p>“I think what I am seeing lost in the excitement around this bidding war and who is going to emerge victorious is that all of the parties seem to be vastly underestimating the regulatory risk,” Hepner said.</p><p>On Wall Street, Paramount Skydance stock is surging in midday trading. It is up 7.4 percent since the market opened. Netflix is also up slightly by 0.4 percent and Warner Bros Discovery is up 3.4 percent.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it seems like they are disregarding all the realities and laws and trying to push through their anti-immigrant agenda by force,” he said.</p><p>Several Yemeni community leaders, particularly in Michigan, were outspoken supporters of Trump in the 2024 election.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last week revoked TPS for Yemen, which shielded eligible Yemenis in the US from deportation due to the dangerous conditions in their homeland.</p><p>Trump had listed Yemen in <a href=\"/news/2025/6/5/trump-announces-travel-ban-on-people-from-12-countries\">a travel ban</a> he imposed last year and tightened immigration restrictions on the country.</p><p>But rescinding TPS was especially jarring for many in the community because beneficiaries of the status are already in the US, and it may not be safe for them to return to Yemen.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to DHS, a country may be designated for TPS due to conditions “that temporarily prevent the country’s nationals from returning safely”.</p><p>Such conditions include political unrest, war, humanitarian crises and natural disasters. The status is granted for people who are not permanent US residents, such as tourists and visitors.</p><h2 id=\"conditions-in-yemen\">Conditions in Yemen</h2><p>Yemen was first designated for TPS in 2015 when the country’s civil war intensified, and the status had been repeatedly renewed.</p><p>“After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>“Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest. TPS was designed to be temporary, and this administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent. We are prioritising our national security interests and putting America first.”</p><p>As of September 2024 – the last time Yemen was redesignated for TPS – there were 2,300 Yemeni beneficiaries.</p><p>Noem’s announcement did not provide details on how allowing Yemenis, many of whom work and pay taxes, to retain their status counters US interests or how the conditions in Yemen were assessed.</p><p>A fragile ceasefire has been in place between Yemen’s Houthis and its internationally recognised government since 2022.

They are just a few thousand compared to hundreds of thousands from some other countries.”</p><p>DHS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.</p><h2 id=\"eople-are-very-devastated\">‘People are very devastated’</h2><p>Ghalib had helped lead the major shift in the Arab community towards Trump, which boosted the Republican leader’s popularity to win Michigan in 2024.</p><p>In the predominantly Yemeni American neighbourhood of the Southend <a href=\"/news/2024/11/1/as-trump-harris-woo-arab-americans-michigan-mayor-readies-to-up-pressure\">in Dearborn</a>, Michigan, Trump grew his share of the votes from less than 11 percent in 2020 to about 55 percent in 2024.</p><p>“People feel betrayed. They feel backstabbed,” Wali Altahif, a Yemeni American activist in Dearborn, said, adding that the decision to revoke TPS for Yemen will likely separate families in the community.</p><p>“There was hope that he was going to bring a different direction, different policy towards Yemen and the Yemeni community, but we’ve seen the opposite – absolutely the opposite.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Altahif expressed concern that, beyond the threat of war, TPS holders may experience harassment and persecution in Yemen due to regional divisions or perceived connection to the US.</p><p>He stressed the policy to revoke TPS for Yemen is unjustifiable. “It’s discriminatory. It’s racist. It’s un-American.”</p><p>The Trump administration has been rolling back TPS protections, including for <a href=\"/news/2025/11/26/trump-administration-nixes-temporary-immigration-protections-for-haitians\">Haiti</a>, which has been suffering from widespread gang violence.</p><p>However, some of Noem’s moves to nix immigration protections have been successfully challenged by the courts.

They’re very scared. They’re very concerned. They don’t know what lies ahead.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

JFB builds commercial and residential properties, including multifamily communities and shopping centres.</p><p>Xtend touts its drones as “low cost per kill”, which has appealed to the US Department of Defense. In November, the firm said it had solidified a multimillion-dollar contract with the Pentagon but did not disclose the contract’s value.</p><p>This month, Xtend was among 25 companies selected to participate in the Defense Department’s Drone Dominance Program, an acquisition reform effort designed to rapidly field low-cost, attack drones at scale.</p><p>Xtend also secured contracts with the Pentagon before Trump’s second term, including an $8.8m deal in December 2024.</p><p>“I am incredibly proud to invest in companies I believe in. Drones are clearly the wave of the future. Xtend has unbelievable potential,” Eric Trump said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>“By pairing XTEND’s operating system and advanced AI capabilities with JFB’s execution, infrastructure and buildout expertise, we see a clear opportunity to accelerate US manufacturing, scale production responsibly, and support a next-generation defense technology platform built in America and ready for the public markets,” Joseph F Basile III, chief executive officer of JFB, said in the news release.</p><p>JFB did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about the connection between its existing portfolio, which includes primarily commercial properties like a Courtyard by Marriott Hotel in Florida and an escape room in Indiana, and a defence contractor.</p><p>“By combining our platform with JFB, we are acquiring the resources we need to scale our manufacturing capabilities in the US and gaining access to the US public markets,” Xtend CEO Aviv Shapira said in the news release.</p><p>Xtend did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><h2 id=\"renewed-conflict-of-interest-concerns\">Renewed conflict-of-interest concerns</h2><p>The deal is the latest in a series of conflict-of-interest concerns surrounding the Trump family’s personal investments and whether its members are using the Trump presidency to advance their own financial interests, according to ethics experts.</p><p>“The first thing that comes to mind is another example of the president’s family appearing to profit from the presidency,” said Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.</p><p>“In the past, a president would avoid even the appearance that the family was benefitting from the office, and if that couldn’t be completely avoided, the president would make statements to reassure the public that there was no special treatment provided to the family that could lead to this benefit. Now, you don’t see anything like that.” Payne told Al Jazeera.</p><p>JFB Construction also appointed Stefan Passantino, a former White House attorney, to its board of directors amid the merger.</p><p>The investment comes even as the Trump family company has filed to trademark the use of the president’s name on airports but said it doesn’t plan on charging a fee at least for a proposed renaming of one near his Florida home, The Associated Press news agency reported.</p><p>Josh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who uncovered the filings over the weekend, said the applications were the first of their kind he’s ever seen.</p><p>“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honor, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote on his blog. “I should be very clear: these are trademark filings that are completely unprecedented.”</p><p>During former President Joe Biden’s term, Republicans rallied against his son Hunter Biden for using his connections with the White House to advance his personal business interests.</p><p>“When he [Hunter Biden] got a board position with a company overseas, there were concerns that he was using his name to secure a high-profile job. There were no ties to government contracts, but even the appearance that he had a position based on his name was controversial,” Payne said.</p><p>The Oversight Committee in the US House of Representatives alleged that the Bidens “participated or benefited from the business schemes” in a committee hearing in March 2024 about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.</p><p>“We have learned that Joe Biden has taken action after action to further his family’s plans to get rich,” James Comer, the committee’s then-chairman, said at the time.</p><p>Comer did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment about whether he shared the same concerns about the Trump family.</p><p>“We’re talking about something far more extreme: a child receiving benefits from government contracts, at least indirectly through a company he owns, including lucrative contracts with the Defense Department. That’s something we haven’t seen since Halliburton and Vice President [Dick] Cheney,” Payne said.</p><p>The White House and Trump Organization representatives did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in October, he took over the country’s presidency after his predecessor, Dina Boluarte, was impeached for “moral incapacity”.</p><p>Boluarte had replaced the last democratically elected president, Pedro Castillo, in December 2022 after he too was impeached.</p><p>Jeri was the seventh president in a decade to lead Peru. Many of his predecessors have been mired in scandal, forcing them to step down or face impeachment.</p><p>In Jeri’s case, the scandals largely concerned allegations that the right-wing leader was involved in influence-peddling. One of the most notable was informally dubbed “Chifagate”, after the Peruvian-Chinese fusion cuisine known as “chifa”.</p><p>“Chifagate” emerged after Peruvian media published video of Jeri attending a late-night meeting with a Chinese businessman, Zhihua Yang, at his restaurant in Lima. The meeting was not included on the official presidential agenda, as required under Peruvian law.</p><p>Jeri appeared to be in disguise in the video, wearing informal clothing including a deep hoodie that partially obscured his face, which spurred further questions about the nature of the meeting.</p><p>Subsequent images showed Jeri visiting another one of Yang’s businesses, a wholesale store, this time in sunglasses.</p><p>Jeri has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has dismissed the meetings as get-togethers to discuss a Peruvian-Chinese friendship day — or as simple shopping trips for candy and food.</p><p>Yang has ties to the Peruvian government. Under Boluarte’s administration, he received a concession to build a hydroelectric plant, which has experienced delays and faced questions about its transparency.</p><p>The meetings between Yang and Jeri also reportedly included a third Chinese businessman, Jiwu Xiaodong, who was placed under house arrest for engaging in illegal activities.</p><p>At Tuesday’s congressional debate, Jeri also faced questions about late-night meetings he took with women who later received government contracts and other irregular interactions he had. Jeri has also faced accusations of sexual assault, stretching back to December 2024.</p><p>He faced a total of seven motions of censure against his presidency. Ultimately, 75 members of Peru’s Congress backed the measure to remove Jeri, while three abstained and a further 24 voted against the proposal.</p><p>A new interim president is set to be voted upon during Wednesday evening, around 6pm local time (23:00 GMT).</p><p>Jeri’s removal marks a new chapter in the turmoil facing Peru’s government. The country is less than two months away from an April 12 general election, which will help decide its next president.</p><p>If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote in that election, the race will proceed to a run-off in June.</p><p>Currently, the field is packed, with at least 36 candidates vying for the presidency. Election observers fear that whoever wins could face the same quick-fire impeachment proceedings that their predecessors have endured.</p><p>Presidents in Peru have often faced accusations of “moral incapacity”, a pathway to impeachment that critics have denounced as overly vague.</p><p>Jeri’s impeachment comes within months of several high-profile court decisions against former presidents.</p><p>In November, former President Martin Vizcarra, who served from 2018 to 2020, was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of accepting bribes for government contracts.</p><p>Then, in December, Castillo received a sentence of 11 years and five months for his conviction on charges of rebellion and conspiracy against the state.</p><p>Castillo, a left-wing leader, had been facing a third impeachment attempt in December 2022, when he attempted what many describe as a self-coup. Within hours, members of his cabinet had resigned, and Congress had impeached him.</p><p>Prosecutors in Peru have said they plan to continue investigations into Jeri on corruption charges.</p></div></div></body></html>"

You will not be able to do this either,” Khamenei said in an apparent reference to the US president telling reporters this week that a change in government would be “the best thing that could happen” in Iran.</p><p>Khamenei also used religious symbolism to draw parallels with figures who fought against Shia Muslim imams more than 1,350 years ago to cast doubt on any meaningful rapprochement with the US today. He said the Iranian nation “will not pledge allegiance to corrupt leaders like those who are in power in America today” based on religious beliefs.</p><p>“They say let us negotiate over your nuclear energy, and the result of the negotiation should be that you must not have this energy,” Khamenei said before adding that if any real negotiations were to take place, they cannot be predicated on any “foolish” demand that Iran move to zero enrichment of uranium.</p><p>His comments came hours before a statement made by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi after the conclusion of indirect talks with the US in Geneva.</p><p>“I can say, compared to the last round, we’ve had very serious discussions, and there was a constructive atmosphere where we exchanged our point of view,” Araghchi told reporters after the talks. “Those ideas were discussed, and we came to some agreements and some guiding principles. We will eventually draft a document. … We are hopeful we can achieve this.”</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The message from the Iranian negotiating team through state media on Tuesday was that Tehran is “serious” about the indirect talks mediated by Oman and wants to see results – particularly the <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/13/us-says-it-caused-dollar-shortage-to-trigger-iran-protests-what-that-means\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lifting of harsh US sanctions</a> imposed after Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from a nuclear deal that Iran had reached with world powers three years earlier.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">For the US, which was also holding parallel talks with Ukraine and Russia in Switzerland, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner acted as lead representatives.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Both teams had separate meetings with Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi as well as Rafael Grossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who will have to lead any potential future inspection missions of Iranian <a href=\"/news/2025/6/22/iranians-react-after-us-bombs-three-nuclear-sites-in-support-of-israel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nuclear sites bombed by the US</a> in June during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"hard-to-be-optimistic\">‘Hard to be optimistic’</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Washington has insisted that no uranium enrichment may take place inside Iran. It has also said Tehran must hand over its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, which are believed to be buried under the rubble of the US air strikes in June, and limit its missile programme. Along with Israel, the US has sought an end to Iran’s support for the “axis of resistance”, the armed groups it backs in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">All these demands have been rejected by Iran, which said they cross “red lines” and undermine the country’s rights and security.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Instead, the Iranian team has proposed to dilute the uranium and to include the US in the potential economic benefits of any agreement.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Addressing a meeting of the leaders of the Iran Chamber of Commerce on Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs Hamid Ghanbari said the Trump administration would have to be offered deals in “areas with high economic output that can be achieved quicker”.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">He suggested Iran could sell energy to the US, work on joint oil- and gasfields and minerals, or even buy aircraft from the US, but he did not say how Tehran believed such agreements could be achieved given the clashing positions offered by the two sides.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Iran’s currency, the rial, depreciated slightly after the indirect talks in Geneva ended on Tuesday after just over three hours. One US dollar was worth about 1.63 million rials on Tuesday, near <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/iran-shuts-down-private-businesses-after-protests-as-economy-slumps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an all-time low</a> registered last month after a deadly crackdown against nationwide antigovernment protests and threats of war.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“It is hard to be optimistic about these negotiations that wrapped up very quickly. These are extremely complex subjects. Remember that it took two and a half years to negotiate the 2015 nuclear deal,” Ali Vaez, director at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">“These talks usually require a lot of patience, a lot of focus, a lot of back and forth, a lot of discussions with experts. So if they wrap up this quickly, this is either a sign that the negotiators don’t have the patience that is required to reach an agreement or the gaps are simply too large to bridge.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"shutting-down-the-strait-of-hormuz\" class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Shutting down the Strait of Hormuz</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Beyond the rhetoric, developments on the ground also showed the two sides are no closer to reaching an agreement.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The US is still in the process of amassing soldiers and military equipment in the region with a second aircraft carrier on the way and more air defence systems positioned in multiple countries to fight against potential Iranian missile and drone attacks in case of a conflict.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Khamenei suggested Iran possesses weapons that can “sink” an aircraft carrier and “slap” the largest military in the world to the ground as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) staged military exercises in the <a href=\"/news/2025/6/14/what-is-the-strait-of-hormuz-could-it-factor-into-israel-iran-conflict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strait of Hormuz</a>.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">IRGC navy chief Alireza Tangsiri told state television from the deck of a warship that if Iranian leaders order it, his forces are ready to make good on a longstanding threat to close down the strategic waterway, through which roughly 20 percent of global oil and gas supplies flow.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The IRGC said the strait was closed for several hours on Tuesday as its forces conducted the naval exercises. State television showed missiles being fired from warships and the shore to hit vessels at sea.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">This comes as the US has also expressed a focus on hitting the ghost fleet of ships used by Iran to sell its oil, mostly to China, in defiance of Washington’s sanctions.

A relatively newer technique has been developed in Ladakh to create an “ice stupa”, which is formed after spraying water in freezing temperatures. The conical shape ice structure remains frozen for a longer period as its surface is not fully exposed to the sun.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3912900\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Pakistan_glacier-floods_August25_2025-03-1756384278.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_vulnerable_glacier floods_August25_2025-03-1756384278\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-is-glacier-grafting-carried-out\">How is glacier grafting carried out?</h2><p>So-called “male” and “female” ice is sourced from different locations and brought together to create an artificial glacier. Villagers where this technique has been implemented as well as experts told Al Jazeera that volunteers go out to collect around 200kg (441 pounds) of “male” ice from one valley and “female” ice from another. Male ice is typically black in colour, while female ice is usually lighter, providing more fertile water that enhances agricultural productivity, according to locals.</p><p>In ancient times, due to the absence of available transportation as well as steep, narrow and slippery routes through the mountains, volunteers would travel on foot for several days, carrying the ice in traditional wooden cages on their backs.</p><p>The process requires specific materials: coal, grass, salt and water collected from seven different streams. Before setting out to the grafting site, the group would recite Quranic verses, perform spiritual rituals and pray for success.</p><p>The material, including both sets of ice blocks, would be carried to the site while “strictly following environmentally respectful and culturally sacred practices”, the locals said.</p><p>They would avoid the use of plastics, refrain from immoral actions and only consume locally produced foods such as wheat, barley, apricots and homemade bread during the process.</p><p>Humour, music, or harm to living creatures is strictly prohibited, as the procedure was viewed as both a spiritual and ecological responsibility.</p><p>At the grafting site, a small trench would be dug in a safe area, away from avalanche or flood-risk zones. The male and female ice pieces would be carefully layered together, mixed with salt, coal and grass.</p><p>“The male pieces are put on the right, while on the left, female ice pieces,” Zakir said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3972254\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3972254\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3972254\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/skardu3-1758555264.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"skardu glacier pakistan\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3972254\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pakistan is home to an estimated 13,000 glaciers [Faras Ghani/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Water collected from the seven streams would slowly be dripped over the ice to help bind the layers.</p><p>Over several months, the pieces fused into a single ice mass. If the site received seasonal snowfall, the mass would gradually develop into a glacier. After surviving for at least three years and enduring seasonal snow cycles, the artificially grafted glacier would expand. Over the next few years, it would become a reliable water source.</p><p>Zakir added that site selection is critical in the process: north-facing slopes, strong winds, less sun exposure and protection from direct flowing water are essential.</p><h2 id=\"rituals-discipline-and-collective-labour\">Rituals, discipline and collective labour</h2><p>Locals and experts told Al Jazeera that the deep spiritual and cultural aspects surrounding this technique are what distinguish glacier grafting from purely technical interventions.</p><p>Ice pieces are never allowed to touch the ground and must remain in continuous motion from collection to planting.</p><p>“Often, vehicles that carry these ice pieces are never switched off,” Zakir recalled, adding that those helping out are forbidden from speaking, using plastic or relieving themselves near the site.</p><p>“If one volunteer feels tired, without lying down, he will pass the basket [carrying the ice] to another volunteer.”</p><p>Historically, glacier grafting has also concluded with local music known as Gang Lho that is sung directly to the ice. One such song, the professor recalled, addresses the glacier as a living being, calling it “my dear baby glacier” having “pastures to grow… mountains to climb”.</p><p>Often, volunteers and villagers would have tears in their eyes, praying for the glacier’s establishment and survival in order to aid their survival and livelihood.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3912886\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Pakistan_glacier-floods_August25_2025-01-1756384125.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Pakistan_glacier floods_August25_2025\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"how-long-does-glacier-grafting-take-is-it-guaranteed-to-survive\">How long does glacier grafting take? Is it guaranteed to survive?</h2><p>A successfully grafted glacier can start supplying water within two decades, making it a long-term investment in water security.</p><p>However, experts warn that the process is vulnerable – not only to a failure of the natural process, a lack of snowfall, drops in temperatures, and climate change, but also to conflict.</p><p>“In abnormal climatic conditions, such as during war, the process may fail,” Zakir warned.</p><p>“Both India and Pakistan have deployed military forces in the glaciers, and the bullets they use, as well as the movement of soldiers and equipment, are very harmful to glaciers.”</p><p>The South Asian neighbours have fought three wars over the disputed Kashmir region, which they both govern parts of.</p><h2 id=\"can-glacier-grafting-solve-water-scarcity-problems\">Can glacier grafting solve water scarcity problems?</h2><p>The mean temperature in Pakistan since the 1950s has risen by 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.34 degrees Fahrenheit), which is twice as fast as the global mean change, according to the World Bank.</p><p>With temperatures rising globally, glacier grafting may not be able to offer a wholesome solution to Pakistan’s melting glaciers problem. But it remains a powerful example of how Indigenous knowledge, culture and collective care have long shaped survival in the mountains.</p><p>Locals told Al Jazeera that glacier grafting is now more critical than ever to counter water scarcity and erratic snowfall that cause problems for irrigation, domestic consumption and livestock.</p><p>They also worry that the practice of glacier grafting is rapidly disappearing. Younger generations, drawn to urban centres and alternative livelihoods such as tourism, education and business, no longer engage in traditional irrigation.</p><p>This shift has disrupted the intergenerational transfer of Indigenous knowledge, they lamented.</p><p><em>This story was produced in partnership with the <a href=\"https://pulitzercenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pulitzer Center</a>.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Protesters accused the Awami League government of using the quota system to reward its supporters.</p><p>The Hasina government was forced to abolish the quota in 2018. But in June 2024, a court reinstated the quota system, triggering the protests that soon morphed into a wider call for the removal of Hasina’s “autocratic” regime.
