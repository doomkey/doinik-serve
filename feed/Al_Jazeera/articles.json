Tambadou has since taken a position at the United Nations – he is the Registrar of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, an international court founded by the United Nations Security Council. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021.</p><p>Seven countries – Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, the Maldives, France and Britain – have since successfully applied to support The Gambia’s case at the ICJ.</p><p>Rohingya people in Myanmar were subjected to violent, months-long offensives by Myanmar’s armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, from late 2016. Although the group had long faced persecution in Myanmar, according to rights groups, the attacks escalated sharply, as Rohingya communities were targeted in cases of arson, mass shootings, rapes and kidnappings.</p><p>In 2019 – the year The Gambia lodged its case with the ICJ – a United Nations fact-finding mission reported that about 10,000 people had been killed, and 730,000 people displaced to refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh. The military offensive showed “genocidal intent” and the government aimed to “erase” Rohingya identity and remove them from Myanmar, the United Nations mission found.</p><p>The Gambia may have been inspired to take up the case due to its own long history of repression under former dictator Yahya Jammeh, who ruled the country with an iron fist for 22 years until 2017, Imran Darboe, a barrister formerly with the Gambian justice ministry, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Jammeh was forced out of office in 2017 by a regional military mission when he failed to leave office after losing the presidential elections.</p><p>In 2018, the new government began investigating Jammeh-era atrocities perpetrated by his “killer squad” security forces, including widespread abductions and killings.</p><p>Gambians were collectively reckoning with the painful testimonies of scores of victims as the Rohingya crisis unfolded, prompting the government to take action, despite a lack of precedent at the ICJ at the time.</p><p>“At that point, we were also going through our truth-and-reconciliation commission, and realising the value of protecting human rights,” Darboe said.</p><p>“Most people [in The Gambia] were shocked by what was being revealed, so there was the thinking that if the concept of human rights is universal, we cannot just focus on our own issues. We feel what the Rohingya people were feeling … we were all on the same page about that.”</p><p>The Gambia’s active role in the OIC also likely played a large role, Darboe added. While bringing an ICJ case would be expensive for the small nation, the OIC’s backing likely alleviates financial pressures, he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-gambia-s-argument-at-the-icj\">What is The Gambia’s argument at the ICJ?</h2><p>Dawda, The Gambia’s justice minister, told the ICJ judges in his opening arguments on Monday that the Rohingya had been “deliberately targeted” by Myanmar’s ruling military and that their lives had been turned upside down.</p><p>“They have been targeted for destruction,” he said.</p><p>“Myanmar has denied them their dream, in fact it turned their lives into a nightmare, subjecting them to the most horrific violence and destruction one could imagine.”</p><p>Paul Reichler, another lawyer on the Gambian team, read out extensive witness testimony from 2017, describing scenes of houses being set ablaze with people in them, gang rapes and arbitrary killings.</p><p>The Myanmar government, Reichler added, had called the Rohingya an “impure and subhuman race” that threatened the local population.</p><p>A third team member, Phillipe Sand, concluded that the scale of the violence showed “Myanmar acted in this case with genocidal intent”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3906977\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3906977\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3906977\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250825__72D28XE__v1__HighRes__BangladeshMyanmarRohingyaConflictAid-1756122801.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Rohingya refugees take part in the 'Genocide Remembrance Day' rally to mark the anniversary of their mass exodus from Myanmar\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3906977\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rohingya refugees take part in the ‘Genocide Remembrance Day’ rally to mark the anniversary of their mass exodus from Myanmar following a military crackdown, at a refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar on August 25, 2025 [Piyas Biswas/ AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-has-myanmar-argued\">What has Myanmar argued?</h2><p>Myanmar’s defence team, led by the minister of international cooperation, Ko Ko Hlaing, will begin its response to the allegations on Friday, January 16, continuing until January 20.</p><p>In 2019, when the case was filed, Myanmar was under civil rule.

But the widely-cited United States-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (<a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">HRANA</a>) put the death toll at 2,615 on Wednesday this week. Iran’s government claims numbers have been vastly exaggerated.</p><p>Tensions with the US escalated this week when President Donald Trump threatened to take action if killings continued, but then appeared to back down on Wednesday night when he said he had received assurances from Tehran that the killings would stop and executions of detained protesters would not take place.</p><p class=\"p1\">But while protesters may have been silenced for now, their concerns remain far from resolved. The threat of intervention by the US <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/trumps-bluffs-why-us-strike-on-iran-remains-real-threat\">remains very real</a>, and, critically, the dire economic conditions that first prompted protest in the closing days of 2025 have only worsened.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"why-have-protests-erupted-over-the-economy\">Why have protests erupted over the economy?</h2><p class=\"p1\">“The recent unrest was undoubtedly rooted in economic distress,” Hassan Hakimian, emeritus professor of economics at SOAS, told Al Jazeera. “Decades of chronic corruption and extensive economic mismanagement were accentuated by international economic sanctions, adding to the misery of large swaths of ordinary people.”</p><p class=\"p1\">On top of this, Hakimian said, Iran has suffered severe environmental-related problems in recent months – “critical <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/as-the-dams-feeding-tehran-run-dry-iran-struggles-with-a-dire-water-crisis\">water shortages</a>, power outages and crippling <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/tehran-shrouded-in-thick-smog-as-iran-burns-dirty-fuel-amid-energy-crisis\">air pollution</a> – generating a perfect economic storm”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The value of the Iranian rial, whose near collapse on December 28, when it fell to a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/protests-strikes-after-irans-economic-situation-rapidly-deteriorates\">record low</a> against the dollar, first prompted the protest, remains at a low.</p><p class=\"p1\">Banking ATMs are offline, flights and currency transactions remain limited, casualties of the shutdown of the National Information Network, Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/14/is-starlink-helping-iranians-break-internet-blackout-and-how-does-it-work\">state-controlled domestic intranet</a>, which is essentially the country’s internet.</p><p class=\"p1\">“If you think of the shutdown as having run for around a month, then we can fairly say that Iran’s economy has run at around 50 percent capacity over that period,” Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, said. “Assuming that’s correct, you’re looking at a loss of around a tenth of the country’s GDP if that extends to a month. How much that is in dollars depends on what currency conversion you use. They change all the time, but, over a year, it’s likely somewhere between $20bn and $90bn.”</p><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-affected-the-iranian-economy\" class=\"p1\">How have sanctions affected the Iranian economy?</h2><p class=\"p1\">Iran’s economy today is unrecognisable from that at the time of the 1979 Islamic revolution, as war, sanctions and shifting economic priorities have slowed it to a crawl, experts say.</p><p>One of the main reasons is that Iran is one of the <a href=\"/economy/2012/10/17/timeline-sanctions-on-iran\">most heavily sanctioned</a> countries in the world.</p><p class=\"p1\">Economic sanctions on Iran, beginning with those imposed by the US in the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/13/a-timeline-of-crises-faced-by-iran-since-1979\">immediate wake</a> of the revolution, followed by further tranches imposed by the United Nations over its nuclear programme in 2006, have played a central role in tilting Iran’s economy to the point of collapse. Israel’s attack in June last year, which resulted in a 12-day war between the two countries, further undermined confidence.</p><p>The US first imposed sanctions on Iran in 1979, when the Islamic revolution overthrew the shah, or monarch, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose forces notoriously used repression and torture to keep him in power, without a democratic mandate.</p><p>In 1979, Washington also halted oil imports from Iran and froze $12bn in Iranian assets.</p><p>In 1995, then-President Bill Clinton issued executive orders preventing US companies from investing in Iranian oil and gas and trading with Iran. A year later, the US Congress passed a law requiring that the US government impose sanctions on foreign firms investing more than $20m a year in Iran’s energy sector.</p><p>In December 2006, the United Nations Security Council imposed its own sanctions on Iran’s trade in nuclear-energy-related materials and technology and froze the assets of individuals and companies involved in activities pertaining to it.</p><p>In subsequent years, the UN toughened sanctions and the European Union also followed suit.</p><p>In 2015, Iran signed a nuclear deal – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – with the US, United Kingdom, China, France, Germany, Russia and the EU. Under that pact, Iran agreed to refrain from any uranium enrichment and research into it for 15 years.</p><p>But in 2018, during his first term as president, Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear treaty and reimposed all sanctions on Iran.</p><p>In 2019, the Trump administration designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “foreign terrorist organization”. Additionally, Trump imposed sanctions targeting petrochemicals, metals (steel, aluminium, copper), as well as senior Iranian officials.</p><p>On January 3, 2020, after the US assassinated Qassem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC’s elite Quds Force, in a drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq, it also imposed more sanctions on Iran.</p><p>In September 2025, the UN’s sanctions were reimposed on Iran over its nuclear programme when the UNSC <a href=\"/news/2025/9/19/un-security-council-rejects-resolution-to-extend-iran-sanctions-relief\">voted against</a> permanently lifting economic sanctions on Iran.</p><p class=\"p1\">Currently, under US and other international sanctions, nearly all of Iran’s oil revenues remain frozen. Additionally, assets held overseas are frozen, trade is restricted, and banks have been targeted.</p><p class=\"p1\">Financial networks and companies linked to the development of Iran’s nuclear, ballistic-missile network and entities, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which many in the international community hold responsible for domestic repression, are also sanctioned and are not permitted to do business with the US or other nations levying sanctions.</p><p>Now, China buys more than 80 percent of Iran’s shipped oil, data for 2025 from analytics firm Kpler shows. Much of it is transported by a “shadow fleet” of oil tankers which fly false flags or switch off tracking devices to avoid sanctions.</p><h2 id=\"how-has-this-affected-people-in-iran\">How has this affected people in Iran?</h2><p class=\"p1\">Even before the conflict with Israel last year, many economists regarded Iran’s economy as locked in a period of “stagflation”, as sluggish growth – estimated by the International Monetary Fund at just 0.6 percent per year – combined with soaring prices, robbed many in Iran of their last hopes for a stable future for themselves and their families.</p><p>Economists generally consider an annual economic growth rate of 2 to 3 percent to be ideal.</p><p>Over the past eight years, Iranians’ purchasing power – the value of the money they have to spend, compared with prices – has fallen by more than 90 percent. Food prices have soared by an average of 72 percent compared with last year, as the rial has collapsed against the US dollar, official statistics show.</p><p>In December 2025, one US dollar was priced at about 1.36 million rial in the open market, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/irans-government-budget-reveals-tough-road-ahead-as-currency-hits-new-low\">the rial’s worst rate ever</a>.</p><p>Then, in early January, as protests were in full swing, the Iranian rial dropped even further to 1.42 million against the US dollar – a 56 percent drop in value in just six months and a sharp decline from about 700,000 in January 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearly one in five young people is out of work.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-rial-exchange-rate-important\" class=\"p1\">Why is the rial exchange rate important?</h2><p class=\"p1\">“One of the key economic indicators that really matters to people is the exchange rate,” Iranian American economist Nader Habibi explained. “People pay real attention to where the dollar is against the rial and, as their uncertainty grows, so does the amount of hard currency they store, such as dollars or gold.”</p><p class=\"p1\">According to Habibi, shortages in the supply of hard currency following Israel’s attack in June last year, as well as competition for funds from a government scrambling to rebuild and maintain its defences after 12 days of war, sent confidence in the Iranian economy reeling and accelerated the collapse of the rial.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The rapid devaluation of the rial was more than even conservative elements of society, such as the Bazaaris, could cope with,” Habibi said, referring to the common name for the shopkeepers who work in the grand bazaar.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Imagine you want to sell a TV. Say you sell it and the next day you need to buy another to replenish your inventory,” he explained. “Everything depends on the ability to buy a new TV at a price lower than that which you sold the last one for. However, after the rial collapsed, that was something the Bazaaris no longer felt they could do, so they shut their shops and took to the streets.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-now\" class=\"p1\">What will happen now?</h2><p class=\"p1\">“The protests have calmed in the last two or three days because of the sheer number of people killed. That’s why people did not go out,” one <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/15/iran-us-live-tension-lingers-amid-threats-as-tehran-reopens-airspace\">Tehran resident</a>, who did not wish to be named, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"p1\">However, people remain angry about the state of the economy, experts say. “The reality is that the regime has no quick fix to alleviate the dire situation it confronts this time. Even if it were to succeed in suppressing the protests by brute force, the underlying issues will not be going away,” Hakimian, the economics professor, said.</p><p>Outside intervention by the likes of the US is unlikely to help, he added.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Those favouring kinetic action overlook its poor record in the region and its likelihood to complicate an already difficult situation, whether through collateral damage in Iran or wider regional conflict.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

logistical support for Yemen’s legitimate government in its war against them; and a platform for direct operations against the Houthis”.</p><p>Over the past two years, Israeli strikes in Yemen have hit key economic and civilian infrastructure and killed Houthi leaders, yet unnamed Israeli officials told The Jerusalem Post that the group remains nearly undeterrable.</p><p>This has prompted calls for a total overhaul of Israel’s military and security doctrines, including by the Israeli army’s Dado Center for Interdisciplinary Military Studies, due to what it said were significant changes in the “characteristics of Israel’s security environment”.</p><p>“This context has totally brought Somaliland into effect,” Max Webb, an independent analyst on the Horn of Africa, told Al Jazeera. “The Houthis are now the largest Iranian proxy posing a direct threat to Israel,” he said, citing the <a href=\"/news/2025/1/21/is-hezbollah-weakened-as-lebanon-shifts-towards-new-governance\">weakening</a> of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/8/live-syria-marks-one-year-since-fall-of-bashar-al-assad\">collapse</a> of the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria.</p><p>“Israel has never previously been attacked by the Houthis; this is a new development. And so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that they’re prepared to work with new actors in order to counter that Houthi threat,” Webb said.</p><p>Asher Lubotzky, a senior fellow at the Israeli think tank, the Israel-Africa Relations Institute, told Al Jazeera that while Israel’s military demonstrated it could strike distant targets, its <a href=\"/news/2025/9/16/israeli-military-attacks-yemens-red-sea-port-hodeidah-houthi-linked-tv\">overall performance</a> against the Houthis was “below the passing mark”, despite it launching the longest-range strike Israel had ever carried out.</p><p>The Houthis, in turn, have <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/any-israeli-presence-in-somaliland-will-be-a-target-houthi-leader\">threatened</a> to strike any Israeli presence in Somaliland, a move that Mostafa Hasan, Somaliland’s former intelligence director, said amounts to a declaration of war.</p><p>Lubotzky said Somaliland had taken a major risk and, in a November report for an Israeli think tank, suggested that other countries take the lead in recognising Somaliland to reduce potential fallout for both Hargeisa and Israel. “But they wanted recognition and they think it is worth it,” he said.</p><p>“Most of the countries which were extremely mad at Israel for this, were mad at Israel before,” he added.</p><p>According to Webb, “both sides have very little to lose diplomatically.</p><p>“Israel is more isolated than it has ever been, and Somaliland isn’t recognised by anyone.

A new administration under Somalia’s federal system has been established.</p><p>Several senior Somali cabinet ministers have arrived in the city this week, and the president is expected to visit over the weekend.</p><p>Somalia’s federal government has also increased pressure over the last year through airspace controls, visa restrictions and port regulations.</p><p>A source close to Somaliland’s government, speaking anonymously to Al Jazeera, said the measures had created a sense of unease in Hargeisa, making the need for action more urgent.</p><p>Hersi Ali Haji Hassan, chair of the governing Waddani party, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/top-somaliland-official-defends-israel-ties-amid-arab-backlash\">told</a> Al Jazeera Mubasher that “we are in a state of necessity for official international recognition,” adding there “is no choice before us but to welcome any country that recognises our existential right”.</p><p>In mid-2025, the administration of Somaliland’s Abdirahman Mohamed Abdillahi sent letters to 193 heads of state offering strategic access and cooperation in exchange for diplomatic recognition.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"129\" data-end=\"532\">Israel’s recognition of Somaliland on December 26 had little to do with the long-standing aspirations of communities living in the breakaway region of Somaliland in northwest Somalia. It was, instead, a product of shifting geopolitics and a rapidly fragmenting global order. An issue once confined to the margins has since been pulled into the centre of regional and international power rivalries.</p><p data-start=\"534\" data-end=\"1025\">The Horn of Africa and the Red Sea corridor, anchored by the Bab al-Mandab Strait, one of the world’s most vital maritime chokepoints, have become arenas of intense competition. Israel, the Gulf countries, Turkey, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea and China are all now deeply engaged. Within this context, Israel’s recognition of Somaliland signals something broader: the growing use of secessionist movements as disruptive instruments of geopolitical strategy across the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.</p><p data-start=\"1027\" data-end=\"1556\">What some experts describe as an “Axis of Secession” is already visible in Libya, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Syria. Led by Israel and supported by a network of regional partners, this axis targets countries whose central governments, hollowed out by conflict, exercise only partial control over their territory. The logic is simple: weaken central authority, bolster breakaway regions, and cultivate dependent entities willing to align with Israel and sign onto the Abraham Accords.</p><p data-start=\"1558\" data-end=\"2237\">For Israel, these emerging client polities offer strategic footholds in volatile regions. From them, it can monitor rivals, project power, secure key maritime routes and expand intelligence networks. Over time, Israel also hopes this strategy will coerce “mother states” into reluctantly joining the Abraham Accords themselves. Yet this approach carries a contradiction. Rather than consolidating the accords, it risks destabilising the region further and eroding their legitimacy. Saudi Arabia, long regarded by Washington and Tel Aviv as the ultimate prize of regional normalisation, has taken the lead in assembling a concerted effort to block the Axis of Secession.</p><h2 id=\"the-scramble-for-the-red-sea\">The scramble for the Red Sea</h2><p data-start=\"2273\" data-end=\"2807\">Beyond broader geopolitical rivalries, Israel’s recognition of Somaliland is closely tied to competition over access to the Red Sea. The Bab al-Mandab Strait, which links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, carries around 10 percent of global trade. Control over ports and coastlines along this route confers outsized leverage over international commerce. Somaliland’s long coastline has therefore become a strategic prize. By recognising Somaliland, Israel seeks to entrench itself within the Horn of Africa’s strategic geography.</p><p data-start=\"2809\" data-end=\"3558\">This competition was evident in January 2024, when Ethiopia signed a controversial Memorandum of Understanding with Somaliland, offering political recognition in exchange for access to the sea. For Ethiopia, the world’s most populous landlocked country, the deal carried obvious strategic appeal. Yet it proved short-lived. In December 2024, following Turkish-brokered talks in Ankara, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed on a framework that reaffirmed Somalia’s sovereignty and pointed to sea access arrangements under Somalia’s authority, signalling a retreat from the earlier recognition-for-access logic. The episode highlighted both the fragility of such arrangements and the intensity of the geopolitical contest surrounding Somaliland’s status.</p><p data-start=\"3560\" data-end=\"4138\">China has also become an increasingly active player. Somaliland’s decision to cultivate ties with Taiwan inevitably drew Beijing’s attention, given China’s strict adherence to the “One China” policy and its view of any engagement with Taipei as a direct challenge. At the same time, China has consistently supported Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, using its diplomatic and economic leverage to counter what it sees as destabilising secessionist dynamics. Beijing is now working to dissuade key regional actors, including Ethiopia, from recognising Somaliland.</p><p data-start=\"4140\" data-end=\"4481\">For China, the Horn of Africa is not only about ports, shipping lanes and mineral resources. It is also about preventing the spread of separatist precedents and countering moves that could embolden Taiwan. The result is an increasingly crowded and volatile theatre, where global power rivalries intersect with unresolved local aspirations.</p><h2 id=\"the-new-middle-east-alliance-and-somalia-s-choices\">The new Middle East alliance and Somalia’s choices</h2><p data-start=\"4539\" data-end=\"4879\">Israel’s recognition of Somaliland has accelerated a wider realignment in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, once close partners, are now increasingly at odds, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt have begun coordinating to counter what they view as a destabilising “Axis of Secession”.</p><p data-start=\"4881\" data-end=\"5438\">This shift was first set in motion by the advance of the Southern Transitional Council in Yemen, which announced a transition towards declaring an independent state, and was then sharply reinforced by Israel’s recognition of Somaliland. For Saudi Arabia, these developments represented a direct threat to its sphere of influence and national security. In response, Riyadh has taken the lead in assembling a new regional alignment that brings together Turkey, Egypt and Qatar to push back against secessionist movements and their external sponsors.</p><p data-start=\"5440\" data-end=\"6205\">Each member of this emerging alliance brings distinct concerns. Egypt fears that recognising Somaliland would embolden Ethiopia, with which it remains locked in a bitter dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Turkey, which has invested heavily in Somalia’s security and economic sectors for more than a decade, sees state fragmentation as a direct challenge to its strategic interests in the Horn of Africa. Saudi Arabia views the Axis of Secession as an existential danger, beginning in Yemen, where secessionist advances directly undermine its security. Together, these states are positioning themselves as defenders of sovereignty and regional cohesion, while also coordinating diplomatic efforts to dissuade Washington from following Israel’s lead.</p><p data-start=\"6207\" data-end=\"6837\">For Somalia, the implications are stark. Anchoring its foreign policy within this emerging alliance is no longer a matter of preference but of urgency. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar all have a direct stake in preserving Somalia’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence. Yet Somalia’s external relations has too often been erratic, marked by mixed signals and internal contradictions. At a moment of existential threat, hedging between competing blocs is no longer viable. Somalia must urgently recalibrate its diplomacy, using its geostrategic importance to forge durable and credible partnerships.</p><p data-start=\"6839\" data-end=\"7445\">Equally critical is the need for domestic political cohesion. With parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for May, the Federal Government of Somalia must work to build consensus among key political stakeholders on unresolved and divisive issues, including the controversial 2024 amendments to the Provisional Constitution and the framework for credible elections. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has so far shown limited willingness to compromise. Failure to secure urgent domestic consensus risks creating openings for Israel and its regional proxies to exploit Somalia’s internal divisions.</p><h2 id=\"somaliland-s-paradox\">Somaliland’s paradox</h2><p data-start=\"7473\" data-end=\"7845\">Ironically, Somaliland’s pursuit of international recognition may have been undermined by its reliance on Israel. Israel’s global standing, already severely damaged by its genocide in Gaza, has made recognition by Tel Aviv politically toxic across much of the Arab and Muslim world. Rather than advancing Somaliland’s case, the association risks deepening its isolation.</p><p data-start=\"8304\" data-end=\"8800\">The move also carries domestic consequences. A significant segment of Somaliland’s population opposes normalising relations with Israel, particularly amid widespread claims that Israel is exploring resettlement of Palestinian refugees from Gaza in Somaliland — an allegation the leadership of the breakaway region denies. Instead of consolidating sovereignty, Somaliland now faces the prospect of internal dissent alongside growing external resistance.</p><p data-start=\"8304\" data-end=\"8800\">These challenges are compounded by changing realities on the ground. Somaliland no longer exercises control over all the territory it claims as the former British Somaliland. In July 2025, a new federal member state, the Northeast State of Somalia, was established in large swathes of this territory and swiftly pledged allegiance to the Federal Government of Somalia. Its emergence has reinforced Somalia’s territorial integrity and further weakened Somaliland’s bid for international recognition.</p><p data-start=\"8802\" data-end=\"9474\">At the diplomatic level, Israel’s decision has triggered a wave of international support for Somalia. Key regional and global organisations, including IGAD, the African Union, the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the European Union and India, have all reaffirmed Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Even the United States, Israel’s closest ally, joined other members of the UN Security Council in restating its commitment to Somalia’s unity. What was intended as a breakthrough for Somaliland has instead strengthened Somalia’s diplomatic position, exposing the paradox of recognition in an increasingly fragmented international system.</p><p data-start=\"9476\" data-end=\"9705\">Unless Israel succeeds in persuading US President Donald Trump to recognise Somaliland, an uphill task given the countervailing weight of the Saudi-led alliance, hopes of a wider domino effect appear to have reached a dead end.</p><h2 id=\"when-recognition-backfires\">When recognition backfires</h2><p data-start=\"9739\" data-end=\"10172\">Israel’s recognition of Somaliland is not an isolated act but part of a broader strategy, the so-called Axis of Secession, which exploits fragility in war-torn states from Libya and Yemen to Sudan, Somalia and Syria. By empowering breakaway regions, Israel, with the backing of key regional partners, especially the United Arab Emirates, has sought to reshape the regional order. Instead, it has provoked determined resistance.</p><p data-start=\"10174\" data-end=\"10596\">Ethiopia’s aborted Memorandum of Understanding with Somaliland, China’s assertive defence of Somalia’s sovereignty, and the deepening rupture between Saudi Arabia and the UAE all underscore the volatility and limits of this approach. For Somaliland, the decision to tie its recognition strategy to Israel has backfired, increasing its diplomatic isolation while internal opposition grows and territorial control weakens.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\">For Somalia, the lesson is equally clear. Its survival as a sovereign state now depends on urgency, internal cohesion and firm alignment with the emerging Middle East alliance that has positioned itself against fragmentation and secession. Far from advancing secessionist ambitions, Israel’s recognition of Somaliland has reinforced the international consensus around Somalia’s territorial integrity. It has also exposed the limits of recognition as a geopolitical instrument in an increasingly fractured global order.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty_6961039d90-1767965597.jpg?resize=1920%2C1292",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"505\" data-end=\"833\">Elon Musk recently declared on X that “an immediate increase in the birth rate is needed”. It’s the kind of statement that sounds dramatic, urgent and vaguely civilisational, but it is also profoundly disconnected from reality. However, Musk is far from an isolated voice within the far right and among the world’s billionaires.</p><p data-start=\"835\" data-end=\"1171\">Low birthrates are not a mystery. They are not the result of moral decay, declining ambition or an excess of “woke politics”, but rather the predictable outcome of an economic system in which people are paid too little, work too much and are told to feel personally responsible for structural failures engineered far above their heads.</p><p data-start=\"1173\" data-end=\"1662\">This disconnect is not limited to fertility. The same billionaires and CEOs who lament demographic decline also complain that people do not buy locally, that European industries are losing ground, and that “the West” is becoming economically fragile, with some even calling for bans on Chinese online platforms such as Temu or Shein. And yet, when it comes to solutions, they reliably converge on the same prescriptions: longer working hours, wage restraint, mass layoffs and deregulation.</p><p data-start=\"1664\" data-end=\"1795\">In other words, even when their diagnosis occasionally overlaps with reality, their remedies systematically make the problem worse.</p><p data-start=\"1797\" data-end=\"2302\">Start with wages. Across much of Europe, real wages have stagnated or fallen in recent years. Inflation has eaten into purchasing power, while salary increases have lagged behind the cost of housing, energy, food and childcare. The results are visible in the numbers: the EU’s average fertility rate has fallen to around 1.4 children per woman, well below replacement level. For millions of households, income is no longer a foundation for planning a future, but a constant exercise in damage control.</p><p data-start=\"2304\" data-end=\"2526\">But better wages alone will not make a difference if the cost of living continues to rise. Young people simply cannot buy a home in most European countries and basic living costs have risen several times faster than wages.</p><p data-start=\"2528\" data-end=\"2909\">All of this has direct consequences for fertility. Having children requires not just love or desire, but time, money and a sense of stability. When rent absorbs half your income, when childcare costs rival a second mortgage, and when job security is eroded by endless “restructurings”, choosing not to have children is not a cultural failure, but an economically rational decision.</p><p data-start=\"2911\" data-end=\"3441\">Yet this reality is routinely ignored by those at the top. Musk, for instance, is famous not only for his concern about population decline, but also for championing extreme work cultures. Employees at companies he controls have been told to work “hardcore” hours or leave, and similar messages echo across corporate America and increasingly in Europe: work more, rest less, be grateful, and somehow also find time to have children and buy local products, which are often more expensive than those sold by Chinese online retailers.</p><p data-start=\"3443\" data-end=\"3766\">The contradiction is obvious. You cannot demand longer working days, weekend availability and permanent precarity, and then act surprised when people do not have the time, energy or confidence to raise children. Biology may set limits but economics determines whether people feel safe enough to build families within them.</p><p data-start=\"3768\" data-end=\"3957\">It is also true that falling birthrates in wealthy societies are a long-observed pattern shaped by structural conditions, not simply by “cultural decline” or a lack of desire for children.</p><p data-start=\"3959\" data-end=\"4281\">This leads to a paradox. Wealthy societies tend to have fewer children, so it is often assumed that the problem cannot be economic. But this confuses national wealth with individual security. Rich countries can still be hostile places in which to raise families. What suppresses fertility is not prosperity, but precarity.</p><p data-start=\"4283\" data-end=\"4560\">Where income is concentrated, time is scarce and risk is individualised, having children becomes a gamble rather than a choice. The question, then, is not why people in rich countries have fewer children, but why so many rich countries make family life economically irrational.</p><p data-start=\"4562\" data-end=\"4858\">The same logic applies to consumption. European business leaders often complain that consumers are turning away from local products and towards cheap imports from China. This is framed as a failure of loyalty or taste, and as an imminent danger to Western economies, but the truth is far simpler.</p><p data-start=\"4860\" data-end=\"5169\">People buy cheaply because they are paid poorly. When wages stagnate, price becomes the dominant factor in purchasing decisions, and supporting local producers becomes a luxury, accessible primarily to those insulated from the economic pressures shaping the debate, often the same actors who helped create them.</p><p data-start=\"5171\" data-end=\"5430\">This is where the hypocrisy becomes clear. The same corporate actors who suppress wages through outsourcing, automation and relentless cost-cutting then complain that domestic demand is weak. They hollow out the middle class and then lament its disappearance.</p><p data-start=\"5432\" data-end=\"5922\">None of this is accidental. Extreme inequality is not a side effect of modern economies, but a political choice, actively defended by those who benefit most from it. Millionaires, and especially billionaires, exercise outsized influence over public policy, labour markets and regulatory frameworks. Through lobbying, tax avoidance, media ownership and direct access to decision-makers, they shape economies in ways that concentrate wealth while externalising risk onto workers and families.</p><p data-start=\"5924\" data-end=\"6339\">The result is a system in which insecurity is normalised for the many and optional for the few. When economic power translates so seamlessly into political power, policies that could restore balance, such as higher wages, shorter working hours, progressive taxation, robust public services and wealth taxation, are dismissed as unrealistic, even as the social consequences of inequality become impossible to ignore.</p><p data-start=\"6341\" data-end=\"6805\">It is not uncommon for politicians aligned with economic elites to propose tax cuts for corporations, often through reductions in social contributions and labour protections, while shifting the burden onto the rest of the population under the claim that it will “create jobs”. In this sense, today’s fertility crisis is not a demographic mystery, but a governance failure rooted in the unchecked power of those who profit from scarcity while lamenting its effects.</p><p data-start=\"6807\" data-end=\"7112\">History offers a simple lesson. Henry Ford famously understood that paying workers enough to buy the products they made was not charity, but sound economics. Today’s corporate elite appears to have forgotten that insight, even as it enjoys productivity gains and record profits unimaginable a century ago.</p><p data-start=\"7114\" data-end=\"7392\">Instead, mass layoffs are presented as efficiency. Thousands of highly skilled workers are dismissed, even as executive compensation and shareholder payouts remain intact. Jobs are treated as expendable, families as optional and stability as a privilege rather than a baseline.</p><p data-start=\"7394\" data-end=\"7573\">And when the social consequences become impossible to ignore, billionaires suddenly rediscover “society” and issue pronouncements about what ordinary people should do differently.</p><p data-start=\"7575\" data-end=\"7910\">Despite the complexity of the situation, the core logic is simple. If people do not earn enough to live decently, they will not buy expensive goods, have children or plan long-term futures. If they are expected to be permanently available for work, they will not have the time or emotional capacity to care for families or communities.</p><p data-start=\"7912\" data-end=\"8300\">If billionaires are genuinely concerned about demographic decline, the prescription is not cultural panic or reproductive moralising, or showcasing their own large families, but higher wages, stronger labour protections, affordable housing, accessible childcare and shorter working hours. Above all, reducing the extreme concentration of wealth in the hands of a few would be fundamental.</p><p data-start=\"8302\" data-end=\"8455\">If they are concerned about the decline of local industries, the answer is not scolding consumers, but rebuilding purchasing power and economic security.</p><p data-start=\"8457\" data-end=\"8882\">The uncomfortable truth is that many of today’s elites benefit from the very fragility they decry. Stability, by contrast, requires redistribution, limits and shared responsibility. If billionaires are truly concerned, they should accept heavy taxation on their wealth. Philanthropy and charitable giving, often used as tools for tax avoidance and reputational laundering, are no substitute for democratic accountability.</p><p data-start=\"8884\" data-end=\"9374\">When billionaires demand more babies, more loyalty, more work and more sacrifice, the real question is not why ordinary people are failing to deliver, but why those with the most power refuse to acknowledge their own role in creating the conditions they now condemn. Addressing this crisis ultimately requires political choices that rebalance power towards workers, families and democratic institutions, rather than further entrenching the authority of those who profit from insecurity.</p><p data-start=\"8884\" data-end=\"9374\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

environmentalists criticised the moves as inadequate.</p><p class=\"p1\">Environmentalists, experts and the government pointed the finger at deforestation for its role in <a href=\"/news/2025/12/8/indonesia-counts-human-cost-as-more-climate-change-warnings-sounded\">last year’s disaster</a> that washed torrents of mud and wooden logs into villages across the northwestern

class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p class=\"p1\">The government is seeking 4.8 trillion rupiah ($283.8m) from six companies accused of unspecified damage to an area spanning more than 2,500 hectares, the Ministry of Environment said on Thursday.</p><p class=\"p1\">The sum represents both fines for damage and the proposed monetary value of recovery efforts.</p><p class=\"p1\">The suits were filed to courts on Thursday in Jakarta and North Sumatra’s Medan, the ministry added.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We firmly uphold the principle of polluter pays,” Environment Minister Hanif Faisol Nurofiq said in a statement.</p><p>He added that any corporation that “profits by damaging the ecosystem must be held fully responsible for restoring it”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Environment Ministry declined to offer more details when speaking with the AFP news agency on the alleged damage caused by the defendants, listed in the statement only by their initials.</p><p>The Indonesia Business Post reported that the ministry is also conducting environmental audits on more than 100 companies operating in the provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra and Aceh, quoting Nurofiq as saying that potential criminal suspects will be identified after the audits are completed.</p><p>Separately, a task force comprised of the military, police, Attorney General’s Office, and ministries has identified 12 companies suspected of contributing to flash floods and landslides in Sumatra, The Indonesia Business Post said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p2\">Environmental groups say the government also holds some responsibility when granting companies the right to raze large tracts of land.</p><p class=\"p2\">Greenpeace Indonesia’s forest campaigner Arie Rompas called the lawsuits a “minimalist” move, adding that authorities should comprehensively review policies responsible for the disaster.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Besides the impact of the climate crisis, the flooding was also caused by land degradation, including deforestation, carried out by corporations,” Arie told AFP.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Those companies were granted permits by the government.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Mining, plantations, and fires have caused the clearance of large tracts of lush Indonesian rainforest over recent decades.</p><p class=\"p1\">More than 240,000 hectares of primary forest were lost in 2024, according to analysis by conservation start-up The TreeMap’s Nusantara Atlas project.</p><p class=\"p1\">Forestry Minister Raja Juli Antoni said last month that the government will revoke 22 forestry permits across the country, including permits that encompass more than 100,000 hectares in Sumatra.</p><p class=\"p1\">Antoni did not specify whether the decision was linked to the disaster, though he earlier said that the floods provide an opportunity to “evaluate our policies”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The “pendulum between the economy and ecology seems to have swung too far towards the economy and needs to be pulled back to the centre,” Antoni said at the time.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Currently, just one remand prisoner, Umer Khalid, continues to refuse food.</p><p>“I was willing to go the distance,” said Ahmed, who is also from London and had worked as a mechanic. “But others were not willing to see me walk a mile further.”</p><p>Described by loved ones as having become paper-thin, Ahmed has lost 25 percent of his body weight. His heart muscle has shrunk, he suffers from chest pains and has lost hearing in one ear. His speech was slurring, and walking took so much energy it made him breathless.</p><p>On Monday, when they last spoke by phone, his sister Shahmina Alam, a pharmacist, urged him to consider ending the strike.</p><p>“We just knew that it’s coming to a point where it’s really dangerous and actually, the probability of death was very high,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Alam and physicians consulting the group are concerned that the hunger strikers may have already suffered irreversible health damage, as long-term symptoms related to starvation can take years to show. There are also fears around refeeding, which can be fatal if mismanaged.</p><p>Ahmed was hospitalised again this week, the seventh time since the protest began.</p><p>The collective held at various prisons includes Qesser Zuhrah; Amu Gib; Muraisi; Teuta Hoxha; Ahmed; Chiaramello; Jon Cink and Khalid, who has muscular dystrophy and has been on hunger strike for seven days.</p><p>All will have spent more than a year in prison before their trials are expected to take place later this year, far beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p><p>Some of the group, known as part of the “Filton 24”, are alleged to have participated in a break-in at the UK subsidiary of Israel’s largest arms manufacturer, Elbit Systems, in Bristol. Others are accused of involvement in a break-in at a Royal Air Force (RAF) base in Oxfordshire. They deny the charges against them, such as burglary and criminal damage.</p><p>Palestine Action, the group they are allegedly linked to, claimed responsibility for both incidents.</p><p>Six of those charged in the Bristol action are currently on trial.</p><h2 id=\"were-the-hunger-strikers-demands-met\">Were the hunger strikers’ demands met?</h2><p>The collective had five key protest demands, including immediate bail, the guarantee of a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action.</p><p>They also called for all 16 of Elbit’s sites in the UK to be closed and demanded an end to what they call censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls and books.</p><p>Throughout the protest, the government said the group would face a fair trial, that it had no power over the issue of bail, as this is a matter for the judiciary, and that prison welfare procedures were being followed. It has not commented on the end of the latest hunger strikes.</p><p>Elbit Systems, a target of Palestine Action’s campaign, describes its drones, which have been used extensively in Gaza to deadly effect, as “the backbone” of Israel’s drone fleet.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/what-is-the-palestine-action-group-and-why-is-the-uk-banning-it\">Palestine Action</a> had been calling to “shut Elbit down” before it was outlawed as a “terrorist organisation” in July, putting it on par with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. The group, which said it backed direct action without violence and accused the UK of complicity in Israel’s atrocities, is fighting the ban in courts.</p><p>In the later stages of the hunger strike, the group added a further demand – that Muraisi be returned to Bronzefield prison near her home, having been moved to a jail in northern England.</p><p>That will now happen, said Prisoners for Palestine, an activist-led group that supports the collective’s families, hailing the transfer as a triumph.</p><p>Prisoners for Palestine has claimed several “victories” – primarily the UK government’s recent decision, reported by The Times newspaper, against awarding Elbit Systems UK a 2-billion-pound ($2.68bn) army training contract. The contract is instead reportedly going to Raytheon UK, the subsidiary of the US defence firm, which also has several deals with the Israeli military. Back in October 2023, Raytheon’s CEO said the company would “benefit” as the “war in Gaza or in Israel … will eventually lead to additional orders”.</p><p>“Obviously we will never know – and I don’t think they’ll ever admit – how much of an influence the hunger strike had on [the contract decision against Elbit],” Alam, Ahmed’s sister, said.</p><p>“There were some wins,” she added, such as raising awareness about Elbit’s role in Israel’s genocide and the overuse of pre-trial detention in the UK.</p><h2 id=\"there-has-been-some-concessions-by-government-mp\">‘There has been some concessions by government’: MP</h2><p>The group’s supporters have also claimed victory.</p><p>“There has been some concessions by government,” said John McDonnell, a Labour MP, as he paid tribute to the hunger strikers’ “dedication”.</p><p>Prisoners for Palestine said it considers as another success the offer of a meeting between Hoxha and the head of JEXU (Joint Extremism Unit) at her prison. Hoxha had claimed she was being monitored by the JEXU task force and that it had ordered prison officers to strip her of a library job in jail.</p><p>The group also saw as a win its meeting with prison healthcare leaders “at the behest of the Ministry of Justice”, and the “bulk” release of mail it alleged had been “withheld”.</p><p>“Books on topics of Gaza and feminism have also been given [to the prisoners] after months of waiting,” the group said.</p><p>The protest is said to have been the largest coordinated hunger strike in UK history since 1981, when Irish Republican inmates were led by Bobby Sands. Sands died on the 66th day of his protest, becoming a symbol of the Irish Republican cause. Nine others also died of starvation.</p><p>“Our prisoners’ hunger strike will be remembered as a landmark moment of pure defiance; an embarrassment for the British state,” said Prisoners for Palestine, which offers “direct action training” on its website.</p><p>“While these prisoners end their hunger strike, the resistance has just begun,” said the group, adding that 500 people have recently expressed interest in taking “direct action against the genocidal military-industrial complex”.</p><p>It added that in pursuit of a fair trial, the hunger strikers had demanded the disclosure of export licences for the last five years from Elbit Systems. “After repeated requests, this information was disclosed to an independent researcher by the Department of Trade during the hunger strike,” it said, hailing another “victory”.</p><p>Alam said she imagines Ahmed will have had a few cups of tea since the hunger strike ended. He requested soya milk, she said, as it is easier on the stomach.</p><p>The government does not “get to decide whether these guys live or don’t live”, she said.</p><p>“At the end of the day, it’s their decision, and that’s what they did.</p><p>“They took back control.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But about 350 kids and teens – some of the nation’s best young cross-country skiers and biathletes – still practise in fenced-off areas amid the sporadic buzz of drones passing overhead, then explosions as they’re shot down.</p><p>“We have adapted so well — even the children — that sometimes we don’t even react,” Mykola Vorchak, a 67-year-old coach, said. “Although it goes against safety rules, the children have been hardened by the war. Adapting to this has changed them psychologically.”</p><p>War has taken a heavy toll on Ukrainian sport. Athletes were displaced or called up to fight. Football matches are often interrupted by air raid sirens, so attendance is capped by bomb shelter capacity. Elite skaters, skiers and biathletes usually train abroad, with attacks and frequent blackouts shuttering local facilities.</p><p>But the government-run Sports Ski Base of the Olympic Reserve is open for cross-country skiing and biathlon, the event which combines skiing with shooting. The sprawling complex is on the outskirts of Chernihiv, a city two hours north of Kyiv along the path of destruction that Russia’s army left in its 2022 attempt to capture the capital. Chernihiv remains a regular target for air attacks aimed at the power grid and civilian infrastructure.</p><p>Several temporary structures at the sports centre serve as changing rooms, toilets and coaches’ offices. Athletes train on snowy trails during the winter and, throughout the rest of the year, use roller skis on an asphalt track pocked by blast marks.</p><p>Biathletes aim laser rifles at electronic targets and, between shooting drills, sling skis over their shoulders and jog back to the start of the course, cheeks flushed from the cold.</p><h2 id=\"ukraine-s-first-olympic-medal\">Ukraine’s first Olympic medal</h2><p>Valentyna Tserbe-Nesina spent her adolescence at the Chernihiv centre performing these same drills, and won bronze at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer. It was Ukraine’s first Olympic medal as an independent country.</p><p>“The conditions weren’t great, but we had nothing better. And for us, it was like a family — our own little home,” she said inside her apartment, its shelves and walls lined with medals, trophies and souvenirs from competitions around the world.</p><p>Tserbe-Nesina, 56, was shocked when she visited the complex in 2022. Shelling had torn through buildings, fire had consumed others. Shattered glass littered the floors of rooms where she and friends once excitedly checked taped-up results sheets.</p><p>“I went inside, up to my old room on the second floor. It was gone — no windows, nothing,” she said. “I recorded a video and found the trophies we had left at the base. They were completely burned.”</p><p>Tserbe-Nesina has been volunteering to organise funerals for fallen Ukrainian soldiers in her hometown while her husband, a retired military officer, returned to the front. They see each other about once a year, whenever his unit allows him brief leave.</p><p>One adult who in 2022 completed a tour in a territorial defence unit of Ukraine’s army sometimes trains today alongside the centre’s youngsters. Khrystyna Dmytrenko, 26, will represent her country at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics that start on February 6.</p><p>“Sports can show that Ukraine is strong,” Dmytrenko said in an interview next to the shooting range. “We represent Ukraine on the international stage, letting other countries, athletes and nations see our unity, strength and determination.”</p><p>The International Olympic Committee imposed bans and restrictions on Russian athletes after the invasion of Ukraine, effectively extending earlier sanctions tied to state‑sponsored doping. But a small group of them will participate in the upcoming Winter Games.</p><p>After vetting to ensure no military affiliation, they must compete without displaying any national symbols — and only in non-team events. That means Russian and Ukrainian athletes could face one another in some skating and skiing events. Moscow’s appeal at the federation level to allow its biathletes to compete is pending.</p><p>That’s why many Ukrainians view training for these events as an act of defiance. Former Olympic biathlete Nina Lemesh, 52, noted that some young Ukrainians who first picked up rifles and skis at the Chernihiv ski base during wartime have become international champions in their age groups.</p><p>“Fortunately, Ukrainians remain here. They always will,” she said, standing beside the destroyed dormitories. “This is the next generation of Olympians.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The STC is now divided, with one leader on the run, and others declaring that the group had been dissolved.</p><p>The Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), Yemen’s UN-recognised authority led by President Rashad al-Alimi, has seized the initiative and, on January 10, established the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/yemens-saudi-backed-government-retakes-southern-areas-from-stc-what-next\">Supreme Military Committee (SMC)</a>, with the goal of overseeing all anti-Houthi military units, and integrating them into the official Yemeni military, under one command.</p><p>Al-Alimi said that the SMC would ultimately be a vehicle to defeat the Houthis, and reclaim all of Yemen.</p><p>The SMC announcement marks a dramatic twist in the decade-long war, and Naef is now – finally – hopeful.</p><p>“I am optimistic today as the government has revived some of its power in southern Yemen,” he told Al Jazeera. “The formation of an inclusive military committee is a boost to our morale and a prelude to a powerful government comeback.”</p><p>The soldier believes that, after years of inertia, the tide has finally turned for the government. After nine years of experience on multiple frontlines, Naef now thinks that the government – with the backing of Saudi Arabia – is capable of pushing into Houthi-controlled northwestern Yemen, should negotiations fail.</p><p>“The PLC has achieved remarkable success in the south over the past few weeks with support from the Saudi leadership. It has once again proven to be an indispensable party to the conflict. Whether this success will be short-lived or lasting remains to be seen,” said Naef.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4238467\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4238467\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4238467\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_Yemen_afterSTC_Jan13_2026-01-1768404152.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Yemen_Control_Map_Jan14_2026_REVISED\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4238467\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"concerns-and-defiance\">Concerns and defiance</h2><p>The formation of the SMC has unleashed a sense of concern among Houthi supporters in northern Yemen.</p><p>Hamza Abdu, a 24-year-old Houthi supporter in Sanaa, describes the new military committee as an “attempt to organise the proxies in the south”.</p><p>“This committee may end the friction between the militant groups in the south, but it will deepen the south’s subjugation to Saudi Arabia,” Hamza said. The Houthis have often framed their opponents as being proxies controlled by foreign powers, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They themselves are backed by Iran.</p><p>In light of the developments, Hamza shared a concern: the resumption of the war between the Houthis and their opponents, which has largely been frozen since 2022.</p><p>“If this military committee succeeded in uniting the forces in the south, that might entice them to attack the north,” he said. “A new destructive war will begin, and the humanitarian ordeal will magnify.”</p><p>Like many ordinary citizens, Hamza is now fearful that the war will restart. But Houthi leaders – while warning that their forces should stay alert – are still confident, saying that the formation of the SMC will not affect their power or weaken their control.</p><p>Aziz Rashid, a pro-Houthi military expert, believes that the SMC will not alter the status quo, arguing that any future confrontation with the Houthis “will only serve the agendas and plans of the United States-supported Zionist entity [Israel]”.</p><p>Rashid indicated that Houthi forces in Sanaa “confronted international and powerful military forces, including the <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/5/1/animated-maps-show-us-led-attacks-on-yemen\">United States</a>, Britain and Israel, and stood firm against the [Saudi-led Arab] coalition during the past 10 years”.</p><p>The only solution for Yemen, Rashid said, was a political settlement.</p><p>The Iran-backed Houthis took over Sanaa in September 2014 and <a href=\"/news/2015/2/6/yemens-houthis-form-own-government-in-sanaa\">toppled</a> the UN-recognised government in February 2015. They insist they are the only legitimate authority governing Yemen.</p><p>The Houthis have faced attacks from the US, the United Kingdom, and Israel since 2023, when the Yemeni group began attacking shipping in the Red Sea and Israel itself, in what the Houthis declared was solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-terrifying-message\">A terrifying message</h2><p>Defeating the Houthis will be easier said than done, considering the Saudi-backed coalition’s failure to do so with overwhelming air power in the early years of the war, and the group’s now extensive combat experience and possession of advanced weapons, including drones and missiles.</p><p>But if the Yemeni military does truly reorganise itself and integrate the different anti-Houthi forces on the ground, the opportunity may be there.</p><p>Adel Dashela, a Yemeni researcher and non-resident fellow at MESA Global Academy, said that if the SMC is able to provide security and stability in territory under its control, it may also be able to improve the lives of Yemenis living there – and put itself in a stronger position in any negotiations with the Houthis.</p><p>“The next stage is the start of a political process to reach an agreement with the Houthi group. If the peaceful option fails, the military action becomes necessary,” Dashela told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Abdulsalam Mohammed, the head of the Yemeni Abaad Studies and Research Center, believes that recent events – both inside and outside Yemen – provide the government with a perfect opportunity to confront the Houthis.</p><p>“A limited military operation routed the UAE-backed STC within a few days,” Mohammed said. “What happened to the STC in the south carried a terrifying message to the Houthis in the north. The Houthis are not invincible.”</p><p>According to Mohammed, some factors have magnified the vulnerability of the Houthis at present.</p><p>He explained, “Iran is undergoing a massive crisis, and this can weaken Tehran’s Houthi proxy. The popular silent rage against the group keeps growing, given the economic and governance issues in areas under their control. Moreover, <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/30/live-yemens-presidential-council-cancels-uae-defence-deal\">the exit of the UAE</a> from the south will enable the Yemeni government to shift the battle to the Houthis in the north.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desperate-for-order\">Desperate for order</h2><p>Armed groups in Yemen have proliferated over the last decade. The outcome has been a weakened government and a prolonged war. Amid the chaos, the population has borne the brunt.</p><p>Fawaz Ahmed, a 33-year-old resident of the southern city of Aden, is hopeful that the establishment of a military committee will end the presence of armed groups in Aden and other southern cities.</p><p>Fawaz expects Aden to get two immediate benefits from the formation of the SMC: an end to unlawful money collection by fighters and the disappearance of infighting between competing armed units.</p><p>He recalled an incident last August in Aden’s Khormaksar district, when two military units clashed at the headquarters of the Immigration and Passports Authority, leading to the closure of the facility for days.</p><p>“The commanders of the armed groups issued conflicting directions, and soldiers opened fire on each other. This clearly points to the absence of a united leadership. So, the declared military committee will prevent such face-offs,” said Fawaz.</p><p>“We are desperate for law and order,” Fawaz said. “Desperate for a city free from an unneeded military presence. This is a collective dream in Aden. Only united military leadership can achieve this.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

At the height of their rivalry, Federer and Nadal toured the world together, playing exhibitions and supporting charities across Europe and Africa.</p><p class=\"pf0\">In Seoul, Alcaraz and Sinner offered a glimpse of a similar dynamic.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Over four days, the pair were almost inseparable.</p><p class=\"pf0\">After their opening news conference, Alcaraz and Sinner moved to the lobby, where cheering employees watched the pair laugh their way through a friendly table tennis match.</p><p class=\"pf0\">In keeping with the marketing needs of the time, Sincaraz filmed playful short videos, completed trending challenges and fielded light-hearted questions.

Alcaraz is chasing his first title at the event to complete his career Grand Slam, while Sinner has his own opportunity to do so later this year at Roland Garros in Paris.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Despite their friendly exchanges in South Korea, the players were mindful of the competitive nature of their relationship.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Today’s game is helpful to see if Jannik changes something in his game,” Alcaraz quipped after the exhibition match. “I wouldn’t say [he did today],” he added, hinting that both are careful not to reveal too much to each other.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“I wouldn’t take anything from today’s match. We will see in Australia. I will watch his matches for sure.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">In addition to paying close attention to “the small details” of his rival’s game, Sinner also stressed that the two rivals’ dominance offers little margin for complacency.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“At the moment, there are many other great players. So, if we drop [our level] just a little bit, they’re going to take our place,” the defending Australian Open champion said. “So, it’s great to have [Carlos] push me to the limit. Hopefully, I can improve every time when we play.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">Only a small group of players have beaten either man in recent years.</p><p class=\"pf0\">The United Kingdom’s No 1, Jack Draper, defeated Alcaraz in the semifinals of Indian Wells – the so-called “fifth grand slam” – last season, while attention in Melbourne will again fall on Novak Djokovic, the 24-time Grand Slam champion chasing an 11th Australian Open title.</p><p class=\"pf0\">After flying to Australia together on a private jet, Alcaraz and Sinner were seen high-fiving during practice on Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday. The tournament begins Sunday, and – as in the past two years – they start from opposite ends of the draw. Many are already anticipating another “Sincaraz” final.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Federal prosecutors charged dozens of defendants beginning in 2022 – before Trump’s current term – and have filed more charges since Trump took office a year ago.</p><p>So far, the Minnesota fraud charges involve a minimum of hundreds of millions of dollars. Assistant US Attorney Joe Thompson, who led Minnesota fraud prosecutions, said in December that Medicaid fraud in the state could reach $9bn although not all of that would be federal money. Thompson resigned on Tuesday.</p><p>But adding the dollars lost to fraud in Minnesota to federal losses elsewhere – which have been estimated as high as $521bn annually – would not bring the total close to the amount of the federal deficit. The fiscal year 2025 deficit – that year’s difference between revenues and spending – was $1.775 trillion.</p><p>“You can’t balance the books on waste, fraud and abuse,” said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks the federal budget. “It’s important to root it out, but the only way you get anywhere close to a balanced budget is fiscal restraint.”</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry for this article.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"federal-report-in-2024-found-hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-in-fraud\">Federal report in 2024 found hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud</h2><p>In April 2024, during the tenure of former President Joe Biden, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) produced what it called a “first-of-its-kind, government-wide estimate of federal dollars lost to fraud”.</p><p>The office estimated $233bn to $521bn lost in fraud per year, based on 2018 to 2022 data from agency inspectors general and fraud reports submitted to the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p>The GAO’s topline figure included not only official fraud findings from legal proceedings but also estimates based on individual agencies’ findings of fraud. The agency also extrapolated figures it believed represented undetected fraud.</p><p>The estimated annual losses amounted to 3 percent to 7 percent of what the government spent on average in those years.</p><p>Joshua Sewell, director of research and policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense, previously cautioned that the GAO report is filled with caveats, including its overlap with the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in increased spending.</p><p>Still, “it’s very, very unlikely that there is enough fraud in the federal government to balance the budget,” said Chris Towner, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group. “For the $1.775 trillion deficit for that year to have been due to fraud, it would mean that one-quarter of federal spending was fraudulent, or some combination of fraudulent lost tax revenue and federal outlays totalled that amount.”</p><p>Another challenge is that fraud is not easy to root out entirely. Historically, “only a small percentage of tax dollars lost to fraud are ever actually recovered by the government,” said Bob Westbrooks, a fraud and corruption risk expert who served as executive director of the federal government’s Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-administration-has-sought-to-investigate-fraud-in-blue-states\">Trump administration has sought to investigate fraud in blue states</h2><p>In recent weeks, Trump, a Republican, has spotlighted fraud in blue states, or states that generally vote Democratic, such as Minnesota. But there have been notable high-dollar fraud investigations in other states too.</p><p>In Mississippi, a solidly Republican state, a trial is under way in a welfare scandal that auditors said resulted in the loss of $100m in federal money from 2016 to 2020.</p><p>In 2024, the US Sentencing Commission pointed to the Southern District of Florida as the nation’s top district for fraud, adding that nationwide offences related to government benefits fraud had increased by 242 percent since 2020. Florida is also a red, or Republican, state.</p><p>This month, the US Department of Health and Human Services froze access to certain <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/trump-administration-freezes-minnesota-childcare-funds-over-fraud-claims\">childcare and family assistance funds</a> for California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – all blue states – saying it was related to fraud concerns. A federal judge blocked it temporarily.</p><h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2><p>Trump said: “If we stop this fraud, this massive fraud, we’re going to have a balanced budget.”</p><p>The amount of fraud committed against federal programmes is large, but the dollar amount does not come close to equalling the dollar amount of the federal deficit.</p><p>The highest nationwide fraud estimate puts fraud losses at $521bn. If all of that could be recouped, it would still be less than one-third of the 2025 deficit.</p><p>We rate the statement <strong>false</strong>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The law has provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health, and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.</p><p class=\"p1\">Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2m) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.</p><p class=\"p1\">To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder’s face, or make inferences from data already available, such has how long an account has been held.</p><p class=\"p1\">About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country’s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84 percent of eight to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million “deactivated or restricted” was encouraging.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We’re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,” Inman Grant said.</p><p class=\"p1\">The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia’s regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Australian officials didn’t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect, it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.</p><p class=\"p1\">In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticised the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn’t apply might not prioritise safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms – a concern that led to the ban’s enactment.</p><p class=\"p1\">The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia’s sprawling rural areas.</p><p class=\"p1\">Some said they had managed to fool age-assessing technologies or were helped by parents or older siblings to circumvent the ban.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Since Australia began debating the measures in 2024, other countries have considered following suit. Denmark’s government is among them, saying in November that it had planned to implement a social media ban for children under 15.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The fact that in spite of some scepticism out there, it’s working and being replicated now around the world, is something that is a source of Australian pride,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday.</p><p class=\"p1\">Opposition politicians have suggested that young people have circumvented the ban easily or are migrating to other apps that are less scrutinised than the largest platforms. Inman Grant said on Friday that data seen by her office showed a spike in downloads of alternative apps when the ban was enacted but not a spike in usage.</p><p class=\"p1\">“There is no real long-term trends yet that we can say but we’re engaging,” she said.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, she said, the regulator she heads planned to introduce “world-leading AI companion and chatbot restrictions in March,” although she did not disclose further details.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Hamas has also returned 27 of the 28 bodies of deceased captives, while the search is still on for the remaining body, believed to be buried under the rubble of buildings bombed by Israel.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4169501\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-GAZA-CEASEFIRE-DEC-12-2025_Captive-bodies-1765554407.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-GAZA CEASEFIRE-DEC 12, 2025_Captive bodies-1765554407\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>However, Suhail al-Hindi, a member of the Hamas political bureau and one of the supervisors of the exchange deal, told Al Jazeera that Israel has failed to release all women and child prisoners as stipulated in the agreement.</p><p>It also continues to hold several <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/who-are-the-95-palestinian-healthcare-workers-held-captive-by-israel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doctors</a>, including Dr Hussam Abu Safia, Dr Marwan al-Hams, and Dr Tasneem al-Hams, among many others.</p><p>Israel has also reneged on a clause in the agreement under which it was to allow the entry of DNA-matching equipment intended to identify the bodies of deceased Palestinian prisoners.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>3. Israeli withdrawal</h3><p><em>Status: Did not fully withdraw</em></p><p>As part of the ceasefire deal, Israel was supposed to withdraw its troops to an area dubbed the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/9/map-of-gaza-shows-how-israeli-forces-will-withdraw-under-ceasefire-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“yellow line”</a>, which takes up more than 50 percent of Gaza and is marked on the ground with a series of yellow concrete blocks.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency found that Israeli forces have been moving these blocks, thereby <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/israel-extends-gaza-occupation-beyond-yellow-line-in-north-bombs-south\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expanding</a> their areas of control and forcing Palestinians into increasingly smaller clusters. Israel has also carried out large-scale demolitions of neighbourhoods and surrounding areas near the yellow line.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3 id=\"surge-in-humanitarian-aid\">4. Full humanitarian aid</h3><p><em>Status: Israel continues to restrict aid</em></p><p>The ceasefire stipulated that “full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip”. However, the reality on the ground remains very different. Israel continues to restrict aid.</p><p>According to the Gaza Government Media Office, from October 10, 2025 to January 9, 2026, only 23,019 trucks entered Gaza out of 54,000, averaging 255 trucks per day. That is only 43 percent of the trucks that were supposed to have been allowed in.</p><p>Israel has blocked essential and nutritious food items, including meat, dairy, and vegetables, crucial for a balanced diet. Instead, non-nutritious foodstuffs are being allowed, such as snacks, chocolate, crisps and soft drinks.</p><p>In addition, Israel has banned more than three dozen <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/which-aid-groups-is-israel-banning-from-gaza-now-and-what-will-it-mean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">international organisations</a>, including Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF; Oxfam; the Norwegian Refugee Council; CARE International; the International Rescue Committee and several other charities from operating in Gaza, further worsening already dire conditions for Palestinians.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4039441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Interactive_WorldFoodDay_October16_2025-02-1760613587.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_WorldFoodDay_October16_2025-01-1760613556\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h3>5.
