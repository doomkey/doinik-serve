            "time": "2026-01-16T10:59:33",
            "imgUrl": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/getty_6961039d90-1767965597.jpg?resize=1920%2C1292",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"505\" data-end=\"833\">Elon Musk recently declared on X that “an immediate increase in the birth rate is needed”. It’s the kind of statement that sounds dramatic, urgent and vaguely civilisational, but it is also profoundly disconnected from reality. However, Musk is far from an isolated voice within the far right and among the world’s billionaires.</p><p data-start=\"835\" data-end=\"1171\">Low birthrates are not a mystery. They are not the result of moral decay, declining ambition or an excess of “woke politics”, but rather the predictable outcome of an economic system in which people are paid too little, work too much and are told to feel personally responsible for structural failures engineered far above their heads.</p><p data-start=\"1173\" data-end=\"1662\">This disconnect is not limited to fertility. The same billionaires and CEOs who lament demographic decline also complain that people do not buy locally, that European industries are losing ground, and that “the West” is becoming economically fragile, with some even calling for bans on Chinese online platforms such as Temu or Shein. And yet, when it comes to solutions, they reliably converge on the same prescriptions: longer working hours, wage restraint, mass layoffs and deregulation.</p><p data-start=\"1664\" data-end=\"1795\">In other words, even when their diagnosis occasionally overlaps with reality, their remedies systematically make the problem worse.</p><p data-start=\"1797\" data-end=\"2302\">Start with wages. Across much of Europe, real wages have stagnated or fallen in recent years. Inflation has eaten into purchasing power, while salary increases have lagged behind the cost of housing, energy, food and childcare. The results are visible in the numbers: the EU’s average fertility rate has fallen to around 1.4 children per woman, well below replacement level. For millions of households, income is no longer a foundation for planning a future, but a constant exercise in damage control.</p><p data-start=\"2304\" data-end=\"2526\">But better wages alone will not make a difference if the cost of living continues to rise. Young people simply cannot buy a home in most European countries and basic living costs have risen several times faster than wages.</p><p data-start=\"2528\" data-end=\"2909\">All of this has direct consequences for fertility. Having children requires not just love or desire, but time, money and a sense of stability. When rent absorbs half your income, when childcare costs rival a second mortgage, and when job security is eroded by endless “restructurings”, choosing not to have children is not a cultural failure, but an economically rational decision.</p><p data-start=\"2911\" data-end=\"3441\">Yet this reality is routinely ignored by those at the top. Musk, for instance, is famous not only for his concern about population decline, but also for championing extreme work cultures. Employees at companies he controls have been told to work “hardcore” hours or leave, and similar messages echo across corporate America and increasingly in Europe: work more, rest less, be grateful, and somehow also find time to have children and buy local products, which are often more expensive than those sold by Chinese online retailers.</p><p data-start=\"3443\" data-end=\"3766\">The contradiction is obvious. You cannot demand longer working days, weekend availability and permanent precarity, and then act surprised when people do not have the time, energy or confidence to raise children. Biology may set limits but economics determines whether people feel safe enough to build families within them.</p><p data-start=\"3768\" data-end=\"3957\">It is also true that falling birthrates in wealthy societies are a long-observed pattern shaped by structural conditions, not simply by “cultural decline” or a lack of desire for children.</p><p data-start=\"3959\" data-end=\"4281\">This leads to a paradox. Wealthy societies tend to have fewer children, so it is often assumed that the problem cannot be economic. But this confuses national wealth with individual security. Rich countries can still be hostile places in which to raise families. What suppresses fertility is not prosperity, but precarity.</p><p data-start=\"4283\" data-end=\"4560\">Where income is concentrated, time is scarce and risk is individualised, having children becomes a gamble rather than a choice. The question, then, is not why people in rich countries have fewer children, but why so many rich countries make family life economically irrational.</p><p data-start=\"4562\" data-end=\"4858\">The same logic applies to consumption. European business leaders often complain that consumers are turning away from local products and towards cheap imports from China. This is framed as a failure of loyalty or taste, and as an imminent danger to Western economies, but the truth is far simpler.</p><p data-start=\"4860\" data-end=\"5169\">People buy cheaply because they are paid poorly. When wages stagnate, price becomes the dominant factor in purchasing decisions, and supporting local producers becomes a luxury, accessible primarily to those insulated from the economic pressures shaping the debate, often the same actors who helped create them.</p><p data-start=\"5171\" data-end=\"5430\">This is where the hypocrisy becomes clear. The same corporate actors who suppress wages through outsourcing, automation and relentless cost-cutting then complain that domestic demand is weak. They hollow out the middle class and then lament its disappearance.</p><p data-start=\"5432\" data-end=\"5922\">None of this is accidental. Extreme inequality is not a side effect of modern economies, but a political choice, actively defended by those who benefit most from it. Millionaires, and especially billionaires, exercise outsized influence over public policy, labour markets and regulatory frameworks. Through lobbying, tax avoidance, media ownership and direct access to decision-makers, they shape economies in ways that concentrate wealth while externalising risk onto workers and families.</p><p data-start=\"5924\" data-end=\"6339\">The result is a system in which insecurity is normalised for the many and optional for the few. When economic power translates so seamlessly into political power, policies that could restore balance, such as higher wages, shorter working hours, progressive taxation, robust public services and wealth taxation, are dismissed as unrealistic, even as the social consequences of inequality become impossible to ignore.</p><p data-start=\"6341\" data-end=\"6805\">It is not uncommon for politicians aligned with economic elites to propose tax cuts for corporations, often through reductions in social contributions and labour protections, while shifting the burden onto the rest of the population under the claim that it will “create jobs”. In this sense, today’s fertility crisis is not a demographic mystery, but a governance failure rooted in the unchecked power of those who profit from scarcity while lamenting its effects.</p><p data-start=\"6807\" data-end=\"7112\">History offers a simple lesson. Henry Ford famously understood that paying workers enough to buy the products they made was not charity, but sound economics. Today’s corporate elite appears to have forgotten that insight, even as it enjoys productivity gains and record profits unimaginable a century ago.</p><p data-start=\"7114\" data-end=\"7392\">Instead, mass layoffs are presented as efficiency. Thousands of highly skilled workers are dismissed, even as executive compensation and shareholder payouts remain intact. Jobs are treated as expendable, families as optional and stability as a privilege rather than a baseline.</p><p data-start=\"7394\" data-end=\"7573\">And when the social consequences become impossible to ignore, billionaires suddenly rediscover “society” and issue pronouncements about what ordinary people should do differently.</p><p data-start=\"7575\" data-end=\"7910\">Despite the complexity of the situation, the core logic is simple. If people do not earn enough to live decently, they will not buy expensive goods, have children or plan long-term futures. If they are expected to be permanently available for work, they will not have the time or emotional capacity to care for families or communities.</p><p data-start=\"7912\" data-end=\"8300\">If billionaires are genuinely concerned about demographic decline, the prescription is not cultural panic or reproductive moralising, or showcasing their own large families, but higher wages, stronger labour protections, affordable housing, accessible childcare and shorter working hours. Above all, reducing the extreme concentration of wealth in the hands of a few would be fundamental.</p><p data-start=\"8302\" data-end=\"8455\">If they are concerned about the decline of local industries, the answer is not scolding consumers, but rebuilding purchasing power and economic security.</p><p data-start=\"8457\" data-end=\"8882\">The uncomfortable truth is that many of today’s elites benefit from the very fragility they decry. Stability, by contrast, requires redistribution, limits and shared responsibility. If billionaires are truly concerned, they should accept heavy taxation on their wealth. Philanthropy and charitable giving, often used as tools for tax avoidance and reputational laundering, are no substitute for democratic accountability.</p><p data-start=\"8884\" data-end=\"9374\">When billionaires demand more babies, more loyalty, more work and more sacrifice, the real question is not why ordinary people are failing to deliver, but why those with the most power refuse to acknowledge their own role in creating the conditions they now condemn. Addressing this crisis ultimately requires political choices that rebalance power towards workers, families and democratic institutions, rather than further entrenching the authority of those who profit from insecurity.</p><p data-start=\"8884\" data-end=\"9374\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

more than 2,500 hectares, the Ministry of Environment said on Thursday.</p><p class=\"p1\">The sum represents both fines for damage and the proposed monetary value of recovery efforts.</p><p class=\"p1\">The suits were filed to courts on Thursday in Jakarta and North Sumatra’s Medan, the ministry added.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We firmly uphold the principle of polluter pays,” Environment Minister Hanif Faisol Nurofiq said in a statement.</p><p>He added that any corporation that “profits by damaging the ecosystem must be held fully responsible for restoring it”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Environment Ministry declined to offer more details when speaking with the AFP news agency on the alleged damage caused by the defendants, listed in the statement only by their initials.</p><p>The Indonesia Business Post reported that the ministry is also conducting environmental audits on more than 100 companies operating in the provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra and Aceh, quoting Nurofiq as saying that potential criminal suspects will be identified after the audits are completed.</p><p>Separately, a task force comprised of the military, police, Attorney General’s Office, and ministries has identified 12 companies suspected of contributing to flash floods and landslides in Sumatra, The Indonesia Business Post said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p2\">Environmental groups say the government also holds some responsibility when granting companies the right to raze large tracts of land.</p><p class=\"p2\">Greenpeace Indonesia’s forest campaigner Arie Rompas called the lawsuits a “minimalist” move, adding that authorities should comprehensively review policies responsible for the disaster.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Besides the impact of the climate crisis, the flooding was also caused by land degradation, including deforestation, carried out by corporations,” Arie told AFP.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Those companies were granted permits by the government.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Mining, plantations, and fires have caused the clearance of large tracts of lush Indonesian rainforest over recent decades.</p><p class=\"p1\">More than 240,000 hectares of primary forest were lost in 2024, according to analysis by conservation start-up The TreeMap’s Nusantara Atlas project.</p><p class=\"p1\">Forestry Minister Raja Juli Antoni said last month that the government will revoke 22 forestry permits across the country, including permits that encompass more than 100,000 hectares in Sumatra.</p><p class=\"p1\">Antoni did not specify whether the decision was linked to the disaster, though he earlier said that the floods provide an opportunity to “evaluate our policies”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The “pendulum between the economy and ecology

Currently, just one remand prisoner, Umer Khalid, continues to refuse food.</p><p>“I was willing to go the distance,” said Ahmed, who is also from London and had worked as a mechanic. “But others were not willing to see me walk a mile further.”</p><p>Described by loved ones as having become paper-thin, Ahmed has lost 25 percent of his body weight. His heart muscle has shrunk, he suffers from chest pains and has lost hearing in one ear. His speech was slurring, and walking took so much energy it made him breathless.</p><p>On Monday, when they last spoke by phone, his sister Shahmina Alam, a pharmacist, urged him to consider ending the strike.</p><p>“We just knew that it’s coming to a point where it’s really dangerous and actually, the probability of death was very high,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Alam and physicians consulting the group are concerned that the hunger strikers may have already suffered irreversible health damage, as long-term symptoms related to starvation can take years to show. There are also fears around refeeding, which can be fatal if mismanaged.</p><p>Ahmed was hospitalised again this week, the seventh time since the protest began.</p><p>The collective held at various prisons includes Qesser Zuhrah; Amu Gib; Muraisi; Teuta Hoxha; Ahmed; Chiaramello; Jon Cink and Khalid, who has muscular dystrophy and has been on hunger strike for seven days.</p><p>All will have spent more than a year in prison before their trials are expected to take place later this year, far beyond the standard six-month pre-trial detention limit.</p><p>Some of the group, known as part of the “Filton 24”, are alleged to have participated in a break-in at the UK subsidiary of Israel’s largest arms manufacturer, Elbit Systems, in Bristol. Others are accused of involvement in a break-in at a Royal Air Force (RAF) base in Oxfordshire. They deny the charges against them, such as burglary and criminal damage.</p><p>Palestine Action, the group they are allegedly linked to, claimed responsibility for both incidents.</p><p>Six of those charged in the Bristol action are currently on trial.</p><h2 id=\"were-the-hunger-strikers-demands-met\">Were the hunger strikers’ demands met?</h2><p>The collective had five key protest demands, including immediate bail, the guarantee of a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action.</p><p>They also called for all 16 of Elbit’s sites in the UK to be closed and demanded an end to what they call censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls and books.</p><p>Throughout the protest, the government said the group would face a fair trial, that it had no power over the issue of bail, as this is a matter for the judiciary, and that prison welfare procedures were being followed. It has not commented on the end of the latest hunger strikes.</p><p>Elbit Systems, a target of Palestine Action’s campaign, describes its drones, which have been used extensively in Gaza to deadly effect, as “the backbone” of Israel’s drone fleet.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2025/6/25/what-is-the-palestine-action-group-and-why-is-the-uk-banning-it\">Palestine Action</a> had been calling to “shut Elbit down” before it was outlawed as a “terrorist organisation” in July, putting it on par with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. The group, which said it backed direct action without violence and accused the UK of complicity in Israel’s atrocities, is fighting the ban in courts.</p><p>In the later stages of the hunger strike, the group added a further demand – that Muraisi be returned to Bronzefield prison near her home, having been moved to a jail in northern England.</p><p>That will now happen, said Prisoners for Palestine, an activist-led group that supports the collective’s families, hailing the transfer as a triumph.</p><p>Prisoners for Palestine has claimed several “victories” – primarily the UK government’s recent decision, reported by The Times newspaper, against awarding Elbit Systems UK a 2-billion-pound ($2.68bn) army training contract. However, the contract is instead reportedly going to Raytheon UK, the subsidiary of the US defence firm, which also has several deals with the Israeli military. Back in October 2023, Raytheon’s CEO said the company would “benefit” as the “war in Gaza or in Israel … will eventually lead to additional orders”.</p><p>“Obviously we will never know – and I don’t think they’ll ever admit – how much of an influence the hunger strike had on [the contract decision against Elbit],” Alam, Ahmed’s sister, said.</p><p>“There were some wins,” she added, such as raising awareness about Elbit’s role in Israel’s genocide and the overuse of pre-trial detention in the UK.</p><h2 id=\"there-has-been-some-concessions-by-government-mp\">‘There has been some concessions by government’: MP</h2><p>The group’s supporters have also claimed victory.</p><p>“There has been some concessions by government,” said John McDonnell, a Labour MP, as he paid tribute to the hunger strikers’ “dedication”.</p><p>Prisoners for Palestine said it considers as another success the offer of a meeting between Hoxha and the head of JEXU (Joint Extremism Unit) at her prison. Hoxha had claimed she was being monitored by the JEXU task force and that it had ordered prison officers to strip her of a library job in jail.</p><p>The group also saw as a win its meeting with prison healthcare leaders “at the behest of the Ministry of Justice”, and the “bulk” release of mail it alleged had been “withheld”.</p><p>“Books on topics of Gaza and feminism have also been given [to the prisoners] after months of waiting,” the group said.</p><p>The protest is said to have been the largest coordinated hunger strike in UK history since 1981, when Irish Republican inmates were led by Bobby Sands. Sands died on the 66th day of his protest, becoming a symbol of the Irish Republican cause. Nine others also died of starvation.</p><p>“Our prisoners’ hunger strike will be remembered as a landmark moment of pure defiance; an embarrassment for the British state,” said Prisoners for Palestine, which offers “direct action training” on its website.</p><p>“While these prisoners end their hunger strike, the resistance has just begun,” said the group, adding that 500 people have recently expressed interest in taking “direct action against the genocidal military-industrial complex”.</p><p>It added that in pursuit of a fair trial, the hunger strikers had demanded the disclosure of export licences for the last five years from Elbit Systems. “After repeated requests, this information was disclosed to an independent researcher by the Department of Trade during the hunger strike,” it said, hailing another “victory”.</p><p>Alam said she imagines Ahmed will have had a few cups of tea since the hunger strike ended. He requested soya milk, she said, as it is easier on the stomach.</p><p>The government does not “get to decide whether these guys live or don’t live”, she said.</p><p>“At the end of the day, it’s their decision, and that’s what they did.</p><p>“They took back control.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But about 350 kids and teens – some of the nation’s best young cross-country skiers and biathletes – still practise in fenced-off areas amid the sporadic buzz of drones passing overhead, then explosions as they’re shot down.</p><p>“We have adapted so well — even the children — that sometimes we don’t even react,” Mykola Vorchak, a 67-year-old coach, said. “Although it goes against safety rules, the children have been hardened by the war. Adapting to this has changed them psychologically.”</p><p>War has taken a heavy toll on Ukrainian sport. Athletes were displaced or called up to fight. Football matches are often interrupted by air raid sirens, so attendance is capped by bomb shelter capacity. Elite skaters, skiers and biathletes usually train abroad, with attacks and frequent blackouts shuttering local facilities.</p><p>But the government-run Sports Ski Base of the Olympic Reserve is open for cross-country skiing and biathlon, the event which combines skiing with shooting. The sprawling complex is on the outskirts of Chernihiv, a city two hours north of Kyiv along the path of destruction that Russia’s army left in its 2022 attempt to capture the capital. Chernihiv remains a regular target for air attacks aimed at the power grid and civilian infrastructure.</p><p>Several temporary structures at the sports centre serve as changing rooms, toilets and coaches’ offices. Athletes train on snowy trails during the winter and, throughout the rest of the year, use roller skis on an asphalt track pocked by blast marks.</p><p>Biathletes aim laser rifles at electronic targets and, between shooting drills, sling skis over their shoulders and jog back to the start of the course, cheeks flushed from the cold.</p><h2 id=\"ukraine-s-first-olympic-medal\">Ukraine’s first Olympic medal</h2><p>Valentyna Tserbe-Nesina spent her adolescence at the Chernihiv centre performing these same drills, and won bronze at the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer. It was Ukraine’s first Olympic medal as an independent country.</p><p>“The conditions weren’t great, but we had nothing better. And for us, it was like a family — our own little home,” she said inside her apartment, its shelves and walls lined with medals, trophies and souvenirs from competitions around the world.</p><p>Tserbe-Nesina, 56, was shocked when she visited the complex in 2022. Shelling had torn through buildings, fire had consumed others. Shattered glass littered the floors of rooms where she and friends once excitedly checked taped-up results sheets.</p><p>“I went inside, up to my old room on the second floor. It was gone — no windows, nothing,” she said. “I recorded a video and found the trophies we had left at the base. They were completely burned.”</p><p>Tserbe-Nesina has been volunteering to organise funerals for fallen Ukrainian soldiers in her hometown while her husband, a retired military officer, returned to the front. They see each other about once a year, whenever his unit allows him brief leave.</p><p>One adult who in 2022 completed a tour in a territorial defence unit of Ukraine’s army sometimes trains today alongside the centre’s youngsters. Khrystyna Dmytrenko, 26, will represent her country at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics that start on February 6.</p><p>“Sports can show that Ukraine is strong,” Dmytrenko said in an interview next to the shooting range. “We represent Ukraine on the international stage, letting other countries, athletes and nations see our unity, strength and determination.”</p><p>The International Olympic Committee imposed bans and restrictions on Russian athletes after the invasion of Ukraine, effectively extending earlier sanctions tied to state‑sponsored doping. But a small group of them will participate in the upcoming Winter Games.</p><p>After vetting to ensure no military affiliation, they must compete without displaying any national symbols — and only in non-team events. That means Russian and Ukrainian athletes could face one another in some skating and skiing events. Moscow’s appeal at the federation level to allow its biathletes to compete is pending.</p><p>That’s why many Ukrainians view training for these events as an act of defiance. Former Olympic biathlete Nina Lemesh, 52, noted that some young Ukrainians who first picked up rifles and skis at the Chernihiv ski base during wartime have become international champions in their age groups.</p><p>“Fortunately, Ukrainians remain here. They always will,” she said, standing beside the destroyed dormitories. “This is the next generation of Olympians.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

When he joined the government army in 2016 – aged only 19 – he thought that the Yemeni government’s war against the Houthi rebel group would be brief.  A decade has elapsed, and the conflict remains unsettled, with the Houthis remaining in Sanaa.</p><p>Naef was clear as to the reason for the government’s failure – a lack of unity and clear command structure. For years, government soldiers and other anti-Houthi fighters have adhered to conflicting agendas across the country, with many of the fighters in the south supporting the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC). A solution to that division, Naef thought, was far-fetched.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>However, more recently, things have changed. The STC’s decision to attempt to seize all of southern and eastern Yemen backfired, and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/27/saudi-says-it-will-militarily-back-yemens-government-against-separatists\">Saudi Arabia backed</a> pro-government troops in pushing the group back. The STC is now divided, with one leader on the run, and others declaring that the group had been dissolved.</p><p>The Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), Yemen’s UN-recognised authority led by President Rashad al-Alimi, has seized the initiative and, on January 10, established the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/12/yemens-saudi-backed-government-retakes-southern-areas-from-stc-what-next\">Supreme Military Committee (SMC)</a>, with the goal of overseeing all anti-Houthi military units, and integrating them into the official Yemeni military, under one command.</p><p>Al-Alimi said that the SMC would ultimately be a vehicle to defeat the Houthis, and reclaim all of Yemen.</p><p>The SMC announcement marks a dramatic twist in the decade-long war, and Naef is now – finally – hopeful.</p><p>“I am optimistic today as the government has revived some of its power in southern Yemen,” he told Al Jazeera. “The formation of an inclusive military committee is a boost to our morale and a prelude to a powerful government comeback.”</p><p>The soldier believes that, after years of inertia, the tide has finally turned for the government. After nine years of experience on multiple frontlines, Naef now thinks that the government – with the backing of Saudi Arabia – is capable of pushing into Houthi-controlled northwestern Yemen, should negotiations fail.</p><p>“The PLC has achieved remarkable success in the south over the past few weeks with support from the Saudi leadership. It has once again proven to be an indispensable party to the conflict. Whether this success will be short-lived or lasting remains to be seen,” said Naef.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4238467\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4238467\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4238467\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_Yemen_afterSTC_Jan13_2026-01-1768404152.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Yemen_Control_Map_Jan14_2026_REVISED\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4238467\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"concerns-and-defiance\">Concerns and defiance</h2><p>The formation of the SMC has unleashed a sense of concern among Houthi supporters in northern Yemen.</p><p>Hamza Abdu, a 24-year-old Houthi supporter in Sanaa, describes the new military committee as an “attempt to organise the proxies in the south”.</p><p>“This committee may end the friction between the militant groups in the south, but it will deepen the south’s subjugation to Saudi Arabia,” Hamza said. The Houthis have often framed their opponents as being proxies controlled by foreign powers, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They themselves are backed by Iran.</p><p>In light of the developments, Hamza shared a concern: the resumption of the war between the Houthis and their opponents, which has largely been frozen since 2022.</p><p>“If this military committee succeeded in uniting the forces in the south, that might entice them to attack the north,” he said. “A new destructive war will begin, and the humanitarian ordeal will magnify.”</p><p>Like many ordinary citizens, Hamza is now fearful that the war will restart. But Houthi leaders – while warning that their forces should stay alert – are still confident, saying that the formation of the SMC will not affect their power or weaken their control.</p><p>Aziz Rashid, a pro-Houthi military expert, believes that the SMC will not alter the status quo, arguing that any future confrontation with the Houthis “will only serve the agendas and plans of the United States-supported Zionist entity [Israel]”.</p><p>Rashid indicated that Houthi forces in Sanaa “confronted international and powerful military forces, including the <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/5/1/animated-maps-show-us-led-attacks-on-yemen\">United States</a>, Britain and Israel, and stood firm against the [Saudi-led Arab] coalition during the past 10 years”.</p><p>The only solution for Yemen, Rashid said, was a political settlement.</p><p>The Iran-backed Houthis took over Sanaa in September 2014 and <a href=\"/news/2015/2/6/yemens-houthis-form-own-government-in-sanaa\">toppled</a> the UN-recognised government in February 2015. They insist they are the only legitimate authority governing Yemen.</p><p>The Houthis have faced attacks from the US, the United Kingdom, and Israel since 2023, when the Yemeni group began attacking shipping in the Red Sea and Israel itself, in what the Houthis declared was solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-terrifying-message\">A terrifying message</h2><p>Defeating the Houthis will be easier said than done, considering the Saudi-backed coalition’s failure to do so with overwhelming air power in the early years of the war, and the group’s now extensive combat experience and possession of advanced weapons, including drones and missiles.</p><p>But if the Yemeni military does truly reorganise itself and integrate the different anti-Houthi forces on the ground, the opportunity may be there.</p><p>Adel Dashela, a Yemeni researcher and non-resident fellow at MESA Global Academy, said that if the SMC is able to provide security and stability in territory under its control, it may also be able to improve the lives of Yemenis living there – and put itself in a stronger position in any negotiations with the Houthis.</p><p>“The next stage is the start of a political process to reach an agreement with the Houthi group. If the peaceful option fails, the military action becomes necessary,” Dashela told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Abdulsalam Mohammed, the head of the Yemeni Abaad Studies and Research Center, believes that recent events – both inside and outside Yemen – provide the government with a perfect opportunity to confront the Houthis.</p><p>“A limited military operation routed the UAE-backed STC within a few days,” Mohammed said. “What happened to the STC in the south carried a terrifying message to the Houthis in the north. The Houthis are not invincible.”</p><p>According to Mohammed, some factors have magnified the vulnerability of the Houthis at present.</p><p>He explained, “Iran is undergoing a massive crisis, and this can weaken Tehran’s Houthi proxy. The popular silent rage against the group keeps growing, given the economic and governance issues in areas under their control. Moreover, <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/30/live-yemens-presidential-council-cancels-uae-defence-deal\">the exit of the UAE</a> from the south will enable the Yemeni government to shift the battle to the Houthis in the north.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"desperate-for-order\">Desperate for order</h2><p>Armed groups in Yemen have proliferated over the last decade. The outcome has been a weakened government and a prolonged war. Amid the chaos, the population has borne the brunt.</p><p>Fawaz Ahmed, a 33-year-old resident of the southern city of Aden, is hopeful that the establishment of a military committee will end the presence of armed groups in Aden and other southern cities.</p><p>Fawaz expects Aden to get two immediate benefits from the formation of the SMC: an end to unlawful money collection by fighters and the disappearance of infighting between competing armed units.</p><p>He recalled an incident last August in Aden’s Khormaksar district, when two military units clashed at the headquarters of the Immigration and Passports Authority, leading to the closure of the facility for days.</p><p>“The commanders of the armed groups issued conflicting directions, and soldiers opened fire on each other. This clearly points to the absence of a united leadership. So, the declared military committee will prevent such face-offs,” said Fawaz.</p><p>“We are desperate for law and order,” Fawaz said. “Desperate for a city free from an unneeded military presence. This is a collective dream in Aden. Only united military leadership can achieve this.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was a great moment that match, that moment we had at the net, and everything we’ve been through over the years”.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Sincaraz” – as Alcaraz and Sinner have come to be known – have dominated the men’s tour for two years, splitting the sport’s biggest titles and trading the No 1 rank between themselves.</p><p class=\"pf0\">When asked to recall his thoughts from their meeting in Paris, where their rivalry first began, Sinner responded with modesty.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“When I said that ‘I hope we can play some more matches,’ it was more of a hope for me because I was very sure [Carlos] would arrive at the stage where he is right now. But I was not sure if I could ever be in the position where I am in right now,” the Italian said.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“But it turned out to be a great rivalry between us, and it also goes off the court because we have a good relationship.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4237300\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4237300\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4237300\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260109__92692CR__v1__MidRes__TennisKorSinnerAlcaraz-1768379085.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C525&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Italy's Jannik Sinner (L) plays table tennis with Spain's Carlos Alcaraz (R) during a welcome event at Hyundai Card headquarters in Seoul on January 9, 2026, ahead of their tennis exhibition match.

At the height of their rivalry, Federer and Nadal toured the world together, playing exhibitions and supporting charities across Europe and Africa.</p><p class=\"pf0\">In Seoul, Alcaraz and Sinner offered a glimpse of a similar dynamic.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Over four days, the pair were almost inseparable.</p><p class=\"pf0\">After their opening news conference, Alcaraz and Sinner moved to the lobby, where cheering employees watched the pair laugh their way through a friendly table tennis match.</p><p class=\"pf0\">In keeping with the marketing needs of the time, Sincaraz filmed playful short videos, completed trending challenges and fielded light-hearted questions. One clip, in which Sinner laughed as Alcaraz attempted to say “Hi, I’m Carlos Alcaraz” in Korean, went viral in no time.</p><p class=\"pf0\">The relaxed mood carried into their exhibition tennis match.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Following in the footsteps of legends such as Maria Sharapova, Venus Williams, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, Alcaraz and Sinner played in front of a sold-out crowd.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Both players took time to find rhythm early, with Alcaraz committing several unforced errors in his first appearance since November.</p><p class=\"pf0\">But as the spectacle took over, the Spaniard began unleashing “tweener” winners.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4238021\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4238021\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4238021\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260110__92A226B__v1__MidRes__TennisKorSinnerAlcaraz-1768397163.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C537&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Spain's Carlos Alcaraz hits a return to Italy's Jannik Sinner during their exhibition tennis match at Inspire Arena in Incheon on January 10, 2026.

So, I think he will three-peat at the Australian Open later this month”.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Kim Ju-hee attended with a friend from her tennis club and said the match had dominated conversations all week.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“But compared to the Big 3 [Federer, Nadal and Novak Djokovic], Sinner and Alcaraz are not there yet,” she said. “They’re just getting started now.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">For Lee Gew-chon, who says tennis has grown enormously in South Korea since he first picked up a racquet 15 years ago, the event was unforgettable.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“It’s not easy at all to see the world’s two top players in your home country, but it’s also not easy to see them at a Grand Slam where tickets are hard to come by,” he said. “Even with tickets, both players would have to make the finals for you to see them clash.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">Broadcasters in Spain, Italy and the United States streamed the match live, while within the region, India and Japan also streamed the event.</p><p class=\"pf0\">An initial report by Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport claimed that both players received a $2.3m appearance fee, but a representative from event organiser SEMA Sports Marketing quashed the report. The South Korean daily No Cut News put the amount closer to $1.35m for each player, referring to its own industry source.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4238033\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4238033\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4238033\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260110__929Z99J__v1__MidRes__TennisKorSinnerAlcaraz-1768397358.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Spain's Carlos Alcaraz (top) serves to Italy's Jannik Sinner during their exhibition tennis match at Inspire Arena in Incheon on January 10, 2026.

Alcaraz is chasing his first title at the event to complete his career Grand Slam, while Sinner has his own opportunity to do so later this year at Roland Garros in Paris.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Despite their friendly exchanges in South Korea, the players were mindful of the competitive nature of their relationship.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Today’s game is helpful to see if Jannik changes something in his game,” Alcaraz quipped after the exhibition match. “I wouldn’t say [he did today],” he added, hinting that both are careful not to reveal too much to each other.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“I wouldn’t take anything from today’s match. We will see in Australia. I will watch his matches for sure.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">In addition to paying close attention to “the small details” of his rival’s game, Sinner also stressed that the two rivals’ dominance offers little margin for complacency.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“At the moment, there are many other great players. So, if we drop [our level] just a little bit, they’re going to take our place,” the defending Australian Open champion said. “So, it’s great to have [Carlos] push me to the limit. Hopefully, I can improve every time when we play.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">Only a small group of players have beaten either man in recent years.</p><p class=\"pf0\">The United Kingdom’s No 1, Jack Draper, defeated Alcaraz in the semifinals of Indian Wells – the so-called “fifth grand slam” – last season, while attention in Melbourne will again fall on Novak Djokovic, the 24-time Grand Slam champion chasing an 11th Australian Open title.</p><p class=\"pf0\">After flying to Australia together on a private jet, Alcaraz and Sinner were seen high-fiving during practice on Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday. The tournament begins Sunday, and – as in the past two years – they start from opposite ends of the draw. Many are already anticipating another “Sincaraz” final.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Federal prosecutors charged dozens of defendants beginning in 2022 – before Trump’s current term – and have filed more charges since Trump took office a year ago.</p><p>So far, the Minnesota fraud charges involve a minimum of hundreds of millions of dollars. Assistant US Attorney Joe Thompson, who led Minnesota fraud prosecutions, said in December that Medicaid fraud in the state could reach $9bn although not all of that would be federal money. Thompson resigned on Tuesday.</p><p>But adding the dollars lost to fraud in Minnesota to federal losses elsewhere – which have been estimated as high as $521bn annually – would not bring the total close to the amount of the federal deficit. The fiscal year 2025 deficit – that year’s difference between revenues and spending – was $1.775 trillion.</p><p>“You can’t balance the books on waste, fraud and abuse,” said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks the federal budget. “It’s important to root it out, but the only way you get anywhere close to a balanced budget is fiscal restraint.”</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry for this article.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"federal-report-in-2024-found-hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars-in-fraud\">Federal report in 2024 found hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud</h2><p>In April 2024, during the tenure of former President Joe Biden, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) produced what it called a “first-of-its-kind, government-wide estimate of federal dollars lost to fraud”.</p><p>The office estimated $233bn to $521bn lost in fraud per year, based on 2018 to 2022 data from agency inspectors general and fraud reports submitted to the Office of Management and Budget.</p><p>The GAO’s topline figure included not only official fraud findings from legal proceedings but also estimates based on individual agencies’ findings of fraud. The agency also extrapolated figures it believed represented undetected fraud.</p><p>The estimated annual losses amounted to 3 percent to 7 percent of what the government spent on average in those years.</p><p>Joshua Sewell, director of research and policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense, previously cautioned that the GAO report is filled with caveats, including its overlap with the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in increased spending.</p><p>Still, “it’s very, very unlikely that there is enough fraud in the federal government to balance the budget,” said Chris Towner, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscally hawkish group. “For the $1.775 trillion deficit for that year to have been due to fraud, it would mean that one-quarter of federal spending was fraudulent, or some combination of fraudulent lost tax revenue and federal outlays totalled that amount.”</p><p>Another challenge is that fraud is not easy to root out entirely. Historically, “only a small percentage of tax dollars lost to fraud are ever actually recovered by the government,” said Bob Westbrooks, a fraud and corruption risk expert who served as executive director of the federal government’s Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"trump-administration-has-sought-to-investigate-fraud-in-blue-states\">Trump administration has sought to investigate fraud in blue states</h2><p>In recent weeks, Trump, a Republican, has spotlighted fraud in blue states, or states that generally vote Democratic, such as Minnesota. But there have been notable high-dollar fraud investigations in other states too.</p><p>In Mississippi, a solidly Republican state, a trial is under way in a welfare scandal that auditors said resulted in the loss of $100m in federal money from 2016 to 2020.</p><p>In 2024, the US Sentencing Commission pointed to the Southern District of Florida as the nation’s top district for fraud, adding that nationwide offences related to government benefits fraud had increased by 242 percent since 2020. Florida is also a red, or Republican, state.</p><p>This month, the US Department of Health and Human Services froze access to certain <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/trump-administration-freezes-minnesota-childcare-funds-over-fraud-claims\">childcare and family assistance funds</a> for California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – all blue states – saying it was related to fraud concerns. A federal judge blocked it temporarily.</p><h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2><p>Trump said: “If we stop this fraud, this massive fraud, we’re going to have a balanced budget.”</p><p>The amount of fraud committed against federal programmes is large, but the dollar amount does not come close to equalling the dollar amount of the federal deficit.</p><p>The highest nationwide fraud estimate puts fraud losses at $521bn. If all of that could be recouped, it would still be less than one-third of the 2025 deficit.</p><p>We rate the statement <strong>false</strong>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the US at what he called “a time of global trade disruption”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">No announcement was made on tariffs between China and Canada, which is a sticking point in the relationship.</p><p class=\"p1\">Canada followed the US in putting tariffs of 100 percent on EVs from China and 25 percent on steel and aluminium under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.</p><p class=\"p1\">China responded by imposing duties of 100 percent on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25 percent on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8 percent tariff on canola seeds last August.

The law has provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health, and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.</p><p class=\"p1\">Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2m) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.</p><p class=\"p1\">To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder’s face, or make inferences from data already available, such has how long an account has been held.</p><p class=\"p1\">About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country’s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84 percent of eight to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million “deactivated or restricted” was encouraging.</p><p class=\"p1\">“We’re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,” Inman Grant said.</p><p class=\"p1\">The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia’s regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Australian officials didn’t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect, it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.</p><p class=\"p1\">In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticised the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn’t apply might not prioritise safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms – a concern that led to the ban’s enactment.</p><p class=\"p1\">The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia’s sprawling rural areas.</p><p class=\"p1\">Some said they had managed to fool age-assessing technologies or were helped by parents or older siblings to circumvent the ban.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p class=\"p1\">Since Australia began debating the measures in 2024, other countries have considered following suit. Denmark’s government is among them, saying in November that it had planned to implement a social media ban for children under 15.</p><p class=\"p1\">“The fact that in spite of some scepticism out there, it’s working and being replicated now around the world, is something that is a source of Australian pride,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday.</p><p class=\"p1\">Opposition politicians have suggested that young people have circumvented the ban easily or are migrating to other apps that are less scrutinised than the largest platforms. Inman Grant said on Friday that data seen by her office showed a spike in downloads of alternative apps when the ban was enacted but not a spike in usage.</p><p class=\"p1\">“There is no real long-term trends yet that we can say but we’re engaging,” she said.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, she said, the regulator she heads planned to introduce “world-leading AI companion and chatbot restrictions in March,” although she did not disclose further details.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has shone a spotlight on the type of crude held by the Latin American country.</p><p>Crude oil, which is produced by about 100 countries, comes in hundreds of varieties that differ by viscosity and sulfur content.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>While all grades of crude oil are valuable, their differing properties make certain grades more sought after in some markets than others.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-difference-between-heavy-and-light-grades-of-oil\">What is the difference between ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ grades of oil?</h2><p>Crude oils are rated as “heavy” or “light” based on their viscosities, or “gravities”.</p><p>Crude is also classified by sulfur content, with high-sulfur grades called “sour” and lower-sulfur varieties referred to as “sweet”.</p><p>Heavy, sour grades are more difficult and costly to refine into petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel.</p><p>Generally speaking, lighter and sweeter crude commands higher prices.</p><p>Some countries and regions primarily produce certain grades.</p><p>Canada mainly produces heavy, sour crude, for example, while African varieties tend to be lighter and sweeter.</p><p>Popular light, sweet varieties include Saudi Arabia’s Arabian Super Light, Iran’s South Pars Condensate, Malaysia’s Tapis Blend, and Australia’s Cossack.</p><p>Among the most traded heavy, sour varieties are China’s Shengli, the United Kingdom’s Kraken, Iraq’s Basra Heavy, and Iran’s Soroosh.</p><h2 id=\"what-type-of-oil-does-venezuela-have\">What type of oil does Venezuela have?</h2><p>Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, at an estimated 303 billion barrels.</p><p>Most of those reserves are made up of heavy, sour crude located in the Orinoco Oil Belt in the centre of the country.</p><p>The basin’s oil is especially dense and vicious, with a tar-like consistency that necessitates specialist methods such as steam injection and diluents for extraction.</p><p>Industry analysts say tapping the basin’s true potential will require huge investment due to the degraded state of the sector’s infrastructure and knowledge base, following late leader Hugo Chavez’s nationalisation of the industry and years of US sanctions that prevented Venezuela from accessing foreign capital and modern technology.</p><p>The Latin American country’s output was estimated at about 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, less than 1 percent of the world’s total, a steep decline from its 1970s peak of about 3.5 million bpd.</p><p>Rystad Energy, a consultancy based in Oslo, Norway, has estimated that about $110bn in capital investment would be needed to return to the country’s late 2000s output of about 2 million bpd.</p><p>US President Donald Trump, whose decision to kidnap Maduro has been widely condemned as a violation of international law, has said US oil companies are prepared to invest billions of dollars to revive production.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-venezuela-s-heavy-crude-particularly-attractive-for-the-us\">Why is Venezuela’s heavy crude particularly attractive for the US?</h2><p>Some industry analysts have expressed scepticism that US oil companies will be drawn to Venezuela – at least not without significant incentives and guarantees.</p><p>They point to the post-Maduro leadership uncertainty, Chavez’s past expropriation of company assets, and the excess supply of oil in the global market as reasons why firms may be hesitant to invest.</p><p>ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, two of the biggest US oil firms, pulled out of the country in 2007 following Chavez’s seizure of their facilities, and the two companies were later awarded large payouts in international arbitration.</p><p>At a meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday, ExxonMobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods described Venezuela as “uninvestable” in its current state and said “significant changes” would need to occur in the country to justify returning.</p><p>As the only major US oil producer in the country at present, Chevron, which operates under special exemption from Washington’s sanctions, is widely viewed as best positioned to profit on Trump’s plans.</p><p>While there are differing views on the business case for the major oil companies in Venezuela, analysts are in agreement that one group in particular stands to gain: US refineries.</p><p>While the US currently pumps more crude than any other country due to an explosion in drilling for lighter shale oil, most of the country’s refineries were built to process heavier grades.</p><p>Nearly 70 percent of US refining capacity is designed for heavier crude, according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a relic of heavy investment made before the more recent boom in shale drilling.</p><p>“You need what is referred to as a ‘complex’ refinery with deep conversion capacities. The Gulf Coast has multiple refineries like that,” Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The coker units that are key were built to take advantage of heavy crude not just from Venezuela, but also places like Mexico and other South American producers.”</p><p>Shon Hiatt, director of the Zage Business of Energy Initiative at the University of Southern California, said US refineries would benefit “tremendously” from a boost in exports of Venezuelan crude.</p><p>“Many of the US refineries along the coast – Texas and Louisiana – were built and designed to process Venezuela crude,” Hiatt told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Venezuela has a history of exporting its oil to the US due to the fact that US oil companies were the first to go in, discover, pump, process, and export Venezuelan petroleum. Hence, refineries along the coast were built to handle this type of petroleum.”</p><p>While heavy Canadian crude has displaced imports from Venezuela over the years due to sanctions, that could change if Trump has his way, Hiatt said.</p><p>“If the Venezuelan heavy crude exports increase, it will displace the Canadian heavy crude as Venezuelan crude typically is sold at a lower price to these refineries,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

While it wasn’t clear what kind of attack he was considering, his remarks left the region bracing for an escalation.</p><p>Arab Gulf nations fear that a military strike on Iran could disrupt oil prices, shatter their reputation as safe havens for business, and trigger an Iranian retaliation on their soil.</p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time. In 2019, Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen struck Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities, temporarily reducing Saudi oil production. Last June, Tehran attacked Qatar’s Al Udeid airbase, which hosts American troops, after the US struck a key nuclear facility in Iran.</p><p>Iran gave ample warning that it would carry out the attack, which marked the end of the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, yet it created a precedent. And while that conflict weakened Iran’s military capabilities, the Islamic Republic still has an arsenal to hurt US interests in the region.</p><p>“Iran has ballistic missiles, supersonic missiles and militia groups around, so if they are given a reason to hit, they would,” said Seloom.</p><p>On Wednesday, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran had warned regional countries, from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to Turkiye, that US bases in those nations would be attacked if the US targets Iran. That was followed by the drawdown of ‍some personnel ‍from the Al Udeid airbase.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in the White House later on Wednesday, Trump said he had received information that “the killing in Iran is stopping, is stopped … and there’s no plan for executions”. While some interpreted that as an off-ramp to de-escalation, the US president did not rule out military action.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"unintended-consequences\">Unintended consequences</h2><p>Each member of the Gulf Cooperation Council has a different history with Iran but they all fear what would happen next and who would fill the vacuum should Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei be replaced or the whole system abruptly collapse, experts say.</p><p>The collapse of Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion, and the chaos that followed – including a deadly civil war, the strengthening of al-Qaeda, and the eventual emergence of ISIL (ISIS) – is an experience Arab Gulf countries do not want to see repeated in a country with a population of more than 90 million, an arsenal of weapons at its disposal, and a badly weakened yet existent network of allies in the region.</p><p>“They may like to see the Iranian leadership weakened, but all of them are more concerned about a scenario of chaos and uncertainty and the possibility of more radical elements coming to power there,” said Khalaf.</p><p>Qatar, Kuwait and Oman have found their way to exist with their neighbour on the northern shore of the Gulf – Doha even shares with Tehran the world’s largest natural gas reservoir.</p><p>The UAE’s Dubai is also a key port for trade with Iran and the two countries enjoy a robust economic partnership. The UAE would therefore greatly suffer from unrest in Iran or an attack on its soil. Still, Emirati officials have remained silent in the past week having diverged from other GCC countries by cozying up to Israel and taking different positions in Sudan and Yemen.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been arch-foes, but in recent years the rivalry has morphed into a pragmatic relationship based on keeping channels of communication open and preventing each other from escalation.</p><p>Riyadh is especially wary of regional destabilisation as the Kingdom embarks on a series of ambitious economic reforms to diversify its reliance on oil and boost its tourism sector – goals that require stability at home and in the broader region.</p><p>“Saudi [Arabia] is not comfortable at all with regime change anywhere – it’s radical and extreme and outcomes are uncertain and risky,” Khalaf added.</p><p>“Our goal is to achieve stability and calm so that we can direct our resources toward building a better future for our people,” Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir said on Thursday.</p><p>Still, Khaled Batarfi, a Saudi political analyst, said that Riyadh would welcome changes in Iran, especially if they are gradual, bringing about a leadership willing to curtail its nuclear and missile programmes and one that is less opposed to the US.</p><p>“But a sudden change like a regime change with the risk of the country’s disintegration is not going to be good for anyone,” said Batarfi. “The whole region is on fire and we don’t need to add another fire to our doors.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This phase is about “moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction”, said US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in a social media post.</p><p>The new phase includes a new Palestinian technocratic administration, overseen by an international “Board of Peace”, chaired by US President Donald Trump.</p><p>But while everything may sound workable on paper, the reaction from Palestinians in Gaza – one that mixes cautious hope and deep scepticism – is shaped by their lived experience since the beginning of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023.</p><p>“A lot of political decisions are distant from the reality faced in Gaza… our daily life that is filled with blockades, fear, loss, tents, and a terrible humanitarian situation,” said Arwa Ashour, a freelance journalist and writer based in Gaza City. “Even when decisions are made to ease the suffering, they are obstructed by the Israeli occupation authorities.”</p><p>“People want everything back like it was before the war: schools, hospitals, travel,” Ashour said. “If the Board of Peace is going to resolve all these crises, then we welcome it. But if it’s unable to do so, then what is its benefit?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"palestinians-excluded\">Palestinians excluded?</h2><p>Ashour explained that after two years of war and more than 18 years of governance in the Palestinian enclave by Hamas, there is a desire for change in Gaza.</p><p>“People want to be part of the process of creating the future, not only to accept the implementation of decisions that have already been made,” she said.</p><p>The governance model envisaged in the second phase of the ceasefire plan does have a Palestinian component.</p><p>Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister, will head the Palestinian technocratic committee that will manage daily life. But that committee will be overseen by the Board of Peace, to be led by Bulgaria’s former foreign and defence minister, <a href=\"/features/2026/1/15/who-is-nickolay-mladenov-the-diplomat-tasked-with-disarming-gaza\">Nickolay Mladenov</a>.</p><p>Mladenov – who has worked as a United Nations diplomat in the Middle East – is seen as an administrator, but one who may not be capable of pushing back against Israel and representing Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“Decisions made without the meaningful participation of those most affected reproduce the same power structures that enabled this occupation and genocide,” Maha Hussaini, head of media and public engagement at Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, told Al Jazeera. “Excluding Palestinians in Gaza from shaping their future strips them of agency and turns reconstruction and governance into tools of control rather than recovery.”</p><p>For Hussaini, justice after a war in which Israel has killed at least 71,400 Palestinians and destroyed vast swathes of the territory cannot be ignored.</p><p>“Peace does not mean silence after bombardment, nor a pause between wars,” she said. “For Gaza, peace means safety, dignity, and freedom from collective punishment. It also means justice: recognising the harm suffered, restoring the rights of victims, and holding perpetrators accountable. Without justice, what is called ‘peace’ becomes only a temporary arrangement that leaves the genocide intact.”</p><p>Palestinian political analyst Ahmed Fayyad said that ultimately, Palestinians have little choice but to go along with Mladenov and the Board of Peace model, even if there is a sense that they are handing over the administration of Gaza to foreigners.</p><p>“Palestinians don’t have the luxury of choice to accept or refuse Mladenov,” Fayyad said. “No one – the Palestinian Authority and the Arab [countries] – wants to disrupt the agreement.”</p><p>But Fayyad described several potential stumbling blocks, including internal Palestinian divisions between the Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah, and its longtime rival Hamas.</p><p>The analyst also believes that the demilitarisation of Hamas – which the US and Israel insist upon, but which Hamas says is an internal Palestinian matter – will also likely cause problems.</p><p>“Israel might attach the demilitarisation to the reconstruction or the opening of [border] crossings, and investments in the education and health sectors,” Fayyad said.</p><p>“It is complicated, and it is all subject to Israeli security conditions,” he continued, adding that the formation of a new Palestinian security force that met Israel’s onerous requirements would take a long time because the process was not spelled out in Trump’s ceasefire plan.</p><p>“This will reflect negatively on the civilians who yearn for an improvement to their daily harsh reality and suffering in tents, amid outbreaks of disease and the collapse of all economic and social life,” Fayyad said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-spoiler\">Israeli spoiler</h2><p>The announcement of the second phase of the ceasefire – a move that should have been seen as a sign of positive improvement – seems disconnected to the reality on the ground for Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“There is more fear than hope,” said Hussaini, from the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor. “Not because people in Gaza lack resilience or imagination, but because experience has taught them that moments labelled as ‘turning points’ rarely translate into real protection or accountability. Hope exists, but it is fragile and constantly undermined by the absence of justice and by decisions imposed from outside.”</p><p>And the most influential outside force is Israel – the power that has bombarded Gaza not just in the last two years but in several previous wars, and controls access to Gaza, and the air and sea that surrounds it.</p><p>“I think Israel tries its best to distance Gaza from any political solutions, which would end with Palestine’s right to self-determination,” said the analyst Fayyad. “Israel wants Gaza to be a disarmed zone; its people’s biggest concerns are the daily struggles of life, without caring about any political solutions.”</p><p>“Israel doesn’t want any future political solutions for Gaza. These are the concerns of the Authority and the Palestinians. Israel doesn’t want independence in decision-making in Palestine,” he concluded.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reality-of-life-in-gaza\">Reality of life in Gaza</h2><p>The daily struggle of life is all Sami Balousha, a 30-year-old computer programmer from Gaza City, can think about.</p><p>Balousha described peace not as a political agreement, conducted in far-off meeting rooms, but as physical safety and a routine.</p><p>“It is simply to sleep at night assured that I wake up the next morning, not dead, or I won’t get up in the middle of the night because of the sound of bombing,” Balousha said. “It is getting up the next morning and going to work, and being sure that I will be able to get home safely, not suspiciously turning around all the time, afraid of a strike.”</p><p>Balousha said that he had been displaced with his family 17 times – moving from place to place to escape Israeli attacks. The mental turmoil of the past two years means he no longer looks to the future, and instead focuses on the here and now.</p><p>“Tomorrow is far away, and I have no control over it,” Balousha said. “We can’t imagine the near future and plan it. We’ve been stuck in this loop for two years. The reality has always been strangely hard and unexpected.”</p><p>Like many others, Balousha feels disconnected from international decision-making.</p><p>“They don’t have a deep understanding of the Palestinians’ needs in Gaza. I don’t think that we are being listened to seriously,” he said.</p><p>It is why he ultimately does not have much faith in any solutions being cooked up for Gaza, and is instead fearful that his current horror will become a permanent reality.</p><p>“I am afraid that the coming generations accept the new reality of living in an open grave, to accept the tent as a home, to grow up not knowing the great days of Gaza,” Balousha said. “People only want an end to this all, no matter what the solution is, no matter who makes it, all that matters is the end of this misery at any cost. People are tired, so tired of this all, but want to live.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
