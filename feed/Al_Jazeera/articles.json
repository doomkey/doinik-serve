PKK is designated as a “terrorist group” by the United States and the European Union. In March, the PKK <a href=\"/news/2025/3/1/pkk-declares-ceasefire-in-40-year-conflict-with-turkiye-kurdish-media\">announced</a> it would give up armed struggle after a <a href=\"/news/2025/2/27/jailed-pkk-leader-calls-for-end-to-decades-long-conflict-with-turkiye\">call</a> from its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan. Thousands of people were killed in the four decades of armed rebellion against the Turkish state.</p><p>Following the SANA report, the SDF said in a later statement that it had issued instructions to stop responding to attacks by Syrian government forces following de-escalation contacts.</p><p>Under a March agreement signed by the SDF and Damascus, the Kurdish-led force was to merge with the new Syrian army, but details were left vague, and implementation has stalled.</p><h2 id=\"sdf-playing-for-time\">SDF ‘playing for time’</h2><p>Syrian analyst Gamal Mansour, a lecturer in political science at the University of Toronto, told Al Jazeera that the SDF had been “playing for time” and that it was “politically inexpedient” for the group to “move the needle forward”.</p><p>Syrian forces had, however, “provoked the SDF into a kinetic movement from their strongholds of Ashrafiyah and Sheikh Maqsoud, the two neighbourhoods that they control”.</p><p>Kurdish units linked to the SDF and the Kurds’ domestic security forces retained control of the two neighbourhoods despite a disengagement agreement reached in April with the Syrian authorities.</p><p>Syria’s Ministry of Interior said on Monday that Kurdish forces attacked government personnel at joint checkpoints in the two Kurdish-majority areas.</p><p>But the SDF accused “factions affiliated with the interim government” of carrying out an attack on a checkpoint.</p><p>Both sides issued denials. The Syrian Defence Ministry denied attacking SDF positions, while the Kurdish-led force denied targeting Aleppo neighbourhoods.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"deep-fracture\">Deep fracture</h2><p class=\"p1\">Integrating the SDF into state forces would mend Syria’s deepest remaining fracture in the wake of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad’s ouster last year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Failing to do so risks an armed clash that could derail the country’s emergence from 14 years of devastating war, which killed more than 350,000 people and displaced nearly half of the country’s pre-war population of 13 million. There is a risk of potentially drawing in Turkiye, as well, which has threatened an incursion against Kurdish fighters it views as “terrorists”.</p><p>A major sticking point had been whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or whether it would be dissolved and its members individually absorbed into the new military.</p><p>Turkiye, which shares a 900km- (560-mile) border with Syria, is opposed to the SDF joining as a single unit because of the group’s links to the <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2025/10/27/has-the-kurdish-pkk-given-up-on-its-dream-of-a-homeland\">PKK</a>.</p><p>Kurdish officials have said a preliminary agreement has been reached to allow three divisions affiliated with the SDF to integrate as units into the new army, but it is unclear how close the sides are to finalising it.</p><p>Mansour, the analyst, said time was running out. “Fidan said four days earlier that the parties in question have run out of patience, that the SDF’s manipulation of time as a strategic asset towards creating more latitude for themselves is something that cannot be withstood by Turkiye and the other parties in question,” he said.</p><p>Fidan, whose delegation also included Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, said on Monday: “Syria’s stability means Turkiye’s stability.”</p><p>He called on the SDF to “cease to be an obstacle to Syria achieving stability, unity and prosperity”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Asaad al-Shaibani, the Syrian foreign minister, accused the SDF of “systematic procrastination”.</p><p>Fidan’s delegation also met with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. According to al-Shaibani, talks also addressed “combating terrorism and preventing” a resurgence of the ISIL (ISIS) group.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Washington wants New Delhi to open its market to genetically modified (GM) soya and corn.</p><p>The GM technology involves altering plant DNA to introduce new traits that help speed up production compared with traditional breeding.</p><p>The US is the world’s second-largest producer of soya beans after Brazil, accounting for 28 percent, or 119.05 million metric tonnes, of global production.</p><p>China was the biggest buyer of US soya beans until the trade war with Beijing led to a <a href=\"/gallery/2025/10/14/us-soya-bean-farmers-battered-by-trade-dispute-with-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slump in sales</a>.</p><p>Suman Sahai, the founder of Gene Campaign, a nonprofit working for farmers, said the US desperately needs a market for its soya beans and corn, because China, its one-time top buyer, has dramatically scaled back its purchases.</p><p>“Trump has to sell this soya and corn so as not to annoy his big political base of the soya [and] corn farmers,” she said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181565\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181565\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mahesh-Patel-soya-farmer-1766044366.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181565\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mahesh-Patel-soya-farmer-1766044366.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soybean India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Soya farmer Mahesh Patel says heavy rains wrecked his crop [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"india-s-reluctance\">India’s reluctance</h2><p>India has so far held off the imports of GM-variety soya beans and corn on the grounds that it produces non-GM, or organic, crops, which have a global niche market and could be undermined by the perception of GM varieties diluting the strain.</p><p>India produces about 13.05 million tonnes of soya beans, with Madhya Pradesh alone yielding more than half.</p><p>India’s corn production stands at approximately 42 million tonnes, 20 percent of which is used in making fuel-grade ethanol. The country is self-sufficient in its corn output but imports soya oil for cooking purposes because of a lack of processing infrastructure for edible oil.</p><p>Farmers of soya and corn, however, complain that they are already being ripped off by traders who pay below the price set by the government. On top of that are the steep costs of fertilisers, seeds and other farm items, coupled with the erratic rainfall that has destroyed crops.</p><p>“The traders set the prices at their will, as the government does not buy from us. We are unable to even recover the production cost,” said Prakash Patel, 50, a corn farmer in Madhya Pradesh.</p><p>“The profit is a distant dream for us, and we still have to pay the loans we took to buy our farming materials.”</p><p>Farmers worry that these losses would be exacerbated if US goods enter the Indian market.</p><p>A farmer in India typically produces about 1 metric tonne of soya beans in 0.40 hectares (1 acre). But GM soya bean yield can go up to 3 metric tonnes over the same land area, said Nirbhay Singh, a soya farmer in the state’s Piploda village.</p><p>Corn exporter Hemant Jain also worries about how US goods entering India may affect exports.</p><p>“The soya and corn from India have a major demand in the international market due to their non-GM quality,” Jain said.</p><p>“The import of GM material would create a doubt of adulteration in the minds of foreign buyers, who might be reluctant to buy from us.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4181559\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4181559\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG20251204094456-1766044326.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4181559\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG20251204094456-1766044326.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Soybean India\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4181559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Indian growers cannot win against US farmers, who have large plots of land and heavy government subsidies, experts say [Gurvinder Singh/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Indra Shekhar Singh, an independent agrarian analyst in New Delhi, said farmers in India have average land holdings of about 2 hectares (5 acres), on which five to seven members of a family work and rely for food and livelihood. They often also have to work on other people’s land as labourers for more income.</p><p>This is unlike the US, where farmers have vast stretches of land for cultivation and, depending on the crop, receive heavy subsidies from the government.</p><p>“The US is trying to find an alternative market to China, but Indian farmers can’t win against the US government’s subsidised agri-commodities. They would capture the complete market in a few years, leaving our farmers in deep poverty and helplessness,” Singh said.</p><h2 id=\"strong-lobby-at-work\">Strong lobby at work</h2><p>However, some scientists and industry watchers believe there are benefits to GM production of soya and corn in India.</p><p>A senior scientist working with the Indian government on GM technology told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media that the introduction of the technology would allow farmers to use specific herbicides to control weeds without harming the crop.</p><p>“The GM technology is insect-resistant, and it would help to reduce the need for spraying insecticides and lower costs for farmers. Besides, production also increases massively in the GM technique that helps farmers to minimise their losses.”</p><p>Kawaljeet Bhatia, 52, a poultry feed supplier in India, said the production of corn and soya beans would increase manifold with the introduction of GM varieties, which would help farmers and businesses like his, which are part of the production chain.</p><p>But he suggested that the government develop its own GM seeds, instead of importing them.</p><p>“A handful of exporters receive a premium price, as they claim to export organic products. They want that status to continue as it benefits them. It is just a matter of time when we have to switch to GM for increased productivity,” Bhatia said.</p><p>The Indian government is being cautious, political analysts told Al Jazeera. Agriculture contributes 18 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) and supports 46 percent of its population.</p><p>“The government is acting with caution, taking lessons from the massive farmers’ protest that had rocked the nation in 2020-21,” Sibaji Pratim Basu, an independent political commentator in Kolkata, West Bengal, told Al Jazeera, referring to the yearlong protests by tens of thousands of farmers in northern India against three farm laws introduced by the government. The protests ended only after the government withdrew those rules.</p><p>“There are already hiccups in India-US relations due to tariffs that have badly hit several businesses in India dependent on the US market. The government is definitely concerned about its vote bank before taking any decision,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

These are bigger. They’ll be 100 times the force, the power [of the old ships], and there’s never been anything like these ships,” Trump said.</p><p>He added that the vessels would be “cutting edge” and equipped with the latest technology, including artificial intelligence and directed energy lasers. They will also be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles and rail guns – all technologies that are in various stages of development by the US Navy.</p><p>“Each one of these will be the largest battleship in the history of our country, the largest battleship in the history of the world,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump downplayed the idea that the new ships were meant to counter any particular country, saying that they were “a counter to everybody”.</p><p>The US president said that production would start with two ships, but could scale up to 10, and as many as 25, over an unspecified period of time.</p><p>Trump said work on the first two would begin “immediately” and that the first ship would be named the USS Defiant.</p><p>Both Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically, that term has referred to a very specific type of ship – a large, heavily armoured vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.</p><p>This type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the US battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tonnes. But after World War II, the battleship’s role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favour of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles.</p><p>Trump referenced the Great White Fleet, commissioned by former President Theodore Roosevelt during the early 20th century as a symbol of US naval strength, as well as a documentary about naval warfare during the second world war.</p><p>“Victory at Sea. I don’t know if anyone has seen Victory at Sea, but it was a classic,” he said, adding that the new ships would help “maintain American military supremacy”.</p><p>According to a newly created website for the Golden Fleet, this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships, but only weigh about half as much, approximately 35,000 tonnes, and have far smaller crews – between 650 and 850 sailors.</p><p>Its primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.</p><p>Trump said the naval expansion would also be paired with renewed pressure on defence contractors to ‌speed up production and rein in costs.</p><p>He said he will meet with major defence firms next week to address delays and overruns, ‌and to examine whether executive compensation, stock buybacks and dividends ⁠are contributing to missed production targets.</p><p>“We don’t want to have executives making $50m a year, issuing big dividends to everybody, and also doing buybacks”, while production of F-35s and other jets languishes, Trump said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And they just didn’t have the capacity to do the clearance … a lot of people are expecting to receive international packages, and they’re just never gonna get them.”</p><p>UPS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.</p><h2 id=\"suspending-tariff-exemptions\">Suspending tariff exemptions</h2><p>Since 2016, the de minimis trade exemption determined that packages worth $800 or less were not subject to taxes and tariffs. According to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the number of shipments entering the US claiming the exemption increased by more than 600 percent from 139 million shipments in 2015 to more than one billion in 2023.</p><p>In August, this all changed. President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending de minimis treatment for all countries, spiralling US imports into a new landscape of paperwork and processes, subject to duties and tariffs based on their place of origin.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4180728\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4180728\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25237470791790-1766004965.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4180728\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25237470791790-1766004965.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Parcels slide down a ramp after being scanned at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection overseas mail inspection facility at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in USA\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4180728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Parcels slide down a ramp after being scanned at a US Customs and Border Protection overseas mail inspection facility [File: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>Just a month after de minimis ended, while shipping products with UPS, Tezumi Tea, an online Japanese tea and teaware company that sells its products online and through meetups in New York City, fell victim to the tariff backlog at US customs. Tezumi lost roughly 150kg (330lbs) of matcha, totalling about $13,000.</p><p>“We responded by increasing buffers in our supply planning across the dozen farms that we partner with,” said Ryan Snowden, a cofounder of Tezumi. “Even with those adjustments, the loss had a severe effect on a number of our cafe customers who suddenly needed to switch to another matcha blend.”</p><p>Now, UPS is no longer accepting shipments from Japan, and Tezumi has switched to shipping supplies through alternate carriers such as DHL and FedEx.</p><h2 id=\"disposing-shipments\">Disposing shipments</h2><p>Wasserbach has witnessed similar instances of UPS losing imports.</p><p>“When a UPS package goes uncleared, it’s just basically sitting in a UPS facility, uncleared for a certain period of time,” said Wasserbach. “Then UPS indicates in their tracking that they’re disposing of the shipments without making, really, any effort, from what I’ve seen, to contact either the sender or the receiver, to get information they need to do to get the clearance.”</p><p>Wasserbach shared email chains with Al Jazeera from UPS customers who looped in his firm to their customs clearance UPS debacles.</p><p>In one exchange, UPS customer Stephan Niznik responded to a notice from the UPS Alternate Broker Team that their packages had been “destroyed”.</p><p>“The tracking says on multiple instances that UPS attempted to contact the sender (me), but this is false; aside from a request for more information on September 5 (which I responded to immediately), UPS never attempted to contact me,” wrote Niznik. “It is absolutely disgraceful that my package was mishandled – clothes and children’s toys were destroyed at the hands of UPS.”</p><p>In another email chain, UPS told customer Chenying Li that their package was released following an email from Express Customs Clearance stating that the shipment was cleared.</p><p>A week later, Li’s package was still showing as “Pending Release”, and when they asked for an update on the shipment, UPS responded, “At this time we are unable to provide an ETA,  as volume is currently backed up and awaiting delivery due to the De Minimis impact.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"impose-additional-pressure\">‘Impose additional pressure’</h2><p>In addition to the customs backlog, Virginia Tech associate professor David Bieri says cost prevention may provide one explanation for UPS choosing to dispose of packages rejected by US customs rather than return the shipments to senders.</p><p>“All these additional rules and regulations impose additional pressure on already relatively tight margins for these companies – UPS, FedEx, DHL and so forth,” said Bieri. “They need to make money, and sometimes it’s easier not to fulfil a service than to take on the additional cost of customs clearance and making sure that it gets to its final destination.”</p><p>Bieri added that UPS resorting to package disposal may indicate that they believe themselves to be in “a sufficiently strong monopolistic position that they can do such horrible practice – unilateral nonfulfillment of contract”.</p><p>Wasserbach told Al Jazeera that “with FedEx and DHL shipments, we aren’t seeing these problems”.</p><p>When asked whether FedEx has disposed of packages stuck in customs, a spokesperson wrote, “If paperwork is not complete and/or rejected by US Customs and Border Protection, FedEx actively works with senders to update paperwork to resubmit to CBP or return shipments to senders. In some cases, shippers can request that packages be disposed of if they would prefer not to pay to return to sender. In those rare cases, recipients are notified at the direction of the shipper.

But your deliverer is saying, no, actually, we’re passing that cost on to you. Because you’re acting as the importer.”</p><p>These fees could cost equal to or more than the item you ordered itself. “You’ve got to pay extra attention to small prints,” said Beiri.</p><p>With looming costs and lost packages on the horizon, Beiri says shoppers will likely make “substitution questions” – are you renovating or are you going on vacation? Are you splashing on Christmas gifts, or are you treating yourself to dining out?</p><p>“I think these are interesting times of having to make choices and asking yourself what can we do given that we have an affordability crisis, rent, insurance, making ends meet,” said Beiri. “That’s what’s currently going on.”</p><p>In order to better handle evolving trade policy, Wasserbach says that UPS will likely aim to hire a massive number of entry writers to assist with necessary documentation for legal transportation of goods across international borders. However, now that it is the busiest time of year in terms of delivering people their Christmas shopping, Wasserbach doubts an influx of hiring could make much of a difference, given the amount of training required.</p><p>The company’s revenue has already taken a hit on account of Trump’s policies. Tariffs on China and the elimination of the de minimis rule saw imports from China, UPS’s most profitable route, drop reportedly 35 percent earlier this year.</p><p>“I would assume it’s gonna get better next year,” said Wasserbach. “But as for solving this problem before Christmas, I don’t think that that’s gonna happen.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The film looks at the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s in parallel with the pursuit of justice after the Dayton Accords. It shows the horrors of ethnic cleansing, mass killings and displacement beginning when Yugoslavia started to break apart. Raw survivor testimonies highlight the human cost of the war from the siege of Sarajevo to the Srebrenica genocide. It also shows how the investigators and prosecutors of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia built cases against those responsible, including Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, and how this tribunal ultimately gave birth to the ICC. The film ends by asking whether justice can genuinely heal a shattered region – and what the future of international justice is today.</p></div><div class=\"article-info m--t-20 m--desktop-b-30 m--b-mobile-20\"><div class=\"article-dates\"><p class=\"date-simple\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Published On 22 Dec 2025</span><span aria-hidden=\"true\">22 Dec 2025</span></p></div><div class=\"rich-share dark-view\" data-testid=\"rich-share\"><div class=\"rich-share__wrapper\"><div class=\"rich-share__button-wrapper\"><button class=\"rich-share__button row\" aria-expanded=\"false\"><p class=\"screen-reader-text\">Click here to share on social media</p><svg class=\"icon icon--share2 icon--primary icon--16 \" viewbox=\"0 0 20 16\" version=\"1.1\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><title>share2</title><path fill=\"#000\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11.688 9.048c-.659 0-1.252.282-1.673.733l-4.92-2.45c.016-.115.028-.232.028-.352 0-.117-.011-.23-.027-.343l4.913-2.423a2.285 2.285 0 0 0 1.68.739C12.964 4.952 14 3.899 14 2.6 14 1.302 12.965.25 11.688.25S9.377 1.302 9.377 2.601c0 .117.01.23.027.343L4.49 5.367a2.285 2.285 0 0 0-1.68-.739C1.536 4.628.5 5.681.5 6.979c0 1.299 1.035 2.35 2.312 2.35.659 0 1.252-.281 1.673-.731l4.92 2.45a2.357 2.357 0 0 0-.029.351c0 1.299 1.035 2.351 2.312 2.351S14 12.698 14 11.399s-1.035-2.35-2.312-2.35Z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg></button><p class=\"rich-share__social-text\">Share</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>"

Monday of the Atlantic coast projects, which were already under construction, was the latest blow for offshore wind developers that have faced repeated disruptions under Trump.</p><section

US president has said he finds wind turbines ugly, costly and inefficient, while pursuing a larger <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/20/trump-announces-new-offshore-drilling-projects-despite-bipartisan-pushback\">pivot away</a> from renewable energy.</p><p>Shares in Danish energy firm Orsted, which owns two of the affected projects, traded down more than 12 percent by late morning, with other companies like Dominion and Equinor also trading lower.</p><p>The US Department of the Interior said the Department of Defense had raised concerns that the movement of huge turbine blades for offshore wind projects, as well as the highly reflective towers that hold them up, could cause radar interference that could make it hard for the military to identify and locate threats.</p><p>“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement.</p><p>The pause will give relevant federal agencies “time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects,” the department said.</p><p>The pause will affect Orsted ‘s Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners’ Vineyard Wind 1 project, Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and Equinor’s Empire Wind 1 project, according to the department.</p><p>The National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), a trade group representing offshore wind developers, urged the administration to end the pause quickly.</p><p>“The regulatory process involves a rigorous framework for assessing the national security implications of proposed projects, and every project under construction has already undergone review by the Department of Defense with no objections,” NOIA President Erik Milito said.</p><p>Orsted, Equinor and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners were not immediately available for comment.</p><p>Dominion said the suspension will threaten grid reliability for its Virginia customers, including military bases and data centres powering artificial intelligence.</p><p>“These electrons will power the data centres that will win the AI race, support our war fighters, and build the nuclear warships needed to maintain our maritime supremacy,” the company said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"anti-wind-stance\">Anti-wind stance</h2><p>Monday’s move was the latest instance of the administration ordering a pause to offshore wind projects already under construction.</p><p>In August, the administration ordered Orsted to halt the advanced construction on the Revolution Wind project off the Rhode Island coast, though a federal judge later lifted the ban.</p><p>Earlier in the year, the administration lifted a stop-work order on Equinor’s Empire Wind in a compromise with New York state that paved the way for a natural gas pipeline Trump supports.</p><p>Trump campaigned for the White House on a promise to end the offshore wind industry, saying “windmills” are too expensive and hurt whales and birds. He has instead <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/20/trump-announces-new-offshore-drilling-projects-despite-bipartisan-pushback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promoted oil and gas drilling.</a></p><p>The uncertainty has taken a financial toll on developers. Orsted raised $9.4bn earlier this year to help fund US projects after potential partners were deterred by Trump’s approach.</p></div></div></body></html>"
