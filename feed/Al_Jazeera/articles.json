That was how they [the bandits] missed us,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But I heard every shout, every cry and footstep as they picked up people from our house and surrounding houses,” she added, between sobs.</p><p>With tears streaming down her face, Idris recounts how she kept calling out the names of her missing family members – men, women and children.</p><p>Her house sits on the edge of the village, close to a bandits’ crossing point.</p><p>“I don’t know what they are doing to them now. I don’t know if they’ve eaten or not,” she said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>A total of 177 people were abducted that day. Eleven escaped their captors, but about a quarter of Kurmin Wali’s population remains captive.</p><p>Initially, state officials denied the attack had taken place.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath, Kaduna’s police commissioner called reports a “falsehood peddled by conflict entrepreneurs”.</p><p>Finally, two days later, Nigeria’s national police spokesman, Benjamin Hundeyin, admitted an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/nigerian-police-confirm-gunmen-abducted-villagers-after-initial-denials\">“abduction”</a> had indeed occurred on Sunday. He said police had launched security operations with the aim of “locating and safely rescuing the victims and restoring calm to the area”.</p><p>Uba Sani, Kaduna state’s governor, added that more than just rescuing the abductees, the government was committed to ensuring “that we establish permanent protection for them”.</p><p>There has been a police presence in Kurmin Wali since then. But it is not enough to reassure villagers.</p><p>Locals say the police are not there to protect the village, but merely to compile the names of victims they for days denied existed.</p><p>At the premises of Haske Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, the largest church in the village, days after the attack, a rust-coloured door lay on the floor, pulled off its hinges. Inside the mud-brick building, the site was chaotic.</p><p>Plastic chairs overturned in panic were strewn around the room – just as the kidnappers had left them.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4274563\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4274563\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4274563\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_697b8cc5-1769704645.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C544&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"An exterior view of the Haske Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, after an attack by gunmen in which worshippers were kidnapped, in Kurmin Wali, Kaduna, Nigeria, January 20, 2026.

We trekked a long distance before taking a break,” he said of his journey with his captors.</p><p>Shekarau, a father of five, was holding his three-year-old daughter when he and others were taken.</p><p>“When we reached an abandoned village, I ducked inside a room with my little daughter when the attackers weren’t looking. I closed the door and waited. After what seemed like eternity, and sure they were gone, I opened the door and walked back home, avoiding the bush path,” he said, now back in the village.</p><p>But on returning home, his heart sank. He and his three-year-old were the only ones who made it home. The rest of the family is still held by the kidnappers.</p><p>Standing in a parched field of long dried grass, Shekarau says the village no longer feels like home.</p><p>The village chief was also taken, but managed to escape. He now presides over a community hopeful for the return of the missing – but too scared to stay.</p><p>“Everyone is on edge. People are confused and don’t know what to do. Some haven’t eaten. There are entire families that are missing,” said Ishaku Danazumi, the village chief.</p><p>Danazumi says the kidnappers regularly visit and loot the village grain stores and the villagers’ possessions, including mobile phones.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Two days after the attack, residents said the bandits rode through their village again.</p><p>On that day, the community also received a ransom demand.</p><p>“They accused us of taking 10 motorcycles they hid in the bush to evade soldiers who operated here the week before,” Danazumi said. “But we didn’t see those bikes.”</p><p>The chief said the captors told him the return of the 10 bikes was a precondition for the return of his people.</p><p>But deep inside, he knows, more demands will follow.</p><p>In the village, residents wait in their thatch and mud-brick houses, hoping for their loved ones to return.</p><p>But because of fear and the tense situation, many are leaving the farming community.</p><p>“Anyone thinking about remaining in this village needs to reconsider,” said Panchan Madami, a resident who also survived the attack.</p><p>“Only the recklessly bold can stay with the current state of security here.”</p><p>Villagers said that before the January 18 attack, 21 people kidnapped by the bandits were returned to them after a ransom was paid. But just two days later, a quarter of the village was taken.</p><p>“It will be stupid to stay here, hoping things will be OK,” added Madami.</p><p>The government says it will establish a military post to protect the community from further attacks. But that is not comforting enough for Idris, who has also made up her mind to leave.</p><p>“I’m not coming back here,” she said, gathering her belongings to leave the village where she grew up and married. “I just hope the rest of my family gets back.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4274561\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4274561\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4274561\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/reuters_697b8cbe-1769704638.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A drone view of Kurmin Wali, where churches were attacked by gunmen and worshippers were kidnapped, in Kurmin Wali, Kaduna, Nigeria, January 20, 2026.

He was articulating a view that has become increasingly central to British immigration politics. The UK’s first ethnic minority home secretary said he opposed admitting unskilled workers and those who do not speak English. By his own criteria, neither his father, who arrived as an unskilled worker, nor his mother, who did not speak English, would have been permitted to settle in the country. Promoting his memoir, The Colour of Time, Javid was unambiguous: immigration must fall, English-language requirements should be tougher, and entry should be limited to skilled workers.</p><p data-start=\"1183\" data-end=\"1429\">Far from being exceptional, Javid’s position points to a broader and increasingly visible pattern in British politics. Some of the most prominent anti-immigration positions of recent years have been articulated by ethnic minority politicians.</p><p data-start=\"1431\" data-end=\"1888\">This pattern is most visible at the Home Office, the government department responsible for borders, asylum, detention and deportation. Since 2018, the role of home secretary has repeatedly been held by ethnic minority politicians, including Javid himself, Priti Patel, Suella Braverman and James Cleverly under Conservative governments, followed by Shabana Mahmood under Labour. Each, in turn, has advanced a tougher approach to immigration control.</p><p data-start=\"1890\" data-end=\"2397\">Under Priti Patel, a points-based immigration system was introduced and the controversial plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was developed. Braverman went further still, declaring that seeing deportation flights take off would be her “dream” and her “obsession”. Yet despite the increasingly punitive tone, overall immigration numbers rose during this period. Rhetoric and outcomes diverged. Even so, the political signal from the Home Office was unmistakable: firmness on borders above all else.</p><p data-start=\"2399\" data-end=\"2867\">The explanation for this phenomenon lies not simply in personal biography or individual conviction. Drawing on my research on ethnic minority representation in Britain, I argue that these appointments reflect a clear political logic. When political parties harden their stance on immigration, they often rely on minority politicians to act as reputational shields, figures who can front restrictive policies while insulating parties from accusations of racism.</p><p data-start=\"2869\" data-end=\"3337\">Reputational shields matter because immigration control in the UK has long been racialised. From post-war restrictions on Commonwealth migration to the “hostile environment” policies associated with former Prime Minister Theresa May, border control has frequently intersected with race and belonging. When such policies are championed by ethnic minority politicians, criticism can more readily be reframed as ideological disagreement rather than racial exclusion.</p><p data-start=\"3339\" data-end=\"3854\">Nowhere is this dynamic clearer than at the Home Office. The department effectively demands a hard line on immigration from its secretary, and appointing minority politicians to the role has repeatedly proven politically expedient. This does not mean white politicians are more liberal, as Theresa May’s record makes clear, but it does help explain why parties have been willing to place minority figures at the forefront of border enforcement. Four consecutive Conservative home secretaries were non-white.</p><p data-start=\"3856\" data-end=\"4263\">This logic now extends beyond the Conservative Party. Labour’s appointment of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/who-is-shabana-mahmood-the-home-secretary-is-the-face-of-labours-most-hardline-immigration-policies-to-date-269977\">Shabana Mahmood</a> as home secretary marks a notable shift for a party that has historically sought to signal greater nuance on immigration. Since taking office, Mahmood has announced and is implementing sweeping asylum reforms, which she has described as “the most substantial reform to the UK’s asylum system in a generation”.</p><p data-start=\"4265\" data-end=\"4869\">That Keir Starmer has placed a minority politician at the forefront of Labour’s tougher turn on immigration suggests an implicit recognition of this reputational logic. Mahmood’s identity does not determine her policy positions, but it does shape how those positions are received, particularly in a media and political environment where immigration debates are routinely filtered through accusations of racism. In this sense, Labour appears to have absorbed a lesson from Conservative governments about how ethnic minority representation can function as political cover when tightening border policy.</p><p data-start=\"4871\" data-end=\"5598\">Immigration is now cited by about four in 10 Britons as the most important issue facing the country. For Labour, long uneasy talking about borders and enforcement, Mahmood’s stance represents a recalibration. Her measures include tightening the route from asylum to permanent settlement, reforming human rights legislation to facilitate removals, and suspending visas for countries that refuse to accept returned nationals. She has been unapologetic, arguing that the pace and scale of immigration has destabilised communities and fuelled perceptions of unfairness. While Labour backbenchers and the Green Party have accused her of scapegoating migrants, figures on the political right have welcomed her approach.</p><p data-start=\"5600\" data-end=\"6069\">It would, however, be a mistake to portray minority politicians as mere symbols or cynical mouthpieces. Many articulate their positions through narratives of fairness, legality and contribution. Javid has spoken of his family’s experiences of racism while emphasising that they entered the UK legally and worked hard. Mahmood has similarly argued that constituents who “did things the right way” feel aggrieved by irregular arrivals crossing the Channel in small boats.</p><p data-start=\"6071\" data-end=\"6430\">These arguments reflect a broader shift in how immigration is discussed: less overtly in racial terms and more through the language of fairness, order and control. Yet this reframing does not escape the UK’s longer history of racialised immigration policy. Instead, ethnic minority politicians increasingly play a visible legitimising role within it.</p><p data-start=\"6432\" data-end=\"7086\">The prominence of politicians of colour at the forefront of the UK’s immigration crackdown is therefore not a paradox. It is a window into how representation is operationalised in practice. When Sajid Javid says his parents would not be admitted today, he is not disavowing his background but signalling his political credibility. The deeper question is what happens when such credibility is no longer enough to contain the moral and social consequences of a system built on exclusion. Race, borders and political legitimacy, and enduring questions about belonging and citizenship, remain tightly bound together in contemporary British politics.</p><p data-start=\"6432\" data-end=\"7086\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

These are allegations UNRWA has vehemently denied, stressing that it takes disciplinary action against any employee proven to be involved in wrongdoing.</p><p>In 2025, the Israeli Knesset passed legislation effectively banning the agency’s operations in areas it considers part of “Israeli sovereignty”, including occupied East Jerusalem, claiming the agency poses a security threat.</p><p>The agency rejected the law as illegal and said it places it in direct confrontation with Israeli authorities.</p><p>As of this month, the UN agency has recorded deaths in Israeli attacks of more than 380 of its staff members in Gaza since October 2023.</p><p>Earlier this month, Israel sent in bulldozers, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/israel-bulldozes-unrwa-buildings-in-occupied-east-jerusalem\">partially destroying UNRWA’s headquarters</a> in East Jerusalem. Israeli lawmakers and members of the far-right government were also present, according to Lazzarini, who said the attack came “in the wake of other steps taken by Israeli authorities to erase the Palestine Refugee identity”.</p><p>As a UN agency, it enjoys international legal status. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier in January that he could take Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) if it does not repeal <a href=\"/features/2024/1/31/israels-allegations-unrwa-effort-eliminate-agency\">laws targeting UNRWA</a> and return its seized assets and property.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"by-what-law-does-this-happen\">‘By what law does this happen?’</h2><p>Maryam herself sustained minor injuries in the Israeli attack, while five of her children also suffered injuries. Her husband was critically wounded in the neck.</p><p>In April 2024, she left Gaza as a medical companion to her spouse, who was referred for treatment at an Egyptian hospital. She was forced to leave behind the rest of her children in Gaza, including those who were wounded.</p><p>“It feels like leaving for treatment and escaping death has become a crime we are being punished for,” Maryam told Al Jazeera by phone, her voice breaking with tears.</p><p>“Wasn’t it enough that I spent all this time grieving for my injured children, being away from them and constantly worried about them while accompanying my husband in treatment? They added to our wounds by dismissing us from our jobs. By what law does this happen?”</p><p>For Maryam and many others who were displaced outside Gaza during the war, the blow was especially severe, as it followed a February 2025 decision to place them on “exceptional leave” despite the fact that many of them continued teaching remotely.</p><p>“All my children are injured and have metal plates in their limbs. They suffered immensely after my salary stopped,” said the mother of eight.</p><p>In the past two weeks, the crisis has extended to employees who remain in the Strip, after the agency decided to cut their salaries by 20 percent, a move that has further deepened their humanitarian suffering amid Gaza’s catastrophic conditions.</p><p>The financial shortfall comes amid a decline in international donations, which had long formed the backbone of UNRWA’s budget, particularly after several donor states froze their contributions following Israeli allegations against some of its employees.</p><p>UNRWA provides essential services to millions of Palestinian refugees, who make up about 70 percent of the Gaza population, including education, healthcare, and social assistance, playing a central role in maintaining a minimum level of stability amid repeated Israeli wars and restrictions on crossings.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4266846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4266846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4266846\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/873A5243-copy-1769426398.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Dr Mustafa Al-Ghoul, a dentist with UNRWA for 29 years, who heads the UNRWA staff union\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4266846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr Mustafa al-Ghoul, a dentist with UNRWA for 29 years, who heads the agency’s staff union, is currently leading protests against its recent decisions [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-gaza-first\">Why Gaza first?</h2><p>There has been widespread anger and protests among UNRWA staff in Gaza, both inside and outside the Strip, who argue that the measures disproportionately target Gaza compared with the agency’s other five areas of operation: the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.</p><p>Mustafa al-Ghoul, head of the UNRWA staff union in Gaza and a dentist who has worked with the agency for 29 years, questioned why Gaza — the most devastated and afflicted area — was chosen as the first sacrifice.</p><p>“All the measures started in Gaza, as if Gaza is not already overwhelmed by death, destruction, and hunger,” he told Al Jazeera, standing in front of their partially destroyed headquarters in Gaza City.</p><p>Of some of the 600 dismissed Palestinian employees who were outside Gaza, the cutting off of their salaries and savings without prior notice, al-Ghoul said, “Some are sick.

It provided everything,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>That reality, however, has changed dramatically since the war began.</p><p>“Now, there is nothing,” Jihan said, referring to the food aid that UNRWA has not been able to distribute for months.</p><p>Since October 2023, all humanitarian agencies, particularly the UN egency, have faced persistent obstacles in delivering aid to Gaza.</p><p>On multiple occasions, Lazzarini accused Israel of using humanitarian aid as a political tool.

It was established by a UN General Assembly resolution and has operated for decades,” he said.</p><p>Al-Shawa said the agency is facing “continuous Israeli incitement” alongside Israeli bans on its operations in the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly Gaza, and the obstruction of humanitarian aid.</p><p>He warned that weakening UNRWA serves Israel’s agenda to erase the Palestinians’ right of return and compensation. That has been a key goal of the successive Israeli governments.</p><p>Linking the agency’s cuts to a broader campaign against humanitarian work in Gaza, al-Shawa noted Israel has faced <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/israel-faces-widespread-condemnation-as-ngo-ban-comes-into-effect\">global condemnation</a> after a ban on dozens of international aid organisations working to provide life-saving assistance to Palestinians in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip came into effect.</p><p>“There is a war being waged against humanitarian work, including UNRWA, and we are paying the price for our commitment to international humanitarian law, a law the Israeli occupation refuses to uphold.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He might still vote, but faces a dilemma over whom to support since the Awami League’s boat symbol will not appear on the ballot.</p><p>The boatman, about 50 years of age, said that his family fears that if they don’t vote, they might be identified as Awami League supporters in a country where Hasina and her party today draw widespread anger for the decades of killings, forced disappearances, torture and political crackdowns that they oversaw.</p><p>Under Hasina’s rule, the Jamaat-e-Islami party and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – the Awami League’s two biggest opponents – were systematically persecuted. The Jamaat was banned, some of its leaders were executed, and many others were imprisoned. Thousands of BNP leaders were arrested, including former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December. Her son and current BNP leader Tarique Rahman lived in exile in London for 17 years before returning to Bangladesh in December.</p><p>Widespread political violence continues to trouble Bangladesh’s preparations for the elections, with leaders from the BNP, Jamaat and other parties<a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/fear-and-hope-in-bangladesh-how-political-violence-is-haunting-elections\"> killed in recent weeks.</a> But now, like their counterparts from other parties, common supporters of the Awami League no longer enjoy immunity either from the anger the actions of their leaders have triggered.</p><p>“If we don’t vote, we risk being singled out,” Mridha told Al Jazeera. “So our family will go to the polling centre.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Conversations with longtime Awami League voters in areas where the party once dominated reveal a divided mood.</p><p>While many say they will still go to polling centres, others say they may not vote at all.</p><p>Like Solaiman Mia, a rickshaw puller in Gopalganj, the Hasina family’s bastion and the hometown of her father and Bangladesh’s founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose grave lies in the district south of Dhaka as an enduring symbol of the Awami League’s powerful grip on the region. Hasina won huge victories in Gopalganj in every election since 1991.</p><p>Mia is unequivocal that he and his family would not vote this year. “An election without the boat on the ballot is not an election,” he told Al Jazeera, a sentiment shared by many residents of Gopalganj.</p><h2 id=\"awami-league-will-return\">‘Awami League will return’</h2><p>In central Dhaka’s Gulistan area lies the Awami League’s head office – now abandoned after it was vandalised and set on fire during the uprising. Since then, the building has been used as a shelter by homeless people and sections of it as a public toilet.</p><p>Outside the office, street vendor Abdul Hamid says he has not seen Awami League activists anywhere near the area for months.</p><p>“You won’t find any Awami League supporters here,” he said. “Even if someone is a supporter, they would never admit it. The Awami League has faced crises before, but it has never almost disappeared like this.”</p><p>Nearby, another street vendor, Sagor, is selling woollen scarves draped in the symbols of the BNP and its former ally and now rival, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/what-is-bangladeshs-jamaat-e-islami-party-could-it-lead-the-country-next\">Jamaat-e-Islami party</a>.</p><p>“The scarves belonging to the parties are selling well,” he said as pedestrians surrounded him.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271090\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271090\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271090\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vendors-selling-BNP-and-Jamaat-party-symbol-designed-woolen-scarf-nearby-the-awami-league-central-party-office-in-dhaka-1769597450.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Election\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271090\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A vendor selling scarves with BNP and Jamaat party symbols in Dhaka [Masum Billah/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Still, some Awami League supporters are optimistic about the party’s resurgence.</p><p>Arman, a former leader of Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, said the party may be maintaining a strategic silence, but is far too entrenched to disappear from Bangladesh’s politics.</p><p>“The Awami League will return,” he told Al Jazeera. “And when it does, it will return with Sheikh Hasina.”</p><p>But Rezaul Karim Rony, a Dhaka-based political analyst and editor of Joban magazine, is not so sure. He thinks surviving the February election will be difficult for the Awami League.</p><p>“If an election takes place without the Awami League, its voters will gradually go through a form of reconciliation at the local level,” Rony told Al Jazeera. “They will be absorbed locally – aligning themselves with whichever influential forces or parties dominate their areas – and begin rebuilding their everyday lives that way.”</p><p>As a result, Rony said, it will be difficult for the Awami League to recover its support base once the election is over. He said while a section of the party’s supporters still sees no future for the party without Hasina, a sizeable group within it is frustrated by her authoritarian rule when she was in power.</p><p>“With supporters divided, with or without Hasina, returning to its previous political position is extremely difficult – almost impossible – for the Awami League,” Rony said.</p><h2 id=\"feels-like-a-political-wipeout\">‘Feels like a political wipeout’</h2><p>Other analysts argue that a recent surge in support for Jamaat-e-Islami could, paradoxically, offer a reference point for a possible future revival of the Awami League. The Jamaat supported Pakistan during Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971, a role that its critics – including Hasina – have repeatedly used to challenge its credibility.</p><p>The party was banned twice, and its top leaders were hanged and jailed during Hasina’s rule. Still, it survived, and is now – according to polls – on the cusp of its best ever performance in the February elections.</p><p>“Jamaat’s current level of activism, influence and assertiveness – what might even be described as a show of dominance – can paradoxically be seen as a kind of blessing for the Awami League,” Anu Muhammad, a retired economics professor at Jahangirnagar University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Muhammad said the appeal of the Awami League extends far beyond its formal political structure, making its total political erasure unlikely. “The Awami League is not just its leadership,” he said. “It is connected to cultural, social and other forces.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271085\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271085\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271085\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vandalised-awami-league-office-in-rajbari-copy-1769597383.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladesh Election\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271085\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A vandalised and deserted Awami League office in Rajbari, Bangladesh [Golam Mohiuddin Shohan/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>A pre-election survey by the International Republican Institute, a United States think tank focused on democratic governance, suggested the Awami League still retains a support base of about 11 percent.</p><p>Yet, the party does not feature in the ongoing <a href=\"/features/2026/1/22/tiktok-facebook-youtube-bangladeshs-latest-election-battlegrounds\">election campaign</a>, and its leaders have instead been seen organising events from India, including a controversial <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/bangladesh-slams-india-over-fugitive-ex-pm-hasinas-first-public-address\">address by Hasina</a> – her first since ouster – at a “Save democracy in Bangladesh” event at New Delhi’s Foreign Correspondents Club.</p><p>“To overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime of this national enemy at any cost, the brave sons and daughters of Bangladesh must defend and restore the Constitution written in the blood of martyrs, reclaim our independence, safeguard our sovereignty, and revive our democracy,” Hasina said in a prerecorded audio message.</p><p>A furious Dhaka said it was “surprised and shocked” that Indian authorities allowed such an event to take place.</p><p>Back home, however, Hasina’s party is struggling to assert political relevance, raising questions about its survival.</p><p>Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, argued that, by strict democratic standards, an election in Bangladesh without the Awami League cannot be considered fully credible, calling the vote “an election with an asterisk”.</p><p>At the same time, he argued, the Awami League had – in the eyes of many Bangladeshis – forfeited its rights to be treated as a legitimate party because of the repression that Hasina had overseen and its earlier efforts to tilt the electoral playing field. The 2014, 2018 and 2024 elections – which Hasina won with a landslide – were all widely seen as manipulated, with opposition boycotts and crackdowns on rivals.</p><p>Still, Kugelman said the nature of dynastic political parties in South Asia is such that they rarely die.</p><p>“Even though the Awami League is in a bad place, it is essentially out of the political picture indefinitely in Bangladesh; one certainly should not rule out a potential future comeback. Political circumstances can change very quickly,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kugelman compared the party’s current crisis with what its bitter rival, the BNP, suffered during Hasina’s regime when the main opposition party struggled to mount a meaningful political or electoral challenge – only to re-emerge now as the most likely contender for power.</p><p>He said the Awami League is likely to adopt a “waiting strategy”. As long as Hasina remains politically active, she is likely to “want to stay in the game” and might also announce her US-based son Sajeeb Wazed as her dynastic successor.</p><p>“It could take time,” Kugelman said. “Given how politics play out in this region, they can be quite volatile. If an opening emerges down the road and the Awami League is in a better position to operate as a viable political force, it could well come back. But for now, it is essentially dead in the water.”</p><p>That is not a happy portent for Mridha, the boatman in Rajbari, for whom the uncertainty over his party’s future is deeply unsettling.</p><p>“My father used to talk about how the Awami League struggled after Bangabandhu [as Hasina’s father is fondly called] was assassinated,” he said, referring to Rahman’s assassination during a coup by the army in 1975, which pushed the Awami League into its first major crisis.</p><p>“But this year feels like a political wipeout.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

That deal prompted a rebuke last week from Trump, who <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115950424403894234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">threatened</a> to impose a 100 percent tariff on Canada.</p><p>In the face of Trump’s accusations that Canada would serve as a “drop-off port” for Chinese goods, Carney clarified that Ottawa was not seeking a free-trade agreement with Beijing.</p><p>But on Thursday, he nevertheless played up the perks he said the agreement would offer to Canada’s agriculture sector.</p><p>“Part of that agreement unlocks more than $7bn in export markets for Canadian farmers, ranchers, fish harvesters and workers across our country,” Carney said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Carney added that Ottawa would soon seek to advance “trading relationships with global giants” including India, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the South American trade bloc Mercosur.</p><p>“And we will work to renew our most important economic and security relationship with the United States through the joint review of the Canada-United States-Mexico agreement later this year,” he said, referring to the regional free trade agreement, which expires in July.</p><h2 id=\"respect-canadian-sovereignty\">‘Respect Canadian sovereignty’</h2><p>Carney’s pledge to diversify Canada’s portfolio of trade and security partners comes just eight days after he delivered an <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/21/rupture-in-the-world-order-speeches-by-carney-world-leaders-at-davos\">attention-grabbing speech</a> at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p><p>During the address, Carney warned that the “rules-based” international order was a fiction that was fading, replaced by “an era of great power rivalry”, where might makes right.</p><p>“We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false, that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically,” Carney told the audience in Davos.</p><p>“We knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or the victim.”</p><p>He ultimately called for the so-called “middle powers” of the world to rally together in these unpredictable times.</p><p>The speech was widely seen as a rebuke to Trump, who has launched an aggressive tariff campaign on global trading partners, including Canada.</p><p>In early January, Trump also abducted the leader of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, in what critics describe as a violation of international law.</p><p>His pledge to “run” Venezuela was followed by a series of aggressive statements towards the self-governing Danish territory of Greenland, which he threatened to seize.</p><p>Those threats have sent shudders through the NATO alliance, which counts both the US and Denmark as members.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Since before the start of his second term, Trump has also pushed to expand US control into Canada, repeatedly calling the country a “state” and its prime minister a “governor”.</p><p>In response to Carney’s speech at Davos, Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/23/rights-advocates-welcome-canadas-exclusion-from-trump-board-of-peace\">withdrew</a> Carney’s invitation to join his so-called Board of Peace.</p><p>Carney, however, has publicly stood by his statements, dismissing US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s claims that he “aggressively” walked back his position during a private call with Trump.</p><p>In a separate exchange on Thursday, Carney was asked about reports that US officials had met with separatists seeking independence for the oil-wealthy province of Alberta.</p><p>The Financial Times reported that State Department officials have held three meetings ​with the Alberta Prosperity Project, a group that pushes for a referendum on whether the energy-producing western province should break away from Canada.</p><p>“We expect the US administration to respect Canadian sovereignty,” Carney replied.</p><p>“I’m always clear in my conversations with President Trump to that effect.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The agency said there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The incident comes as robotaxis are being deployed in rising numbers across the country. The US Senate Commerce Committee had already scheduled a hearing on self-driving cars for February 4, which will include Waymo Chief Safety Officer Mauricio Pena.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) also said it will investigate the incident.</p><p>Waymo said in a blog post on Thursday that it will cooperate in the investigation and said the child “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path”.</p><p>It added that the self-driving vehicle immediately detected the individual as soon as the child emerged from behind the stopped vehicle, braking hard and reducing speed from approximately 17 miles per hour (27 kilometres per hour) to under 6mph (10km/h) before contact was made.</p><p>NHTSA is opening a preliminary evaluation to investigate whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given its proximity to the elementary school during drop-off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.</p><p>The agency said it plans to examine the vehicle’s “intended behaviour in school zones and neighbouring areas, especially during normal school pick-up and drop-off times, including but not limited to its adherence to posted speed limits” and will “also investigate Waymo’s post-impact response”.</p><h2 id=\"rising-incidents\">Rising incidents</h2><p>Waymo said a computer model suggested a fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14mph (23km/h). After the collision, the child stood up immediately, walked to the pavement, and Waymo called 911.</p><p>“The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo said.</p><p>The same day as the incident, the NTSB opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis illegally passed stopped school buses in Austin, Texas, at least 19 times since the start of the school year.</p><p>Waymo in December recalled more than 3,000 vehicles to update the software that had caused vehicles to drive past stopped school buses that were loading or unloading students, increasing the risk of a crash. NHTSA opened a probe in October into Waymo vehicles near school buses.</p><p>Waymo said there were no collisions in the incidents. The Austin Independent School District said five incidents occurred in November after Waymo installed software updates to resolve the issue. The school system asked the company to halt operations around schools during pick-up and drop-off times until it could ensure the vehicles would not violate the law. In December, the school district told the Reuters news agency that Waymo had refused to halt operations around schools.</p><p>In late December, a Waymo <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/8/waymo-runs-into-safety-concerns-and-competition-as-it-expands-in-the-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crushed to death</a> a cat in San Francisco and a month later, a dog met the same fate.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He described how Kazmierczak abruptly stood up and interrupted Omar while she held a town hall in her hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 27.</p><p>“Kazmierczak had a syringe in his hand, and as he continued to rapidly approach Representative Omar, he sprayed her with an initially unidentified liquid from the syringe,” Fossi said in the affidavit.</p><p>Omar had been speaking to the town hall about her outrage over the surge in federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis area, which is part of the congressional district she represents.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, has targeted the Democrat-led area in part because of its large Somali American community, of which Omar is a member.</p><p>She blamed the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and specifically Secretary Kristi Noem, for the violence that had occurred as a result of the immigration raids.</p><p>“Renee Good should be alive. Alex Pretti should still be alive,” Omar said, referring to two US citizens who were recently killed in shootings involving federal agents.</p><p>Good was shot in her car by an agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on January 7, while Pretti was killed when two Customs and Border Patrol Protection agents reportedly opened fire on January 24.</p><p>Omar then called for accountability from the Trump administration and reform to its “reckless and lawless” practices.</p><p>“ICE cannot be reformed. It cannot be rehabilitated. We must abolish ICE for good. And DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must resign or face impeachment,” Omar said, seconds before Kazmierczak stood from his front-row seat and sprayed her.</p><p>Fossi later explained he heard Kazmierczak say as he turned away, “She’s not resigning. You’re splitting Minnesotans apart.”</p><p>The incident caused grave concern, particularly in the immediate aftermath, when it was not clear what substance Omar had been struck with – and whether it was hazardous.</p><p>Thursday’s affidavit outlined several incidents where Kazmierczak had been critical of or appeared to threaten violence against the representative.</p><p>According to the court document, investigators interviewed a “close associate” of Kazmierczak, who overheard him saying on the phone several years ago, “Someone should kill that b****.” The interviewee allegedly told the investigators that they believed Kazmierczak was referring to Omar.</p><p>The affidavit also displayed a cartoon Kazmierczak posted onto his Facebook account criticising Omar for her role in the so-called “defund the police” movement.</p><p>Omar had called to “rebuild” the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose heart stopped while an officer knelt on his neck.</p><p>A member of Congress’s progressive flank, nicknamed “The Squad”, Omar has long been a target for right-wing criticism.</p><p>President Trump, in particular, has repeatedly mocked Omar and spread false rumours about her, including suggestions of incest.</p><p>During a midterm campaign stop this week in Clive, Iowa, he questioned her patriotism and that of other immigrants.</p><p>“They have to show that they can love our country. They have to be proud. Not like Ilhan Omar,” he told a booing crowd. “Did you see that wise guy? You know, she’s always talking about, ‘The Constitution provides me with the following.’ The Constitution? She comes from a country that’s a disaster. It’s not even a country.”</p><p>It was the latest in a string of derogatory remarks Trump had made against Somalia and Omar personally.</p><p>In a December 2 cabinet meeting, for instance,  Trump used Omar as an example of the “garbage” the US immigration system was supposedly letting in.</p><p>Omar arrived in the US at age 12 as a child refugee, fleeing Somalia’s civil war. She has served as the representative for Minnesota’s 5th congressional district since 2019.</p><p>Critics have long warned of a rise in political violence in the US, and just this week, the US Capitol Police released a <a href=\"https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/uscp-threat-assessment-cases-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> saying it had probed 14,938 “concerning statements” made against Congress members in the last year alone.</p><p>That was a significant increase over the rate in 2024, when 9,474 such threats were investigated.</p><p>Since the vinegar-spraying incident, Omar held a separate news conference to denounce the “hateful rhetoric” aimed at her since she took public office.</p><p>She added that the death threats she receives increase when the president mentions her by name. But she emphasised that she remains unbowed.</p><p>“My presence here should tell you that the fear and intimidation doesn’t work on me,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
