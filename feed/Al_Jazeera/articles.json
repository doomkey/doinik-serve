She answered that this week was the first time she had heard of such accusations.</p><p>“On Mexico’s part, there is no investigation that has to do with that,” Sheinbaum said. “As we always say, if they have some evidence, show it.

During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump pursued a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Maduro, which included <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/nicol-s-maduro-moros-and-14-current-and-former-venezuelan-officials-charged-narco-terrorism\">an initial reward</a> of $15m.</p><p>That amount was later raised to $25m during the final weeks of President Joe Biden’s presidency, in reaction to Maduro’s hotly contested re-election to a third term in 2024.</p><p>Election observers said that the vote had not been “<a href=\"https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2024/venezuela-073024.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">democratic</a>“, and the opposition coalition published raw vote tallies that appeared to contradict the government’s official results.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But as Trump began his second term on January 20, critics speculated that the Republican leader would soften his approach to Maduro in order to seek assistance with his campaign of mass deportation.</p><p>Venezuela has a history of refusing to accept deportees from the US.</p><p>Since then, Trump has sent envoy Richard Grenell to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and secured deals that saw US citizens released from Venezuelan custody.

In 2023, exports were estimated to be worth $560m, with top importers of Sarawak’s wood including France, the Netherlands, Japan and the United States, according to Human Rights Watch.</p><p>In recent years, the timber industry has turned to meeting the rapidly growing demand for wood pellets, which are burned to generate energy.</p><p>While logging reaped billions in profits, it often came at the expense of Indigenous communities, who lacked formal legal recognition of their ancestral lands, despite their historical connection to the forest and their deep ecological knowledge of the region.</p><p>“In Sarawak, there are very limited options for communities to actually claim native customary land rights,” says Jessica Merriman from The Borneo Project, an organisation that campaigns for environmental protection and human rights across Malaysian Borneo.</p><p>“Even communities who do decide to try the legal route, which takes years, lawyers, and costs money, they risk losing access to the rest of their customary territories,” Merriman says, explaining that making a legal claim to one tract of land may mean losing much more.</p><p>“Because you’ve agreed – essentially – that the rest [of the land] doesn’t belong to you,” she says.</p><p>Even successful community claims may only grant rights to a very small fraction of what Indigenous communities actually consider to be their native customary land in Sarawak, according to The Borneo Project.</p><p>This also means that logging companies might legally obtain permits to cut the forest in areas which had been previously disputed.</p><p>While timber companies have brought economic opportunities for some, providing job opportunities to villagers as drivers or labourers, many Kenyah community members in the Ulu Baram region have negative associations with the industry.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878183\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878183\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878183\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC04425-1754638109.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Harvested logs in Sarawak [Izzy Sasada/Al Jazeera]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3878183\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Logs transported on a truck in Sarawak [Izzy Sasada/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>“We don’t agree with logging, because it is very damaging to the forests, water and ecosystems in our area,” says David Bilong, a member of Long Semiyang village, which is about a half-hour boat ride from Long Moh village.</p><p>Both Long Moh and Long Semiyang have dwindling populations, with about 200 and 100 full-time residents, respectively.</p><p>Extensive logging roads in the region have increased accessibility for the villages, resulting in younger community members migrating to nearby towns for work and sending remittances back home to support relatives.</p><p>Those who remain in the village, or “kampung”, live in traditional longhouses which are made up of rows of private family apartments connected by shared verandas. Here, community activities like rattan weaving, meetings and karaoke-singing take place.</p><p>Bilong has played an active role in community activism over the years. For him, deforestation activities have contributed to the undermining of generational knowledge, as physical landmarks have been removed from their lived environment.</p><p>“It’s difficult for us to go to the jungle now,” he explains.</p><p>“We don’t know any more which hill is the one we go to for hunting,” he says.</p><p>“We don’t even know where the hill went.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878202\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878202\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878202\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CE6AE106-E695-441C-AC0F-8DC398A6BB75-1754638498.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"William Tinggang examines a mushroom within Nawan.

Indigenous communities across Ulu Baram have shown their resistance to logging activities by making physical blockades.</p><p>This typically entails community members camping for weeks, or even months, along logging roads to physically obstruct unwanted outsiders from entering native customary territories.</p><p>The primary legal framework regulating forest use is the Sarawak Forest Ordinance (1958), which grants the state government sweeping control over forest areas, including the issuance of timber licences.</p><p>Now, local communities are increasingly turning to strategic tools to assert their rights.</p><p>One of these tools is the creation of community maps.</p><p>“We are moving from oral tradition to physical documentation,” says Indigenous human rights activist Celine Lim.</p><p>Lim is the managing director of Save Rivers, one of the local organisations supporting Ulu Baram’s Indigenous communities to map their lands.</p><p>“Because of outside threats, this

government maps, these maps reflect the community’s cultural landmarks.</p><p>They include markers for things like burial grounds, sacred sites and trees which contain poison for hunting with blow darts, reflecting how Indigenous people actually relate to and manage their land sustainably.</p><p>“For Indigenous people, the way that they connect to land is definitely a lot deeper than many of our conventional ways,” says Lim.</p><p>“They see the mountains, the rivers, the land, the forest and in the past, these were entities,” she says.</p><p>“The way you’d respect a person is the way that they would respect these entities.”</p><p>By physically documenting how their land is managed, Indigenous communities can use maps to assert their presence and protect their native customary territory.</p><p>“This community map is really important for us,” says Bilong, who played a role in the creation of Long Semiyang’s community map.</p><p>“When we make a map, we know what our area is and what is in our area,” he says.</p><p>“It is important that we create boundaries”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The tradition of creating community maps in Sarawak first emerged in the 1990s, when the Switzerland-based group Bruno Manser-Fonds – named after a Swiss environmental activist who disappeared in Sarawak in 2000 – began supporting the Penan community with mapping activities.</p><p>The Penan are a previously nomadic indigenous group in Sarawak who have now mostly settled as farmers.</p><p>Through mapping, they have documented at least 5,000 river names and 1,000 topographic features linked to their traditions, and their community maps have been used numerous times as critical documentation to prevent logging.</p><p>Other groups, such as the Kenyah, are following suit with the creation of their own community maps.</p><p>“The reason why the trend of mapping has continued is because in other parts of Baram and Sarawak, they’ve proven to be successful,” says the Borneo Project’s Merriman, “at least in getting the attention of logging companies and the government.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3878221\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3878221\"

native customary territories by joining a global platform hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme that recognises Indigenous and community conserved areas, known as the ICCA.</p><p>Communities participating in the ICCA are listed on a globally accessible online database, and this international visibility offers a place for them to publicise threats and land grabs.</p><p>In Sarawak, the international visibility afforded through ICCA registration could offer an alternative avenue of protection for communities.</p><p>Merriman says that another important aspect of applying for ICCA recognition is the process itself of registering.</p><p>“The ICCA process is fundamentally an organising tool and a self-strengthening tool,” she says.</p><p>“It’s not just about being on the database. It’s about going through the process of a community banding together to protect its own land, to come up with a shared vision of responding to threats and what they want to do to try to make alternative income.”</p><p>Safeguarding Indigenous communities in Sarawak also has an international significance, activists say.</p><p>As the impacts of climate change intensify in Malaysia and globally, the potential role of Sarawak’s rainforests in climate change mitigation is increasingly being recognised.</p><p>“There’s plenty of talk at the state level about protecting forests,” says Jettie Word, executive director of The Borneo Project.</p><p>“Officials often say the right things in terms of recognising their importance in combatting climate change. Though ongoing logging indicates a gap between rhetoric and reality,” Word says.</p><p>“While mapping alone can’t protect a forest from a billion-dollar timber project, when it’s combined with community organising and campaigning, it’s often quite powerful and we’ve seen it successfully keep the companies away,” she says.</p><p>“The maps provide solid evidence of a community’s territory that is difficult to refute.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Earlier this week, Vox’s branch in the Murcia region celebrated the measure, saying on X that “Spain is and always will be a land of Christian roots!”</p><p class=\"p1\">The town’s mayor, Seve Gonzalez, told Spain’s El Pais newspaper that the measure did not single out any one group and that her government wanted to “promote cultural campaigns that defend our identity”.</p><p class=\"p1\">But Mohamed El Ghaidouni, secretary of the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain, said it amounted to “institutionalised Islamophobia”, taking issue with the local government’s assertion that the Muslim festivals celebrated in the centres were “foreign to the town’s identity”.</p><p class=\"p1\">The ban, he said, “clashes with the institutions of the Spanish state” that protect religious freedom.</p><p class=\"p1\">Saiz told Spain’s Antena 3 broadcaster that policies like the ban in Jumilla harm “citizens who have been living for decades in our towns, in our cities, in our country, contributing and perfectly integrated without any problems of coexistence”.</p><p>Separately, Miguel Moratinos, the UN special envoy to combat Islamophobia, said he was “shocked” by the City Council of Jumilla’s decision and expressed “deep concern about the rise in xenophobic rhetoric and Islamophobic sentiments in some regions in Spain”.</p><p></p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“The decision undermines the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion” as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he said in a statement on Friday.</p><p>“Policies that single out or disproportionately affect one community pose a threat to social cohesion and erode the principle of living together in peace,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"far-right-clashes-with-locals\">Far-right clashes with locals</h2><p class=\"p1\">For centuries, Spain was ruled by Muslims, whose influence is present both in the Spanish language and in many of the country’s most celebrated landmarks, including Granada’s famed Moorish Alhambra Palace.</p><p class=\"p1\">Islamic rule ended in 1492 when the last Arab kingdom in Spain fell to the Catholics.</p><p class=\"p1\">The ban stipulates that municipal sports facilities can only be used for athletic activities or events organised by local authorities. Under no circumstance, it said, can the centre be used for “cultural, social or religious activities foreign to the City Council”.</p><p class=\"p1\">Its introduction follows clashes between far-right groups and residents and migrants that erupted last month in the southern Murcia region after an elderly resident in the town of Torre-Pacheco was beaten up by assailants believed to be of Moroccan origin.</p><p class=\"p1\">Right-wing governments elsewhere in Europe have passed measures similar to the ban in Jumilla, striking at the heart of ongoing debates across the continent about nationalism and religious and cultural pluralism.</p><p class=\"p1\">Last year in Monfalcone, a large industrial port city in northeastern Italy with a significant Bangladeshi immigrant population, far-right mayor Anna Maria Cisint banned prayers in a cultural centre.</p><p class=\"p1\">The move led to protests involving some 8,000 people, and the city’s Muslim community is appealing it in a regional court.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Sex toys were also thrown at games in New York and Phoenix last Tuesday, but didn’t reach the court. Police say another toy was thrown at a game in Atlanta on August 1, although it is unclear if that one reached the court.</p><p>The distractions have created unexpected challenges for the league, the teams and the players, but also for arena security. Here’s what to know.</p><p>A man was arrested Saturday in College Park, Georgia, after he was accused of throwing a sex toy onto the court during the Atlanta Dream’s July 29 matchup with the Golden State Valkyries, according to a police report. The report said he threw another sex toy during the Dream’s August 1 game against the Phoenix Mercury, but that instance did not seem to result in a delay of play.</p><p>He is charged with disorderly conduct, criminal trespassing, public indecency and indecent exposure. All four charges are misdemeanours in the state of Georgia, meaning that if he is convicted, the punishment for each can be a fine of up to $1,000 or jail time of up to 12 months. A misdemeanour for public indecency and indecent exposure may also require registration on the state’s sex offender list.</p><p>The report said the man told police, “This was supposed to be a joke and the joke [was] supposed to go viral.”`</p><p>Another man in Phoenix was arrested after police say he threw a sex toy in the crowd at a Mercury game on Tuesday. Police say the 18-year-old pulled the sex toy from his sweater pocket and threw it towards seats in front of him, striking a spectator in the back.</p><p>The man later told police it was a prank that had been trending on social media and that he bought the toy a day earlier to take to the game. He was later tackled by a volunteer at the arena who had witnessed the incident and began following him as the man tried to leave the arena.</p><p>Police say the man was arrested on suspicion of assault, disorderly conduct and publicly displaying explicit sexual material.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The New York Liberty told The Associated Press on Thursday night that there is an ongoing investigation into the throwing in New York, and the team is cooperating with law enforcement.</p><p>The types of sex toys being thrown onto the court generally do not include metal elements, meaning that arena metal detectors are not able to sense them. When carried on a spectator’s body, they become even more difficult to detect.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>Arena security teams face challenges in catching these items, according to Ty Richmond, the president of the event services division at Allied Universal Security, a company that provides security services to certain NBA, WNBA, NFL, MLB and MLS arenas across the country.</p><p>“Not all stadiums are using a screening process that’s consistent and can detect (the sex toys) because of what it would require — pat down searches, opening the bags, prohibiting bags,” he said. “The conflict of expediency, of getting fans into the arena and into the venue, which is an important issue, and security and safety.”</p><p>The limits of arena security make legal action one of the strongest deterrents for this kind of behaviour, Richmond said.</p><p>“The decision to prosecute and show examples of how people are being handled is very important,” he said. “Without a doubt, I think it will make a difference. The application of it is important, and publicising that is important.”</p><p>There have not been any arrests made yet in Los Angeles and Chicago. In a statement to The AP, the Sparks said they are “working with arena personnel to identify the individual responsible and ensure appropriate action is taken”.</p><p>The WNBA has said that any spectators throwing objects onto the court will face a minimum one-year ban and prosecution from law enforcement.</p><p>As the disturbances pile up, those on the court have become increasingly frustrated.</p><p>“Everyone is trying to make sure the W is not a joke and it’s taken seriously, and then that happens,” Cunningham said on her podcast after nearly being hit by one of the sex toys on Tuesday. “I’m like, ‘How are we ever going to get taken seriously?’”</p><p>No other professional sports leagues have faced sex toy disturbances like this. It has started a conversation online about the perpetrators’ choices to throw them during games in a women’s league and a league with a high-profile amount of lesbian and queer players.</p><p>“This has been going on for centuries, the sexualization of women. This is the latest version of that. It’s not funny. It should not be the butt of jokes,” said Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve on Thursday. “The sexualisation of women is what’s used to hold women down, and this is no different.”</p><p>Despite the criminal behaviour leading to arrests, at least one crypto-based predictions market is offering trades essentially allowing users to wager on whether sex toys will be thrown at future WNBA games.</p><p>Players have also been sounding off on social media, echoing concerns about arena security protocols.</p><p>Liberty forward Isabelle Harrison posted on X last week, saying, “ARENA SECURITY?! Hello??! Please do better. It’s not funny. Never was funny. Throwing ANYTHING on the court is so dangerous.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They circled the moon 10 times before returning to Earth.</p><p>Lovell was the last surviving crew member from that flight.</p><p>He also was a key figure on the doomed 1970 Apollo 13 flight, which was meant to conduct the third lunar landing.</p><p>But the flight met disaster when its oxygen tank exploded in space, endangering all on board. It was unclear whether Lovell, the most experienced astronaut on the flight, and his two colleagues, John Swigert Jr and Fred Haise Jr, would return from the voyage alive.</p><p>As mission commander, however, Lovell helped steer their lunar module back to Earth in a death-defying splashdown. It was his last space flight, and he has been praised for his calm under pressure.</p><p>“Jim’s character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success,” Duffy said.</p><p>“From a pair of pioneering Gemini missions to the successes of Apollo, Jim helped our nation forge a historic path in space that carries us forward to upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and beyond.”</p><p></p><p>Known by the nickname Smilin’ Jim, Lovell was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 25, 1928.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>He began his aviation career in the 1950s as part of the US Navy, where he completed a four-year tour of duty as a test pilot in Maryland. During his naval service, he logged more than 7,000 hours of flying time.</p><p>Then, in 1962, he was selected by NASA to be an astronaut. His first space flight took place as part of the Gemini project, a series of flights designed to improve space travel in order to pave the way for the later Apollo moon missions.</p><p>At first, Lovell was a backup pilot for Gemini 4. But he got his break with the Gemini 7 mission in 1965, which was only the 12th crewed flight the US had sent to space by that point.</p><p>He was paired with Borman, his future Apollo 8 colleague, for that launch, and together, they made a rendezvous in space with Gemini 6 — a first-time feat for two crewed flights.</p><p>Lovell was also on the spacecraft for the final mission of the project, Gemini 12, which paired him with Buzz Aldrin, then a rookie.</p><p>With the Gemini missions complete, NASA turned its attention to putting a man on the moon.</p><p>Lovell and his colleagues on Apollo 8 helped make that possible, with NASA dubbing the circumnavigation “man’s maiden voyage to the moon”.</p><p>“We could actually see the Earth start to shrink,” Lovell would later tell the TV channel CSPAN. “It reminds me of being in a car, looking out the back window, going inside a tunnel and seeing the tunnel entrance shrink as you go farther into the tunnel. It was quite a sensation to think about.”</p><p>“You had to pinch yourself: Hey, we’re really going to the moon.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3879128\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3879128\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3879128\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP20099712956863-1754687006.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C770&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jim Lovell in a black-and-white photo inside Apollo 13\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3879128\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Astronaut Jim Lovell is photographed inside the Apollo 13 lunar module in April 1970 [NASA via AP]</figcaption></figure><p>In 1969, Apollo 11 would make good on the promise of Lovell’s mission, achieving the first successful moon landing of a crewed flight. Lovell’s former colleague Aldrin joined Neil Armstrong in being the first human beings to plant a foot on the moon.</p><p>Lovell was meant to land on the moon himself. He was 42 at the time of his flight with Apollo 13, which was likewise charged with completing a lunar landing.</p><p>But two days into the 10-day mission, the crew heard an explosion. “OK, Houston,” Lovell’s colleague Swigert radioed back to Earth, coining a famous phrase. “We’ve had a problem here.”</p><p>Lovell communicated that the spacecraft was “venting something out into” space. That turned out to be oxygen leaking out of an exploded tank. Another tank remained, but it was damaged, as were the fuel cells. That, in turn, risked leaving the astronauts without electricity.</p><p>The fate of the three astronauts on board the Apollo 13 mission, including Lovell, captured international attention.</p><p>The crew ultimately transformed their lunar module into a “lifeboat” and faced dangerous levels of carbon dioxide as they looped around the moon to boomerang back to Earth.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3879130\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3879130\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3879130\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP20099713391453-1754687029.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C542&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"red Haise, Jack Swigert and Jim Lovell pose at a wooden table for a photo.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3879130\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fred Haise, Jack Swigert and Jim Lovell gather for a photo on the day before launch of Apollo 13 on April 10, 1970 [NASA via AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Lovell ultimately co-wrote a book about his experience, Lost Moon, and the American actor Tom Hanks played him in a 1995 film adaptation, called Apollo 13.</p><p>Lovell himself made a cameo appearance opposite Hanks.</p><p>During his final days, Lovell met with Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, who <a href=\"https://x.com/SecVetAffairs/status/1950559288436400145\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> about the meeting on social media.</p><p>“Yesterday, I was honored to meet one of my personal heroes, Navy Veteran and astronaut Jim Lovell,” Collins said. “Jim’s remarkable leadership during the historic Apollo 13 mission is an inspiration to all!”</p><p>Upon learning of Lovell’s death, Collins <a href=\"https://x.com/SecVetAffairs/status/1953917147518054464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">joined</a> in the outpouring of condolences: “Astronaut and Navy Veteran Jim Lovell was a legend, plain and simple.”</p><p>Lovell is survived by his four children.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Within hours, however, the Supreme Court upheld a stay on that opinion, allowing the bombing to proceed.</p><p>“Any freestanding order to turn planes around mid-air would have been indefensible,” Katsas wrote, citing that 1973 case.</p><p>But Pillard — the Obama-appointed judge — offered a counterargument in her dissent, pointing out that the US is not currently at war.</p><p>She also noted that the Venezuelan men who were deported on the March flights had, by and large, not faced criminal charges. Yet, the US had chosen to deport them to El Salvador for imprisonment in a maximum-security facility with a history of human rights abuses.</p><p>“Whatever one might think about a Supreme Court Justice’s emergency order superintending an ongoing military operation, the authority of a federal district court to temporarily restrain government officials from transferring presumptively noncriminal detainees to a foreign prison without any pre-removal process is well recognized,” Pillard wrote.</p><p>The appeals court’s decision comes just days after the Department of Justice announced it had filed a formal complaint against Boasberg, accusing him of misconduct for public comments he made criticising the Trump administration’s approach to the judiciary.</p><p>Critics have called the complaint a blatant retaliation and evidence of an increasing <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/pam-bondi-who-is-trumps-attorney-general-handling-the-epstein-files\">politicalisation</a> of the Justice Department.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She emphasised that her country is not at risk of US intervention.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“There will be no invasion of Mexico,” <a href=\"/news/2025/5/15/claudia-sheinbaum-denounces-proposed-us-remittance-tax-as-unacceptable\">Sheinbaum</a> said.</p><p>“We were informed that this executive order was coming and that it had nothing to do with the participation of any military personnel or any institution in our territory.”</p><p>The Mexican leader has previously warned that any US military activity on Mexican territory would be a serious violation of the country’s sovereignty.</p><p>The possibility, however, has been raised in the past, particularly by politicians on the US right. In 2023, for instance, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis — then a candidate for president — repeatedly pledged to authorise use of force against drug cartels on Mexican soil.</p><p>Other Republican politicians, like Representative Dan Crenshaw, also <a href=\"/news/2023/3/9/mexicos-president-slams-calls-for-us-military-to-target-cartels\">proposed legislation</a> to greenlight military action against the cartels.</p><p>Such claims have been met with anger in Mexico, where a long history of US intervention has contributed to a strong belief in the need to uphold national sovereignty.</p><p>Still, in May, Trump confirmed that, earlier this year, he offered to send US troops to help combat drug trafficking in Mexico. For her part, Sheinbaum said she <a href=\"/news/2025/5/3/sheinbaum-says-she-rejected-trumps-offer-to-send-us-troops-to-mexico\">firmly rebuffed</a> the idea.</p><p>“I told him, ‘No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable, our sovereignty is not for sale,’” she said at the time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"wide-consequences-for-the-region\">Wide consequences for the region</h2><p>Trump’s heavy-handed approach has also caused frustration in other parts of Latin America, as well as thorny legal and ethical issues.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term in January, Trump has repeatedly stretched the bounds of executive power by claiming that the US faces an “invasion” of criminal immigrants, thereby authorising him to take extreme action.</p><p>But legal experts say it is unclear what the US military might be able to do within the constraints of domestic and international law.</p><p>The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prohibits the military from being used as a domestic policing force. Local and federal law enforcement are, therefore, the entities that helm operations on domestic soil to disrupt and arrest gangs.</p><p>International laws, meanwhile, restrict military actions abroad except in instances of self-defence. The United Nations charter, for instance, includes language that calls on its members to refrain from “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.</p><p>Attacking people outside of combat situations might also infringe upon international humanitarian law.</p><p>Critics have also questioned the efficacy of taking such a strong-armed approach to gangs, drug cartels and other groups.</p><p>After Trump designated many such groups as “terrorist organisations”, human rights groups pointed out that civilians who live in gang-controlled territory could inadvertently be sanctioned, as they are often forced to pay the gangs through coercion.</p><p>Reports that Trump signed the authorisation for military action also come at a tense time for US-Latin American relations.</p><p>The US president recently placed high tariffs on Brazil, in an effort to end a trial against his right-wing ally Jair Bolsonaro over his alleged involvement in a coup plot.</p><p>Brazilian President <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/6/brazil-requests-world-trade-organization-consultation-over-trump-tariffs\">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> called Trump’s actions “unacceptable” and described them as an effort to interfere in the sovereignty of another country.</p></div></div></body></html>"
