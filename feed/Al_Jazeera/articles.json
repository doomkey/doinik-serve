On your behalf. But we are also now being asked to put the fire out. And there is not enough water in the tank. And we’re being shot at.”</p><p>Fletcher chided international “apathy” despite the widespread suffering he had seen on the ground in 2025, and said the institution faces “brutal choices”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The UN’s plan for 2026 identifies 87 million people deemed as priority cases whose lives are on the line.</p><p>Yet the institution says about a quarter of a billion need urgent assistance. It said it will aim to help 135 million people at a cost of $33bn – should it have the means.</p><p>The biggest single appeal of $4bn is aimed at the occupied Palestinian territory. Most of that sum is tagged for Gaza, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/un-warns-gaza-aid-still-too-slow-as-israel-restricts-supplies-despite-truce\">devastated by Israel’s genocidal war,</a> which has left nearly all of its 2.3 million inhabitants homeless and dependent on aid.</p><p>The second priority is <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/wfp-warns-of-massive-humanitarian-aid-crisis-in-sudan-as-war-rages\">Sudan</a>, followed by Syria.</p><p>“(The appeal) is laser-focused on saving lives where the shocks hit hardest: Wars, climate disasters, earthquakes, epidemics, crop failures,” said Fletcher.</p><p>The world body estimates that 240 million people in conflict zones, suffering from epidemics, or victims of natural disasters and climate change are in need of emergency aid.</p><p>If the UN comes up short on funding again, Fletcher predicts it will widen the campaign to appeal to civil society, the corporate world and the public at large.</p><p>UN humanitarian agencies are overwhelmingly reliant on voluntary donations by Western donors, with the US by far the top historical donor.</p><p>Data from the institution showed that the US remained the biggest fund provider in 2025, despite the cuts implemented by President Trump, but its share shrank from more than one-third of the total to 15.6 percent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

And what are the chances of it continuing into phase two?</p><p>Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=\"has-israel-observed-the-ceasefire\">Has Israel observed the ceasefire?</h2><p>No.</p><p>Since the ceasefire began on October 10, Israel has <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/4/live-gaza-mourns-victims-of-israeli-genocide-that-never-really-ended\">broken it more than 590 times,</a> killing at least 360 Palestinians, and sending the total death toll in Gaza from two years of attacks above 70,000.</p><p>Under the first phase – based on US President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan – Israel was required to halt its genocidal war on Gaza, pull back its troops, allow aid in, and exchange hundreds of Palestinian detainees for the remaining captives still held in Gaza.</p><p>Speaking a month after agreeing to the ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s war on Gaza “has not ended” and that Hamas “will be disarmed”.</p><p>Throughout Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, Israeli officials have been pledging to “destroy” Hamas and claiming that Israeli bombardment, <a href=\"/news/2025/8/21/israeli-data-shows-83-percent-of-gaza-war-dead-are-civilians-report\">which has killed mostly civilians according to Israel’s own tally</a>, was to achieve that.</p><p>Palestinians in Gaza remain <a href=\"/features/2025/11/26/stuck-in-gazas-limbo-palestinians-struggle-to-live-amid-israels-attacks\">in limbo and suffering daily attacks</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-israel-withdrawn-its-troops\">Has Israel withdrawn its troops?</h2><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Israel initially pulled its troops back behind what it called the “yellow line”.</p><p>Running around the land edges of the Strip, the poorly demarcated yellow line separates the areas of Gaza controlled by the Israeli army and those controlled by Hamas.</p><p>Hamas accuses Israel of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/palestinians-squeezed-as-israel-moves-beyond-yellow-line-in-gaza-city\">pushing the yellow line further into Gaza</a> “daily”, displacing those who find themselves on the wrong side and killing Palestinians, <a href=\"/news/2025/11/29/israeli-attack-kills-two-children-in-southern-gaza-despite-ceasefire\">including children</a>, approaching the unclear boundary.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-israel-allowed-aid-in\">Has Israel allowed aid in?</h2><p>A full Israeli blockade on Gaza this year led to <a href=\"/news/2025/8/27/starvation-strategy-how-israel-created-famine-in-gaza\">an engineered famine</a> that was recognised by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in Gaza City in August.</p><p>Since the ceasefire, Israel has allowed slightly more aid in, although far less than Gaza’s needs and what the agreement stipulated.</p><p>Aid agencies are reporting that the situation remains desperate, despite cases of malnutrition starting to slow.</p><p>UNICEF and partners in October identified nearly 9,300 children less than five with acute malnutrition, five times the level reported during a previous ceasefire in February.</p><p>“A big portion of the goods coming in is commercial [not humanitarian] – meaning that big aid agencies, including UNRWA, aren’t getting there,” said Tamara Alrifai, the director of external relations for Gaza’s principal aid agency, UNRWA.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-israel-really-committed-to-this-ceasefire\">Is Israel really committed to this ceasefire?</h2><p>Considering Israel’s past actions – including unilaterally breaking a ceasefire earlier this year and Netanyahu saying the war isn’t over – it is uncertain.</p><p>According to many Netanyahu critics, much of the genocide Israel unleashed on Gaza has been shaped by his own political circumstances.</p><p>But that makes him more reliant on the Trump administration, which supports the ceasefire, to protect him.</p><p>“Israel has never had a leader in a weaker position, so the US will never have a better chance of pushing their deal through,” Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, said, listing the threats to the PM that Trump’s support might save him from.</p><p>Netanyahu has petitioned Israel’s President Isaac Herzog to grant him a pardon in his ongoing corruption trial. Trump has also asked Herzog to pardon Netanyahu.</p><p>Netanyahu can also use Trump as an excuse if his far-right government members are angered by an end to the war on Gaza.</p><p>“Netanyahu can always shrug and say, ‘it’s not me, it’s Trump,'” Mekelberg said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-s-planned-for-phase-two\">What’s planned for phase two?</h2><p>Phase two of the deal concerns Gaza’s post-war governance. The most detailed framework so far has been the US-backed plan, now endorsed in part by the UNSC.</p><p>The plan sets out a transitional phase in which Palestinian technocrats – not political factions – would run day-to-day governance.</p><p>Their work would be overseen by a multinational “Board of Peace”, and supported by an International Stabilisation Force tasked with security and demilitarisation. This is meant to allow for the reconstruction of Gaza and stop a return to armed conflict.</p><p>But Hamas and other Palestinian groups have <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/palestine-factions-refuse-foreign-guardianship-on-gaza-as-truce-takes-hold\">rejected the idea of foreign guardianship</a> over Gaza.</p><p>They were also <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/hamas-gaza-factions-say-un-resolution-undermines-national-will\">opposed to the UNSC resolution</a>, saying it “paves the way for field arrangements imposed outside the Palestinian national will”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"so-could-a-final-deal-be-likely\">So, could a final deal be likely?</h2><p>Other than the still escalating death toll in Gaza, nothing is certain.</p><p>Netanyahu, according to his critics, is an opportunist to his core, who is still balancing several competing threats at home.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump and his inexperienced political negotiators drawn from outside of the US’s diplomatic core find themselves negotiating a settlement to both the genocide in Gaza and the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/no-compromise-territory-ukraine-talks-us-kremlin\">war in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>And, whatever deal is agreed upon, Israel is almost certain to continue to attack Gaza whenever it likes, much as it does in the occupied West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, and elsewhere in the region.</p><p>A Palestinian state also does not look any closer to fruition.</p><p>Mekelberg points out that with so many potentially shifting factors, including Israel’s domestic politics, it is hard to know if a final deal is achievable.</p><p>“It’s Netanyahu,” Mekelberg said.</p><p>“His corruption cuts through everything, from his legitimisation of the far-right at home to the way he’s approached the conscription of the ultra-Orthodox [Jews in the Israeli military]. It’s too messy. There are no lines through.</p><p>“Add to this a US president that is also unpredictable, and it’s close to impossible to predict how this will play out.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

If they release the video, then everything that the Republicans are saying will clearly be portrayed to be completely false, and people will get a look at it, and they will see,” Smith said in an interview with the ABC News programme This Week with George Stephanopoulos.</p><p>“It seems pretty clear they don’t want to release this video because they don’t want people to see it because it’s very, very difficult to justify,” Smith added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Jim Himes, who leads the Democrats on the House’s intelligence committee, said the American public should have the chance to judge the video for themselves.</p><p>“Look, there’s a certain amount of sympathy out there for going after drug runners, but I think it’s really important that people see what it looks like when the full force the United States military is turned on two guys who are clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under just so that they have sort of a visceral feel for what it is that we’re doing,” Himes told CBS News’s Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.</p><p>Several Republicans said they would support the release of the video, even as they defended the strikes.</p><p>Senator Tom Cotton, whose account of the survivors trying to “flip” the boat and continue their voyage has been disputed by Democrats, said he would not object to the video’s release, but would defer to the judgement of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Pentagon.</p><p>“I didn’t find it distressing or disturbing. It looks like any number of dozens of strikes we’ve seen on Jeeps and pickup trucks in the Middle East over the years,” Cotton, who chairs the intelligence committee in the Senate, told NBC News’s Meet the Press.</p><p>John Curtis, a Republican senator from Utah, also suggested that he would support the video’s release, saying officials should “err on the side of transparency”.</p><p>“The American people, they like to make decisions too based on facts, not just on what we tell them,” Curtis told CNN’s State of the Union.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>President Donald Trump, whose administration has carried out at least 22 strikes against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific, said last week he would have “no problem” with releasing the footage.</p><p>Hegseth on Saturday struck a more cautious note during an appearance at a defence forum in California, telling a Q&amp;A that officials were reviewing the possibility, but needed to make a “responsible” decision.</p><p>Scrutiny of the strikes has mounted since The Washington Post reported last month that US military officials carried out a second attack on two people clinging to the vessel’s wreckage after Hegseth directed commanders to leave no survivors.</p><p>Hegseth has repeatedly denied the report, which cited two unnamed sources, labelling it “fake news”, “fabricated” and “inflammatory”.</p><p>Legal scholars have argued that both the double-tap strike and the Trump administration’s military campaign against suspected drug traffickers more generally are illegal.</p><p>“The United States is not currently operating in a context of armed conflict in its strikes in the Caribbean. For that reason, this is not a context in which war crimes apply,” Tom Dannenbaum, an expert in the laws of war at Stanford University, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Instead, all of the strikes qualify as murder in violation of domestic criminal law, and extrajudicial killings in violation of international human rights law.”</p><p>At least 87 people have been killed in the strikes, which the Trump administration began in September.</p><p>The Trump administration has yet to make public any evidence to back its claims that the boats were carrying narcotics, were headed to the US, or that they were being commandeered by members of proscribed cartels.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Critics have described the reforms as a power grab by the governing coalition, which has chosen Minister of Economy and Finance Romuald Wadagni as its candidate.</p><p>The opposition Democrats party, founded by Talon’s predecessor, Thomas Boni Yayi, has meanwhile seen its proposed candidate rejected because of what a court ruled was insufficient backing from lawmakers.</p><p>Ibrahim Yahaya Ibrahim, deputy director of the Sahel Project at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that the coup bids in Benin and other African countries have been partly driven by governments rejecting their democratic responsibilities.</p><p>“In recent days and recent months, we have all been holding our breath about what could happen in many countries that are either facing security situations that are bad, or are coming to an election, where there is no clarity on whether the rulers will be respecting the rules of the democratic game,” Yahaya said.</p><p>“That is a good part of the story [in Benin]. President Talon has accepted to step down in a context where many other leaders are trying to add new terms. We saw it in Cote d’Ivoire, we saw it in Cameroon recently, and many other cases.

The focus of the meeting, he said, would be on ending Hamas governance in Gaza and ensuring it fulfilled its “commitment” to the plan, which calls for demilitarisation of the enclave.</p><p>“We have a second phase, no less daunting, and that is to achieve the disarmament of Hamas and the demilitarisation of Gaza,” Netanyahu said during a news conference with visiting German Chancellor <a href=\"/news/2025/12/7/germanys-merz-meets-netanyahu-under-shadow-of-israels-war-on-gaza\">Friedrich Merz</a>.</p><p>It was not clear whether Naim’s comments on the group freezing or storing arms would satisfy Israel’s demands for full disarmament. The Hamas official said the group retained its “right to resist”, adding that laying down arms could happen as part of a process leading to a Palestinian state, with a potential long-term truce lasting five to 10 years.</p><p>The US-drafted plan for Gaza leaves the door open to Palestinian independence, but Netanyahu has long rejected this, asserting that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"vague-plan\">Vague plan</h2><p>Trump’s 20-point plan offers a general way forward on such plans as the establishment of the stabilisation force and the formation of a technocratic Palestinian government operating under an international “board of peace”, but does not offer concrete details or timelines.</p><p>US officials have said they expect “boots on the ground” early next year, but while countries like Indonesia have agreed to contribute troops, there is no roadmap for setting up the force, and its exact makeup, command structure and responsibilities have not been defined.</p><p>Netanyahu appeared to recognise the plan’s vagueness. “What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,” he said on Sunday.</p><p>The Israeli prime minister said that phase two of the plan, which will be set in motion once Hamas returns the last Israeli captive, a policeman killed in the October 7 attack on southern Israel, would be “more difficult”.</p><p>Stage one of the plan has already proven challenging, with Israel continuing to bomb Gaza throughout the ceasefire, killing more than 370 Palestinians, according to health officials. Meanwhile, it has accused Hamas of dragging out captive returns.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-army-says-yellow-line-new-border\">Israeli army says yellow line ‘new border’</h2><p>The plan’s initial steps saw Israeli forces withdraw to positions behind a so-called yellow line in Gaza, though the Israeli military remains in control of 53 percent of the territory. The Israeli military said on Sunday that the line of demarcation was a “new border”.</p><p>“We have operational control over extensive parts of the Gaza Strip, and we will remain on those defence lines,” said Israeli military chief Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir. “The yellow line is a new border line, serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”</p><p>Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani warned at the Doha Forum on Saturday that the truce was at a “critical moment” and could unravel without rapid movement towards a permanent deal.</p><p>He said a true ceasefire “cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal” of Israeli forces, alongside restored stability and freedom of movement for Palestinians, which has so far not transpired under phase one of the plan. He did not allude to the yellow line in his comments.</p><p>Amid growing momentum for a move to phase two of the peace plan, Israeli and Qatari officials met with US counterparts in an effort to rebuild relations after Israel’s air strike on Doha in September, Axios reported, citing unnamed sources.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

She has a responsibility to point out Israel’s criminality.”</p><h2 id=\"is-international-law-still-relevant\">Is international law still relevant?</h2><p>With multilateral institutions and the international law system coming under growing pressure from nation-states, Albanese said that international law does work and that “we need to make it work”.</p><p>“I often make the example, if a cure doesn’t work, would you trash all medicine? No,” she asserted.</p><p>“This is the first genocide in history that has awakened a conscience, a global conscience, and has the potential to be stopped.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Reckoning Project’s Di Giovanni said the UN General Assembly could be “activated to work at a higher level and a more effective level than what they’re doing, while the Security Council is blocked”.</p><p>“But maybe this shows us that we need to have a greater reform for how the Security Council works,” she said.</p><p>Di Giovanni added that it was crucial to address the “extraordinary heinous crimes that Netanyahu and others” have committed, or else it would send a message that “impunity is rampant”.</p><p>“Without accountability, there is no global security,” she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

There have been conflicting reports about how he died and who killed him. Some have said it was Hamas fighters who shot him, others that members of his own tribe did. Reportedly, he was taken to an Israeli hospital, where he died of his wounds.</p><p>Israel framed the killing as a “tribal dispute” rather than retribution for his collaboration; this was also the position of the Popular Forces militia, which Abu Shabab commanded. This narrative, of course, ignores the fact that his own tribe saw him as a collaborator and welcomed his death.</p><p>Throughout the war, Abu Shabab’s name was synonymous with collaboration with Israel. He was a key partner in Gaza in securing safe passage for Israeli troops, searching for Israeli captives, killing Palestinian resistance members, and, most infamously, looting aid trucks. Before he was killed, Abu Shabab was reportedly being considered for the position of governor of Rafah to be appointed by Israel.</p><p>His death deals a massive blow to Israel’s efforts to establish a new Palestinian administration in Gaza that responds to its wishes and oppresses the Palestinians. It is yet another proof that the Palestinian people will never accept colonial rule.</p><p>For decades, Israel has used collaborators to undermine Palestinian unity and governance. In the early 1980s, it spearheaded the creation of so-called “village leagues” in the occupied West Bank. These represented institutions of local rule headed by individuals funded and protected by Israel in exchange for their loyalty. The aim was to diminish the influence of the Palestine Liberation Organization and spread disunity. However, the leagues were rejected by the Palestinians as illegitimate, and the whole initiative collapsed within a few years.</p><p>Now Israel is trying to replicate the same model in Gaza. Funding and arming Abu Shabab was supposed to create a centre of coercive power in Gaza, which would have been fully loyal to Israel. It would have allowed the Israeli occupation to come after the resistance, exterminating its fighters, without having to get its soldiers involved any more or bearing the diplomatic cost of doing so.</p><p>Even if Abu Shabab had not succeeded in establishing control over Rafah or the whole of Gaza, sowing internal conflict would have been beneficial enough for Israel. It would have undermined internal security in Gaza, damaging the cohesion of the Palestinian society and encouraging people to leave.</p><p>But just like in the past, Israel’s plan was doomed to fail.</p><p>Although Abu Shabab had significant financial and military support from the occupation, he could not convince his tribe to follow him or the people of Rafah to join him. He was only able to recruit takfiri extremists, criminals and formerly imprisoned collaborators.</p><p>The vast majority of Palestinians saw him as a collaborator. Abu Shabab could not recruit even among those who oppose or dislike the resistance factions because they too would not sell out their principles and work for the genocidal power killing Palestinians every day.</p><p>While Abu Shabab provided Israel with security and technical services on the ground, his power was built entirely on crimes and theft, which made him just a hated traitor, not a leader. Despite bragging in videos about giving away stolen aid to the poor or building tent camps with looted tents, he was unable to rally people behind himself.</p><p>The Israeli plan to make Abu Shabab into a governor failed because it failed to take into account that one cannot build legitimate governance on crimes.</p><p>As much as Israel tried to protect him, his death was inevitable. His tribe and others in Rafah could not accept his collaboration with the occupation, which hurt their honour and longstanding moral ground.</p><p>When news of Abu Shabab’s death spread, people in Gaza celebrated, going out into the streets and distributing sweets. Palestinians who had different perspectives about Hamas’s actions were united in their joy. Israel’s attempt to put its hand on Gaza’s future was severed.</p><p>Abu Shabab’s death, in the end, sent a powerful message: that any collaborator is a target and no collaborator can achieve legitimacy. After more than two years of genocide, the Palestinian people’s spirit has not broken; they have not given up on their land and on their just cause.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

border.</p><p>“Sometimes we used to take advantage of moving furniture,” Al Hariri said.</p><p>“We used to put the documents underneath the car’s floor and fill it with the furniture of the house.”</p><p>CIJA now has a vast archive of security, military and intelligence documents that link war crimes to regime officials at the highest levels, all the way up to al-Assad himself.</p><p>“Countries that saw conflicts, such as Bosnia, began work after five years and started collecting evidence, so the evidence was gone, or only a few simple things could be collected,” Al
