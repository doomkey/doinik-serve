Or will the light blues of Manchester continue to feel the heavy burden of a side that conquered all before them, only to seemingly lose control of their own success last season?</p><p>The injury to Ballon d’Or holder Rodri undoubtedly hit City hard last term, and the news that he will <a href=\"/sports/2025/8/9/ballon-dor-holder-rodri-suffers-latest-man-city-injury-set-back\">miss the start of the new campaign</a> will also come as a huge concern to Guardiola.</p><p>For a team that won an unprecedented <a href=\"/sports/liveblog/2023/12/22/manchester-city-vs-fluminese-club-world-cup-final-live-match-coverage-football-commentary-updates-jeddah-saudi-arabia\">five trophies in 2023</a>, and the record-setting Premier League title the following year, to fall so far last season came as a huge shock to all, not least their manager.</p><p>Indeed, many believed last season may well have been Guardiola’s final term.

included in the peace deal.</p><p>“This passage will not become a gateway for Trump’s mercenaries — it will become their graveyard,” he added, describing the plan as “political treachery” aimed at undermining Armenia’s territorial integrity.</p><p>The terms of the accord, which was unveiled at a signing ceremony at the White House on Friday, include exclusive US development rights to a route through Armenia that would link Azerbaijan to Nakhchivan, an Azerbaijani enclave that borders Baku’s ally Turkiye.</p><p>The corridor, which would pass close to the border with Iran, would be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, or TRIPP, and operate under Armenian law.</p><p>Velayati argued that it would open the way for NATO to position itself “like a viper” between

borders.</p><p>While it welcomed the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the ministry said any project near Iran’s borders should be developed “with respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and without foreign interference”.</p><p>For its part, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautiously welcomed the deal, saying on Saturday that Moscow supported efforts to promote stability and prosperity in the region, including the Washington meeting.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Similarly to Iran, however, it warned against outside intervention, arguing that lasting solutions should be developed by countries in the region.</p><p>“The involvement of non-regional players should strengthen the peace agenda, not create new divisions,” the ministry said, adding that it hoped to avoid the “unfortunate experience” of Western-led conflict resolution in the Middle East.</p><p>Meanwhile, Turkiye on Saturday said it hoped the planned transit corridor would boost exports of energy and other resources through the South Caucasus.</p><p>A NATO member, Turkiye has strongly backed Azerbaijan in its conflicts with Armenia, but has pledged to restore ties with Yerevan after it signs a final peace deal with Baku.</p><p>The Turkish presidency said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the peace agreement with Ilham Aliyev, his counterpart from Azerbaijan, and offered Ankara’s support in achieving lasting peace in the region.</p><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also addressed the planned corridor during a visit to Egypt, saying it could “link Europe with the depths of Asia via Turkiye” and would be “a very beneficial development”.</p><p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a series of

event”.</p><p>Ahmad Shahidov, of the Azerbaijan Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, told Al Jazeera that he expected a final peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan to be signed in the coming weeks.</p><p>Shahidov said Friday’s US-brokered deal constituted a “roadmap” for the final agreement, which appears imminent given there are no unresolved territorial disputes between the two neighbours.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>For more than 21 months, much of the international media danced around the truth about Israel’s war on Gaza. The old newsroom cliche – “if it bleeds, it leads” – seemed to apply, for Western media newsrooms, more to Ukraine than Gaza. When Palestinian civilians were bombed in their homes, when entire families were buried under rubble, coverage came slowly, cautiously and often buried in “both sides” framing.</p><p>But when the images of starving Palestinian children began to emerge – haunting faces, skeletal limbs, vacant stares – something shifted. The photographs were too visceral, too undeniable. Western audiences were confronted with what the siege of Gaza truly means. And for once, the media’s gatekeepers could not entirely look away.</p><p>The world’s attention, however, alerted Israel, and a new “hasbara” operation was deployed. Hasbara means “explaining”, but in practice, it’s about erasing. With Tel Aviv’s guidance, pro-Israel media operatives set out to “debunk” the evidence of famine. The method was fully Orwellian: Don’t just contest the facts. Contest the eyes that see them.</p><p>We were told there is no starvation in Gaza. Never mind that Israeli ministers had publicly vowed to block food, fuel and medicine. Never mind that trucks were stopped for months, sometimes vandalised by Israeli settlers in broad daylight.</p><p>Israeli officials, speaking in polished English to Western media, assured the public this was all a Hamas fabrication, as though Hamas had somehow managed to trick aid agencies, foreign doctors and every journalist in Gaza into staging hunger.</p><p>The propaganda machine thought it had struck gold with one photograph. A New York Times image showed a skeletal boy, Mohammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq. Israeli intelligence sources whispered to friendly outlets: He’s not starving. He has a medical condition. As if that somehow makes his horrific condition acceptable.</p><p>The Times went ahead and added an editor’s note to “correct” the record.</p><p>That’s how hasbara works – not by persuading people but by exhausting them. By turning every fact into a dispute, every image into a row. By pushing editors to “balance” a photograph of an emaciated child with a government news release denying he is hungry.</p><p>Imagine a weather report where one source says, “It’s raining,” and another insists, “No, it’s sunny,” while everyone stands outside, soaked from the downpour. Gaza is that drenched truth, and yet much of the Western news media still feels obliged to quote the weatherman in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Every honest report is met with a barrage of emails, phone calls and social media smears, all designed to create just enough doubt to make editors pull back.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But the claim “He’s not starving. He’s just sick” is not an exoneration. It’s an admission.</p><p>A child with a pre-existing medical condition who is brought to the point of looking like a skeleton means he has been deprived not only of the nutrition he needs, but of the medical care. This is forced starvation and medicide side by side.</p><p>Palestinian journalists inside Gaza, the only ones reporting since Israel banned all foreign media and killed more than 200 Palestinian journalists, are starving alongside the people they report on. In a rare joint statement, the BBC, AFP and Associated Press warned that their own staff members face “the same dire circumstances as those they are covering”.</p><p>At the height of the outrage over these photos last week, Israel allowed in a trickle of aid – some airdrops and 30 to 50 trucks a day when the United Nations says 500 to 600 are needed. Some trucks never arrived, blocked by Jewish extremists.</p><p>Meanwhile, a parallel mechanism for aid distribution has been funnelled through Israeli-approved American contractors, which purposefully create dangerous and chaotic conditions that lead to daily killings of aid seekers. Crowds of starving Palestinians gather, only to be shot at by Israeli soldiers.</p><p>And still, the denials persist. The official line is that this is not starvation. It’s something else – undefined but definitely not a war crime.</p><p>The world has seen famine before – in Ethiopia, in Somalia, in Yemen, in South Sudan. The photographs from Gaza belong in the same category. The difference is that here, a powerful state causing the starvation is actively trying to convince us that our own eyes are lying to us.</p><p>The goal is not to convince the public that there is no hunger but to plant enough doubt to paralyse outrage. If the facts can be made murky, the pressure on Israel diminishes. This is why every newsroom that avoids the word “starvation” becomes an unwitting accomplice.</p><p>Starvation in Gaza is not collateral damage. It is an instrument of war, measurable in calories denied, trucks blocked and fields destroyed.</p><p>Israel’s strategy depends on controlling the lens as well as the border. It goes as far as prohibiting journalists allowed on airplanes airdropping food from filming the devastation below.</p><p>For a brief moment, the publication of those photos of starving Palestinians broke through the wall of propaganda, prompting minimal concessions. But the siege continues, the hunger deepens and the mass killing expands. Now the Israeli government has decided to launch another ground offensive to occupy Gaza City, and with it, the genocide will only get worse.</p><p>History will record the famine in Gaza. It will remember the prices of flour and sugar, the names of children and the aid trucks turned back. And it will remember how the world allowed itself to be told, in the middle of a downpour, that the sky was clear.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Public health experts sounded the alarm after his election win in November, warning there would likely be a “war on vaccines” under Trump.</p><p>“My main concern is that this is part of an increasingly ideological rather than evidence-based approach to healthcare and vaccination in particular that is being adopted in the US,” David Elliman, associate professor at University College London, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is likely to increase vaccine hesitancy … [and] will result in more suffering and death, particularly for children. This would be a tragedy, even more so because it is avoidable.”</p><h2 id=\"what-new-cuts-to-vaccine-funding-have-been-made\">What new cuts to vaccine funding have been made?</h2><p>In a statement posted on Tuesday on X, Kennedy said 22 projects on mRNA vaccine development worth nearly $500m will be cancelled. The main reason, he said, was that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in his Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had reviewed mRNA vaccines and found them to be “ineffective” in fighting mutating viruses.</p><p>“A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,” Kennedy said in a video statement. “After reviewing the science and consulting top experts, … HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.”</p><p>Instead, Kennedy said, the US will shift mRNA funding to other vaccine development technologies that are “safer” and “remain effective”.</p><p>Some notable institutions and companies that will be affected by the latest decision, as <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">listed</a> on the HHS website, include:</p><ul>\n<li>Emory University and Tiba Biotech (terminated contracts)</li>\n<li>Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL Seqirus (rejected or cancelled proposals)</li>\n<li>Luminary Labs, ModeX (“descoped” or weakened contracts)</li>\n<li>AstraZeneca and Moderna (“restructured” contracts)</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-are-mrna-vaccines-and-are-they-really-ineffective-against-virus-mutations\">What are mRNA vaccines, and are they really ineffective against virus mutations?</h2><p>Messenger ribonucleic acid vaccines prompt the body to produce proteins that help it build immunity against certain microbes. They differ from traditional vaccines that introduce weakened or dead microbes into the body to stimulate immunity. Both types of vaccines have their strengths and weaknesses, but mRNA vaccines are notably faster to manufacture although they don’t provide the lifelong coverage that traditional vaccines might.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>However, Elliman said virus mutations are a general problem for any vaccines and present a challenge scientists are still contending with.</p><p>“As yet, there are no vaccines in use that have solved this problem, so this is not a good reason for abandoning mRNA vaccines,” Elliman said. “The technology has great promise for vaccines and therapeutics, so ceasing research in the field without good evidence is unjustified.”</p><p>The move, he added, could discourage investors and scientists, both inside and outside the US, from keeping up research.</p><p>Dorit R Reiss, a law professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who focuses on vaccine law, told Al Jazeera that the decision is “troubling and shortsighted”.</p><p>“Procedurally, the decision was done in a very flawed manner. At the least, there should be notice and an opportunity for hearing and explanation under our administrative law, and there was instead a short and cursory X video with no references, no real data,” she said.</p><p>The move will not only hurt innovation, she said, but will also leave the country less prepared for emergencies.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3756557\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3756557\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3756557\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/afp_6842b7f4cdbd-1749202932.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"MIAMI, FLORIDA - MAY 29: In this photo illustration, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (top) and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines sit in boxes at Borinquen Health Care Center on May 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida.

The organisation has also campaigned against the fortification of drinking water with fluoride, which prevents tooth decay.</p><p>During a 2013 autism conference, Kennedy compared the CDC’s childhood vaccine programme to Nazi-era crimes. “To me, this is like Nazi death camps, what happened to these kids,” he said, referring to an increasing number of children diagnosed with autism. “I can’t tell you why somebody would do something like that. I can’t tell you why ordinary Germans participated in the Holocaust.”</p><p>In a 2023 interview with Fox News, Kennedy claimed vaccines cause autism. He cited a widely debunked study by Andrew Wakefield, a discredited British doctor and antivaccine activist whose study on the matter has since been retracted from journals. In another 2023 podcast, Kennedy said, “No vaccine is safe or effective.”</p><p>Aside from his vaccine scepticism, Kennedy, also known as RFK Jr, has also made several controversial remarks about other health issues, such as COVID-19. He criticised vaccine mandates and lockdown restrictions during the pandemic under former President Joe Biden. He also claimed in a leaked video in 2022 that COVID-19 “attacked certain races disproportionately” because of their genetic makeup and Ashkenazi Jews were most immune to the virus. Several research <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8586903/#:~:text=Findings,mortality%20rates%20than%20White%20individuals.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies</a>, however, found that social inequalities were major influences on how COVID-19 affected different ethno-social groups because certain people had reduced access to care.</p><p>During a congressional hearing in the lead-up to his appointment in Trump’s administration, Kennedy denied making several of the controversial statements attributed to him in the past. He also promised to maintain existing vaccine standards.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-trump-s-views-on-vaccines\">What are Trump’s views on vaccines?</h2><p>Trump has flip-flopped on this issue.</p><p>He has previously downplayed the usefulness of vaccines and, in particular, criticised the schedules under which children receive several vaccine doses within their first two years. In his election campaign last year, Trump promised to dismantle vaccine mandates in schools.</p><p>In a 2007 interview with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Trump claimed that an autism “epidemic” had arisen as a result of vaccines, a theory which has since been debunked. “My theory – and I study it because I have young children – my theory is the shots [vaccines]. We’re giving these massive injections at one time, and I really think it does something to the children.”</p><p>In subsequent interviews, Trump called childhood vaccines a “monster shot” and in 2015 during a debate among Republican presidential candidates said vaccines were “meant for a horse, not a child”.</p><p>In 2015, he told a reporter he had never received a flu shot.</p><p>But Trump has also spoken in favour of vaccines at times. During his first term as president, Trump said at a news briefing that children “have to get their shots” after outbreaks of measles emerged across the country. “The vaccinations are so important. This is really going around now,” he said.</p><p>Additionally, in his first term during the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration initially downplayed the virus, but it ultimately oversaw the rapid production of COVID-19 vaccines in a project it called Operation Warp Speed.</p><p>After Biden became president in 2021, Trump’s camp criticised his vaccine and face mask mandates, which critics said contributed to rising levels of antivaccine sentiment among conservative voters.</p><p>Trump also avoided using Operation Warp Speed’s success as a selling point in last year’s presidential campaign. He also did not publicly announce that he had received initial and booster COVID-19 vaccine shots before leaving the White House.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-the-trump-administration-targeted-vaccines-more-broadly\">Has the Trump administration targeted vaccines more broadly?</h2><p>During Trump’s second term, the US introduced vaccine regulations that some critics said undermine the country’s vaccine system.</p><p>Furthermore, the Trump administration has cut funding to the US Agency for International Development, which supported hundreds of vaccine development programmes across the world.</p><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>In February, Trump halted federal funding for schools that required students to have what his administration called “coercive” COVID-19 vaccines.</li>\n<li>In May, Kennedy announced that the federal government would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women without giving details about the reasons behind the change in policy. That went against the advice of US health officials who had previously urged boosters for young children.</li>\n<li>In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of a CDC panel of vaccine experts, claiming that the board was “rife with conflicts”. The panel, which had been appointed by Biden, was responsible for recommending how vaccines are used and for whom. Kennedy said the move would raise public confidence, stating that the US was “prioritising the restoration of public trust above any specific pro- or antivaccine agenda. However, the move drew condemnation from scientists and health bodies.</li>\n<li>At the same time, the Food and Drug Administration, which also comes under the remit of the HHS, has approved at least one COVID-19 vaccine. In May, the FDA approved Novavax’s non-mRNA, protein-based COVID-19 vaccine although only for older adults and those over the age of 12 who also have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk from the virus. That was unusual for the US, where vaccines are usually approved without such limitations.</li>\n<li>The 2026 budget proposal to Congress does not include funding for the Global Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), a public-private entity formed in 2002 to support vaccine distribution to low and middle-income countries. GAVI was instrumental in securing vaccines for several countries in Africa and other regions during the COVID-19 pandemic when it was feared that richer countries could stockpile the available doses. The US currently provides more than 10 percent of GAVI’s funding.

In Romania, they represent approximately seven percent of the population, with one-fifth reporting discrimination experiences in the past year, according to European Union data.</p><p>Lakatos began his mission in the early 1980s as an art student during Nicolae Ceausescu’s communist regime. When anti-Roma sentiment was widespread, he discovered that Elvis’s music created connections with ethnic Romanian students while simultaneously symbolising resistance against government oppression.</p><p>Now, 40 years later, his audience has expanded. As a teacher for 25 years, Lakatos uses music to show his students they can aspire beyond the limited opportunities of their northwestern Romanian village.</p><p>“The adjective Gypsy is used everywhere as a substitute for insult,” Lakatos said. “We older people have gotten used to it, we can swallow it, we grew up with it. I have said many times, ‘Call us what you want, dinosaur and brontosaurus, but at least join hands with us to educate the next generation.'”</p><p>Despite his teaching career, Lakatos continues performing throughout Romania at various venues.</p><p>The eclectic mix of languages can sometimes lead to surprises because there is not always a literal translation for Elvis’s 1950s American English.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>For example, “Don’t step on my blue suede shoes” does not make sense to many of the children he teaches because they are so poor, Lakatos said.</p><p>In his version, the lyric Elvis made famous becomes simply “Don’t step on my bare feet.”</p><p>It is a message that Elvis – born in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, during the Great Depression – probably would have understood.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Yet, in reality, it became a morbid attraction for Parisians.</p><p>As the story goes, a pathologist, struck by her beauty and serene expression, commissioned a sculptor to produce a death mask of her face, a plaster or wax mould of a person made shortly after death.</p><p>No documents survive in the Paris police archives, and it is impossible to verify the truth of this story.</p><p>However, a sculpture of the supposed death mask captured the public’s imagination, and reproductions of it began to circulate in the early 20th century.</p><p>Her face soon decorated Parisian salons and wealthy people’s homes.</p><p>The visage was known as L’Inconnue de la Seine – the Unknown Woman of the Seine – and it became a muse for writers, poets, and artists.</p><p>The French writer Albert Camus called her the “drowned Mona Lisa”, while the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke said of her serene expression, “It was beautiful, because it smiled, because it smiled so deceptively, as if it knew.”</p><h2 id=\"resusci-anne\">Resusci Anne</h2><p>It is not known whether Laderdal was aware of the legend behind the painting in Stavanger, but in 1960, he gave it new life when the first CPR doll was officially launched with the subject’s face.</p><p>The doll was given a soft plastic torso – a compressible chest for practising CPR – and open lips for mouth-to-mouth rescue.</p><p>She travelled around the world, appearing in fire stations, schools, hospitals, scout groups, and airline training centres, where she was used for CPR training.</p><p>She was also finally given a name, “Resusci Anne,” by Laerdal, a shortening of the word “resuscitation”. Anne is a common female name in Norway and France, which suggests that by this stage, the toymaker was aware of the legend behind the face. In the English-speaking world, she became known as “CPR Annie”.</p><p>“Annie, are you OK?” became the go-to training phrase as people simulated how to check for responsiveness in the event of a cardiac arrest.</p><p>In the 1980s, about a century after Annie was reported to have been found in the Seine, Michael Jackson immortalised her in pop culture.</p><p>As the story goes, the superstar heard the phrase during a first aid training session and, struck by the rhythm and urgency of it, worked it into the chart-topping song, Smooth Criminal, repeating it like a heartbeat: “Annie, are you OK?

But even as the ban was <a href=\"/amp/news/2025/8/7/police-raid-kashmir-bookshops-after-india-bans-titles-for-secessionism\">followed by police raids</a> on several bookstores in the region’s biggest city, Srinagar, during which they seized books on the blacklist, Indian officials are holding a book festival in the city on the banks of Dal Lake.</p><p>“Nothing is surprising about this ban, which comes at a moment when the level of censorship and surveillance in Kashmir since 2019 has reached absurd heights,” Kanjwal told Al Jazeera, referring to India’s crackdown on the region since it <a href=\"/news/2020/1/1/how-2019-changed-the-kashmir-dispute-forever\">revoked Kashmir’s semiautonomous status</a> six years ago.</p><p>“It is, of course, even more absurd that this ban comes at a time when the Indian army is simultaneously promoting book reading and literature through a state-sponsored Chinar Book Festival.”</p><p>Yet even with Kashmir’s long history of facing censorship, the book bans represent to many critics a particularly sweeping attempt by New Delhi to assert control over academia in the disputed region.</p><h2 id=\"misguiding-youth\">‘Misguiding youth’</h2><p>The 25 books banned by the government offer a detailed overview of the events surrounding the Partition of India and the reasons why Kashmir became such an intransigent territorial dispute to begin with.</p><p>They include writings like Azadi by Booker Prize winner <a href=\"/opinions/2024/7/22/why-does-india-hate-arundhati-roy\">Arundhati Roy</a>, Human Rights Violations in Kashmir by Piotr Balcerowicz and Agnieszka Kuszewska, Kashmiris’ Fight for Freedom by Mohd Yusaf Saraf, Kashmir Politics and Plebiscite by Abdul Gockhami Jabbar and Do You Remember Kunan Poshpora? by Essar Batool. These are books that directly speak to rights abuses and massacres in Kashmir and promises broken by the Indian state.</p><p>Then there are books like Kanjwal’s, journalist Anuradha Bhasin’s A Dismantled State: The Untold Story of Kashmir After Article 370 and legal scholar AG Noorani’s The Kashmir Dispute 1947-2012, which dissect the region’s political journey over the decades.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3878501\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Interactive_Kashmir_India_books_banned_August8_2025-1754654061.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_Kashmir_India_books_banned_August8_2025-1754654061\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>The government has blamed these books for allegedly “misguiding youth” in Kashmir and instigating their “participation in violence and terrorism”.

Muslim-majority Kashmir’s Hindu king sought to be independent of both, but after Pakistan-backed fighters entered a part of the region, he agreed to join India on the condition that Kashmir enjoy a special status within the new union with some autonomy guaranteed under the Indian Constitution.</p><p>But the Kashmiri people were never asked what they wanted, and India repeatedly rebuffed demands for a United Nations-sponsored plebiscite.</p><p>Discontent against Indian rule simmered on and off and exploded into an armed uprising against India in 1989 in response to allegations of election fixing.</p><p>Kanjwal’s Colonizing Kashmir sheds light on the complicated ways in which the Indian government under its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, consolidated its control over Kashmir.</p><p>Some of Nehru’s decisions that have come under criticism include the unceremonious dismissal of the region’s leader Sheikh Abdullah, who advocated for self-rule for Kashmir, and the decision to replace him with his lieutenant, Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad, whose 10 years in office were marked by the strengthening of New Delhi’s rule of Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>Kanjwal’s book won this year’s Bernard Cohn Book Prize, which “recognizes outstanding and innovative scholarship for a first single-authored English-language monograph on South Asia”.</p><p>Kanjwal said the ban gives a sense of how “insecure” the government is.</p><h2 id=\"intensification-of-political-clampdown\">‘Intensification of political clampdown’</h2><p>India has a long history of censorship and information control in Kashmir. In 2010, after major protests broke out following the killing of 17-year-old student <a href=\"/news/2017/12/12/in-kashmir-a-fathers-fight-against-forgetfulness\">Tufail Mattoo</a> by security forces, the provincial government banned SMS services and restored them only three years later.</p><p>At the height of another civil uprising in 2016, the government stopped Kashmir Reader, an independent publication in Srinagar, from going to press, citing its purported “tendency to incite violence”.</p><p>Aside from prohibitions on newspapers and modes of communication, Indian authorities have routinely detained journalists under stringent preventive detention laws in Kashmir.</p><p>That pattern has picked up since 2019.</p><p>“First they came for journalists, and realising they were successful in silencing them, they have turned their attention to academia,” said veteran editor <a href=\"/opinions/2020/6/20/bringing-the-israeli-model-to-kashmir\">Anuradha Bhasin</a>, whose book on India’s revocation of Kashmir’s special status in 2019 is among those banned.</p><p>Bhasin described the accusations that her book promotes violence as strange. “Nowhere does my book glorify terrorism, but it does criticise the state. There’s a distinction between the two that authorities in Kashmir want to blur. That’s a very dangerous trend.”</p><p>Bhasin told Al Jazeera that such bans will have far-reaching implications for future works being produced on Kashmir. “Publishers will think twice before printing anything critical on Kashmir,” she said. “When my book went to print, the legal team vetted it thrice.”</p><h2 id=\"a-feeling-of-despair\">‘A feeling of despair’</h2><p>The book bans have drawn criticism from various quarters in Kashmir with students and researchers calling it an attempt to impose collective amnesia.</p><p>Sabir Rashid, a 27-year-old independent scholar from Kashmir, said he was very disappointed.  “If we take these books out of Kashmir’s literary canon, we are left with nothing,” he said.</p><p>Rashid is working on a book on Kashmir’s modern history concerning the period surrounding the Partition of India.</p><p>“If these works are no longer available to me, my research is naturally going to be lopsided.”</p><p>On Thursday, videos showed uniformed policemen entering bookstores in Srinagar and asking their proprietors if they possessed any of the books in the banned list.</p><p>At least one book vendor in Srinagar told Al Jazeera he had a single copy of Bhasin’s Dismantled State, which he sold just before the raids. “Except that one, I did not have any of these books,” he shrugged.</p><h2 id=\"more-acclaimed-works-on-the-blacklist\">More acclaimed works on the blacklist</h2><p>Historian Sumantra Bose is aghast at the suggestion by Indian authorities that his book Kashmir at the Crossroads has fuelled violence in the region. He has worked on the Kashmir dispute since 1993 and said he has focused on devising pathways for finding a lasting peace for the region. Bose is also amused at a family legacy represented by the ban.</p><p>In 1935, the colonial authorities in British India banned The Indian Struggle, 1920-1934, a compendium of political analysis authored by Subhas Chandra Bose, his great-uncle and a leader of India’s freedom struggle.</p><p>“Ninety years later, I have been accorded the singular honour of following in the legendary freedom fighter’s footsteps,” he said.</p><p>As police step up raids on bookshops in Srinagar and seize valuable, more critical works, the literary community in Kashmir has a feeling of despondency.</p><p>“This is an attack on the people’s memory,” Rashid said. “These books served as sentinels. They were supposed to remind us of our history. But now, the erasure of memory in Kashmir is nearly complete.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
