That watery mixture of chemicals and minerals is then pumped out of the ground and into the collection pools, where the rare earths are then separated and gathered up.</p><p>Without careful attention to keeping everything contained at a mine, said Meehan, the risks of contaminating local rivers and groundwater could be high.</p><p>Rare earth mines are situated close to rivers because of the large volumes of water needed for pumping the extractive chemicals into the hills, he said.</p><p>The contaminated water is then often pumped back into the river, he added, while the groundwater polluted by the leaching can end up in the river as well.</p><p>“There is definitely scope for that,” said Meehan.</p><p>He and others have tracked the effect such mines have already had in Kachin – where hundreds of mining sites now dot the state’s border with China – from once-teeming streams now barren of fish to rice stalks yielding fewer grains and livestock falling ill and dying after drinking from local creeks.</p><p>In a 2024 report, the environmental group Global Witness called the fallout from Kachin’s mining boom “devastating”.</p><p>Ben Hardman, Mekong legal director for the US advocacy group EarthRights International, said locals in Kachin have also told his team about mineworkers dying in unusually high numbers.</p><p>The worry now, he adds, is that Shan state and the neighbouring countries into which Myanmar’s rivers flow will suffer the same fate as has Kachin, especially if the mine sites continue to multiply as global demand for rare earth minerals grows.</p><p>“There’s a long history of rare earth mining causing serious environmental harms that are very long-term, and with pretty egregious health implications for communities,” Hardman said.</p><p>“That was the case in China in the 2010s, and is the case in Kachin now. And it’s the same situation now evolving in Shan state, and so we can expect to see the same harms,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"you-need-to-stop-it-at-the-source\">‘You need to stop it at the source’</h2><p>Most, if not all, of the rare earths mined in Myanmar are sent to China to be refined, processed, and either exported or put to use in a range of green-energy and, increasingly, military hardware.</p><p>But, unlike China, neither Myanmar, Laos nor Thailand have the sophisticated processing plants that can transform raw ore into valuable material, according to SFA (Oxford), a critical minerals and metals consulting firm.</p><p>The Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar, a local think tank, says Chinese customs data also show that Myanmar has been China’s main source of rare earths from abroad since at least 2017, including a record $1.4bn-worth in 2023.</p><p> </p><figure id=\"attachment_3873212\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3873212\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3873212\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2012-01-27T120000Z_1225173334_GF2E81L0E8H01_RTRMADP_3_MEKONG-CHINA-MURDERS-1-1754378526.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A signboard at the Thai village of Sop Ruak on the Mekong river in the Golden Triangle region where the borders of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet January 14, 2012.

At that point, Saint-Cyr and the council are expected to hand off power to the election’s victor.</p><p>Elections for roles in the federal government are expected to unfold in three stages, starting in November and ending with February’s presidential race. But critics warn gang violence could thwart those plans.</p><p>The United Nations estimates that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/11/haiti-death-toll-hits-nearly-5000-in-nine-months-as-gang-violence-spreads\">4,864 people</a> in Haiti were killed from October 2024 to June of this year.</p><p>Threats of violence have forced essential services to shut down, including hospitals and roadways, and nearly 1.3 million people have been displaced from their homes.</p><p>The humanitarian situation in Haiti is considered among the most dire in the world, and Saint-Cyr called on the international community to respond with further resources.</p><p>“I invite all international partners to increase their support, send more soldiers, provide more training,” Saint-Cyr said at Thursday’s ceremony. “I am asking the security forces to intensify their operations.”</p><p>Ambassadors from several foreign countries were in attendance. He directed some of his remarks at them.</p><p>“Our country is going through one of the greatest crises in all its history,” Saint-Cyr said. “It’s not the time for beautiful speeches.

Kugler is returning to her tenured professorship at Georgetown University.</p><p>The term expires January 31, 2026, and is subject to approval by the Senate. Trump said the White House continues to search for someone to fill the 14-year Fed board seat that opens on February 1.</p><p>Miran, who served as an economic adviser in the Department of the Treasury during the first Trump administration, has advocated for a far-reaching overhaul of Fed governance that would include shortening board member terms, putting them under the clear control of the president, and ending the “revolving door” between the executive branch and the Fed and nationalising the Fed’s 12 regional banks.</p><p>The appointment is Trump’s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining federal agencies that is still independent. Trump has relentlessly criticised the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/30/us-federal-reserve-leaves-rates-unchanged-despite-pressure-from-white-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">short-term interest rates unchanged</a> – a major point of contention between the White House and the central bank.</p><p>Miran has been a major defender of Trump’s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He has also played down the risk that Trump’s tariffs will generate higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.</p><p>Trump has unsuccessfully pressured Fed policymakers – who include Powell, his six fellow board members and the 12 Fed bank presidents – to lower rates. Appointing Miran to the central bank, even in a placeholder role, gives the president a potentially more direct route to pursue his desire for easier monetary policy.</p><h2 id=\"trump-loyalist\">‘Trump loyalist’</h2><p>It is unclear how much time Miran would have at the Fed to try to deploy his ideas, or even vote on interest rates, though.</p><p>All Fed nominees require Senate confirmation, a process that includes a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, a vote from that panel advancing the nomination and a series of floor votes before the full Senate, where Democrats have been slowing the pace of approval for Trump appointments.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Stephen Miran is a Trump loyalist and one of the chief architects of the President’s chaotic tariff policy that has hurt Americans’ wallets,” the Senate Banking Committee’s top-ranking Democrat, Elizabeth Warren, said on X following the announcement. “I’ll have tough questions for him about whether he’d serve the American people or merely serve Donald Trump.”</p><p>The Senate is on summer recess until September 2.</p><p>There are just four policy-setting meetings, including one on September 16-17, before the end of what would be Miran’s term.</p><p>Fed policymakers kept the policy rate in its current 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent range at their July meeting, with Powell citing somewhat elevated inflation and the concern that Trump’s tariffs could keep it that way as reasons to keep policy restrictive.</p><p>Several central bankers this month have raised concerns about labour market weakness, and at least a couple have expressed renewed confidence that tariffs may not push up inflation as much as earlier thought. Those views echo the arguments made by two Fed governors who last month dissented on the decision to leave policy on hold.</p></div></div></body></html>"

would require universities to disclose to the federal government data about their student admissions.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the news in a post on the social media platform X, reposting an article from the right-wing publication The Daily Caller.</p><div class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span

list</span></div><p>Trump has long sought to exert greater control over the country’s higher education system, which he and other prominent Republicans consider ideologically skewed.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has also sought to dismantle initiatives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion — goals known collectively by the acronym DEI — on the basis that such efforts are inherently discriminatory.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"rolling-back-dei\">Rolling back DEI</h2><p>This was such a priority for Trump that, on January 20, during the first day of his second term, he signed <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an executive order</a> titled “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing”.</p><p>That order repealed a previous directive, issued under President Joe Biden, to advance “racial equity” and better support “underserved communities”.</p><p>It also called diversity initiatives “illegal and immoral” and ordered the termination of any such programmes run by the federal government.</p><p>“Federal employment practices, including Federal employee performance reviews, shall reward individual initiative, skills, performance, and hard work and shall not under any circumstances consider DEI,” the order explained.</p><p>Trump has sought to extend his campaign against DEI beyond the auspices of the federal government, including to private enterprises.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s inauguration, major US companies like <a href=\"/economy/2025/1/24/target-becomes-latest-us-firm-to-end-dei-initiatives\">the retailer Target</a> and the carmaker Ford have reframed or dialled back their DEI programming, in an apparent response to the president’s platform.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But critics have questioned whether Trump may be exceeding his constitutionally mandated powers.</p><p>Some have argued that an embrace of diversity practices falls well within a private enterprise’s free speech rights under the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p><p>They also point out that, without proactively supporting diversity in companies and universities, those institutions are likely to maintain imbalances in race, gender and ability that do not reflect the wider public.</p><p>That, in turn, keeps certain groups out of positions of power, perpetuating a history of segregation and bias in the US.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"peeling-back-affirmative-action\">Peeling back affirmative action</h2><p>But Trump and his allies have long argued that diversity-promoting practices use race, gender and other factors to discriminate against qualified candidates who may belong to over-represented groups.</p><p>In a subsequent <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> on January 21, Trump pledged to restore “merit-based opportunity” in the US.</p><p>“Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex,” the executive order said.</p><p>Under Trump, the Department of Education <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-takes-action-eliminate-dei\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has taken steps</a> to roll back diversity initiatives and other “divisive ideology” in schools, including by freezing federal funds to institutions that do not comply.</p><p>That has put it at loggerheads with academic freedom advocates, who fear the independence of US schools is being trampled in favour of advancing a political agenda.</p><p>Opponents of diversity initiatives, however, have won significant victories, most recently in 2023.</p><p>That year, the <a href=\"/news/2023/6/29/us-top-court-bans-colleges-from-considering-race-in-admissions\">US Supreme Court ruled</a> that affirmative action — the practice of considering race and other diversity factors in school admissions — violated the US Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment, which asserts the right to equal protection under the law.</p><p>That decision, delivered by the court’s conservative supermajority, overturned decades of precedent and barred schools from using race as a factor for choosing students.</p><p>Some conservative groups, however, have continued to question whether there is a bias in school admissions against white, male and Asian students.</p><h2 id=\"trump-versus-the-ivy-league\">Trump versus the Ivy League</h2><p>The US president has been among the sceptics clamouring for more information about university admissions and hiring practices, and he has made that demand a pillar in his fights with various top schools.</p><p>Trump has yanked billions in federal contracts, grants and other funds from schools, including Columbia University in New York, Harvard University in Massachusetts and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which reported this week a pause on $584m in grants.</p><p>To restore those suspended funds, Trump has called on university leaders to agree to his demands, including oversight over admissions.</p><p>Columbia was the first major campus to do so. As part of <a href=\"https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/03.21.2025%20Columbia%20-%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its deal</a> with the Trump administration, Columbia agreed to review its admissions practices and establish an advisory group to “analyze recent trends in enrollment”.</p><p>The advisory group will then “report to the President”, according to the deal.</p><p>The Trump administration has also launched federal investigations into universities, alleging violations of civil rights law. Some universities have submitted to Trump’s demands in part to bring those probes to a close.</p><p>On July 30, for instance, another Ivy League school, Brown University in Rhode Island, announced <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-07-30/brown-united-states-resolution-agreement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it had struck a deal</a> in exchange for the continuation of its federal funding and a “permanent closure” to the “open reviews and investigations” the Trump administration had launched.</p><p>As part of the deal, however, Brown <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/brown-university-strikes-50m-deal-to-end-trump-administration-pressure\">agreed to spend $50m</a> on workforce development programmes and maintain “merit-based admissions policies”.</p><p>“No proxy for racial admission will be tolerated,” <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/sites/default/files/brown-and-united-states-resolution-agreement_July-30-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the deal reads</a>. “Brown may not use personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means to introduce or justify discrimination.”</p><p>Still, some schools have resisted Trump’s demands, <a href=\"/news/2025/4/15/harvard-university-defies-trumps-demands-faces-2-3bn-in-funding-cuts\">most notably Harvard</a>, the nation’s oldest university.</p><p>In April, Harvard President Alan Garber rejected an agreement proposed by the Trump administration, which <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">would have required</a> a “comprehensive audit” of the school’s hiring and admissions practices.</p><p>That data would have then been shared with the federal government.</p><p>“No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/the-promise-of-american-higher-education/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> at the time.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It. On.”</p><p>“While AIPAC is lying to their donors about me claiming I’m ‘betraying my American values’ the REALITY is AIPAC 1,000,000% serves and lobbies for a foreign country, Israel!!” Greene wrote in a social media post.</p><p>“I’m as AMERICAN as they come! I can’t be bought and I’m not backing down!!”</p><p></p><p>The United Nations defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Over the past 22 months, Israel has destroyed nearly <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/8/7/live-israel-kills-13-in-attacks-since-dawn-as-five-starve-to-death-in-gaza\">all of Gaza</a>, repeatedly displaced the enclave’s population, killed more than 61,000 people and imposed a suffocating blockade that sparked deadly hunger in the territory.</p><p>On Thursday, AIPAC called Greene’s genocide accusation “disgusting”.</p><p>“Let’s call this what it is: Marjorie Taylor Greene is the newest member of the anti-Israel Squad,” the group said.</p><p>“She may think this earns her praise from the far-left or online radicals — but we see it for what it is: a betrayal of American values and a dangerous distortion of the truth.”</p><p>Greene’s recent stances on Gaza stand in stark contrast with her staunch early support for Israel. In 2023, she led efforts to <a href=\"/news/2023/11/8/who-is-rashida-tlaib-why-was-the-palestinian-american-lawmaker-censured\">formally rebuke Tlaib</a> – the only Palestinian American in Congress – over condemning Israeli policies.</p><p>With criticism of Israel in the US mostly coming from the progressive left, AIPAC rarely denounces members of Trump’s Republican Party.</p><p>But the lobby group said on Thursday that it will challenge “lies” about Israel, whether they come from the “radical left or the radical right”.</p><p>Although <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/trump-says-he-wants-all-middle-eastern-countries-to-have-formal-israel-ties\">Trump has been</a> uncompromising in his backing for Israel, a segment of his Republican base has been increasingly critical of unconditional support for the US ally, viewing the relationship as incompatible with the president’s “America first” mantra.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"aipac-spending\">AIPAC spending</h2><p>For decades, AIPAC has encouraged its members to donate to candidates for public office, and in 2022, it started directly spending tens of millions of dollars to defeat critics of Israel.</p><p>Last year, AIPAC helped oust two incumbent progressive <a href=\"/news/2024/8/5/why-is-a-pro-israel-lobby-targeting-us-congress-member-cori-bush\">congressmembers</a>, spending record amounts on election advertisements.</p><p>AIPAC has not announced plans to challenge Greene in next year’s midterm elections.</p><p>The congresswoman did not face a primary opponent in her Georgia district last year and won the general election by nearly 30 percentage points.</p><p>In recent weeks, AIPAC has been trying to mitigate the growing outrage at Israel’s starvation policy in Gaza, often repeating false Israeli statements denying hunger in the territory and accusing Hamas of stealing the humanitarian aid.</p><p>However, despite the group’s efforts, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/horrors-upon-horrors-how-us-congress-responded-to-mass-hunger-in-gaza\">many congressmembers</a>, including some legislators who have been backed by AIPAC, have begun condemning Israel’s conduct in Gaza.</p><p>On Wednesday, Democratic Congresswoman Valerie Foushee, whom AIPAC helped elect to Congress in 2022 with $2m in campaign spending, said she was co-sponsoring a bill to block offensive weapons to Israel.</p><p>“We simply cannot continue to provide the Israeli government with weapons when they are not being used in accordance with <a href=\"/features/2025/4/10/israels-war-on-international-humanitarian-law\">international law</a> to maximize the protection of civilians in Gaza,” Foushee wrote in a social media post.</p></div></div></body></html>"
