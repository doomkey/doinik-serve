Instead, the poorest countries already in debt are being told to transition faster, with fewer funds,” Santiago said.</p><p>“The spark of hope lies in the proposed Belem Action Mechanism, which puts workers’ rights and justice at the centre of the shift away from fossil fuels. But without financing from rich countries, the just energy transition risks becoming stalled in many countries.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

largest drivers of the climate crisis – that drew opposition from oil-producing countries and nations that depend on oil, gas and coal.</p><p>Questions of <a href=\"/opinions/2025/8/20/to-close-the-climate-finance-gap-let-vulnerable-nations-use-carbon-markets\">climate finance</a> also sparked heated debates, with developing nations demanding that richer countries bear a greater share of the financial burden.</p><p>But COP30 host Brazil had pushed for a show of unity, as the annual conference is largely viewed as a test of the world’s resolve to address a deepening crisis.</p><p>“We need to show society that we want this without imposing anything on anyone, without setting deadlines for each country to decide what it can do within its own time, within its own possibilities,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/brazils-lula-faces-obstacles-in-push-for-agreement-at-climate-summit\">said earlier this

greater ambitions for some of the issues at hand”.</p><p>“As President Lula said at the opening of this COP, we need roadmaps so that humanity – in a just and planned manner – can overcome its dependence on fossil fuels, halt and <a href=\"/podcasts/2025/8/25/the-take-how-did-lula-da-silva-cut-amazon-deforestation-in-half\">reverse deforestation</a> and mobilise resources for these purposes,” Correa do Lago said.</p><p>“I, as president of COP30, will therefore create two roadmaps: One on halting and reverting [reversing] deforestation and another to transitioning away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner,” he said, spurring a round of applause from delegates.</p><p>Correa do Lago also added that the first international conference on the phase-out of fossil fuels is scheduled to take place in Colombia in April.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera before the draft text was released, Asad Rehman, chief executive director of Friends of the Earth, said <a

COP30.</p><p>“They have tried to bully developing countries and have weakened the text … But I would say that, overall, from what we’re hearing, we will have taken a step forward,” Rehman said in an interview from Belem.</p><p>“This will be welcomed by the millions of people for whom these talks are a matter of life and death. However, in the scale of <a href=\"/news/2025/11/4/world-very-likely-to-exceed-1-5c-climate-goal-in-next-decade-un\">the crisis that we face</a>, we of course needed a giant leap forward.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Since the ceasefire was announced on October 10, the division of Gaza into a so-called “green zone” under Israeli army control and a so-called “red zone”, where Palestinians have been displaced and contained, has solidified. Separating the two is the invisible “yellow line”.</p><p>The administration of United States President Donald Trump has signalled that reconstruction will be limited to the “green zone” where Israel and its allies have been working on plans for so-called “alternative safe communities”.</p><p>Although there are reports last week that these plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/14/us-military-plan-divided-gaza-green-zone\">were dropped</a>, colleagues in the humanitarian field have informed me that the first such community is still slated to be built in Rafah, southern Gaza and a further 10 are planned along the yellow line and into the north.</p><p>If plans for these “safe communities” proceed, they would cement a deadly fragmentation of Gaza.  The purpose of creating these camps is not to provide humanitarian relief but to create zones of managed dispossession where Palestinians would be screened and vetted to enter in order to receive basic services, but would be explicitly barred from returning to the off-limits and blockaded “red zone”.</p><p>These plans represent a recycled version of what Israel has long wanted to do in Gaza. The creation of “bubbles” – an initial, telling euphemism that I first heard proposed by the Israeli authorities when I was part of coordinating humanitarian operations in Palestine as a United Nations official – was the first iteration of areas where Palestinians would be screened and would be conditioned to receive controlled assistance.</p><p>This is the grim reality of the so-called ceasefire deal in Gaza. It will not deliver peace; it will further shatter Gaza and the prospect for Palestinian sovereignty into pieces. If anything, it is a Gaza piece plan.</p><p>On Monday this week, the United Nations Security Council voted to legitimise the plan by endorsing a board of peace to manage Gaza and an international stabilisation force (ISF) to provide security. But what areas will these forces secure? There is no agreed-upon peace for these forces to keep. According to maps I have seen of the “alternative safe communities”, the ISF would be positioned along the yellow line and would secure these newly established camps.</p><p>Hamas has unsurprisingly rejected the UNSC resolution. It was obvious that its provisions were not the outcome of a negotiated agreement. In the 20-point Trump plan, which was attached as an annex to the <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/RES/2803(2025)\">resolution</a>, point 17 may now be invoked: “in the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operations, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF [Israeli army] to the ISF”. In this way, the “alternative safe communities” may become the only enabled aid delivery centres, thereby prolonging the total blockade on Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>The deadly logic of evacuation orders that marked the past two years and which drove Palestinians out of their homes, is now being extended into the UNSC-endorsed plan. Those who remain outside of the alternative communities, in the “red zone”, risk being labelled “Hamas supporters” and therefore ineligible for protection under Israel’s warped interpretation of international law and subject to ongoing military operations, as already seen <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/11/21/live-israel-keeps-bombing-gaza-kills-two-in-occupied-east-jerusalem\">in past days</a>.</p><p>The fate of Palestinians in the “red zone” remains conspicuously absent from official planning. In fact, humanitarian organisations capable of saving lives are <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/mounting-alarm-israeli-authorities-reject-ngo-applications-transport-life-saving-aid\">being squeezed out</a> by an Israeli registration process designed to stifle criticism and vet staff for compliance.</p><p>The model of contained communities is not entirely new. The British created “new villages” in Malaya in the 1950s, the Americans created “strategic hamlets” in Vietnam in the 1960s, and the colonial authorities in Rhodesia (today’s Zimbabwe) created “protected villages” in the 1970s during so-called “counter-insurgency”.</p><p>Civilian populations were coerced and forced into camps where they were screened in return for aid. The plan was to diminish popular support for resistance groups who were fighting colonial rule. It failed.</p><p>In South Africa, the apartheid government created bantustans, pseudo-independent homelands designed to concentrate and control the Black population. They also failed to prevent the collapse of a settler-colonial apartheid regime.</p><p>In Gaza, the peace plan that has been imposed rather than negotiated will leave Israel’s occupation not only intact but emboldened. The UNSC has endorsed something that goes against the <a href=\"/news/2024/7/19/world-court-says-israels-settlement-policies-breach-international-law\">rulings</a> of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/22/icj-says-israel-must-allow-aid-into-blockaded-gaza-provide-basic-needs\">occupied Palestinian territory</a>, essentially whitewashing a genocidal crime scene and creating a monument to impunity.</p><p>All of this unfolds during a so-called ceasefire, in which Palestinians continue to be killed for crossing invisible lines drawn by an illegal occupation.</p><p>The world might hail this phase as an end to the war, and states reluctant to sanction Israel are undoubtedly relieved to revive trade and reduce public scrutiny.</p><p>Moving beyond this dangerous status quo will require the very accountability the US and Israel have worked hard to avoid: implementing the rulings of the ICJ. While Western powers hollow out these institutions, new political coalitions are needed to demand the equal application of international law. At its most basic level, this requires the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians wherever they are in the strip and Palestinian-led reconstruction that ensures Palestinians are not perpetually condemned to bare survival.</p><p>The precedent set in Gaza would not be contained within the fences of Gaza’s gated communities sealed by international forces: it would further erode the foundations of a so-called rules-based order. The only way forward is a return to the principle this entire process has so far ignored: the inalienable right of a people to determine their own future.</p><p><strong><em>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</em></strong></p></div></div></body></html>"

Ramaphosa flatly rejected that.</p><p>Many of South Africa’s priorities for the group, including a focus on climate change and its impact on developing countries, have met resistance from the US.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said before the summit: “But I think South Africa has done its part in putting those things clearly upon the table.”</p><p>Guterres cautioned that rich nations have often failed to make the concessions required to strike effective climate or global financial reform agreements.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/how-trumps-absence-marks-leadership-opportunity-for-china-at-g20\">ordered</a> his country to boycott the summit over his baseless claims that South Africa is pursuing racist anti-white policies and persecuting its Afrikaner white minority.</p><p>The Trump administration has also made clear its opposition to South Africa’s G20 agenda from the start of the year, when it began hosting G20 meetings.</p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped a G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in February, slamming the agenda as being all about diversity, equity and inclusion, and climate change.</p><p>Rubio dismissively said he would not waste American taxpayers’ money on that.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122812\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122812\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122812\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-22T082237Z_1918744837_RC2K1IA1KZ3A_RTRMADP_3_G20-SUMMIT-1763799837.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A general view of the plenary hall on the opening day of the G20 Summit\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4122812\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A general view of the plenary hall on the opening day of the G20 summit in Johannesburg, November 22, 2025 [Yves Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-months-long-diplomatic-rift-between-the-us-and-south-africa-deepened-in-the-build-up-to-the-main-summit-this-weekend-but-while-trump-s-boycott-dominated-the-pre-talks-discussions-in-johannesburg-and-threatened-to-undercut-the-agenda-some-leaders-were-eager-to-move-on\">‘So many challenges’</h2><p id=\"the-months-long-diplomatic-rift-between-the-us-and-south-africa-deepened-in-the-build-up-to-the-main-summit-this-weekend-but-while-trump-s-boycott-dominated-the-pre-talks-discussions-in-johannesburg-and-threatened-to-undercut-the-agenda-some-leaders-were-eager-to-move-on\">The months-long diplomatic rift between the US and South Africa deepened in the build-up to the main summit this weekend, but while Trump’s boycott dominated the pre-talks discussions in Johannesburg and threatened to undercut the agenda, some leaders were eager to move on.</p><p>“I do regret it,” French President Emmanuel Macron said of Trump’s absence.</p><p>“But it should not block us.
