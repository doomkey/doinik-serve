It had earlier been forecast to strengthen into this week.</p><p>On Sunday, Erin was moving west-northwest at nearly 14 mph (22 kph) with a decrease in forward speed expected on Sunday and a turn to the north on Monday and Tuesday, the NHC said.</p><p>Swells generated by Erin will continue to affect parts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos Islands for the next couple of days, the NHC said. These swells will spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda, the east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the early and middle portions of the week.</p><p>Rough ocean conditions will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents, the NHC added.</p><p>The Bahamas, which provides some meteorological services for the Turks and Caicos Islands, has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for the British islands to its southeast.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3892955\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3892955\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3892955\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250816__69Q63N7__v1__HighRes__UsPuertoRicoWeatherHurricaneErin-1755412196.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Hurricane\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3892955\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A surfer rides a wave at La Pared Beach as Category 5 Hurricane Erin approaches in Luquillo, Puerto Rico [File: Ricardo Arduengo/AFP]</figcaption></figure><p>Erin has also raised concerns about wildfire risks, if human-caused sparks ignite parched vegetation and strong dry winds fan the flames. BMS Group Senior Meteorologist Andrew Siffert said these conditions could arise if Erin grows into a powerful offshore storm prompted by colliding warm and cold air rather than tropical seas.</p><p>The US government has deployed more than 200 employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies as a precaution. Puerto Rico Housing Secretary Ciary Perez Pena said 367 shelters were inspected and ready to open if needed.</p><p>Officials in the Bahamas are also preparing shelters and urging people to monitor the storm’s progress.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30 and is expected to be unusually busy. Six to 10 hurricanes are predicted for the season, including three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 177km/h (110mph).</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Scientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to climate change. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapour and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.</p><p>Storms that ramp up so quickly complicate forecasting and make it harder for government agencies to plan for emergencies.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That guy [Du Plessis] is strong. I couldn’t finish. I respect that guy. He is the only champion that would say my name.

Du Plessis experienced his first UFC loss and drops to 23-3 for his mixed martial arts (MMA) career.</p><p>Chimaev, who first entered UFC in 2020 and has previously defeated former champions Kamaru Usman and Robert Whittaker, was rarely threatened against Du Plessis, and despite being denied a finish by the South African he relentlessly took down the defending champion in the opening minute of every round.</p><p>The 31-year-old converted 12 of 17 takedown attempts in the bout and spent 84% of the 25-minute fight in control of Du Plessis, according to official UFC match data.</p><p>Du Plessis’s only moment to stage a come-from-behind victory came in the final round when he spun his way on top of his tiring opponent and executed a guillotine. Unfortunately for the reigning champion, the choke only lasted a couple of seconds as Chimaev methodically fought his way out and again resumed his control of the fight until the final bell.</p><p>“The man has incredible control on top,” Du Plessis said. “It wasn’t a matter of strength; it wasn’t physical; it was almost like he knew what your next move was. I could almost taste that victory [with the guillotine choke hold], but he beat me fair and square. He was the better man tonight. I’ll be coming to get my belt back, but for now, it’s his.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In April 2025, the Human Rights Court in Kenya issued an unprecedented ruling that it has the jurisdiction to hear a case about harmful content on one of Meta’s platforms. The lawsuit was filed in 2022 by Abraham Meareg, the son of an Ethiopian academic who was murdered after he was doxxed and threatened on Facebook, Fisseha Tekle, an Ethiopian human rights activist, who was also doxxed and threatened on Facebook, and Katiba Institute, a Kenyan non-profit that defends constitutionalism. They maintain that Facebook’s algorithm design and its content moderation decisions made in Kenya resulted in harm done to two of the claimants, fuelled the conflict in Ethiopia and led to widespread human rights violations within and outside Kenya.</p><p>The content in question falls outside the protected categories of speech under Article 33 of the Constitution of Kenya and includes propaganda for war, incitement to violence, hate speech and advocacy of hatred that constitutes ethnic incitement, vilification of others, incitement to cause harm and discrimination.</p><p>Key to the Kenyan case is the question whether Meta, a US-based corporation, can financially benefit from unconstitutional content and whether there is a positive duty on the corporation to take down unconstitutional content that also violates its Community Standards.</p><p>In affirming the Kenyan court’s jurisdiction in the case, the judge was emphatic that the Constitution of Kenya allows a Kenyan court to adjudicate over Meta’s acts or omissions regarding content posted on the Facebook platform that may impact the observance of human rights within and outside Kenya.</p><p>The Kenyan decision signals a paradigm shift towards platform liability where judges determine liability by solely asking the question: Do platform decisions observe and uphold human rights?</p><p>The ultimate goal of the Bill of Rights, a common feature in African constitutions, is to uphold and protect the inherent dignity of all people. Kenya’s Bill of Rights, for example, has as its sole mission to preserve the dignity of individuals and communities and to promote social justice and the realisation of the potential of all human beings. The supremacy of the Constitution also guarantees that, should there be safe harbour provisions in the laws of that country, they would not be a sufficient liability shield for platforms if their business decisions do not ultimately uphold human rights.</p><p>That a case on algorithm amplification has passed the jurisdiction hearing stage in Kenya is a testament that human rights law and constitutionality offer an opportunity for those who have suffered harm as a result of social media content to seek redress.</p><p>Up to this point, the idea that a social media platform can be held accountable for content on its platform has been dissuaded by the blanket immunity offered under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the US, and to a lesser extent, the principle of non-liability in the European Union, with the necessary exceptions detailed in various laws.</p><p>For example, Section 230 was one of the reasons a district judge in California cited in her ruling to <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/doe-vs-meta-order-granting-motion-to-dismiss-usdc-northern-california-rohingya-genocide.pdf\">dismiss</a> a case filed by Myanmar refugees in a similar claim that Meta had failed to curb hate speech that fuelled the Rohingya genocide.</p><p>The aspiration for platform accountability was further dampened by the US Supreme Court decision in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1496_d18f.pdf\">Twitter v Taamneh</a>, in which it ruled against plaintiffs who sought to establish that social media platforms carry responsibility for content posted on them.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The immunity offered to platforms has come at a high cost, especially for victims of harm in places where platforms do not have physical offices.</p><p>This is why a decision like the one by the Kenyan courts is a welcome development; it restores hope that victims of platform harm have an alternative route to recourse, one that refocuses human rights into the core of the discussion on platform accountability.</p><p>The justification for safe harbour provisions like Section 230 has always been to protect “nascent” technologies from being smothered by the multiplicity of suits. However, by now, the dominant social media platforms are neither nascent nor in need of protection. They have both the monetary and technical wherewithal to prioritise people over profits, but choose not to.</p><p>As the Kenyan cases cascade through the judicial process, there is cautious optimism that constitutional and human rights law that has taken root in African countries can offer a necessary reprieve for platform arrogance.</p><p><strong><em>Mercy Mutemi represents Fisseha Tekle in the case outlined in the article. </em></strong></p><p data-start=\"6686\" data-end=\"6983\"><strong><em>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</em></strong></p></div></div></body></html>"

Its soldiers face a grinding slog in Ukraine, dying by the hundreds, sometimes to advance just a few hundred metres or not at all.</p><p>On the diplomatic front, however, the situation is different. Russian President Vladimir Putin secured a major diplomatic victory by holding a summit with United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>At Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, it was all bonhomie. Trump clapped as Putin made his way onto the red carpet for a handshake before Trump escorted him into his presidential limo as the Russian leader smiled like a Cheshire cat. The two came away from their nearly three-hour meeting without much to say. Both spoke of agreement on a host of matters. Putin invited Trump to Moscow, who demurred – for now.</p><p>Little has leaked thus far on exactly what Putin and Trump discussed. The Russian leader sought to suggest in his remarks to the media that the talks were on his terms, bringing up Russia’s security concerns and praising his US counterpart for trying to “understand the history” of the conflict.</p><p>According to Russia’s ambassador to the US, Alexander Darchiev, apart from Ukraine, there were some concrete bilateral issues discussed. He <a href=\"https://www.interfax.ru/world/1042523\">claimed</a> two major diplomatic questions were raised: “the return of six Russian diplomatic properties that were de facto confiscated” during former US President Joe Biden’s administration and “the restoration of direct air traffic” between Russia and the US.</p><p>Trump for his part appeared to drop the demand for a ceasefire in Ukraine – something he had publicly called for before the summit. Instead, he agreed to take the Kremlin’s demand for a full settlement of the conflict rather than a ceasefire to Ukraine and its European allies. Later, he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, that the European Union and Ukraine agreed with him that “the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement”.</p><p>Although Trump seemed to take the Russian position on a ceasefire, the worst possible outcome of the summit was still avoided. The meeting did not turn into a “new Munich”, where Trump would appease Putin just like the French and British leaders appeased Adolf Hitler in a meeting in the German city in 1938 by agreeing to a German takeover of part of Czechoslovakia. The US president did not accede to Russian territorial claims.</p><p>That said, for Putin, the summit was a tactical win because it broadcast to the world that the US president himself was casting off the pariah status the Kremlin had earned for its unilateral invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent war crimes it has overseen. The Russian president was treated like the leader of a “great power” – a status he has long been obsessed with returning Russia to – who had to be negotiated with, on his terms.</p><p>So where does all this leave Ukraine and its European allies?</p><p>Trump is clearly unwilling to change his position on Ukraine. He admires Putin – his personality and his governing style – immensely.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>But Brussels, London, and Kyiv cannot give up on him. The truth is that continued US support is indispensable to Ukraine maintaining its defence. Europe has moved to pick up more of the burden of funding since Trump was inaugurated for his second term, but its military capabilities and defence industry supply chains cannot replace those of the US anytime soon, even if they increase investments exponentially.</p><p>Trump wants peace in name and cares nought about the details. For Kyiv, the detail is its very survival, and for the rest of Europe, Ukraine’s fate shapes the potential that it could be the next target of Putin’s aggression in his would-be geopolitically rebalanced world.</p><p>That does not mean that there is no way to turn Trump. There is – Ukraine and Europe can use a page or two out of Putin’s playbook in dealing with the US president.</p><p>Trump clearly likes his ego to be stroked, which is what Putin repeatedly did in his remarks to the media, echoing, for example, Trump’s claim that if he had been president in 2022, the war in Ukraine would not have happened.</p><p>Continuing diplomatic engagement is the way forward, as is seeking to change the frame in which Trump sees the Ukrainian conflict.</p><p>The US president cares more about the future of US energy exports, US competition with China, its challenge to US economic dominance and the exploitation of the Arctic than he does about Ukraine. It was Trump’s choice to host the meeting in Alaska, after all, and his obsession with Greenland – so seemingly strange to European allies of the US – makes far more sense in this context.</p><p>The key is to persuade the US president that Russia is a threat to Washington’s interests in all of these matters.</p><p>An easing of sanctions could see Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects flood into the market and depress the price for US LNG exports. Putin has reshaped Russia’s economy to be dependent on minerals exports to China, fuelling its ability to compete economically thanks to cheap inputs. Putin has also repeatedly sought to push Beijing to be more assertive in economic competition by calling on it to dump the dollar and push new trade and finance frameworks that exclude the US. And Russia is hoping to dominate the Arctic by expanding its Arctic fleet with new nuclear-powered icebreakers and submarines.</p><p>For Putin, his war in Ukraine has never been just about the dividing lines in the Donbas or his claimed injustices from the Soviet Union’s collapse. It is a war to reshape the world. On the other hand, Trump sees the war as a distraction and a drag on his own efforts to reshape the world.</p><p>Only if Kyiv and the wider West understand Trump’s approach could they persuade him what is at stake. They must focus on how Putin hurts American interests and Trump’s perception thereof. If they fail to do so, while Alaska may have proven to be no “new Munich”, its legacy could be that of one of a “new Yalta” in which Europe’s future is to be shaped by new exclusive spheres of influence drawn by Moscow and Washington.</p><p data-start=\"6686\" data-end=\"6983\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In reality, it was a major military operation in response to Indonesia’s unilateral declaration of independence in August 1945. This two-part series reveals how far the Dutch government went in “selling” the war as a domestic affair aimed at restoring peace in what it called the Dutch East Indies. The series exposes how propaganda, selective media coverage and historical omission shaped the Dutch collective memory. A wide range of interviewees explain the complex relationships in the former colony and provide a global context. International pressure eventually forced the Dutch government to give up its colonial war, but its carefully orchestrated disinformation campaign still hangs over the public debate in the Netherlands today. This is about how history is written, rewritten and often manipulated to serve powerful vested interests.</p></div></div></body></html>"

You might be seeing mixed messaging based on the politicians you listen to or what your social media algorithms surface.</p><p>Some say the numbers show President Donald Trump’s success. Others say the opposite.</p><p>Every month, the federal Bureau of Labour Statistics publishes the consumer price index, which measures price changes for goods and services, including food, apparel, gasoline and housing. The report is used to assess economic stability and inform policy decisions.</p><p>Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida celebrated the July report on the day of its release.</p><p>“Another month of inflation coming in lighter than expected. That’s GREAT NEWS for Florida families, and another reminder to trust in Pres. Trump!” Scott posted on August 12 on X, alongside a short Fox Business clip about energy and gas price decreases.</p><p>US Representative Kathy Castor, a Democrat from Florida, had a different take.</p><p>“Trump is raising your grocery bill to line the wallets of his billionaire friends. Nothing great about this for American families across the country,” Castor wrote in an August 12 X post that included a link to a CBS News story that said in its headline that the index rose in July by 2.7 percent on an annual basis.</p><p>Economists told PolitiFact this muddled framing isn’t new, and people from different political tribes use varying metrics to reinforce their views. They said the full picture on the economy’s health and trajectory needs more time to come into focus.</p><p>Overall, the report’s numbers are “another dose of modest bad news,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the centre-right policy institute American Action Forum. “It’s not dramatic yet, it’s not a crisis, but it’s not positive.”</p><p>Trump’s tariffs, widely watched to see how they affect consumer prices and inflation, are still new and some <a href=\"/news/2025/8/7/trumps-higher-tariffs-take-effect-on-imports-from-dozens-of-countries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just went into effect</a> in August.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“Since at least 2021, the CPI reports have become a partisan battleground with both sides cherry picking the data to best support their argument,” said Jason Furman, an economist and professor at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government who previously served as an economic adviser to former President Barack Obama. “And there is so much data in the CPI report that there is always some way to slice and dice it to support just about any view.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><strong>The CPI report and its meaning</strong></h2><p>For July, <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/12/consumer-prices-increase-in-july-amid-tariff-driven-economic-uncertainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPI</a> increased 0.2 percent compared with the previous month and 2.7 percent from a year ago. That’s slightly cooler than the 2.8 percent rise economists had forecast, thanks to declines in gasoline and energy prices.</p><p>Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the 2.7 percent 12-month rise in consumer prices for all items is a “bit lower than it was at the start of 2025,” to Trump’s advantage. But the number is also a bit higher than it was from March to July, he said, an advantage for Trump’s critics.</p><p>A separate measure, core inflation – which excludes food and energy because they are considered volatile measures prone to large, rapid fluctuations – increased 0.3 percent for July and 3.1 percent from a year ago. This is the first time annual core inflation, which officials use to monitor underlying, longer-term inflation trends, has risen above 3 percent in several months. This outpaces Federal Reserve projections before the 2024 election, which projected 2.2 percent median core inflation for 2025.</p><p>“Economists tend to focus on the core because it is less erratic than food and energy prices,” said Dean Baker, cofounder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Food and energy prices are very important, but big changes in either direction tend to be reversed. Therefore, it is often more useful if we are looking for future trends to look at the core index.”</p><p>Despite the uptick, the report was mild enough for investors, as US stocks closed near a record high on August 12. The stock market appears, for now, to be focusing on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, given concerns about a cooling labour market. Central bank officials, to Trump’s disapproval, have held rates steady in 2025 as they wait to see tariffs’ effects on the economy.</p><p>The July data comes amid a Bureau of Labor Statistics shake-up. After the agency’s downward revision of May and June employment data, Trump <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/1/trump-fires-official-overseeing-jobs-data-after-dismal-employment-numbers\">fired</a> bureau Commissioner <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/4/banana-republic-trump-puts-credibility-of-us-economic-data-on-the-line\">Erika McEntarfer</a>, accusing her of political bias. Trump nominated<a href=\"/economy/2025/8/13/trump-nominee-to-lead-labour-statistics-agency-faces-wave-of-criticism\"> E J Antoni</a>, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has criticised the bureau, as the agency’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/12/trump-names-conservative-economist-to-lead-labour-statistics-agency\">new commissioner</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-long-and-winding-road-of-trump-s-tariffs\"><strong>The long and winding road of Trump’s tariffs</strong></h2><p>As the Trump administration highlights the collection of nearly $130bn from the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/trump-sets-new-tariffs-on-dozens-of-countries-exports\">new tariffs</a> so far, many economists expect that businesses will begin passing on the additional costs to US customers.</p><p>Goldman Sachs estimated in an analysis shared with Bloomberg that US companies have so far absorbed the bulk of tariff costs – about two-thirds of the levies – while consumers absorbed about 22 percent of the costs through June.</p><p>But Goldman Sachs said it expects the consumer share of the costs to soar to 67 percent by October if the tariffs follow previous patterns of how import levies affected prices.</p><p>Trump wrote in an August 12 Truth Social post that Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon should replace its economist. “It has been proven, that even at this late stage, Tariffs have not caused Inflation, or any other problems for America, other than massive amounts of CASH pouring into our Treasury’s coffers,” Trump wrote.</p><p>Some US companies have avoided passing along higher prices by stockpiling goods ahead of the tariffs’ implementation. Others have absorbed costs to avoid losing customers or are holding off in hopes that <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-about-legality-of-trump-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">courts</a> nix the tariffs.</p><p>“That’s just businesses making business decisions,” said Holtz-Eakin, from the American Action Forum. “But there will be a point if the tariffs stay in place at the current levels, where that just won’t be feasible any more.”</p><p>Many studies of past tariffs have found that they harm the economy and raise consumer prices.</p><p>For now, however, experts agreed that the <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/what-has-been-the-impact-of-trumps-tariffs-so-far\">US economy</a> is in a wait-and-see moment.</p><p>Burtless, from Brookings, believes that the effects of tariffs on consumer prices are modest so far, and that price increases across different categories of goods and services appear “inconsistent with the idea that tariffs are the main driver of overall inflation”.</p><p>“That may turn out to be the case in the future,” he said, “but not yet.”</p><p>Holtz-Eakin also warned about putting too much stock in a single report.</p><p>“Never believe one month’s data,” he said. “That’s a rule of life if you’re doing policy work.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

So there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” the US president said.</p><p>Trump and Putin also refused to take questions.</p><p>As a result, the summit ended with “nothing concrete”, Kucherenko said, as Putin said the “root causes” of the war should be addressed before any ceasefire or real steps towards a peace settlement are made.</p><p>“In order to make the [future peace] settlement lasting and long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict, and we’ve said it multiple times, to consider all legitimate concerns of Russia,” Putin said.</p><p>“Root causes” is Putin’s code for rejecting Ukraine’s existence outside Moscow’s political shadow and denying its very sovereignty.</p><h2 id=\"the-china-angle\">The China angle</h2><p>However, the talks were not a total triumph for Putin, another Ukrainian observer said.</p><p>They lasted for less than three hours instead of the seven that Russian officials had announced, and there was no bread broken over a joint lunch.</p><p>And what was discussed behind closed doors went far beyond the war.</p><p>“Russia works through <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/15/can-putin-sway-trump-with-economic-offers-in-alaska\">economy and geopolitics</a>, offers Trump profit here and now, and also haggles over the topic of containing China,” Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevych told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Based on that, the Kremlin is trying to gain political concessions that could help Russia confirm its ambitions for the status of a geopolitical centre, ” he said.</p><p>“And Ukraine is just a derivative part – an important but derivative one – of these processes,” he said.</p><p>As the White House wants to prevent the <a href=\"/features/2025/3/14/is-trump-trying-to-pull-putin-away-from-china-and-can-it-work\">fusion of Moscow’s and Beijing’s interests</a>, Trump finds it beneficial to negotiate business projects and political interactions with Moscow, Tyshkevych said.</p><p>“As a result, the United States is not interested in a total defeat and a crisis for Russia. Alas for us,” he said.</p><p>However, both Washington and Beijing wouldn’t agree with boosting Moscow’s geopolitical role to the status of a third global power, so the White House only “partially understands” Putin’s ambitions, he said.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h2><p>For Ukraine, it all means more hostilities and attacks by Russian drones and missiles – while Moscow would boost mobilisation of men of fighting age, he said.</p><p>One of Ukraine’s pre-eminent military analysts, meanwhile, is pessimistic about the summit’s outcomes.</p><p>The very fact of a face-to-face with Trump on American soil means Putin was “legitimised” and raised from the role of a political pariah, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of the Ukrainian military’s General Staff, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“He was legitimised in an absolutely unacceptable way” while being an “international evil man who should be held responsible for his actions”, Romanenko said.</p><p>“Yet again, Trump didn’t fulfil his promises about sanctions [on Russia], didn’t reach a position on a ceasefire,” he said.</p><p>Ukraine, therefore, will have to continue its “complicated fight until Trump grows his willpower and political will”, the general said.</p><p>Russia will accelerate its attempts to break through Ukraine’s defence lines in the east and will resume its devastating air strikes with drones and missiles, he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities will need to make strategic decisions to start a “full and just” mobilisation of men of fighting age and focus the economy on military needs, Romanenko said.</p></div></div></body></html>"
