We moved on,” Slot told reporters on Friday, referring to his decision to bring Salah on as a substitute in last week’s <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/13/salah-assists-ekitikes-brace-as-liverpool-beat-brighton\">2-0 victory over Brighton</a>.</p><p>Salah said after the 3-3 draw at Leeds United – the third consecutive game for which he was benched – that he had been thrown under the bus for Liverpool’s woes this season. He was <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/8/inter-milan-vs-liverpool-champions-league-salah-team-start-and-lineups\">dropped from the squad</a> that travelled to Inter Milan in the Reds next match. Subsequently, interest was shown from Saudi Arabia about <a href=\"/sports/2025/12/9/liverpools-mohamed-salah-a-transfer-target-for-saudi-arabia\">bringing Salah to the Saudi Pro League</a>.</p><p>“Now he’s at the AFCON playing big games for himself and the country,” Slot continued. “All the focus for him is over there and there should not be any distraction of me saying anything because we moved on after the Leeds interview and he played against Brighton.”</p><p>Despite a difficult second season for Slot in England, Liverpool sit seventh in the Premier League and would move into the top four with a victory against struggling Spurs.</p><p>The English champions transformed their squad over the summer transfer window, spending nearly 450 million pounds ($602m) to bring in Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.</p><p>Apart from the impressive Ekitike, all the new signings have struggled, and Slot conceded he had been overly optimistic over how long it would take for his new-look squad to perform consistently.</p><p>“I think we are getting closer and closer to the team I want us to be and that has gone with ups and downs,” said the Dutchman.</p><p>“But for me, that makes complete sense because all the changes we’ve made during the summer, and we made them on purpose because we thought we needed to.</p><p>“If I’m completely honest, maybe I didn’t expect it to take maybe as long as it did, but, looking back on it, reflecting on it now, I think I’ve been too positive because if you go with a new group where not all of them are completely ready to play every single game, 90 minutes in this intensity, you have to adapt.</p><p>“Sometimes he can play, then he cannot play. So it takes maybe a bit of time, and we’ve been very unlucky.”</p><p>Joe Gomez and Cody Gakpo will miss the trip to Tottenham due to injury, but Slot is hopeful that Dominik Szoboszlai will be fit to start. Frimpong returns after a two-month absence.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Similar protests occurred in Gazipur, Sylhet, and Chattogram.</p><p>Thursday night saw protesters set fire to several Dhaka buildings, including the offices of prominent newspapers Prothom Alo and the Daily Star. Critics accuse these publications of favouring India, where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina sought refuge after fleeing during the 2024 uprising.</p><p>Staff trapped in the Daily Star building reported dangerous conditions. “I can’t breathe any more… You are killing me,” reporter Zyma Islam wrote on Facebook before firefighters rescued employees.</p><p>Prothom Alo’s executive editor Sajjad Sharif condemned the incident as “an attack on freedom of the press, expression, dissent and diversity of opinion”.</p><p>The interim government, led by 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, reached out to both newspapers’ editors and denounced the vandalism. Officials urged citizens to resist mob violence perpetrated by “fringe elements”.</p><p>“This is a critical moment in our nation’s history when we are making a historic democratic transition,” a government statement declared. “We cannot and must not allow it to be derailed by those few who thrive on chaos and reject peace.”</p><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists called on authorities to ensure media safety and accountability for those responsible.</p><p>Protesters had previously marched towards the Indian High Commission in Dhaka on Wednesday, reflecting deteriorating relations between the neighbouring countries since Hasina’s government collapsed.</p><p>Hadi, who led the student protest group Inqilab Moncho, had planned to run for parliament in the February 2026 national election. Police have launched a manhunt for his killers, releasing photographs of key suspects and offering a reward for information.</p><p>Special prayers were held in mosques nationwide, and Saturday was designated an official day of mourning for the slain student leader.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The appointments often took all day and sometimes required missing school and final exams. Jose felt embarrassed to tell his teachers and classmates where he was going, but also knew he had to fulfil his immigration obligations and maintain good conduct and his arrest-free record.</p><p>“You have to follow the law, because when you follow the law things go well, right?” Jose said.</p><p>That day, Jose heard the rattle of handcuffs. The officer told him not to make a scene. As Josue turned and saw his older brother restrained, a different officer handcuffed him, too.</p><p>By the time the brothers had walked into ICE’s field office for their 8am appointment, about two months into President Donald Trump’s second administration, rumours were swirling that immigration agents were detaining people at routine immigration check-ins. These appointments are typically for people with pending immigration cases who aren’t considered threats to the public.</p><p>Detaining people at check-ins became part of Trump’s effort to carry out mass deportations, one of his <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/maga-meter-tracking-donald-trumps-2024-promises/promise/1617/carry-out-the-largest-domestic-deportation-operati/\">2024 campaign promises</a>. But the strategy contradicted Trump’s and his administration’s assurances that immigration agents would pursue “the worst of the worst always first”.</p><p>“I’m talking about, in particular, starting with the criminals. These are some of the worst people anywhere in the world,” Trump said on August 22, 2024.</p><p>On October 31, CBS News correspondent Norah O’Donnell asked Trump about his promise “to deport the worst of the worst, violent criminals”. Trump answered: “That’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>Neither Jose nor Josue have been convicted of a crime. The same is true of <a href=\"https://tracreports.org/immigration/detentionstats/pop_agen_table.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">73 percent of the more than 65,000 immigrants</a> in ICE detention as of November, a record number of detainees. Nearly half of all immigrants in ICE detention have neither a criminal conviction nor pending criminal charges. Of the immigrants with criminal convictions, 5 percent have been convicted of violent crime such as murder or rape, according to the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.</p><p>Despite what Trump said, some of the most high-profile moments during his administration’s mass deportation campaign did not lead to large-scale arrests of violent criminals.</p><p>In March, the Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"/news/2025/3/17/trump-deports-238-gang-members-to-el-salvador-whats-the-controversy\">sent nearly 250 Venezuelan men</a> to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. A ProPublica investigation later found that only 32 of the men had US criminal convictions, most for nonviolent offences such as retail theft or traffic violations.</p><p>In the first half of a months-long Chicago immigration crackdown dubbed “<a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/lawsuit-alleges-horrific-conditions-at-us-immigration-facility-in-chicago\">Operation Midway Blitz</a>“, immigration officers arrested 1,900 people, two-thirds of whom had no criminal convictions or pending charges, according to a Chicago Tribune analysis.</p><p>When PolitiFact asked the White House whether its detention strategy was in line with what Trump and officials have said publicly, spokesperson Abigail Jackson said: “The Trump Administration’s top immigration enforcement priority is arresting and removing the dangerous violent, illegal criminal aliens that Joe Biden let flood across our Southern Border – of which there are many. Recent ICE <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/newsroom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arrests</a> include criminal illegal aliens who are rapists, pedophiles and murderers. But anyone who is illegally present in the country, and as a result breaking US laws, is eligible for deportation if they do not take advantage of self-deportation opportunities.”</p><p>Jose and Josue were applying for legal status. They were not in hiding and had spent years appearing before ICE officers and immigration judges.</p><p>In May, Jose and Josue were deported to <a href=\"/opinions/2021/12/11/remembering-us-backed-state-terror-in-el-salvador\">El Salvador</a>, a country the rest of their family had already fled.</p><p>“We followed the law and we were punished,” Jose said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-brothers-quest-for-legal-residency\">The brothers’ quest for legal residency</h2><p>Fleeing threats of <a href=\"/news/2024/2/2/trapped-in-this-hell-how-one-el-salvador-town-transformed-under-bukele\">gang violence</a> in El Salvador, Jose and Josue arrived in the US in summer 2016 at the ages of 11 and 10 with their mother, Alma Lopez Diaz.</p><p>US officials stopped the family at the southern border and released them into the US while they sought asylum. The family moved in with the boys’ aunt in Georgia.</p><p>The brothers enrolled in school and learned English by reading books, using language-learning apps and correcting themselves after classmates teased them.</p><p>By 2020, judges had denied the family’s asylum case and appeals because gang extortion is not generally considered a reason for asylum, said Ala Amoachi, who became the brothers’ immigration lawyer in 2024. Jose and Josue had received a deportation order.</p><p>Deportation orders are paused when people file appeals. Jose and Josue were appealing until 2020, when their appeals ran out, but they continued to appear at ICE check-ins. Amoachi said the government likely didn’t deport them during that time because they had no criminal records and for humanitarian considerations “such as family unity and the fact that they have a younger brother who’s a US citizen and who’s disabled”.</p><p>By 2025, when the brothers were detained, they had a viable pathway to obtaining legal status, based on a process their attorney started in 2024.</p><p>We contacted DHS to ask why the brothers were detained and deported while they had a pending immigration case and received no reply.</p><p>During his second term, Trump has significantly curtailed legal pathways for immigrants. In January, he ended a Biden-era programme that let people schedule immigration appointments at the border and legally enter the US to seek asylum. Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has stripped hundreds of thousands of people of temporary legal protections that let them live and work in the US.</p><p>Jose continued to try to build what he called his American dream, but his immigration status presented obstacles to buying a car and getting a job.</p><p>In 2024, the brothers moved to Long Island, New York, where their mother’s long-distance partner lived.</p><p>Amoachi initiated a process for them to apply for Special Immigrant Juveniles Status, a protection for young immigrants who were abused, abandoned or neglected by a parent. The brothers’ father had abandoned them, court documents say. When approved, the status allows immigrants to eventually apply for permanent residency. The brothers’ previous lawyer in Georgia had failed to tell them this status was an option, Amoachi said.</p><p>Under the Biden administration, immigrants granted Special Immigrant Juveniles status were protected from deportation. In June, the Trump administration ended the <a href=\"/news/2025/4/25/venezuelans-in-state-of-uncertainty-over-us-temporary-protected-status\">deportation protection programme</a> and began detaining and deporting people with Special Immigrant Juveniles status. Immigrant advocacy groups are <a href=\"https://nipnlg.org/work/litigation/acr-v-noem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suing</a> the government over the changes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-sudden-unexpected-outcome\">A sudden, unexpected outcome</h2><p>Jose’s dream of starting fresh in New York was short lived.</p><p>At the March 14 appointment, an ICE officer asked whether the brothers were contesting their removal order, and when Jose handed over their paperwork, the officer said, “‘This doesn’t work’,” Jose recounted.</p><p>Within minutes, the brothers were in handcuffs.</p><p>There’s no data about how many people have been arrested while attending required ICE check-ins, but news stories and social media clips are rife with examples of immigrants being detained and separated from family members. Lawyers have warned clients about the tactic. In San Diego, several immigrants are suing the government following their detention at check-ins.</p><p>Amoachi, who has worked as an immigration lawyer for 15 years, said before Trump’s second term, she had never seen a case like Jose’s and Josue’s – young men with deportation orders but no criminal convictions or gang affiliation and a pending application – end with detention.</p><p>About a week after the brothers were detained, Trump’s border czar Tom Homan said the administration was prioritising criminals.</p><p>“We’re going to keep targeting the worst of the worst, which we’ve been doing since Day One, and deporting from the United States,” Homan said on March 23.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"leaving-everything-behind\">Leaving everything behind</h2><p>Detention was the first leg in a two-month journey which would take the brothers back to El Salvador.</p><p>Hours after the brothers were detained, immigration officers shackled them and took them to a Buffalo, New York, detention centre.</p><p>In detention, Jose worked with a detained pastor to host weekly church services. Josue took a job in the kitchen – cleaning dishes and helping serve food – earning $1 a day. He used the money to call his mom or buy ramen, a delicacy in detention. Josue also taught English to fellow detainees and served as an unofficial translator for immigration officers.</p><p>On March 26, a New York family court judge ruled that Jose and Josue had been abandoned by their father and it was not in their best interest to return to El Salvador. Even so, they remained detained.</p><p>In early May, officers called in the brothers for processing, which would mean they’d either be deported or released, Jose said. Fellow detainees rooted for them.</p><p>The outcome wasn’t as hoped. The brothers were transported to Louisiana.</p><p>For several days, Jose and Josue stayed in holding cells dubbed “hieleras” – Spanish for “ice boxes” – with about 100 people in each. On May 7, their mother’s birthday, an officer called the brothers’ names to board a flight to El Salvador. Once on the plane, Jose said an officer entered with a separate list of names for people who could get off the flight. That was Jose’s last hope. But the brothers’ names weren’t called.</p><p>“When the plane took off, I knew I was leaving behind my mum,” Jose said. “Literally everything was staying behind. Our dreams. Everything.”</p><h2 id=\"stuck-in-limbo\">Stuck in limbo</h2><p>Nine years after fleeing their home country, Jose and Josue, now 21 and 20, landed in El Salvador. They had no passports; US immigration authorities had taken them when they applied for asylum and never returned them.</p><p>Authorities gave each brother a piece of paper with his name on it as a form of identification. When Jose and Josue arrived at an immigration processing centre, they saw people waiting for US deportees. No one was waiting for them.</p><p>“I looked at my brother and said, ‘Now what? What do we do?’” Jose said.</p><p>Their mother sent their grandmother’s childhood friend to pick them up. For the first few nights, the brothers couldn’t eat or sleep. They have since been diagnosed with PTSD and depression, Amoachi said.</p><p>A few weeks after Jose and Josue arrived in El Salvador, Josue’s high school in Georgia held its graduation ceremony. Rather than walking across the stage, he watched from his phone as they announced his name, and he cried in Jose’s arms.</p><p>Seven months after being deported, Jose and Josue yearn for the possibility of reuniting with their families. Amoachi has filed several appeals on their behalf.</p><p>Jose said the brothers followed the conditions: Going to court, attending ICE check-ins, having good moral conduct and no criminal record.</p><p>“So what is the legal pathway?” Jose asked. “There isn’t one.”</p><p><em>PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.</em></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Healthcare has been disrupted, with the World Health Organization documenting deaths caused by the inability to contact emergency services in time.</p><p class=\"font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal leading-[1.7]\">Even during the fragile ceasefire that took effect in October 2025, Israel has blocked essential repair equipment from entering Gaza.

It eventually peaked on October 29 during a meeting with South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-seok: “I think by the end of my first term, we should have $21 or $22 trillion dollars invested in the United States from other people and countries,” Trump said.</p><p>Since then, Trump has reported varied investment figures:</p><ul>\n<li>On November 27 and December 2, he said they were worth nearly $20 trillion.</li>\n<li>On December 2, December 3, December 4 and December 9, he said about $18 trillion, a figure he had first cited on October 10.</li>\n</ul><p>Sometimes Trump has phrased the commitments as approaching a dollar figure; other times, he’s said they’ve already hit that number.</p><p>In May, when Trump said, “We have now close to $10 trillion” in investments, we rated that <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/may/08/donald-trump/foreign-corporate-investment-10-trillion/\">False</a>. The White House had documented at least $4.9 trillion less than what Trump claimed.</p><p>That $10 trillion number has about doubled in the seven months since, according to Trump, but it’s unsubstantiated.

Experts say there’s no guarantee the full amounts promised will come to fruition, and some of this investment would have occurred regardless of who was president.</p><p>The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s questions about Trump’s statements.</p><p>One way to benchmark Trump’s investment figure is to look at what the White House officially documented.</p><p>The White House launched a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">webpage</a> in April that includes a list of countries and companies it said have announced investments during Trump’s second term.</p><p>Using the internet archive Wayback Machine, we tracked the amount of investment the White House website cited over time.

The remaining $2.6 trillion included countries’ agreements to purchase items such as natural gas or to expand future trade. The analysis characterised some of the investment pledges by other countries as “amorphous”.</p><p>More than 80 percent of the investments from private companies stemmed from artificial intelligence-related spending.</p><p>“Many of the pledges cited by the White House are part of overlapping multi-company projects, making it difficult to determine how much may be counted more than once,” Bloomberg said.</p><p>Ten items on the White House’s website accounted for the vast majority of the $9.6 trillion the White House detailed. Some of the White House’s documentation includes details such as specific companies getting involved and the types of facilities or infrastructure envisioned; other examples are more vague.

Companies cited in a White House news release include Boeing, GE Aerospace, Emirates Global Aluminum, ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, Qualcomm and Amazon Web Services. It’s unclear how much of this investment would come from new investments.</p><p>The UAE’s 2024 gross domestic product was $537bn, making the pledge equal to three years of the country’s entire economic output.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>2. Qatar: $1.2 trillion.</strong> The White House press release described this as an “economic exchange”, rather than a one-way investment. It cited the involvement of companies including Boeing, GE Aerospace, Raytheon, General Atomics, ExxonMobil and Chevron Phillips. The announcement described a mixture of trade deals, purchase agreements and investment intentions – items that analysts say often include future-looking efforts rather than capital injections.</p><p>In 2024, Qatar’s gross domestic product was $218bn, making this pledge equivalent to nearly six years of the country’s entire economy.</p><p><strong>3. Japan: $1 trillion.</strong> The White House has said Japan is <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/8/trump-japans-ishiba-play-nice-despite-tariff-threat\">moving towards $1 trillion</a>, following an initial agreement to invest $550bn in sectors such as semiconductors, shipbuilding, energy, pharmaceuticals, metals and minerals by the end of Trump’s term. Japan also disputes that this will be a one-way flow of cash into the US. Bloomberg News quoted Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa saying, “It’s not that $550bn in cash will be sent to the US” but rather a combination of investments, loans and loan guarantees provided by financial institutions backed by the Japanese government.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>4. Meta: $600bn.</strong> The White House and the social media company said $600bn is tied to Meta’s US AI infrastructure and workforce expansion plans through to 2028.</p><p><strong>5. Apple: $600bn.</strong> Apple’s long history of multi-year domestic investment pledges  means the $600bn figure incorporates prior commitments plus recent accelerations. Apple’s news release described a new $100bn boost to bring its total US commitment to $600bn over several years. The release cites a new American Manufacturing Program, supplier investments and training programmes.</p><p><strong>6. Saudi Arabia: $600bn.</strong> The administration said $600bn from <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/trump-hosts-saudi-arabias-mohammed-bin-salman-five-key-takeaways\">Saudi Arabia</a> would involve the energy, critical minerals and defence sectors.</p><p>The amount cited would be equal to about half of Saudi Arabia’s 2024 gross domestic product.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>7. European Union companies: $600bn.</strong> The EU said in August that “European companies are expected to invest an additional $600bn across strategic sectors in the United States through 2028.” However, the statement frames this as aspirational, not as a commitment.</p><p><strong>8. Stargate: $500bn.</strong> This consortium between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle was unveiled during a January 21 White House event. Stargate said $100bn will be invested “immediately” and that the consortium “intends to invest” a total of $500bn over the next four years. OpenAI, among others, published blog posts describing its plans for five new sites that would bring the project to “over $400bn” in near-term investment, positioning it on a path to the $500bn target.</p><p><strong>9. NVIDIA: $500bn.</strong> The White House said NVIDIA has <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/14/nvidia-commits-to-500bn-ai-server-production-in-the-us\">pledged</a> to build $500bn-worth of AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years. NVIDIA has said it is pursuing “ambitious” manufacturing and server production in the US, but the $500bn figure remains a goal.</p><p><strong>10. India: $500bn.</strong> What is being called “Mission 500” aims to reach $500bn in annual bilateral trade by 2030. But it is a trade goal, not an investment pledge, and its end date would come after the end of Trump’s term. Further, the framework seems to allow US purchases of Indian goods to count towards the goal, which does not foster US investment and production.</p><p>Importantly, experts said, some of these pledges won’t materialise.</p><p>“Historically, large-scale investment announcements often overpromise and underdeliver,” Roman V Yampolskiy, an AI specialist at the University of Louisville told PolitiFact in May. “There is a performative element to them, especially in politically charged contexts. They function as political theatre as much as economic commitment.”</p><p>Trump isn’t the first to overstate new investments. President Joe Biden said in 2024 that his bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act had attracted $640bn in private investments; economists told PolitiFact that Biden’s numbers were based on what companies had announced, which is not the same as dollars already spent.</p><h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2><p>Trump says the US has received investment commitments totalling $18 trillion to $22 trillion since he took office in January.</p><p>The number Trump cites is about double what the White House’s website lists. And experts say the website’s current figure, $9.6 trillion, should be viewed with caution.</p><p>It includes aspirational, multi-year goals that might or might not come to fruition, and some items are future purchases or sales of products, rather than capital investments.</p><p>For the two biggest line items – commitments from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – the amounts are multiple times those countries’ annual gross domestic product.</p><p><strong>We rate Trump’s statement False.</strong></p></div></div></body></html>"

But this is not entirely out of concern for the more than 70,000 people that Israel has killed in Gaza so far. Rather, many of their objections have focused on the cost of supporting Israel and the potential risks of doing so.</p><p>In June, the influential MAGA figure and Trump ally, former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, openly broke with the president on the topic. Taking to social media, he wrote: “The real divide isn’t between people who support Israel and people who support Iran or the Palestinians. The real divide is between those who casually encourage violence, and those who seek to prevent it — between warmongers and peacemakers.”</p><p></p><p>Another of Trump’s inner circle, his former aide Steve Bannon, has also questioned the “special relationship”, describing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as having “betrayed” the US by launching strikes on Iran while knowing it did not have the tools needed for outright victory.</p><p>Later the same year, after Netanyahu had suggested that being anti-Israel was incompatible with being part of the MAGA movement, Bannon responded with what commentators described as a “scorched earth” approach, appearing to address the Israeli prime minister directly via social media. Bannon used colourful language to say that US citizens did not care about Netanyahu’s opinions towards MAGA, but instead cared about exposing the prime minister’s “pathological lies” so that the US stays out of “[Israel’s] next war”.</p><h2 id=\"has-trump-s-support-for-israel-hurt-his-political-base\">Has Trump’s support for Israel hurt his political base?</h2><p>Up to a point.</p><p>While many Republican figures remain loyal, the most strident criticism – and one of the few on the US right to have accused Israel of genocide – has come from one of his previously most stalwart allies, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p><p>In the midst of a number of ruptures over the cost of living and the release of files related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Greene earned Trump’s fury after she took to social media to call out the “genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza”.</p><p>Trump has responded to the congresswoman’s criticism by branding her Marjorie “Traitor” Greene.</p><p>Greene has since announced that she will be leaving Congress, but is still well respected by many in the MAGA movement, who see her as having stood up for an “America First” policy rather than an “Israel First” one.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4132562\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4132562\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132562\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/afp_6926fbc62de5-1764162502.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"(FILES) US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R), Republican of Georgia, speaks alongside former US President and 2024 presidential hopeful Donald Trump at a campaign event in Rome, Georgia, on March 9, 2024.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4132562\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R) speaks alongside Trump at a campaign event in Rome, Georgia [File: AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-much-might-this-be-costing-him-electorally\">How much might this be costing him electorally?</h2><p>It is not certain.</p><p>A new poll released this week by YouGov and the Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU) Policy Project showed a plurality of Republicans surveyed favoured letting the 10-year aid agreement lapse once it had run its course. Feelings were even more marked among younger Republicans, with 53 percent of those aged between 18 and 44 favouring ripping up the agreement entirely.</p><p>“Even before the war in Gaza, there was less support for Israel and greater sympathy for Palestinians among younger Americans, including young evangelical Christians,” Dov Waxman, professor of Israel studies at the University of California, told <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/spinning-genocide-why-is-israel-trying-to-reframe-its-war-on-gaza\">Al Jazeera</a> in October. “Israel’s behaviour during the war in Gaza has significantly accelerated the erosion of support for Israel among these key groups.”</p><p>But it is not just within Trump’s traditional base where his support for Israel is costing him. Polls also show it to be flagging in one of the most traditional pro-Israel branches of his base, evangelical Christians. In October, the Israeli government hired a newly formed PR company, Faith through Works, to, in its own <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/spinning-genocide-why-is-israel-trying-to-reframe-its-war-on-gaza\">words</a>, “combat low American Evangelical Christian approval of the Nation of Israel”.</p><p>Earlier this month, more than 1,000 US Christian pastors and influencers travelled to Israel, becoming “the largest group of American Christian leaders to visit Israel since its founding”.</p><p>Significantly, the trip was organised by American author Mike Evans, a close evangelical ally of Trump and reportedly a longstanding Netanyahu confidant.</p><p>And yet, as Gaza recedes from US headlines, the importance of Israel within US discourse may recede with it.</p><p>The forthcoming US elections will likely be influenced by a myriad of issues, including Israel, but most probably focused on the economy and other domestic concerns.</p><p>And if they are confronted with electoral losses ahead of the 2028 presidential election, Republicans – both supporters and opponents of Israel – may decide to put the issue to one side as they focus on confronting the Democrats.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

It specifically targeted individuals committing serious violations, and the European Council only recently extended these measures until January 2027.</p><p>In 2013, the European Council decided to place Syria under restrictive measures, including asset freezes and financial restrictions. These include member states being prohibited from entering into new commitments for grants, financial assistance or concessional loans to the Government of Syria.</p><p>These measures were put in place in protest against human rights violations committed under Bashar al-Assad’s regime, which was finally toppled in December last year. In 2014, the measures were expanded to include any individuals or entities which supported the regime and chemical weapons production.</p><p>After the overthrow of the government in December 2024, the EU suspended some of these measures to help support the political transition in Syria, but has maintained freezes on the Assad regime and the drugs trade.</p><h2 id=\"which-countries-have-the-uk-and-us-imposed-asset-freezes-on\">Which countries have the UK and US imposed asset freezes on?</h2><p>According to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), which tracks financial sanctions, the United Kingdom has frozen the UK-based assets of individuals and entities from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sanctions-regimes-under-the-sanctions-act\">22 countries</a>, with most being the same states sanctioned by the EU.</p><p>The United States typically freezes assets via the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List. According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which catalogues different levels of sanctions, the US has almost fully frozen the assets of the governments of four countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
