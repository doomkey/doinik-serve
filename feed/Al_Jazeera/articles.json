But for now, it has done all it can to make life more complicated for Palestinians,” Shawa said.</p><p>Oxfam humanitarian response adviser Chris McIntosh agreed, telling Al Jazeera that the people of Gaza were bracing for a “very tragic situation”.</p><p>“Persistent bureaucracy prevented us from bringing in adequate dwellings for people in Gaza,” McIntosh said. “The Israelis have not permitted tents to enter Gaza for many months. The only thing they’re allowing at this point is some tarpaulin, which isn’t going to do much for people who need proper shelter.”</p><p>He said Palestinians were being forced to live in “deplorable conditions”, with well more than 50 percent of the population living in tents.</p><p>He anticipated many would attempt to find dry ground inside bombed-out buildings that were at heightened risk of collapse amid the forecast heavy rains and winds.</p><h2 id=\"families-flee-flooding-risk\">Families flee flooding risk</h2><p>Farhan Haq, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, warned that vulnerable groups, including newborn children, are at particular risk from the incoming winter storm.</p><p>About 200 families were expected to arrive at a new displacement site in eastern Khan Younis in the south of the Strip, fleeing a heightened risk of flooding in their present location, he said.</p><p>“These households made the decision to move given the impact of the frequent rains and the risk of flooding,” he said.</p><p>Ismail al-Thawabta, director of Gaza’s Government Media Office, told Al Jazeera that about 288,000 Palestinian families were without shelter as Storm Byron bore down on the enclave, and issued a call to the international community to pressure Israel to allow in supplies to help respond to the storm.</p><p>“We are issuing an urgent appeal to the world, [United States] President Trump and the [United Nations] Security Council to pressure the Israeli occupation,” he said.</p><p>Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, condemned global inaction as families in Gaza braced for the storm.</p><p>“Palestinians in Gaza are literally left alone, freezing and starving in the winter storm,” she posted on X.</p><p>“I keep asking how we became such monsters, [i]ncapable of stopping this nightmare.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

At least <a href=\"/news/2025/8/1/another-us-citizen-killed-by-israeli-settler-attack-in-west-bank-family\">two US citizens</a> have been killed in settler attacks this year.</p><p>“When you are dealing with a group of people who continually call for the destruction of the State of Israel, who are OK with signs that say, ‘Jews may not enter these areas’, we want to be free of Jews, how do you make peace with that?” Fine asked Morton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, during the hearing.</p><p>“How do you create a long-term solution with that? Or is there another way that we have to go?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Klein – who previously used the slur “filthy Arab” and called for profiling Muslims in the US – said Islam needs to undergo a “reformation” and accept “Israel as a Jewish state”.</p><p>“Nobody wants to talk about it. They’re afraid of being called Islamophobic,” Klein said.</p><p>Fine interrupted, saying, “I’m not afraid of that.”</p><p>The Republican US congressman, who represents a district in the state of Florida, then doubled down on his volatile rhetoric.</p><p>“I don’t know how you make peace with those who seek your destruction. I think you destroy them first,” he said.</p><p>A United Nations convention defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, including killing, causing harm, preventing births, forcibly transferring children, and imposing life conditions to cause destruction”.</p><p>Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed nearly 70,400 Palestinians and turned nearly the entire territory into rubble, aimed to destroy the Palestinian people, leading rights groups and <a href=\"/news/2025/9/16/first-head-of-united-nations-body-declares-israels-gaza-war-a-genocide\">UN investigators</a> have said.</p><p>Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), slammed Fine, calling him “the Temu version of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/8/trump-to-host-netanyahu-at-white-house-on-december-29-israeli-government\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>,” referring to the discount online retailer and the Israeli prime minister.</p><p>“He’s hated by Republicans and Democrats for his policy of Israel first, Israel second, Israel third — Americans nowhere. He’s basically a foreign spokesperson at this point, and not even a good one,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“His unhinged, genocidal rhetoric shows his desperation as he tries to appease his bosses back in Tel Aviv.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Fine – who was elected to Congress earlier this year with the endorsements of Trump and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) – has made inflammatory statements about Palestinians.</p><p>In 2021, Fine commented on a social post with a photo of a dead Palestinian child asking him how he sleeps at night with: “Quite well, actually! Thanks for the pic!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Earlier this year, he wrote “starve away” in response to a report about the <a href=\"/news/2025/8/22/world-reacts-as-un-backed-body-declares-famine-in-gaza\">deadly hunger</a> in Gaza due to the Israeli blockade.</p><p>Last year, Fine lauded the killing of <a href=\"/news/2024/9/13/light-in-any-room-friends-hail-aysenur-eygi-us-citizen-killed-by-israel\">Aysenur Ezgi Eygi</a>, a US activist who was fatally shot by the Israeli military in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>“Throw rocks, get shot. One less #MuslimTerror ist. #FireAway,” Fine wrote in a social media post.</p><p>He has also previously argued that fear of Muslims is warranted. “While many Muslims are not terrorists, they are the radicals, not the mainstream,” he wrote in a post on X in 2023. “Now is the time to speak truth, not bathe in political correctness that will kill us.”</p><p>Despite such comments, Fine – who refers to himself as the Hebrew Hammer – has been a regular guest on some mainstream media outlets, including CNN.</p><p>Hatem Abudayyeh, national chair of the US Palestinian Community Network (USPCN), called out Republicans in Congress and Trump for failing to denounce Fine.</p><p>“It’s one thing to read disgusting, racist, anti-Palestinian, anti-Black, and xenophobic vile on social media 24-7, but we’re not supposed to hear it from actual elected officials in this country,” Abudayyeh told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is what the Trump era has brought to the political arena: hateful speech from hateful people like Randy Fine, a sickening Zionist apologist for genocide who is allowed to <a href=\"/news/2025/7/26/horrors-upon-horrors-how-us-congress-responded-to-mass-hunger-in-gaza\">spew his racism</a> without condemnation from the rest of his party or his president.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump confirmed the news shortly after.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“We’ve just seized a tanker off the coast of Venezuela – large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually,” Trump said during an event at the White House. “And other things are happening. So you’ll be seeing that later, and you’ll be talking about that later with some other people.”</p><p>At a roundtable with business leaders, when faced with questions about the tanker, Trump encouraged reporters to “follow the tanker”. He also declined to identify the vessel’s owner.</p><p>“You’re going to get that information later,” he said, adding later: “I assume we’re going to keep the oil.”</p><p>The Trump administration has ramped up threats against Venezuela, deploying considerable military forces to the Caribbean region. That includes the deployment of the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and its strike group to the southern Caribbean.</p><p>Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post that the seizure had been carried out with coordination between the Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security in addition to the Coast Guard.</p><p>She said that the tanker was used to transport “sanctioned oil from Venezuela to Iran” and that it had been under sanctions for several years. Her social media post includes a video showing armed figures lowering themselves onto the vessel from a helicopter.</p><p>Under Trump, the US has also carried out a campaign of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/9/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-legal-basis-for-trumps-caribbean-boat-strikes\">lethal strikes</a> against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, with the Trump administration identifying Venezuela as the origin point for some of the vessels. At least 22 boats have been attacked, and an estimated 87 people have been killed.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to continue the bombing campaign by pursuing strikes on land as well.</p><p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has said that the US is seeking to topple his government.</p><p>He has responded with his own military buildup along Venezuela’s coast and indicated his country’s armed forces <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/the-homeland-is-the-homeland-venezuelans-brace-for-possible-us-attack\">would resist</a> a military attack from the US.</p><p>Oil exports are a key source of revenue for the South American country, which exported more than 900,000 barrels per day last month. Oil futures rose following the seizure.</p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Mike Hanna noted that information about the tanker seizure remains scarce.</p><p>“There aren’t many details about the seizure of this tanker, apart from the president’s confirmation,” said Hanna.</p><p>But, he added, the seizure is likely to escalate an already volatile situation in the Caribbean.</p><p>“This does mark a massive escalation in terms of US action against Venezuela. It has been reported that President Trump has been pondering for weeks now what kind of action to take in Venezuela and has been very clear that he is contemplating regime change,” he said.</p><p>But the US has taken action to seize high-value materials linked to Venezuela in the past. In February 2024, under then-President Joe Biden, the US <a href=\"/news/2024/2/13/us-takes-over-boeing-747-iran-had-sold-to-venezuela\">seized a cargo plane</a> Iran allegedly sold to Venezuela, claiming it violated sanctions on Tehran.</p><p>Then, a year later, the Trump administration seized a Dassault Falcon 2000EX jet linked to a state-run oil company in Venezuela, also claiming sanctions violations, this time against restrictions on the South American country.</p><p>The Maduro government denounced that seizure as “brazen theft”.</p><p>Trump also recently declared Venezuelan airspace closed to travel, prompting <a href=\"/news/2025/12/4/last-foreign-carriers-halt-flights-to-venezuela-after-trumps-airspace-ban\">foreign airlines to pause their flights</a> to the country.</p><p>Trump’s rivalry with Maduro stretches back to the Republican leader’s first term in office, when he imposed a campaign of “maximum pressure” on Venezuela.</p><p>The latest spike in tensions, however, has been met with domestic and international condemnation.</p><p>Just this month, two United Nations experts issued a joint statement expressing “deep concern about mounting pressure from the United States on Venezuela”.</p><p>Polls in the US also show disapproval over the escalating tensions. A November poll from The Economist and YouGov found that only 17 percent of US adults support using military force to overthrow the Venezuelan government, with 45 percent opposed.</p><p>And on Wednesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that 48 percent of respondents expressed opposition to the administration’s targeting of alleged drug vessels, widely considered illegal under international law.</p><p>About 45 percent, meanwhile, said that they generally supported using force near Venezuela to stem the flow of drugs, with 36 percent expressing opposition.</p><p>While Trump indicated earlier this month he had been in contact with Maduro, he told reporters on Wednesday that he has not spoken to the Venezuelan leader since then.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And this has huge implications, pushing back the earliest fire-making,” said archaeologist Nick Ashton, curator of Palaeolithic Collections at the British Museum in London.</p><p>While there are even older signs of humans using naturally occurring wildfires in Africa, this is the earliest proof that people knew how to start their own fires.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Fire was a crucial turning point in human evolution. Controlled flames allowed ancient hunter-gatherers to live in colder environments, cook food, and protect themselves from predators. Cooking also helped our ancestors get more energy from meat, roots and tubers, fuelling the growth of larger brains and enabling communities to support more people.</p><p>Scientists say fire likely transformed social life as well. It brought people together at night to share warmth, food and conversation, possibly encouraging storytelling, language and cultural beliefs.</p><p>“The campfire becomes a social hub,” British Museum archaeologist and study co-author Rob Davis said. “We’re a species who have used fire to really shape the world around us – and now we know this is something Neanderthals were doing far earlier than we thought, just like us.”</p><p>The evidence at Barnham suggests repeated fire use at temperatures above 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 degrees Fahrenheit), pointing to deliberate fire-starting rather than reliance on natural flames. The team spent four years testing the materials to confirm the hearth’s age and human origin.</p><p>The finding supports the view that Neanderthals, and possibly their close relatives such as the Denisovans, were far more innovative than once assumed, sharing key survival skills long before the emergence of modern-day humans.</p></div></div></body></html>"

More recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated,” the central bank said in a statement.</p><p>The cut was widely expected, with an 89 percent probability of a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch, a tracker that monitors the likelihood of monetary policy decisions.</p><p>The <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/29/us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-as-labour-market-weakens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decision came</a> as the central bank faced gaps in many sets of government data used to assess the state of the US economy. During the record-long 43-day government shutdown, key agencies, including the Department of Labor, were unable to gather information needed for their reports.</p><p>Among them were import and export prices, the producer price index report, as well state employment and unemployment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday said that it would not release numbers from October because the agency did not have enough resources to collect information.</p><p>The last top-line data that the central bank had to make its interest rate decision was from September. At the time, the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.4 percent, and the core inflation rose to 2.8 percent.</p><p>“The labour market has continued to cool gradually… a touch more gradually than we thought,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the rate cut decision.</p><p>A new government report on Wednesday showed US labour costs increased 0.8 percent in the third quarter, slightly less than expected.</p><p>The central bank might be more cautious about interest rate cuts in the next year as economic data shows a cooling labour market.</p><p>“There is considerable uncertainty around the labour market, but some of the weights should begin to lift early next year,” Ryan Sweet, managing director, US Macro Forecasting and Analysis at Oxford Economics, said in a report published ahead of the central bank’s decision.</p><p>“The challenge facing the Fed next year is the potential jobless expansion, when GDP increases but employment gains are modest, at best. This leaves the economy vulnerable to shocks because the labour market is the main firewall against a recession.”</p><h2 id=\"political-turmoil\">Political turmoil</h2><p>While the Fed has maintained its independence from partisan interference, there has been increased pressure from US President Donald Trump to cut rates further, and he has often used hostile rhetoric towards the Fed chair to do it. The first rate cut in Trump’s second term as president came only in <a href=\"/economy/2025/9/17/us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-for-the-first-time-since-december\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">September</a>.</p><p>The White House has also installed loyalist Stephen Miran to the Fed board, where he is on leave from his job as an economic adviser in the White House. Miran has dissented against the 25 basis point rate cut that was undertaken at each of the two meetings he has attended in favour of larger half-percentage-point cuts.</p><p>On Wednesday, Miran, again, voted for a more aggressive cut of half a percentage point while governors Austan D Goolsbee and Jeffrey R Schmid voted not to make a rate cut at all. The other governors all voted for a 25 basis point cut.</p><p>“Still-elevated inflation and a backlog of economic data complicate the picture for the Fed looking into next year — with President Trump’s aggressive push for lower short-term rates potentially complicating the objective of bringing down longer-term borrowing costs,” Daniel Hornung, policy fellow at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, said in remarks provided to Al Jazeera.</p><p>Fed Chair Powell’s term is up in mid-May 2026. Trump, in an interview published on Tuesday in news outlet Politico, said support for immediately cutting interest rates would be a requirement for anyone he chose to lead the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Wednesday’s decision was underscored by an upcoming Supreme Court decision that would either allow Trump to fire <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/17/us-fed-governor-cook-offers-detailed-defence-in-mortgage-fraud-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fed Governor Lisa Cook</a> or not after she was accused of mortgage fraud.

An additional $1bn has been earmarked for farmers who grow some speciality crops not covered by this. The aid money is expected to be made available by the end of February.</p><p>The package is Trump’s latest effort to defend his economic record and respond to public anxiety about rising food costs. It also comes after China curbed its purchases of US soya beans in retaliation for steep US trade tariffs, which have also caused the cost of fertiliser and other agricultural products to soar.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-will-this-aid-be-distributed-to-farmers\">How will this aid be distributed to farmers?</h2><p data-start=\"1678\" data-end=\"2034\">The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will calculate per-acre payments for different crops using a formula that estimates production costs. Payments will be capped at $155,000 per farm or individual, and only farms earning less than $900,000 annually will qualify.</p><p>The USDA’s formula is designed to bolster small-scale producers who may be struggling more than others. “We looked at how they were hurt, to what extent they were hurt,” Trump said.</p><p>Farmers will begin receiving funds on February 28, according to Rollins. Meanwhile, applications for funds will open in the coming weeks so that farmers “will know exactly what that number looks like”.</p><p>Trump said the money for the scheme will come from tariff revenues.</p><p>Though Trump has, at times, downplayed cost-of-living issues, he visited Pennsylvania on Tuesday to explain to voters how his administration is addressing this concern.</p><p>At the same time, he defended his record on trade and the sweeping reciprocal tariffs he has imposed on countries around the world this year. “It’s amazing,” Trump said of tariffs at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. “It’s the smart people who understand it. Other people are starting to learn, but the smart people really understand it.”</p><h2 id=\"why-is-this-aid-package-being-introduced-now\">Why is this aid package being introduced now?</h2><p>Many farmers continue to support Trump. The country’s most farming-dependent counties overwhelmingly backed him in last year’s presidential election by an average of 77.7 percent, according to the USDA.</p><p>Experts say his anti-establishment rhetoric has resonated with rural communities that feel overlooked by political elites in Washington, DC. His promises of deregulation also appealed to many farmers who feel frustrated by federal rules they view as burdensome.</p><p>But the president’s trade agenda and the imposition of trade tariffs to address the country’s trading deficit with many other countries have hit farmers hard. Trump’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\">“liberation day”</a> tariff announcement earlier this year provoked steep retaliatory duties on US products, particularly from China, including on US agricultural exports.</p><p>Trump’s latest package is an echo of a $12bn programme he offered to farmers in 2018 during his first-term administration’s initial trade dispute with China.</p><h2 id=\"which-crops-have-been-hardest-hit-by-trade-tariffs\">Which crops have been hardest hit by trade tariffs?</h2><p>Soya bean farmers have been badly bruised by the US-China trade spat this year. Trump was the principal architect of recent tensions – his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, <a href=\"/economy/2025/4/3/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-liberation-day-reciprocal-tariffs\">launched earlier this year</a>, targeted China more than any other country.</p><p>Historically, more than half of all soya beans produced in the US – mainly in the Midwest – have been sold to China. But after Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing raised duties on US soya beans to 34 percent.</p><p>Last year, China bought slightly more than 50 percent (27 million metric tons) of the $24.5bn of produce that US soya bean farmers sold to international markets. This year, US exports to China have so far fallen by more than half.</p><p>Instead, China has begun buying more soya beans from Brazil and other South American nations.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The American Soybean Association has also warned that tariffs are driving up costs for soya bean producers. In particular, US tariffs on Moroccan fertiliser, which have been hiked from 2.1 percent to 16.8 percent, have squeezed farmers.</p><p>In October, following a <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/10/29/trump-xi-meeting-live-china-and-us-to-negotiate-rare-earths-tariffs\">meeting</a> with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said Beijing had committed to buying 12 million metric tons of US soya beans by the end of this year, and 25 million metric tons annually for the next three years.</p><p>Trump is also facing pressure to address rising beef prices. On November 7, he asked the Department of Justice to investigate foreign-owned meatpackers in the US, which he claims are driving up costs, though he has provided no supporting evidence for this.</p><p>Then, on November 20, Trump announced he would <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/trump-and-lula-hold-phone-call-to-discuss-us-tariffs-on-brazil-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">peel back trade tariffs</a> of up to 50 percent on certain Brazilian agricultural products, including coffee and beef. The reversal was broadly interpreted as an acknowledgement that the tariffs were fuelling inflationary pressures at home.</p><p>More broadly, US consumer sentiment remains near record lows. In November, data released by the University of Michigan showed that Americans view their personal finances as the weakest they’ve been since 2009.

Admonishing Volodymyr Zelenskyy for failing to hold a presidential election, he accused him of not ending the war with Russia as an excuse to cling to power.</p><p>“They talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it’s not a democracy any more,” Trump told Politico, referring to the presidency of Zelenskyy who was elected in April 2019 with more than 70 percent of the vote, but whose five-year term would, under normal circumstances, have expired in 2024.</p><p>There is a reason he’s still there, though. The Ukrainian constitution bans wartime elections, and Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion will enter its fifth year in February 2026.</p><p>Hours after Trump’s remarks, Zelenskyy responded, saying he was “ready” to hold an election – as long as Washington and, perhaps, Brussels could ensure its security.</p><p>“I’m asking – and now declaring it openly – the United States to help me, maybe along with European colleagues, to provide security for holding the vote,” Zelenskyy said. “I have the will and readiness for that.”</p><p>So why is Trump raising this issue now, and would it even be possible to hold an election during a war?</p><h2 id=\"is-trump-repeating-russian-talking-points\">Is Trump repeating Russian talking points?</h2><p>Trump is indeed “playing along” with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Putin and his ministers have long called Zelenskyy “illegitimate” and dubbed his government a “neo-Nazi junta” that allegedly pits average Ukrainians against the “brotherly” Russian nation.</p><p>Last month, Trump unveiled a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work\">28-point peace plan</a> for Ukraine with short and vague clauses which offer few security guarantees for Kyiv and are widely seen as a Moscow wish list. Crucially, the plan would involve Ukraine ceding land already lost to Russia during the war, a line that Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he will not cross.</p><p>“Trump doesn’t care what’s going to happen to Ukraine and Ukrainians, what’s more important to him is that the war is settled somehow, and he can show his leadership and response to Ukraine and to Europeans,” Romanenko said.</p><p>Civilian observers <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/trump-wants-us-to-capitulate-to-russia-ukrainians-aghast-at-peace-plan\">agree</a>.</p><p>“The Kremlin offered an ultimatum via Trump, and Ukraine refused,” Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevych told Al Jazeera.</p><p>And now, observers say, Trump is seeking to settle Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War II before his upcoming summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>“Otherwise Trump will have to consult Xi, and that contradicts his conception of America First and Make America Great Again,” Tyshkevych said.</p><p>That’s why the upcoming two months will be “very complicated” for Ukraine as Washington is likely to frantically push for a peace deal, he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4161889\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4161889\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4161889\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1765274027.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1765274027\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4161889\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-are-the-hurdles-an-election-would-face\">What are the hurdles an election would face?</h2><p>Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that Trump’s suggestion of him clinging to the presidency were “frankly, completely unreasonable”. He added that he would ask his Public Servant party, which dominates the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s lower house of parliament, to draft a law to allow voting during martial law.</p><p>However, practically, it could be extremely difficult to hold an election in Ukraine now.</p><p>In February, Zelenskyy and his officials also responded to Trump’s demands that they hold a presidential vote. They insisted it couldn’t be held while Moscow <a href=\"/tag/ukraine-russia-crisis/\">pummelled Ukrainian cities</a> with drones and missiles and occupied almost one-fifth of Ukraine.</p><p>Ukrainian nationals in occupied areas are subject to abduction, torture and even death for taking an anti-Russian stance and, therefore, could not possibly take part in any vote.</p><p>An election would likely be a logistical nightmare as millions of Ukrainians have been displaced or fled to Europe or other nations where embassies and consulates would not be able to handle the volume of voters.</p><p>The hours-long blackouts all over Ukraine, which follow Moscow’s pinpointed, repeated strikes on Ukrainian power generation and transmission infrastructure, would make an election even more difficult to hold.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4165109\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4165109\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4165109\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-09T164718Z_549838239_RC23DIAF625K_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-BLACKOUT-KYIV-1765379466.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C536&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kyiv blackout\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4165109\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A delivery courier uses his bike light to illuminate during a power blackout after critical civil infrastructure was hit by recent Russian missile and drone attacks in Kyiv, Ukraine, on December 9, 2025 [Gleb Garanich/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-would-ensure-voters-safety\">Who would ensure voters’ safety?</h2><p>Only Washington’s full commitment to interfere militarily if Russia were to violate a ceasefire could guarantee security, analyst Tyshkevych said.</p><p>But that’s a step that Washington has not taken and is not likely to take now, he added. “I barely imagine security guarantees that will ensure the security of the election without ending the war.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4165114\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4165114\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4165114\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-06T104108Z_562327897_RC2YAIAUJPRN_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-KYIV-REGION-1765379554.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Ukraine\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4165114\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A family looks at their home that was damaged during a night of Russian missile and drone strikes in Novi Petrivtsi, outside Kyiv, Ukraine, on December 6, 2025 [Thomas Peter/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-soon-could-an-election-be-held\">How soon could an election be held?</h2><p>Even if Kyiv begins preparations for a vote, it likely could not be held much earlier than March 2026.</p><p>The Verkhovna Rada will take several weeks to draft, submit and vote in a law allowing the election. Election authorities would then take several more weeks to approve all candidates and allow them to campaign. All earlier timelines are “fantasy,” Tyshkevych said.</p><h2 id=\"would-soldiers-be-able-to-vote\">Would soldiers be able to vote?</h2><p>Kyiv did hold presidential and parliamentary elections after 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and backed a separatist uprising in the southeastern Donbas region.</p><p>But the hostilities were limited to Donbas and were labelled “an anti-terrorism operation” that did not require martial law to be imposed on Ukraine.</p><p>Servicemen were able vote – but most did not insist on participating, Lieutenant General Romanenko said.</p><p>This time, securing the vote of hundreds of thousands of servicemen would be near-impossible without a stable, months-long ceasefire, he added.</p><p>A truce would have to guarantee every serviceman’s chance to cast a ballot – or risk triggering an uproar among them. “They will demand full participation,” Romanenko said.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-ukrainians-say-about-holding-an-election\">What do Ukrainians say about holding an election?</h2><p>Most Ukrainians are opposed to holding an election without a stable peace settlement in place.</p><p>In September, 63 percent of those surveyed opposed holding a vote even immediately after a ceasefire, according to a survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.</p><p>Only 22 percent believed elections could be held in the wake of a ceasefire with security guarantees, the poll said.</p><p>“Now is not the time,” Mykola Chernenko, a 29-year-old sales manager at an electronics store in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “We have to focus on ending the war, and will sort all the politics out later,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"would-zelenskyy-be-re-elected\">Would Zelenskyy be re-elected?</h2><p>Zelenskyy’s approval ratings soared above 80 percent in the immediate aftermath of the full-scale invasion by Russia in 2022.</p><p>However, his popularity has diminished since. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, a burly, taciturn top commander and four-star general whom Zelenskyy fired in early 2024 is Ukraine’s most popular politician these days.</p><p>Some 73 percent of Ukrainians polled in July said they trust Zaluzhny, according to the Rating Sociological Group, <a href=\"https://english.nv.ua/nation/zaluzhnyi-tops-ukraine-s-trust-ratings-in-july-2025-new-poll-shows-50528376.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a Kyiv pollster</a>.</p><p>Zaluzhny, who now serves as ambassador to the United Kingdom, has largely refrained from making any public remarks on the matter.</p><p>The same poll found that Zelenskyy is trusted by 65 percent of Ukrainians, while 29 percent said they “distrust” him.</p><p>A <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/could-ukraines-corruption-crisis-lead-to-military-defeat-against-russia\">scandal</a>, which unfolded last month over the alleged involvement of Zelenskyy’s close allies in a corruption scheme linked to nuclear power generation, is likely to dampen his popularity further in the energy-starved nation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"are-elections-allowed-in-other-countries-during-war\">Are elections allowed in other countries during war?</h2><p>Two years after the full-scale invasion, Russia held a presidential election – even though hostilities were raging in four partly-occupied Ukrainian regions, which Moscow declared part of its territory in September 2022.</p><p>Many Ukrainians in occupied areas were <a href=\"/news/2024/3/16/at-gunpoint-ukrainians-in-occupied-regions-back-putin-in-russias-election\">forced to cast their ballots</a> under duress, and Putin predictably won with 88 percent of the vote.</p><p>But Moscow never openly declared martial law and stubbornly dubs its invasion of Ukraine “a special military operation”. Anyone who calls it a “war” faces fines, arrest or Kremlin-orchestrated trials.</p><p>Other ex-Soviet nations have held presidential elections during ongoing, yet frozen, armed conflicts – notably, Armenia and Azerbaijan, whose conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988 and ended in 2023.</p><p>Iraq and Afghanistan also held presidential and parliamentary elections during active domestic conflicts.</p></div></div></body></html>"
