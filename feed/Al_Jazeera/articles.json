The drone attack also damaged energy infrastructure, the emergency service added in a post on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Ukraine’s General Staff said that, according to preliminary reports, Ukrainian forces hit an oil refinery in Ukhta in Russia’s Komi Republic, about 1,750km (1,087 miles) from the border with Ukraine, causing a fire to break out.</li>\n<li>A Russian attack last month on the Ukrainian branch of ⁠the Soviet-built Druzhba oil pipeline halted the transit of Russian oil to eastern Europe, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said. Despite its war with ⁠Russia, Ukraine continues to transport Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary even though it stopped the transit of Russian gas last year.</li>\n<li>Ukraine said the bodies of two Nigerians fighting for Russia have been found in the east of the country. Hamzat Kazeem Kolawole and Mbah Stephen Udoka both served in the 423rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, according to a statement by Ukrainian intelligence.</li>\n</ul><h3>Military aid</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukraine’s allies have pledged about $35bn in military aid to Kyiv this year, British Defence Minister John Healey said. The figure includes new commitments by individual countries, but also previous promises of weapons made by Ukraine’s allies, including the 11.5 billion euros ($13.6bn) already announced by Germany, a diplomat told the Reuters news agency.</li>\n<li>German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said his country was ready to deliver five new PAC-3 interceptors for Ukraine’s air defence, provided Ukraine’s other allies deliver at least 30 more of their own.</li>\n<li>Norway announced it was buying a “large volume” of French glide bombs as part of a bilateral agreement to support Ukraine militarily against Russia’s invasion.</li>\n<li>The United Kingdom announced it will “urgently provide” air defence missiles and systems worth more than 500 million British pounds ($681m) “to protect Ukraine from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s brutal attacks on energy sites and homes”.</li>\n<li>US military aid to Ukraine fell by 99 percent in 2025 compared with 2024, according to a report from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a think tank based in Germany. “European military aid rose by 67 percent above the 2022–2024 average” in 2025, the Kiel report found.</li>\n</ul><h3>Peace talks</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that another round of talks on ending the war in Ukraine was expected “soon” but gave no further details.</li>\n<li>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Sybiha said that Russia’s more recent overnight attacks on Ukraine further undermined efforts to end the war through dialogue. “Each such strike is a blow to peace efforts aimed at ending the war. Russia must be forced to take diplomacy seriously and de-escalate,” Sybiha wrote on X.</li>\n</ul><h3>Regional security</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Estonia is to buy 12 more Caesar self-propelled howitzer artillery pieces from France to strengthen its defence capabilities.</li>\n<li>European Union leaders broadly agreed Thursday on a plan to restructure the 27-nation bloc’s economy to make it more competitive as they face antagonism from US President Donald Trump, strong-arm tactics from China and hybrid threats blamed on Russia.</li>\n<li>Ukraine will begin exporting weapons, including drones, in the coming weeks, Ukrainian Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said in a news conference, according to Ukraine’s Ukrinform news agency.</li>\n</ul><h3>Energy</h3><ul>\n<li>Power plants in Ukraine that have been damaged by Russian missile and drone attacks continue to produce far too little electricity to supply the country’s citizens, Ukraine’s Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal told a parliamentary energy committee.</li>\n</ul><h3>Politics and diplomacy</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>French President Emmanuel Macron said there was no rush to open dialogue with Russian leader Putin, stressing the need for Europeans to fine-tune their objectives. Macron raised the prospect of reviving dialogue with Putin in an interview published on Tuesday by several newspapers.</li>\n<li>Six more Russian and Ukrainian children are being reunited with ⁠their families, Washington and Moscow said. One child would return to Russia, and five children would be reunited with their families in ‌Ukraine, Russia’s presidential commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, said in a post on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Ukraine has accused Russia of abducting thousands of children, and the International Criminal Court has called for the arrest of President <a href=\"/news/2023/3/17/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-russias-putin-over-ukraine-crimes\">Putin and Lvova-Belova</a> on suspicion of unlawful deportation of children.</li>\n<li>⁠US Secretary of State Marco Rubio ⁠said he would have a chance to ‌meet Zelenskyy at this week’s Munich Security Conference.</li>\n</ul><h3>Sport</h3><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Ukrainian athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych has lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after he was barred from competing in the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics. The skeleton racer was banned over a dispute concerning a helmet he wanted to wear in the event to honour Ukrainian athletes killed in the war with Russia.</li>\n<li>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in a statement: “[The decision] was taken by the jury of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) based on the fact that the helmet he intended to wear was not compliant with the rules.”</li>\n<li>Zelenskyy reacted to the decision, accusing the IOC of playing “into the hands of aggressors” as Ukraine’s Sport Minister Matviy Bidnyi said Ukraine would go through legal channels to reverse the decision.</li>\n<li>“We are proud of Vladyslav and of what he did. Having courage is worth more than any medal,” Zelenskyy said.</li>\n</ul></div></div></body></html>"

The section also highlights Trump’s recent push to end conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan.</p><p>But the document also alludes to a wider vision for US-Africa ties, shifting from a “foreign aid paradigm to an investment and growth paradigm”.</p><p>That approach would be fuelled by new bilateral relationships with countries “committed to opening their markets to US goods and services”. In turn, the US envisions boosting development efforts on the continent, particularly when it comes to accessing strategic energy and rare earth mineral resources.</p><p>However, that paradigm shift — away from foreign aid — has had a disproportionate effect on Africa and is likely to be a topic of conversation at Friday’s summit.</p><p>An estimated 26 percent of the continent’s foreign aid came from the US. As of 2024, the country’s direct foreign investment in Africa was estimated at <a href=\"https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?ReqID=2&amp;step=1&amp;_gl=1*1awx5r9*_ga*NTM4MTU5NTkzLjE3NzA5MzAxMjM.*_ga_J4698JNNFT*czE3NzA5MzAxMjMkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzA5MzAxMzEkajUyJGwwJGgw#eyJhcHBpZCI6Miwic3RlcHMiOlsxLDIsMyw0LDUsNywxMF0sImRhdGEiOltbIlN0ZXAxUHJvbXB0MSIsIjEiXSxbIlN0ZXAxUHJvbXB0MiIsIjEiXSxbIlN0ZXAyUHJvbXB0MyIsIjEiXSxbIlN0ZXAzUHJvbXB0NCIsIjMwIl0sWyJTdGVwNFByb21wdDUiLCIxIl0sWyJTdGVwNVByb21wdDYiLCIxIl0sWyJTdGVwN1Byb21wdDgiLFsiNzEiXV0sWyJTdGVwOFByb21wdDlBIixbIjEiXV0sWyJTdGVwOFByb21wdDEwQSIsWyIxIl1dXX0=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$47.47bn</a>, much of it coming through the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p><p>But Trump has since dismantled USAID, as well as cancelled billions of dollars in aid programmes. Those moves have been accompanied by a wider US retreat from the United Nations. Experts say the repercussions have already been felt on the ground in Africa.</p><p>“We have experienced the end of USAID, and that has had huge, detrimental negative impacts — at least in the short run — on global health, particularly on health funding for African countries,” Belinda Archibong, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Center for Global Development has assessed that the current US foreign aid cuts could lead to 500,000 to 1,000,000 deaths annually.</p><p>In a December report, the organisation said the evidence of Trump’s aid cuts could be seen through increases in malnutrition mortality in northern Nigeria and Somalia, food insecurity in northeast Kenya and malaria deaths in northern Cameroon, among others.</p><p>Archibong also pointed to disruptions in HIV treatment and prevention across the continent, an area of concern for African Union members.</p><p>Trump’s funding freeze, for example, has caused service interruptions for programmes financed by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a US initiative credited with saving 25 million lives, primarily in Africa.</p><p>“So what does the health funding and health security globally look like in the aftermath of the US pulling back?” Archibong said. “That is going to be a very, very key point of discussion at the summit.”</p><p>With USAID scuttled, the Trump administration has pursued at least 16 preliminary <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/us-and-ivory-coast-sign-480m-deal-as-part-of-america-first-aid-strategy\">bilateral agreements</a> on public health aid, including with Ethiopia, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Kenya. It has dubbed its new aid model the “America First global health strategy”.</p><p>Critics, though, have raised concerns about such deals being tainted by “transactional pressures”, creating the potential for corruption and questions about their long-term sustainability.</p><h2 id=\"strategic-ambiguity\">‘Strategic ambiguity?’</h2><p id=\"professor-everisto-benyera\">For Everisto Benyera, a politics professor at the University of South Africa in Pretoria, Trump is likely to be the “proverbial elephant in the room” during the African Union’s two-day summit.</p><p>“This summit will be aware of his presence in his absence,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Trump’s tariff policies have also had a wide impact on the continent. In April, 20 countries were hit with custom tariffs ranging from 11 percent to 50 percent, and another 29 countries faced a baseline tariff of 10 percent.</p><p>Experts say the nature of the tariffs adds to the air of uncertainty before this year’s summit.</p><p>The heightened, individualised tariffs disproportionately affect countries with specialised export industries that rely, in part, on protectionist trade policies to keep their economies afloat.</p><p>For instance, the kingdom of Lesotho, a nation of about 2 million, landlocked by South Africa, initially faced a staggering 50 percent tariff rate, risking <a href=\"/news/2025/4/3/trump-imposes-50-tariff-on-africas-lesotho-the-highest-among-nations\">ravages</a> to its garment industry. Meanwhile, Madagascar, known for its vanilla exports, was slammed with an initial 47 percent tariff rate.</p><p>The rates for both Lesotho and Madagascar were later dropped to 15 percent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Some reprieve has been offered by Trump’s decision this month to temporarily extend the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a trade agreement dating back to 2000.</p><p>It allows eligible countries to export 1,800 products — including fossil fuels, car parts, textiles and agricultural products — to the US duty-free. However, the extension only stretches through the end of 2026.</p><p>Adding to the tensions is Trump’s decision to stop processing immigration visas for 75 countries, including 26 in Africa. That accounts for nearly half of the African Union’s members.</p><p>Three African countries have launched reciprocal policies, <a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/why-are-some-african-countries-banning-us-citizens-from-entry\">banning</a> travel for US citizens.</p><p>Still, Benyera predicted most leaders at this week’s summit would strive to maintain “strategic ambiguity”, with an eye towards arranging future agreements.</p><p>“The African Union will, therefore, not want to make policy pronunciations that contradict Trump,” he said.</p><p>“They will aim to strike a strategic balance between appeasing Trump, reassuring [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, and maintaining relations with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping.”</p><h2 id=\"normative-actor\">‘Normative actor’</h2><p>Lopes, meanwhile, predicted that the summit will include “subtle but pointed language emphasising international law, multilateralism and consistency”.</p><p>He pointed out that several African states have taken “vocal stances” on “global flashpoints”, including Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza — which the US supports — and the recent US military action in Venezuela.</p><p>The governments of South Africa, Namibia and Ghana, for instance, have led condemnation of the US’s abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as a blatant violation of international law.</p><p>South Africa, meanwhile, has <a href=\"/news/2025/9/20/brazil-joins-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-at-icj\">spearheaded</a> a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).</p><p>“I do expect that theme of international justice to continue, not necessarily as open confrontation but as a reminder that Africa increasingly sees itself as a normative actor on the global stage,” Lopes said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>He explained that recent dealings between the US, South Africa and Nigeria have been “illustrative” of the tightrope walk many African Union members face in the Trump era.</p><p>In South Africa, Trump has pushed claims that white Afrikaner farmers have been persecuted in a “white genocide”, a position rejected by the government of Cyril Ramaphosa and several top Afrikaner officials.</p><p>But even after an extraordinary — and falsehood-laden — <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trumps-ramaphosa-ambush-key-takeaways-from-heated-white-house-meeting\">confrontation</a> at the Oval Office, Ramaphosa’s government has sought to forge new deals with the Trump administration, while also strengthening ties with its top trading partner, China.</p><p>Trump has also pushed dubious claims about Christian persecution in Nigeria. In December, the US struck an alleged ISIL (ISIS)-linked group in the country’s restive northeast, promising more bombings if armed actors “continue to kill Christians”.</p><p>Nigeria’s government has responded to the US attack carefully, characterising it as a “joint operation”, while rejecting the notion that religion was the root of the violence.</p><p>It has also used Trump’s interest in the region to boost security cooperation and intelligence sharing with the US, in an effort to counter the persistent insecurity in the country’s north.</p><p>“Both have experienced a more antagonistic tone from Washington. Yet, both have also leveraged that friction to diversify partnerships and assert strategic autonomy,” Lopes said.</p><p>“That reflects the broader balancing act under way across the continent.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

LOCK THEM UP?” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115582451169685243\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> in one post.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115582703277798715\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another</a>, he suggested a harsher punishment: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”</p><p>Shortly thereafter, the Defense Department announced it had <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/pentagon-says-it-is-investigating-us-senator-over-illegal-orders-video\">launched an investigation</a> into the video and Kelly specifically, given his role as a retired Navy captain.</p><p>Hegseth accused Kelly of using “his rank and service affiliation” to discredit the US armed forces, and he <a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/2008189258528665898\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">echoed</a> Trump’s claims that the video was “reckless and seditious”.</p><p>His decision to pen a formal letter of censure against Kelly prompted the senator to sue.</p><p>Such a letter serves as a procedural step towards lowering Kelly’s military rank at the time of his retirement, as well as curbing his post-military benefits.</p><p>But Kelly argued that such punishment would serve to dampen the rights of veterans to participate in political discourse – and would additionally hinder his work as a member of Congress.</p><h2 id=\"an-exclamation-filled-ruling\">An exclamation-filled ruling</h2><p>In Thursday’s <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365.37.0_2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruling</a>, Judge Leon determined that Kelly was likely to prevail on the merits of his case – and, citing the folk singer Bob Dylan, he added that it was easy to see why.</p><p>“This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,” Leon said in his often quippy ruling.</p><p>“After all, as Bob Dylan famously said, ‘You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.'”</p><p>Leon acknowledged that granting an injunction against the government is an “extraordinary remedy”. But he argued it was necessary, given the gravity of the case.</p><p>The judge conceded that the Defense Department does have the ability to restrict the speech of active-service military members, given the need for discipline among troops.</p><p>But the Trump administration argued in its court filings that those restrictions extended to retired military veterans as well.</p><p>Leon, however, dismissed that assertion with the verbal equivalent of a snort: “Horsefeathers!”</p><p>“Speech from retired servicemembers – even speech opining on the lawfulness of military<br>\noperations – does not threaten ‘obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de corps’ in the same way as speech from active-duty soldiers,” Leon wrote.</p><p>“Nor can speech from retired servicemembers ‘undermine the effectiveness of response to command’ as directly as speech from active-duty soldiers.”</p><p>Leon also acknowledged that Kelly’s role as a lawmaker in Congress compounded the harms from any attempts to curtail his free-speech rights.</p><p>“If legislators do not feel free to express their views and the views of their constituents without fear of reprisal by the Executive, our representative system of Government cannot function!” he wrote, in one of his many exclamatory statements.</p><p>The judge was also harshly critical of the Trump administration’s arguments that Kelly’s rank and retirement benefits were solely a military matter, not a judicial one.</p><p>Leon described Hegseth’s letter of censure as making Kelly’s punishment a “fait accompli” – a foregone conclusion – given that such a document cannot be appealed and could itself serve as the basis for a demotion.</p><p>“Here, the retaliation framework fits like a glove,” Leon said, appearing to validate the crux of Kelly’s lawsuit.</p><p>At another point, he rejected the government’s arguments by saying, “Put simply, Defendants’ response is anemic!”</p><p>The injunction he offered, though, is temporary and will last only until the lawsuit reaches a resolution.</p><h2 id=\"trump-administration-responds\">Trump administration responds</h2><p>In the wake of the injunction, Kelly took to social media to say the short-term victory was a win for all military veterans.</p><p>“Today a federal court made clear that Pete Hegseth violated the Constitution when he tried to punish me for something I said,” Kelly said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/senmarkkelly/status/2022008602194526370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> statement.</p><p>“But this case was never just about me. This administration was sending a message to millions of retired veterans that they, too, can be censured or demoted just for speaking out.”</p><p>He added that the US faces a “critical moment” in its history, warning of the erosion of fundamental rights.</p><p>Kelly then proceeded to accuse the Trump administration of “cracking down on our rights and trying to make examples of anybody they can”. He also acknowledged that the legal showdown had only just begun.</p><p>“I appreciate the judge’s careful consideration of this case,” Kelly said. “But I also know that this might not be over yet, because this president and this administration do not know how to admit when they’re wrong.”</p><p>Within a couple of hours of Kelly’s post, Hegseth himself shared a <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/2022035474337214836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">message</a> on social media, confirming that the Trump administration would forge ahead with contesting Thursday’s decision.</p><p>“This will be immediately appealed,” Hegseth said of the injunction. “Sedition is sedition, ‘Captain.'”</p><p>Kelly is considered a Democratic contender for the presidency in 2028.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The endangerment finding, he argued, is “one of the greatest scams in history”, adding that it “had no basis in fact” or law.</p><p>“On the contrary, over the generations, fossil fuels have saved millions of lives and lifted billions of people out of poverty all over the world,” Trump said at a White House ceremony on Thursday.</p><p>He hailed the repeal of the endangerment finding as “the single largest deregulatory action in American history, by far”.</p><p>EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, who also attended the ceremony, described the endangerment finding as “the Holy Grail of federal regulatory overreach”.</p><p>Rescinding the endangerment finding repeals all greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks. It could also unleash a broader unravelling of climate regulations on stationary sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities, experts say.</p><p>But Thursday’s new rule is likely to face pushback in the US court system.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Overturning the finding will “raise more havoc” than other actions Trump has taken to roll back environmental rules, environmental law professor Ann Carlson told The Associated Press news agency.</p><p>Environmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in US history against federal authority to address <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/climate-study-finds-overheating-world-will-add-57-superhot-days-a-year\">climate change</a>. Evidence backing up the endangerment finding has only grown stronger in the 17 years since it was approved, they said.</p><p>As part of Thursday’s decision, the EPA also announced it will end tax credits for automakers who install automatic start-stop ignition systems in their vehicles. The device is intended to reduce emissions, but Zeldin said “everyone hates” it.</p><p>Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticised his Democratic predecessors, saying that, in the name of tackling climate change, they were “willing to bankrupt the country”.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/trump-administration-moves-to-nix-key-finding-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">endangerment finding</a> “led to trillions of dollars in regulations that strangled entire sectors of the United States economy, including the American auto industry”, Zeldin said, criticising the leadership of Obama and former President Joe Biden in particular.</p><p>“The Obama and Biden administrations used it to steamroll into existence a left-wing wish list of costly climate policies, electric vehicle mandates and other requirements that assaulted consumer choice and affordability.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The endangerment finding had allowed for a series of regulations intended to protect against climate change and related threats.</p><p>They include deadly floods, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/16/why-is-europe-facing-record-breaking-heatwaves\">extreme heat waves</a>, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the US and around the world.</p><p>Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who served as the White House’s climate adviser in the Biden administration, called the Trump administration’s actions reckless.</p><p>“This EPA would rather spend its time in court working for the fossil fuel industry than protecting us from pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change,” she said.</p><p>EPA has a clear scientific and legal obligation to regulate greenhouse gases, McCarthy explained, adding that the health and environmental hazards of climate change have “become impossible to ignore”.</p><p>Thursday’s EPA action follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding.</p><p>Conservatives have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.</p><p>Democratic Senator <a href=\"/opinions/2023/3/25/we-need-a-fossil-fuel-phase-out-now\">Ed Markey</a> said that keeping the endangerment finding should have been a “no-brainer”.</p><p>“Trump and Zeldin are putting our lives and our future at risk,” he said in a video statement.</p><p>“They have rolled back protection after protection in a race to the bottom. Instead of ‘Let them eat cake,’ Zeldin is saying, ‘Let them breathe soot.'”</p></div></div></body></html>"

If it cannot, we will just have to see what the outcome will be.”</p><p>Last week, the US and Iran held their first round of indirect talks since last year in Oman.

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/iran-says-oman-mediated-talks-with-us-a-good-start\">told Al Jazeera</a> last week that the missile programme is a defence issue that is “never negotiable”.</p><p>Trump has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/trump-threatens-iran-with-something-very-tough-if-us-demands-are-not-met\">repeatedly warned</a> of renewed strikes against Iran should the negotiations fail.</p><p>Israel launched a military offensive against Iran in June of last year, killing the country’s top military officials, several nuclear scientists and hundreds of civilians.</p><p>Tehran responded by firing hundreds of missiles at Israel, dozens of which penetrated the country’s air defences.</p><p>The US joined the Israeli campaign and bombed three of Iran’s nuclear facilities before a ceasefire was reached.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has said that the US attack “obliterated” the Iranian nuclear programme.</p><p>But it is not clear what happened to Iran’s stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.</p><p>Tehran has been coy about the effects of the US strikes, but it has insisted on its right to enrich uranium, which it says does not violate its commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).</p><p>During Netanyahu’s previous visit to the US, in December, Trump warned Iran against rebuilding its nuclear or missile programmes.</p><p>“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/trump-says-us-would-back-strikes-against-irans-missile-programme/news/2025/12/29/trump-says-us-would-back-strikes-against-irans-missile-programme\">Trump told reporters</a> at that time. “We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But, hopefully, that’s not happening.”</p><p>Days later, antigovernment protests broke out in Iran. The US president backed the demonstrators and urged them to take over government institutions, <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2026/1/14/trump-says-help-is-on-the-way-for-iran-protesters\">telling them</a> that “help is on the way”.</p><p>But the Iranian government managed to quickly subdue the protest movement, which it said included a US-backed plot to violently attack civil institutions and government agents, with an intense security crackdown.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the US smuggled approximately 6,000 Starlink satellite-internet kits into Iran after the Iranian government <a href=\"/news/2026/1/3/internet-disruption-several-arrests-made-as-iran-protests-continue\">cut off the internet</a> to help stem the protests last month.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in the aftermath of Maduro’s abduction, Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/trump-says-no-more-venezuelan-oil-or-money-to-go-to-cuba-and-demands-deal\">announced</a> that much of the economic exchange between the two countries would cease.</p><p>“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela.

They’re not getting any of it.”</p><p>Trump has repeatedly pushed Cuba to “make a deal” to resolve the impasse, though it is unclear what such an agreement would include.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threat-of-tariffs\">Threat of tariffs</h2><p>But when weeks passed without a negotiated solution, the Trump administration upped the ante. On January 29, it <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">declared</a> the situation in Cuba a “national emergency” for the US.</p><p>It <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> the government in Havana of being an “extraordinary threat” and supporting “hostile actors, terrorism, and regional instability that endanger American security and foreign policy”.</p><p>Paired with this emergency declaration was the announcement that the US would impose tariffs on countries that supply oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly.</p><p>That put Mexico on the defensive. Mexico, like Venezuela, was among the regional trading partners that supplied Cuba with oil.</p><p>But it is also one of the top trading partners for the US. As many as 80 percent of Mexico’s exports go to its northern neighbour, and the two countries are currently part of a regional free-trade agreement.</p><p>Sheinbaum has nevertheless criticised Trump’s oil blockade against Cuba, calling the situation “unfair”.</p><p>Cuba has long suffered from economic instability, which its government blames on the US sanctions regime. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the island saw shortages of basic supplies, including fuel, sparking one of the island’s largest exoduses in recent history.</p><p>Still, the new Trump-era restrictions on fuel exports to Cuba have brought the island to the brink of a new humanitarian crisis.</p><p>In early February, Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the situation on the island had grown dire. Already, blackouts are a chronic problem.</p><p>“I can tell you that the secretary-general is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,” Dujarric said.</p><p>The US has also announced this month it will supply <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/mexico-promises-food-support-for-cuba-as-us-stifles-the-islands-fuel-supply\">$6m in humanitarian aid</a> to Cuba, though it said it would avoid disbursing the funds through the Cuban government by going through the Catholic Church instead.</p><p>As the two Mexican ships unloaded their humanitarian cargo on Thursday, locals told international news agencies they were grateful for the show of support.</p><p>Ediberto Rodriguez, a 65-year-old Havana resident, told the news outlet Reuters that the delivery was an “unforgettable gesture” from an ally.</p><p>“Mexico hasn’t abandoned us,” he said. “Even with pressure from a global superpower [the United States], they weren’t afraid.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But securing a foothold in the West Bank – which Smotrich and his settler movement believe they are biblically entitled to – was <a href=\"/news/2022/12/29/who-are-the-ministers-leading-israels-new-far-right-government\">among his demands</a> before agreeing to join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government in 2022.</p><p>Little known internationally before the genocidal war in Gaza began in 2023, Smotrich and his fellow far-right figure, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have become regular fixtures in headlines and government sanction lists around the world. Each has sought to fuel the Gaza war, threatening to collapse the coalition at the first sign of any change in intensity, and pressing on with an illegal campaign of settlement and occupation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It’s not that Smotrich is particularly charismatic, or that he’s being driven by his base,” Orly Noy, journalist and editor of the Israeli Hebrew-language magazine Local Call, told Al Jazeera. “It’s more that he’s incredibly ideological and he’s smart,” she said, explaining how, over the years, Smotrich had painstakingly worked to have the mechanisms of West Bank governance shifted from the military to his own, civil control.</p><p>“There shouldn’t be anything surprising in this,” Noy continued.</p><p>“In his early days as a political nonentity, he published what he called his ‘Decisive Plan’,” she said, outlining the strategy published by Smotrich in 2017 whereby Palestinians in the West Bank would be left with three essential options: to leave, to accept Israeli domination, or to face annihilation.</p><p>“People, even those on the right wing, laughed at that and dismissed it,” she said, pausing. “They really shouldn’t.”</p><h2 id=\"religious-zionist-upbringing\">Religious Zionist upbringing</h2><p>Bezalel Smotrich is, in every sense, a child of Israel’s settler movement, and one who draws ideological inspiration from Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, a key figure in shaping religious Zionism in the 20th century.</p><p>Unlike the better-known American rabbi <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/normalising-hate-israel-leans-in-to-anti-palestinian-violence-rhetoric\">Meir Kahane</a>, whose teachings have been invoked by figures including Ben-Gvir to justify violence, Kook’s ideas have underpinned what their adherents think of as a more high-minded form of ethnic supremacy and colonialism. This ideology casts Israel’s victory in the 1967 war as divinely mandated, but also adds a future Israeli settlement of Palestinian territory as the will of God.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4307361\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4307361\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4307361\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-1371429326-1770884136.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel/Palestine: Zvi Yehuda Kook (1891-1982), rabbi, leader of Religious Zionism and Rosh Yeshiva of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva.

Smotrich remained in the chamber through a shifting variety of right-wing alliances, briefly serving as transport minister for a year in 2019.</p><p>However, it wasn’t until 2022, after Netanyahu brokered a joint electoral slate between Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party and Ben-Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) bloc, that the two finally got access to real power.</p><h2 id=\"far-right-alliance\">Far-right alliance</h2><p>Both men have exploited their positions ruthlessly since, acting in concert to urge Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza on, irrespective of the political and international cost, while seeking to maximise the power of the government ministries under their control.</p><p>For Ben-Gvir, that has meant politicising the security force to such a degree that he now finds himself confronting Israel’s Supreme Court over it. Smotrich, for his part, has continued to channel millions to the settler movement, even as other ministries’ budgets have been cut, while settlements and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/22/mapping-1800-israeli-settler-attacks-in-the-occupied-west-bank-since-october-7\">settler violence</a> have increased.</p><p>Smotrich has also continued to expand his influence over both Palestinian and Jewish residents of the occupied West Bank.</p><p>He was appointed head of the Settlements Administration under his initial deal with Netanyahu, and by <a href=\"/news/2024/6/21/is-israels-smotrich-fulfilling-his-dream-of-annexing-the-west-bank\">June 2024</a>, as global attention focused on the war in Gaza, additional authority was transferred from the military to the Smotrich-headed body.</p><p>“They’re different,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said of Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who, too often, are lumped together. While both politicians rely on the fundamental idea of Jewish supremacy, Goldberg said, “Smotrich wants order. He has a vision for the future; Ben-Gvir isn’t interested in any of that. He’s about hate, racism and a keen desire to burn it all down”.</p><p>“The thing is, many Israelis feel the same way.”</p><p>Throughout, attacks on Palestinians by settlers have become <a href=\"/features/2026/1/22/if-you-sleep-settlers-will-burn-your-house-fear-in-the-west-bank\">more brazen</a> and lethal – and conducted with even greater impunity. Even politicians, such as the parliamentarian Ofer Cassif, who have vocally objected to the settlers’ activities, are <a href=\"/news/2021/4/9/video-shows-police-beating-israeli-politician-in-jerusalem\">not safe from physical assault</a>.</p><p>For Cassif, the blame extends beyond just the settlers’ patrons in government to the more mainstream political establishment, including self-styled opposition figures, such as Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid, who Cassif describes as turning a blind eye to both the settlers’ violence and Smotrich’s agenda.</p><p>“They don’t dare confront these neo-Nazi bigots in the West Bank, who are launching daily pogroms,” Cassif said.</p><p>“They’ve emboldened them. Now they’re attacking both Arabs and activists within Israel proper, and no one does anything,” he said. “Netanyahu, Smotrich and other ministers don’t interfere with these groups and, in return, these groups help finance them.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4300230\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4300230\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4300230\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_6989d7913b305-1770641297.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich holds a map that shows the E1 settlement project during a press conference near the settlement of Maale Adumim, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Aug. 14, 2025.

The damage has already been done.</p><p>“I don’t know what the future holds for him,” Goldberg concluded. “Extremism [has] become part of the national conversation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
