the 120-member assembly backed Kurti’s cabinet in a 66-49 vote on Wednesday, hours after parliament convened for the first time since his Vetevendosje party won a <a

the economy and increased investment in defence as key areas, with plans to invest one billion euros ($1.18bn) for military purposes, including the production of combat drones.</p><p>“During these years, as we have all witnessed, we have faced constant attacks and threats from Serbia,” said Kurti of tense relations with Kosovo’s northern neighbour, which has never recognised its independence since it was declared in 2008 after a war in the late 1990s.</p><p>However, the prime minister, a former political prisoner, promised to pursue “normalisation of relations” with Belgrade aimed at “a bilateral external relationship and not interference or meddling in internal affairs”.</p><p>Tensions remain high in Kosovo’s north, where most of the ethnic Serb minority live, but normalisation of relations is a key requirement for both countries’ stated ambitions to join the European Union.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"urgent-tasks-after-political-stasis\">Urgent tasks after

government.</p><p>Deeply divided lawmakers eventually forced a snap poll in December, which Kurti’s party won with more than 51 percent of the vote, securing 57 seats.</p><p>But the result took weeks to confirm, after alleged inaccuracies in the tally triggered a full recount and a criminal investigation that has seen the arrests of more than 100 election staff.</p><p>Now confirmed as the country’s leader, Kurti has already flagged an intention to move quickly as he seeks to approve key international loans for Kosovo, including from the EU.</p><p>The new government’s most urgent tasks

If the crime took place when the victim was a minor, then they have 10 years to sue from when they turn 18.<strong> </strong></p><p>In September 2022, Congress passed a law removing the statute of limitations for victims of child sex abuse, but that change did not apply to any crimes committed before that date.</p><p>Virginia’s Law calls for the 10-year statute of limitations for all federal civil cases relating to sexual abuse and trafficking – regardless of when abuses were committed – to be scrapped.</p><p>Introducing the law on Tuesday, Schumer told Congress: “When the truth of Jeffrey Epstein finally started to come out, when the world finally started to listen to their stories, oftentimes the laws in the books said, ‘Sorry, it’s too late. The deadline to bring your case has passed.</p><p>He said Virginia’s Law “will change that, because justice for victims of abuse should not have an expiration date”.</p><p>The bill will ultimately mean that many of Epstein’s alleged victims will now be able to lodge civil claims against Epstein’s estate.</p><p>“Virginia’s dream was to inspire and empower survivors to come forward in a world that too often turns away from abuse and pushes it into the shadows. She wanted to bring light,” Giuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, said during a news conference in the US Capitol.</p><p>Virginia’s Law also expands victims’ legal options in other respects, such as by covering relevant sex crimes committed outside the US where a US court has jurisdiction – for example, in cases where the abuser or victim is American or where there has been sex trafficking to or from the US.</p><p>Virginia’s Law would apply to federal cases only and will not change state statutes of limitations.</p><p>“The bill applies only to federal sex abuse crimes involving the mails or interstate commerce as stipulated in 18 USC 2421 et seq,” constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein told Al Jazeera.</p><p>This means the bill would cover federal sex‑abuse and trafficking crimes, which fall under the 1910 federal law, the Mann Act – cases in which the abuse involved crossing state lines or using the mails, the internet or other channels of interstate commerce.</p><p>“The federal bill would not supersede state laws that commonly create civil causes of action for sexual abuse, including assault. The state laws would complement the federal law,” Fein said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-does-the-bill-pass-into-law\">How does the bill pass into law?</h2><p>The bill will have to gain the approval of enough members of the Republican-dominated Senate and the House of Representatives before it can be signed into law.</p><p>The House includes 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats empty. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate, 45 Democrats and two independent senators who caucus with the Democratic Party. So far, there is no scheduled date for a vote on Virginia’s Law in either chamber.</p><p>In both chambers, the law requires a simple majority of members present and voting, which means it needs 51 votes in the Senate and 217 votes in the House. The bill must pass both chambers before it goes to the Oval Office for the president to sign it into law.</p><p>However, a bipartisan push succeeded last year in forcing the Department of Justice to release all unclassified files from its Epstein investigation through the Epstein Files Transparency Act.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-statute-of-limitations\">What is a statute of limitations?</h2><p>A statute of limitations is a time limit for bringing a case. In criminal law, it sets how long prosecutors have to file charges; in civil law, it sets how long a victim has to sue their abuser.</p><p>If this time limit elapses, a defendant cannot be prosecuted or sued, even if there is strong evidence that they committed a crime.</p><p id=\"according-to-an-article-published-by-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi\">Statutes of limitations exist to limit the deterioration of evidence, promote swift enforcement of the law and provide greater legal certainty, according to the FBI.</p><p>“Memories fade, witnesses die, and documents are commonly lost over time,” lawyer Fein said.</p><p>Crimes besides sexual abuse also have statutes of limitations.</p><p>In the US, statutes of limitations for nonfederal civil and criminal cases vary by state. In criminal cases, they can also vary depending on whether the sexual abuse was a “felony” or “misdemeanour”, and whether the victim was a minor or an adult.</p><p>Felonies are serious crimes punishable by a year or more in a state or federal prison, while misdemeanours are “less serious” crimes that are punishable by fines, probation, or less than one year in a local jail.</p><p>For example, in Alabama, there is no statute of limitations for criminal cases of rape, sexual abuse involving violence or threats of violence, or sexual offences against a victim below the age of 16.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Arkansas, the criminal statute of limitations is six years for rape and three years for certain sexual assault offences.</p><p>States usually have separate statutes of limitations for civil cases, and they can be very different from the criminal ones.</p><p>Many states are moving to increase or scrap statutes of limitations for sexual abuse cases. Iowa, Vermont, California, Texas and others have eliminated or greatly extended criminal statutes of limitations for many sex crimes for both criminal and civil cases.</p><p>Other states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Florida and Alabama, have expanded civil filing windows, often allowing victims to sue decades after the abuse or after it is discovered. Several have also lengthened or lifted criminal statutes of limitations for certain sex crimes, particularly where there is strong evidence, such as DNA.</p><p>Virginia’s Law will not supersede any state laws, as it will relate to federal cases only.</p><h2 id=\"what-can-we-expect-if-virginia-s-law-passes\">What can we expect if Virginia’s Law passes?</h2><p>The bill would scrap civil time limits so that many survivors whose cases are currently time‑barred would now be able to sue. Some lawyers expect a flurry of lawsuits, particularly from Epstein victims, if this happens.</p><p>In May 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law the New York State Adult Survivors Act (ASA), allowing adult survivors of sexual assault to file civil lawsuits, regardless of when the abuse occurred. In 2019, New York had opened a similar window for people abused as children under its Child Victims Act.</p><p>The ASA expired in late November 2023. While the Act was active, more than 3,000 civil suits were filed under it, including writer E Jean Carroll’s successful <a href=\"/news/2023/4/25/what-to-know-about-e-jean-carroll-civil-rape-trial-against-trump\">sexual abuse and defamation case</a> against President Donald Trump.</p><p>In June 2019, Carroll published an excerpt of her book in a New York Magazine article alleging that Trump had raped her in 1996. Trump denied these allegations. In November 2019, Carroll sued Trump for defamation. After the ASA took effect in 2022, she filed her lawsuit against Trump for defamation as well as sexual abuse.</p><p>“If the law passes, an indeterminate number of women may bring civil actions against men identified in the Epstein files, [for example] Prince Andrew, seeking damages,” Fein said.</p><p>“The number is unknown because victims commonly are reluctant to sue because of [the] social stigma attached to women perceived to be promiscuous.”</p><h2 id=\"have-some-victims-been-barred-from-suing-in-other-ways\">Have some victims been barred from suing in other ways?</h2><p>The Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program was a fund set up in June 2020 by Epstein’s estate, with court approval in the US Virgin Islands, to provide compensation to many women who say they were abused. However, they were required to waive their right to sue Epstein or his estate in exchange for the compensation.</p><p>Some 225 claims were submitted under this fund before it shut down in August 2021 at the end of its remit. It is unclear whether women who received payouts from the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program would be able to benefit from Virginia’s Law.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

His barber shop was also demolished later that day.</p><p>Agando is one of the thousands of Makoko residents forcibly evicted from their homes by the Lagos State government, in a demolition operation that began in late December and only ended when the Lagos State House of Assembly ordered it be halted earlier this month.</p><p>The government said the demolitions were being carried out due to the community’s proximity to an electric power line, and that people needed to move back by 100 metres (109 yards). But authorities have gone beyond the 100-metre mark. Nonprofit organisations (NGOs) working with the community say the demolitions took place between 250 and 500 metres (about 270 and 550 yards) inside the settlement, destroying people’s homes, rendering thousands homeless and causing the death of more than 12 people, including two infants, in the process.</p><p>During the weeks of demolitions, the surrounding water was dotted with canoes carrying beds, bowls and other household appliances, as anxious community members removed their valuables in case operations reached them. At the same time, there have been no plans to resettle or compensate victims.</p><p>“They did not stop where they said they would; they just kept demolishing the whole place,” said Innocent Ahisu, one of the community’s leaders.</p><p>“This is where we live and get what we eat and drink. We are all sad and don’t know where this will end for us.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305872\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305872\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305872\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0344-1770827583.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Makoko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305872\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A boy paddles around on a raft in Makoko [Pelumi Salako/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"we-are-humans\">‘We are humans’</h2><p>Makoko, popularly called the “Venice of Africa”, is a historic fishing village dating back to the 19th century, built on stilts along the coast of Lagos. It overlooks the Third Mainland Bridge, which connects the affluent Lagos Island with mainland Lagos, and its residents are predominantly fishermen who fish in the same water on which they have dwelled for decades. An economic hub, it serves markets around the city with fresh and dried seafood.</p><p>Although it is home to about 200,000 people, the combination of poverty and lack of government development and social infrastructure has made it a slum. Yet its scenic waterways plied by canoes hawking everyday necessities and food, and its distinct culture, make it a popular destination for visitors. Much of the community sits on water, but a part is situated on land.</p><p>On an average day, the sunset’s reflection on the water, coupled with rising smoke from the wooden houses and children swimming nearby, makes Makoko picturesque from a distance – its rugged imperfections that are a testament to resilience also giving it a unique beauty.</p><p>But recently, the landscape of the village has resembled the aftermath of a storm, with only the carcasses of wooden structures left in many places.</p><p>At one of Makoko’s numerous processing hubs for dried fish, women working are anxious about what the demolition means for their business and economic future.</p><p>“We hope they can see that we are humans and stop demolishing our homes,” one of the older women who did not want to give her name said in the local dialect, Egun.</p><p>This eviction will only increase hardship for people who are already disproportionately affected by Nigeria’s cost-of-living crisis, observers note.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0348-1770827379.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Makoko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Women at work at one of the huts where fresh fish is smoked before being supplied to the market [Pelumi Salako/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"history-is-going-to-be-lost\">‘History is going to be lost’</h2><p>Phoebe Ekpoesi, a mother of three, has been staying at a relative’s house in Makoko after her home was demolished. She said everything she owns, including her business in the village, has been lost.</p><p>“This Makoko is everything we have, my family lives here, my children go to school here, and we do not have anywhere else to go,” she said with frustration.</p><p>Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, the executive director of Spaces for Change, a Lagos-based civil society organisation advocating for urban governance, gender rights, and environmental justice, said the demolition has had a devastating effect on people like Ekpoesi.</p><p>“There is disruption of their children’s education, people are becoming increasingly homeless, and there is heightened vulnerability, especially among women, people with disabilities, and aged persons within the community,” she said.</p><p>Not only will the demolitions affect victims and community structures, but people will be deprived of communal land ownership and a sense of belonging to a place, according to Deji Akinpelu, the cofounder of Rethinking Cities, an NGO advocating against the exclusion of the urban poor.</p><p>“Heritage is going to be lost, history is going to be lost,” he said.</p><p>And worse still, many say, is that there has been no resettlement plan for the victims, many of whom now stay with friends and relatives, or sleep in their canoes or what is left of their structures.</p><p>Although the state government promised on February 4 to provide money to victims, Lagos State commissioner of information, Gbenga Omotoso, told Al Jazeera that compensation will be determined only after victims have been counted and documented.</p><p>Akinpelu said authorities ought to have considered compensation and resettlement before starting demolitions, not as an afterthought.</p><p>According to advocates like Ibezim-Ohaeri, the government’s failure to provide these is “illegal”, as they are considerations clearly stipulated by Nigeria’s constitution, which forbids the government from demolishing structures without prior negotiation and prompt payment of compensation.</p><p>Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has, however, defended the state’s actions, saying, “What we are doing is not demolishing the whole of Makoko. We are clearing areas to ensure they do not encroach on the Third Mainland Bridge and to keep residents away from high-tension lines.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305846\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305846\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305846\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Phoebe-Ekpoesi-1770827270.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Makoko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Phoebe Ekpoesi stands in front of her relative’s house, where she now stays temporarily [Pelumi Salako/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"an-eviction-playbook\">An eviction ‘playbook’</h2><p>Although the government has cited safety as its reason for demolishing the homes, activists say there are other motives at play. Last year, local Nigerian outlets <a href=\"https://guardian.ng/property/real-estate/lagos-investors-begin-55-hectare-mixed-use-development-scheme-in-makoko-waterfront/\">reported</a> that the government had entered an agreement with a private contractor to develop an estate in Makoko, and promptly began sand dredging and land reclamation opposite the area.</p><p>“The unofficial reason is that Makoko is sitting in a highly coveted area. Makoko sits on the waterfront overlooking the lagoon from the Third Mainland Bridge. So that intersection between urban poverty and highbrow property development is one of the biggest pressures,” Ibezim-Ohaeri said.</p><p>Forceful eviction and demolition are not new to Nigeria’s economic capital. They follow a historical trend that has seen informal settlements and waterfront communities pushed out to make way for luxury estate developments.</p><p>In 1990, 300,000 people were forcefully evicted from Maroko in Lagos to make way for what has now become parts of Victoria Island and Oniru Estate, both sought-after areas for wealthy Nigerians. Otodo-Gbame faced a similar <a href=\"/news/2017/4/10/thousands-displaced-as-police-raze-lagos-otodo-gbame\">fate</a> in 2017 when its 30,000 residents were rendered homeless, and more recently, to make way for the luxurious Periwinkle estate.</p><p>Another waterfront community, Oworonshoki, is currently being demolished, and activists say a luxurious estate might spring up in the location soon.</p><p>Between 1973 and 2024, 91 eviction operations were carried out in parts of Lagos.</p><p>“There is an eviction playbook in Lagos State, and if you look at all the other evictions, it follows the same playbook,” Ibezim-Ohaeri said. “It will first of all be cited that there is something wrong in that area, and at the end of the day, new highbrow developments that are far beyond the reach of the former owner will spring up in that area.”</p><p>Ibezim-Ohaeri, who has been a counsel for Makoko since 2005, said the state has made more than 20 attempts to evict the residents of the village, but the community has resisted through court orders and pressures from civil society organisations.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305874\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305874\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305874\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0342-1770827633.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Makoko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Makoko residents load the belongings they can salvage into canoes [Pelumi Salako/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-power-line-or-the-people\">The power line or the people?</h2><p>Other waterfront communities and informal settlements are also at risk, Ibezim-Ohaeri said, as the Lagos government recently announced its plans to reclaim more informal lands.</p><p>“What this means for Lagos is that it has continued to follow a pattern of classism right from the colonial era,” said Akinpelu, who added that “it is very much time for the government to start to rethink its ways because providing housing for high-income earners creates an imbalance in the city.”</p><p>Experts said the city should be thinking of mixed-income housing patterns that allow everyone to get shelter, and not push more people into homelessness in the city of 22 million people, where a housing crisis is brewing.</p><p>“We have to consider what can give way to what. The power line or the people? The power line itself can be moved, but they found it right that the people are the ones who should move for the power line,” Akinpelu said.</p><p>On January 29, Makoko community members demonstrated at the government secretariat and demanded an audience with the city’s governor, but they were forcefully dispersed by the police who fired tear gas. A large banner read: “A megacity cannot be built on the bones and blood of the poor.”</p><p>This week, a compromise was reached by the Lagos State House of Assembly and the community that residents would not rebuild on the demolished structures, compensation would be determined by a committee, and a water-city regeneration project would be implemented in Makoko.</p><p>Meanwhile, for those evicted and displaced, the future looks bleak.</p><p>In Makoko, Agando is back to sleep under the mosquito-infested shed with his pregnant wife and relatives at his pastor’s house. His family is considering finding a place in Ikorodu, northeast of Lagos, as soon as they are able to get enough money.</p><p>“This is what we have for now,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4305863\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4305863\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4305863\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0353-1770827482.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Makoko\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4305863\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Nigerian flag stands amid the ruins of Makoko [Pelumi Salako/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Larijani has accused Israel of attempting to sabotage negotiations with the United States over Tehran’s nuclear programme, so it can ignite a new war that would destabilise the region.</p><p>In an interview with Al Jazeera Arabic during his visit to Doha, Qatar, where he met top officials on Wednesday, Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said Israel had been fabricating pretexts to try to derail the negotiations with Washington, as the renewed talks were at a delicate stage.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories

engaged in any talks with Israel,” he said.</p><p>“However, Israel has inserted itself into this process, with their intent on undermining and sabotaging these negotiations.”</p><p>He said Israel’s strategy was “to destabilise the region”, and that its agenda “extends beyond its alleged concerns about Iran”, as was evidenced by its <a href=\"/news/2025/9/9/israeli-attack-in-doha-sparks-regional-and-international-condemnation\">attack on the Qatari capital</a> targeting Hamas officials in September.</p><p>“They are gambling not only with Iran, but also Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye,” he said, calling on regional leaders to “be aware of this.”</p><p>Israel’s attack on Iran in June came as Tehran and Washington were engaged in talks and effectively torpedoed the negotiations, which were several rounds in.</p><h2 id=\"netanyahu-meets-with-trump\">Netanyahu meets with Trump</h2><p>Iran and the US held a round of indirect negotiations in Muscat, Oman, on Friday, seeking to negotiate a resolution to the nuclear dispute, amid a US military buildup in the region and Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/trump-threatens-iran-with-something-very-tough-if-us-demands-are-not-met\">ongoing threats</a> to strike Iran if it does not accede to his demands.</p><p>Amid plans for a second round of talks – the timing of which is currently under discussion, Larijani said – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday for urgent talks with Trump, where he presented the US leader with <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/netanyahu-says-hell-present-principles-for-iran-talks-to-trump\">“principles”</a> for negotiating with Iran.</p><p>After the meeting, Trump said <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/nothing-definitive-reached-about-iran-during-netanyahus-visit-with-trump\">“nothing definitive”</a> had been reached, “other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"common-ground\">‘Common ground’</h2><p>Larijani told Al Jazeera that Tehran had not yet received a specific proposal from Washington in the negotiations, and that the talks in Muscat had consisted of an exchange of messages.</p><p>He said that Tehran was taking a positive position towards the negotiations, and that Washington, too, appeared to have concluded that negotiations were the preferred option.</p><p>He said there was common ground between Tehran and Washington regarding Iran not possessing a nuclear weapon, which it insists it is not pursuing.</p><h2 id=\"missiles-zero-enrichment-off-the-table\">Missiles, zero enrichment off the table</h2><p>However, Larijani <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/iran-says-missile-programme-non-negotiable-as-tehran-washington-eye-talks\">reiterated</a> that the negotiations would be limited to Iran’s nuclear programme, with issues such as Iran’s missile programme – which the US has pushed to address in the talks, and is a key concern for Israel – not up for discussion.</p><p>“When we met at the negotiating table, a clear boundary was drawn … our talks centred solely on the nuclear issue,” he said, adding that this was a “logical” approach.</p><p>“Our missile program stands entirely separate from the nuclear one. It is a domestic matter, basically linked to our national security. As such, it cannot be part of these negotiations.”</p><p>Similarly, he said, the notion of Iran reducing its uranium enrichment to zero was “not on the table”.</p><p>“It is impractical for a country that has already mastered this technology to reduce it to zero,” he said, citing the need for enriched uranium for peaceful civilian purposes such as in cancer treatment.</p><p>“Meanwhile, we are open to verification, and anybody is welcome to come and see [our facilities] for themselves.”</p><p>If the US did opt to attack Iran, as it did in a series of strikes targeting the country’s nuclear facilities in June as part of a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/visualising-12-days-of-the-israel-iran-conflict\">12-day war</a>, then Tehran would respond by attacking US military bases in the region, Larijani said.</p><p>Before leaving Doha, Larijani also met with Muhammad Darwish, the head of Hamas’s Leadership Council, along with a senior delegation from the Palestinian group, to discuss the latest political developments in the region and Israel’s war on Gaza, Lebanon’s Al-Manar reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The sun hasn’t fully risen, but 15-year-old Mahmoud rubs the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>He woke up this morning not in a warm bed, but on a thin mattress in a crowded tent – displaced, like hundreds of thousands of others in Gaza.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>And Mahmoud did not reach for a schoolbag to get ready for school. Instead, he picked up a rough, frayed burlap sack.</p><p>“The sack is empty now, but I feel its weight even before I fill it,” Mahmoud said, as he looked at his palms, calloused and scarred from carrying the sack around Khan Younis’s streets, planning to begin his day. “My back hurts before I even start walking.”</p><p>But Mahmoud insisted that he has to fill his sack – even if that comes at the expense of his childhood and his <a href=\"/features/2026/2/11/young-and-old-struggle-to-get-their-studies-back-on-track-in-gaza\">education</a>.</p><p>The young Palestinian is forced by the economic situation in Gaza, brought on by Israel’s genocidal war, to spend his days filling his sack with items that can be used as fuel for his family.</p><p>Nylon, cardboard and <a href=\"/news/2026/1/24/israeli-drone-strike-kills-two-children-collecting-firewood-in-gaza\">scraps of wood</a> find their way into his sack.</p><p>“Sometimes I walk for six hours just to find a few pieces of wood,” Mahmoud said, describing his daily routine. “The dust from the rubble gets into my lungs. I cough all night. But I can’t stop, there is no fire to bake bread.”</p><p>Mahmoud feels a deep sense of responsibility for his family. He explained that his father was killed in an Israeli air strike early last year, one of more than 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza to be killed by Israel since the war started in October 2023.</p><p>As his mother’s eldest, and with Gaza mired in deep poverty with little help coming, Mahmoud knows that it is his job now to provide. Despite his age, he doesn’t consider himself a child any more.</p><p>“My mother is waiting for me to come back with something to make a fire,” he said. “If I collect any extra, I sell it at the market to buy bread.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"economic-strife\">Economic strife</h2><p>Mahmoud knows that life could be different. He talks about his school days with nostalgia in his voice.</p><p>“I used to go to school before the war, when my father was alive,” he said. “Sometimes, while I am dragging the sack through the market, I see my old math teacher, and I hide behind the wall. I don’t want him to see me like this – dirty, working like a donkey instead of studying. I was one of the top students.”</p><p>Mahmoud’s story is typical of Gaza’s current conditions and is tied to two issues that are a direct result of Israel’s genocidal war: the destruction of school buildings and the dire economic situation in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>Israeli attacks – including air strikes, shelling and deliberate demolitions – have left much of Gaza decimated. According to the United Nations, more than 97 percent of schools in Gaza have either been damaged or destroyed, and most of the 658,000 children of school age in the enclave have had “limited access” to in-person learning for more than two academic years.</p><p>Even now, with a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/at-least-67-palestinian-children-killed-in-gaza-since-ceasefire-began-un\">shaky ceasefire</a> in place since October, many of the schools that remain standing are used as shelters for Gaza’s legion of displaced people, preventing them from being used for education.</p><p>While there are no accurate statistics on the number of children forced to work in Gaza, Palestinians on the ground say that they have seen an increase as a result of the enclave’s economic circumstances.</p><p>In November, the UN reported that Gaza’s economy had “collapsed”, with gross domestic product (GDP) – an important economic indicator – down 83 percent compared with the pre-war period.</p><p>The weak economy, coupled with a lack of electrical power and the thousands of families whose breadwinners have been killed in the war, led to situations like Mahmoud’s.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"child-trauma\">Child trauma</h2><p>“What we are witnessing in Gaza is not merely child labour,” said Yaqeen Jamal, an educational psychologist who has provided psychological support to children during the war. “It is the systematic destruction of an entire generation’s future.”</p><p>“These children lose their sense of security and their childhood, and they bear responsibilities that exceed their cognitive and physical capabilities,” she added.</p><p>Jamal said that would inevitably lead to dangers in the future. “The long-term effects will be catastrophic. We are facing a generation suffering from illiteracy and deteriorating mental health, which will create a societal gap that will be difficult to bridge.”</p><p>“Rebuilding schools and resuming the educational process must be the top priority, because education is the last line of defence for [these] people’s identity and future,” she said.</p><p>Reconstruction in Gaza is likely to take years, with Israel continuing to hinder the process, and uncertainty over whether Israel will attack Gaza again.</p><p>That means that children like 11-year-old Layla continue to be forced to work to help their families.</p><p>Her father suffers from a physical disability that limits his mobility, leaving him unable to work. The burden has instead fallen on Layla, who goes out every day to the streets of Khan Younis to sell tea.</p><p>She walks back and forth on al-Bahr Street – the main street in Khan Younis – calling out “hot tea, hot tea for one shekel”.</p><p>Layla carried a tray containing eight cardboard cups, two-thirds full of tea, and covered each cup with aluminium foil to keep it hot.</p><p>Asked about her favourite colour, she replied that it was pink, and remembered her pink room, full of her toys. Then she remembered her favourite toy, a pink doll.</p><p>Her doll currently lies under the rubble of the pink room, destroyed in Israel’s war.</p><p>“I wish that the colour pink would return to my life, that my room would return, that my family’s happy life before the war would return, she said. Then she hurried away down the street, focused on selling more tea.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The FAA and the military had planned to discuss the issue at a February 20 meeting, but the army moved ahead without final FAA approval, prompting the agency to halt flights in El Paso, sources said.</p><p>Here is what we know:</p><h2 id=\"what-happened-when-el-paso-s-airspace-was-shut-down\">What happened when El Paso’s airspace was shut down?</h2><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">On February 10, at about 11:30pm (05:30GMT) local time, the FAA stopped all flights to and from El Paso international airport, citing “special security reasons”.</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">The restriction was initially expected to last for 10 days.</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">The order covered an area of about 16km (almost 10 miles) around El Paso, including the nearby community of Santa Teresa, and was originally set to remain in place until the night of February 20.</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">Restrictions applied to all aircraft flying below roughly 5,500 metres (18,000 feet), while planes flying above that altitude were not expected to be affected.</p><p data-start=\"90\" data-end=\"318\">US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that the airspace was closed due to the Department of Defense and the FAA dealing with an incursion by Mexican drug cartel drones, and “the threat has been neutralized”.</p><p></p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"936\">According to <a href=\"https://elpasomatters.org/2026/02/11/unexplained-faa-order-shuts-down-el-paso-southern-new-mexico-airspace-for-10-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">local media reports</a>, the FAA also warned that pilots who failed to follow the order “may be intercepted, detained and interviewed by law enforcement/security personnel”.</p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"936\">The agency added that authorities could use deadly force if it was “determined that the aircraft poses an imminent security threat”.</p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"936\">The airspace closure risked disrupting activity in one of the largest cities in the US, as El Paso is home to nearly 700,000 residents and is among the country’s 25 most populous cities.</p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"936\">A restriction of this scale has only been applied once before in El Paso, after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when US airspace was closed nationwide following the coordinated airliner hijackings that led to the destruction of the World Trade Center towers in New York and damage to the Pentagon.</p><h2 id=\"why-did-the-faa-close-el-paso-s-airspace\" data-start=\"288\" data-end=\"694\">Why did the FAA close El Paso’s airspace?</h2><p>The agency initially cited “special security reasons”.</p><p>Transport Secretary Duffy said that a cartel drone had breached US airspace, an explanation that was echoed by officials at the White House and the Pentagon.</p><p>However, according to media reports, people briefed on the situation said the shutdown was linked to the Defense Department’s use of new high-energy laser technology designed to counter unmanned aircraft.</p><p>Bloomberg News, citing a source familiar with the matter, reported that the Pentagon was also flying drones as part of the tests, with some operating outside normal flight paths.</p><p>The activity occurred in airspace near El Paso international airport, prompting FAA concerns about potential interference with commercial flights.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, pushed back on the drone incursion explanation.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“I believe the FAA owes the community and the country an explanation as to why this happened so suddenly and abruptly and was lifted so suddenly and abruptly,” Escobar said during a morning news conference.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">There was “nothing extraordinary about any drone incursion into the US that I’m aware of”, she said.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“The information coming from the federal government does not add up,” Escobar added later.</p><p></p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">The airspace closure also drew backlash from other leaders, who said they were not properly consulted.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“This unnecessary decision has caused chaos and confusion in the El Paso community,” Renard Johnson, the mayor of El Paso, said at a news conference.</p><p class=\"css-ac37hb evys1bk0\">“I want to be very, very clear that this should have never happened.

represents a dangerous escalation in the pattern of repeated violations against civilians,” the doctors said.</p><p>The Sudan Doctors Network said the RSF has previously targeted other religious

A minority, comprised of 211 representatives, voted against the bill.</p><p>It was a rare rebuke from Congress’s lower chamber, where the Republican Party holds a 218-seat majority.</p><p>Before the vote, Democrats challenged their Republican colleagues to defy Trump, who has come to dominate the party.</p><p>“Today’s vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J Trump?” said Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, who authored the resolution.</p><p>The vote comes as the US enters its pivotal midterm election season. Primaries begin in March, and the general election unfolds in November.</p><p>All members of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in their respective districts.</p><p>Faced with Trump’s drooping approval rating, Republican representatives have faced the uncomfortable choice of either bucking his less-popular policies or remaining steadfast, despite possible blowback at the ballot box.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, threatened to derail the election prospects of any Republican who voted in favour of Wednesday’s bill.</p><p>“Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116054542648712986\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media in the lead-up to the vote.</p><p>He also accused Canada – one of the US’s biggest trading partners and closest allies – of mistreating its southern neighbour.</p><p>“Canada has taken advantage of the United States on Trade for many years,” Trump said in a second <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116054544240272433\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>“They are among the worst in the World to deal with, especially as it relates to our Northern Border. TARIFFS make a WIN for us, EASY. Republicans must keep it that way!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Wednesday’s bill now heads to the US Senate, where it is likely to pass.</p><p>That chamber had already passed similar legislation designed to curtail Trump’s Canada tariff, first in April and later in October of last year.</p><p>But the legislation is unlikely to become law. Even if it passes the Senate, Trump is poised to veto the bill.</p><p>Congress needs a two-thirds majority in each chamber to overcome a presidential veto. That would require substantial Republican defections, more than what happened during Wednesday’s vote.</p><p>Still, polls have shown that Trump’s tariffs are largely unpopular with voters, who blame them in part for rising prices on a bevy of goods.</p><p>On February 4, for instance, the Pew Research Center found that 60 percent of respondents disapprove of Trump increasing tariffs. Only 37 percent said they approved.</p><p>Democrats hope that the growing dissatisfaction, along with anger over Trump’s aggressive mass deportation raids, will help them end Republican majorities in both houses of Congress.</p><p>Currently, the Supreme Court is also weighing the legality of Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs, after the president faced defeat in lower-court rulings.</p><p>Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson had urged the Republican caucus to abstain from voting until the high court rendered its decision.</p><p>But six Republican representatives, including Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, defied him to help bring the measure to the floor for a vote.</p><p>“Why doesn’t the Congress stand on its own two feet and say that we’re an independent branch?” said Representative Bacon. “We should defend our authorities. I hope the Supreme Court does, but if we don’t do it, shame on us.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

He also indicated the US president would take a hemisphere-wide approach to his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.</p><p>“Our countries share a long history. It has gone through different chapters, as all relationships do,” Wright said.</p><p>“But I bring today a message from President Trump. He is passionately committed to absolutely transforming the relationship between the United States and Venezuela, part of a broader agenda to make the Americas great again.”</p><h2 id=\"a-new-era-of-expansion\">A new era of expansion</h2><p>Trump has repeatedly outlined his vision for a new era of “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manifest destiny</a>“, a 19th-century doctrine that champions US expansionism.</p><p>Already, he has quipped about implementing the “Donroe Doctrine”, his version of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century foreign policy platform that designates the entire Western Hemisphere as the US’s sphere of influence.</p><p>Part of that push has been to bring countries throughout the Americas in line with US policy, whether through economic pressure, diplomatic efforts or military action.</p><p>An example of the latter came on January 3, when Trump authorised an early-morning military operation to attack Venezuela and abduct its then-leader, President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>The Venezuelan leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were then transported by military aircraft to New York. They are expected to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges in March.</p><p>In his first remarks after the military operation, Trump asserted that the US would “run” Venezuela.</p><p>He has since recognised the interim leadership of Maduro’s former vice president, Rodriguez, though he has threatened a “second wave” of military action if she fails to comply with his demands.</p><h2 id=\"claiming-venezuela-s-oil\">Claiming Venezuela’s oil</h2><p>Trump has also made sweeping claims to Venezuela’s oil industry.</p><p>In his initial speech following the military operation, Trump reiterated claims that the country’s petroleum resources belonged to the US, as a result of early oil exploration from companies like Exxon Mobil.</p><p>Trump argued that Venezuela’s efforts to nationalise its oil industry amounted to the “largest theft of property in the history” of the US.</p><p>“Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,” Trump said. “They took all of our property. It was our property. We built it.”</p><p>He emphasised that his country, not Venezuela, should control the local oil reserves, though international law states otherwise.</p><p>Multiple international resolutions and covenants outline that nations have permanent sovereignty over their own natural resources.</p><p>“We built Venezuela’s oil industry with American talent, drive and skill. And the socialist regime stole it from us during those previous administrations,” Trump said on January 3.</p><p>Since then, Trump has announced that Venezuela has turned over nearly 50 million barrels of oil to the US. That oil, Trump explained, is slated to be sold at market price for the benefit of both the US and Venezuela.</p><p>“That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America,” Trump <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/2008691566131769746\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> online.</p><p>He also indicated he had tasked Wright to carry out the planned sale.</p><h2 id=\"a-presidential-overstep\">A presidential overstep?</h2><p>But Trump has faced backlash for his aggressive approach to Venezuelan oil. Critics have pointed out that the US Constitution puts the power to manage money with Congress, not the president.</p><p>Then there is the question of whether this oil was legally acquired from Venezuela in the first place, as Republican Congress member Thomas Massie pointed out last month.</p><p>“Selling stolen oil and putting billions of dollars in a bank in Qatar to be spent without Congressional approval is not Constitutional,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2013661360752640469\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>“Only Congress can appropriate money. The President can’t legally create a second Treasury overseas for his own piggy bank.”</p><p>The criticism continued on Wednesday. While Wright visited the Rodriguez administration, Democrats in the Senate introduced the Venezuela Oil Proceeds Transparency Act, designed to force a nonpartisan audit of the recent oil proceeds.</p><p>One of the bill’s sponsors, Adam Schiff of California, criticised Trump’s preoccupation with Venezuelan oil and questioned his motives for attacking Venezuela and its surrounding waters.</p><p>“For months, the Trump administration claimed that its military operations in the Caribbean were about stopping drugs, but the objective is now abundantly clear: this was about seizing Venezuela’s oil and lining the pockets of the oil industry,” Schiff said in a <a href=\"http://democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/as-americans-face-higher-energy-prices-leader-schumer-and-senator-schiff-demand-independent-audit-of-trump-admins-secretive-plan-for-handling-venezuela-oil-money-that-is-ripe-for-corruption-and-exploitation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber and the bill’s co-sponsor, echoed Schiff’s call for greater transparency.</p><p>“The American people deserve to know what’s happening with the money received from these Venezuelan oil payments and where – and to whom – they are going,” Schumer said.</p><h2 id=\"an-upbeat-meeting\">An upbeat meeting</h2><p>But the controversy in the US did not dampen the upbeat meeting Wright had with Rodriguez.</p><p>Wright’s visit was the first of its kind for Venezuela. Under Maduro, Trump did send a special envoy, Richard Grenell, to the country in January 2025 to negotiate for the release of US prisoners.</p><p>Grenell’s negotiations with Maduro, however, ended in October, as the Trump administration ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government.</p><p>Since Maduro’s removal, the US Department of State <a href=\"/news/2026/1/9/venezuela-starts-exploratory-process-to-re-establish-formal-ties-with-us\">has deployed</a> a mission to Caracas, as the two countries work to reestablish diplomatic ties. The US has signalled it will soon reopen its embassy in Venezuela, which has been closed since 2019.</p><p>But no US official as senior as Wright has visited the country in years.</p><p>Rodriguez, meanwhile, has led an effort to comply with Trump’s demands. On January 29, she <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/venezuelas-rodriguez-signs-oil-reform-law-while-the-us-eases-sanctions\">signed into law</a> a reform bill that would allow for increased privatisation in Venezuela’s nationalised oil industry.</p><p>On Wednesday, she and Wright appeared together on the steps of the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas to present a summary of their meeting.</p><p>Wright pledged that Venezuela would see a “dramatic increase in Venezuelan oil production”, as well as a boost in the use of its other energy resources. He also promised “to bring commerce, peace, prosperity, jobs, opportunity to the people of Venezuela and in partnership with the United States”.</p><p>“These are not just words or ambitions,” he added. “We have very specific plans and very specific actions already.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

They have met a total of seven times — including once in Israel — since January 2025.</p><p>The latest visit came just days after US and Iranian officials held indirect talks in Oman aimed at diverting a military confrontation that could spill into the wider Middle East region.</p><p>While Arab leaders have largely advocated for deescalation, Netanyahu has <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/netanyahu-says-hell-present-principles-for-iran-talks-to-trump\">repeatedly called</a> for further military action against Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-private-meeting\">A private meeting</h2><p>Netanyahu’s latest visit took place behind closed doors. After their visit was over, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116053512461029874\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted</a> on his Truth Social account that it had been a “tremendous meeting”. He also wrote that he had hope a deal could be struck with Iran.</p><p>“If it can, I let the Prime Minister know that will be a preference,” Trump said. “If it cannot, we will just have to see what the outcome will be.”</p><p>Trump previously sided with Israel in a 12-day war against Iran last June. The conflict culminated with US strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, in a military operation dubbed “Midnight Hammer”.</p><p>In Wednesday’s post, the US president appeared to threaten further military action against Iran, pointing out that June’s attack came after talks on Iran’s nuclear programme failed to make progress.</p><p>“Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal, and they were hit with Midnight Hammer,” Trump wrote. “That did not work well for them. Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible.”</p><p>Netanyahu’s office, meanwhile, offered few details, saying only that the pair discussed Israel’s “security needs” and agreed to “continued coordination and close ties”.</p><p>Among the topics discussed were “negotiations with Iran, Gaza and regional developments”, the statement said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"iran-says-ballistic-missile-non-negotiable\">Iran says ballistic missile ‘non-negotiable’</h2><p>Trump has signalled optimism in the wake of Friday’s talks in Oman, which included US envoy Steve Witkoff, the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.</p><p>The gathering came after the US surged military assets to the region, raising the prospect of a military entanglement.</p><p>Since January, Trump has pledged to strike Iran if the country’s security agents kill protesters involved in recent antigovernment demonstrations.</p><p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in turn, warned of a “regional war” in the event of a US attack.</p><p>Regional powers across the Middle East have pushed for a diplomatic solution to avoid a military clash.</p><p>The Trump administration, meanwhile, has not been clear on the scope of its talks with Iran.</p><p>However, officials have told US media outlets that the recent negotiations hinge on three main demands: ending Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme, curtailing its ballistic programme and cutting its support for regional proxies, a goal long held by Netanyahu as well.</p><p>The US had previously entered into an agreement to scale back Iran’s nuclear programme in 2015.</p><p>That multilateral deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), offered Iran sanctions relief. The United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, Germany and the European Union were all participants.</p><p>But in 2018, during his first term, Trump withdrew from the JCPOA. Ever since, he has unsuccessfully pursued a new agreement while re-imposing “maximum pressure” sanctions on Iran.</p><p>Iranian officials have <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/iran-says-missile-programme-non-negotiable-as-tehran-washington-eye-talks\">signalled</a> they are open to reaching a new deal on their nuclear programme, which they have maintained is only for civilian purposes. But they maintain their ballistic missile capabilities should remain off limits.</p><p>“The ‌Islamic Republic’s missile capabilities are non-negotiable,” Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Khamenei, was quoted by state media as saying on Wednesday.</p><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, meanwhile, said that his country was ready to prove the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme but would “not yield to excessive demands”.</p><h2 id=\"netanyahu-brings-maximalist-demands\">Netanyahu brings ‘maximalist demands’</h2><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera, Barbara Slavin, a fellow at the US-based Stimson Center think tank, said Netanyahu brought “maximalist demands” to his White House meeting.</p><p>“He considers Iran to be a mortal threat to Israel. He wants it weakened in any possible way. He would love to see regime change,” Slavin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But if he can’t have that, he would like to make sure that Iran has no nuclear programme whatsoever and that it has no missiles that could strike Israel.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>She added that the Israeli prime minister “clearly was worried, especially because Donald Trump said some rather optimistic things after the talks in Oman”.</p><p>Al Jazeera correspondent Nour Odeh also pointed to the prospect of early elections in Israel, which might further incentivise Netanyahu to push Trump to take a hard line.</p><p>“Toppling the government in Iran would make him the king of all kings, as far as Israeli policy is concerned, and that’s something he can take to the ballot and win with,” Odeh said.</p><p>“Netanyahu now needs to convince Trump that a deal is not something that will yield results and that Iran cannot be trusted.”</p><p>Still, Odeh explained that Netanyahu must also be prepared for the possibility that the US-Iran negotiations will succeed.</p><p>“If a deal is reached, he needs to make sure that this is up to par with what Israel can live with,” Odeh explained. “He wants Iran to be permanently disabled, and that, in effect, is a formula to ensure that Israel continues to be the hegemon in the region.”</p><h2 id=\"highlighting-gaza\">Highlighting Gaza</h2><p>In his post on Truth Social, Trump said he and Netanyahu also discussed the “tremendous progress being made in Gaza, and the Region in general”.</p><p>Since October 2023, Israel has led a genocidal war in Gaza that has killed an estimated 72,045 Palestinians and wounded 171,686.</p><p>But last year, the Trump administration advocated for a 20-point Gaza “ceasefire” plan that was adopted in October.</p><p>It has since announced in January that the plan was entering “phase two”, although major questions persist, including over the disarmament of Hamas.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israeli attacks have continued. On Wednesday, a Palestinian child was wounded by Israeli gunfire in the Batn as-Sameen area, south of Khan Younis, according to the Wafa news agency.</p><p>Israeli air strikes and artillery shelling also targeted areas under Israeli military control east of the city, Al Jazeera’s team in Gaza reported.</p><p>Since the first phase of the ceasefire agreement came into effect in October, 591 Palestinians have been killed and 1,578 injured, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>Also on Wednesday, Netanyahu signed a document establishing Israel’s membership in Trump’s controversial <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/trumps-board-of-peace-to-convene-in-washington-discuss-gaza-report\">Board of Peace</a> during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>The board was initially designed to supervise Gaza’s ceasefire, but Trump has since pushed it to take on a wider role in resolving global conflicts. Some critics have accused the US president of seeking to create an alternative to the United Nations.</p><p>Netanyahu, who will hold a seat on the multinational board, currently faces an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/israels-netanyahu-to-join-board-of\">arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) over alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territory.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It also calls for stricter border surveillance and expands the list of convictions for which a foreigner can be expelled.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Before going into effect, the bill must be approved by both chambers of parliament.</p><p>One of the most controversial elements allows authorities to impose a 30-day naval blockade on sea arrivals if there is a “serious threat to public order or national security”.</p><p>Such a threat could include “exceptional migratory pressure that could compromise the secure management of borders”, says the bill. It also cites the “concrete risk” of terrorist acts or infiltration in Italy, global health emergencies and high-level international events.</p><p>Those violating the rules would face fines of up to 50,000 euros ($59,400) and would see their boats confiscated in the case of repeated violations, a measure that seems to target humanitarian rescue ships.</p><p>If approved by parliament, the bill could help revive Italy’s beleaguered “return hub” migrants centre in Albania, which has failed to take off due to a series of legal challenges and has been <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/italys-pm-meloni-determined-to-continue-sending-migrants-to-albania\">roundly condemned by rights groups</a>.</p><h2 id=\"migrant-boat-arrivals-to-italy-down\">Migrant boat arrivals to Italy down</h2><p>The draft legislation comes a day after the European Parliament <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/eu-votes-to-allow-deportation-of-migrants-to-safe-third-countries\">adopted two flagship texts</a> tightening European Union migration policy, which Italy had pushed for. That EU legislation allows member states to deny asylum and deport migrants to designated “safe” countries outside the bloc, provided there is an agreement with the receiving country.</p><p>Meron Ameha Knikman, senior adviser for the International Rescue Committee, said those measures are “likely to force people to countries they may never have set foot in – places where they have no community, do not speak the language, and face a very real risk of abuse and exploitation.”</p><p>Meloni, the head of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, was elected in 2022 on a promise to stop the tens of thousands of migrants who land in small boats on Italy’s shores each year.</p><p>Her government has <a href=\"/news/2019/11/2/anti-migration-deal-between-italy-and-libya-renewed\">signed accords with North African countries</a> to limit departures, while also restricting the activities of the charities that operate rescue boats in the Central Mediterranean.</p><p>The number of migrants arriving in Italy by sea this year has fallen to 2,000 compared with 4,400 during the same period last year, according to government figures.</p><p>Still, large numbers of migrants continue to die crossing the Central Mediterranean, with nearly 490 people reported missing this year, according to the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
