Under the agreement, the government will take over land held by the Kurdish armed group.</p><p>Despite this, Syria’s army and the SDF both reported <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2026/1/19/syria-live-government-forces-take-control-after-heavy-fighting-with-sdf\">ongoing gun battles</a> in the country on Monday, in particular around a prison holding ISIL (ISIS) members in the town of al-Shadadi.</p><h2 id=\"what-was-agreed-on-sunday\">What was agreed on Sunday?</h2><p>President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the Syrian Army would take control of three eastern and northeastern provinces – Raqqa, Deir Az Zor and Hasakah – from the SDF as part of the deal.</p><p>On Monday, an official from Syria’s Defence Ministry said government-affiliated forces had arrived on the outskirts of the Kurdish-led city of Hasakah in the country’s northeast per this agreement.</p><p>The SDF is now to be integrated into Syria’s defence and interior ministries as part of a broader 14-point agreement.</p><p>Al-Sharaa’s government pledged to reunify Syria following the ousting of former President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. On Friday, al-Sharaa <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">issued a decree</a> declaring Kurdish a “national language” and granting the minority group official recognition.</p><p>“What [we] are witnessing now in the region is the end of the SDF,” Omar Abu Layla, a Syrian affairs analyst, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>The SDF in Syria represents the struggle of the Kurdish people, an ethnic group present across the Middle East.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-kurds\">Who are the Kurds?</h2><p>The Kurds are a group of people who are indigenous to the Mesopotamian plains and nearby highlands which, today, stretch across southeastern Turkiye, northeastern Syria, northern Iraq, northwestern Iran and southwestern Armenia. The Kurdish population is concentrated in these areas, which are collectively referred to as Kurdistan.</p><p>Kurds are, therefore, spread across several different countries in the Middle East and do not have a state of their own. They also have a large diaspora population, primarily in Germany but also in other European countries including France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p><p>There are between 30 and 40 million Kurdish people around the globe. Kurds are widely understood to be the largest stateless ethnic group in the world, connected by a shared culture and the Kurdish language.</p><p>Kurdish, a Northwestern Iranian language, has several distinct dialects that vary by region. Most historians agree that Kurds constitute the Iranian branch of the Indo‑European peoples.</p><p>While most Kurds are Sunni Muslims, there are also Kurdish communities that follow Shia Islam, Alevism, Yazidism, Christianity and other faiths.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4251438\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4251438\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4251438\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-WHERE-ARE-THE-KURDS-JAN19-2026-copy-1768814414.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - WHERE ARE THE KURDS - JAN19, 2026 copy-1768814414\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4251438\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-are-the-kurds-stateless\">Why are the Kurds stateless?</h2><p>The Kurds lost their lands in the 1500s when the Ottoman Empire took over most Kurdish-held territory.</p><p>The Ottoman Empire was dissolved by the 1920 Treaty of Sevres, a post-World War I peace treaty.</p><p>Under this, the Allied powers proposed creating an autonomous Kurdistan. This was seen as a major breakthrough for the emerging Kurdish nationalist movement, but the treaty never came into force. Turkiye later renegotiated the post-war settlement with the Allies, and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne dropped the idea of a self-governing Kurdistan altogether.</p><p>Since then, Kurds have repeatedly tried to establish their own state, but those efforts have so far failed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4251646\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4251646\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4251646\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-Who-are-the-main-Kurdish-groups-SDF-Syria-KDP-Iraq-1768819555.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Who are the main Kurdish groups SDF Syria KDP Iraq-1768819555\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4251646\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-do-kurdish-grievances-differ-in-syria-turkiye-iran-and-iraq\">How do Kurdish grievances differ in Syria, Turkiye, Iran and Iraq?</h2><p>In each of the four nations, Kurds have endured years of tricky relations with respective governments.</p><h3>Syria</h3><p>Kurds make up about 10 percent of the population in Syria, according to the CIA World Factbook.</p><p>Syria’s Kurds have experienced repression and unfair treatment.</p><p>In 1962, a special census in al-Hasakah province stripped about 120,000 Kurds of Syrian citizenship. Their children and grandchildren remained stateless, and later estimates from early 2011 put the number of Kurds without citizenship at around 300,000.</p><p>Kurdish land has also been distributed to Arab communities under Arabisation policies.</p><p>The Kurds were initially neutral when the uprising against al-Assad began in 2011 and escalated into a civil war. However, in 2012, Syrian government troops pulled out of many Kurdish areas, and Kurdish groups took control.</p><p>In 2013, fighters from ISIL (ISIS) began attacking three Kurdish areas in northern Syria that bordered the armed group’s territory. The People’s Protection Units (YPG) – a Syrian Kurdish armed group that is the military wing of the Syrian Kurdish political party, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) – fought them off. The YPG was backed by the Turkiye-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).</p><p>In 2014, ISIL seized the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane on the Turkish border. After months of heavy fighting, Kurdish forces, led by the YPG and backed by United States-led air strikes, regained control of the town in early 2015. Later that year, in October 2015, the YPG and allied Arab and other factions formally established the SDF as a broader coalition to fight ISIL across northern and eastern Syria.</p><p>In October 2017, the SDF captured Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIL in Syria, and then pushed into Deir Az Zor, ISIL’s last big stronghold. By March 2019, the SDF had taken Baghouz, the last piece of ISIL-held territory in Syria.</p><p>Al-Assad remained in power until he was ousted in December 2024 by Syrian opposition fighters led by al-Sharaa, who is now the interim president.</p><p>As part of his efforts to unite Syria, al-Sharaa on Friday issued a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/17/syria-decree-grants-kurds-new-rights-formally-recognising-kurdish-language\">decree formally recognising</a> Kurdish as a “national language” alongside Arabic, allowing it to be taught in schools, and restoring citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians. The decree also abolishes measures dating back to a 1962 census in Hasakah province that actively stripped many Kurds of Syrian nationality.</p><p>The decree officially recognises Kurdish identity as part of Syria’s national fabric for the first time and declares Newroz, the Kurdish New Year festival, a paid national holiday.</p><p>It also grants Kurdish Syrians rights, bans ethnic or linguistic discrimination, requires state institutions to adopt inclusive national messaging, and sets out penalties for “incitement to ethnic strife”.</p><p>In a statement, the Kurdish administration in Syria’s north and northeast said the decree was “a first step, however, it does not satisfy the aspirations and hopes of the Syrian people”. It called for more action.</p><p>“Rights are not protected by temporary decrees, but… through permanent constitutions that express the will of the people and all components of a society,” it said.</p><h3>Turkiye</h3><p>Kurds make up 19 percent of the population of Turkiye but, for generations, have experienced erasure, with Kurds displaced and their names and costumes banned.</p><p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) was founded in 1978 by Abdullah Ocalan, with the aim of creating an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkiye. In 1984, the group launched an armed rebellion against the Turkish state, carrying out guerrilla attacks on security forces and state institutions.</p><p>The ensuing conflict between the PKK and Turkish security forces has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced many more in Kurdish-majority areas.</p><p>In the 1990s, the PKK rolled back its demands, instead seeking greater cultural recognition. It continued its armed resistance against the Turkish state, alongside its efforts to build a broader political and social movement through affiliated parties and organisations.</p><p>The SDF’s secular Kurdish leadership is linked to the Turkish-based PKK. Although the PKK signalled in early 2025 that it would lay down its arms and disband, it is still listed as a “terrorist” group by Turkiye, the European Union and the US. Sporadic clashes between PKK fighters and Turkish forces have continued.</p><p>Despite this, the US backed the SDF because it was an effective partner in fighting ISIL, which the SDF and a US-led coalition had defeated in northeastern Syria by 2019.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Iran</h3><p>Kurdish people make up nearly 10 percent of Iran’s population.</p><p>The 1979 Islamic Revolution led to the overthrow of the shah and the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran.</p><p>While the Kurds initially supported the Islamic Republic and briefly controlled parts of Iran, Iran’s mostly Sunni Muslim Kurdish community has often clashed with the Persian-speaking, Shia Muslim government in Tehran over Kurdish demands for political autonomy and cultural and linguistic rights.</p><p>Several Kurdish groups have long opposed the government in western Iran, where they form a majority, and there have been periods of active rebellion against government forces in those areas.</p><p>Kurdish uprisings in Iran in the 1980s and 1990s were met with heavy repression. Key Kurdish parties were pushed out of their strongholds, and many of their leaders and fighters relocated across the border to bases in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Civilian communities were also forced into Iraq, although large Kurdish communities remained inside Iran.</p><p>In 2004, the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) was formed as an armed struggle against the Islamic Republic in Iran. Since then, it has carried out guerrilla attacks and ambushes on Iranian security forces from bases in the mountains along the Iran-Iraq border.</p><h3>Iraq</h3><p>Kurdish people make up between 15 and 20 percent of the population in Iraq. While they have historically enjoyed more rights than the Kurds in neighbouring countries, they have still faced repression in Iraq.</p><p>Kurdish nationalist leader Mustafa Barzani formed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to fight for autonomy in Iraq in 1946. In 1961, he launched a full armed struggle in what is often referred to as the First Kurdish–Iraqi War or the September Revolution.</p><p>The conflict lasted into the 1970s, with on-and-off clashes in the northern provinces of Iraq. Then, in the late 1970s, the government began settling Arabs on Kurdish land and displacing Kurds. Some of them – many Yazidis – settled in “Mujammaat” or army-controlled towns or settlements in northern Iraq.</p><p>In 1991, the year that Iraq lost the Gulf War, Barzani’s son, Masoud Barzani of the KDP, and Jalal Talabani of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led a Kurdish uprising in Iraq. It was violently crushed by the administration of then-President Saddam Hussein. More than 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkiye to escape a crackdown by Hussein’s regime. Turkiye shut its borders in response. Thousands died along the border, and the United Nations set up a “safe zone” for refugees in northern Iraq in April 1991. Eventually, most people returned to their homes in Iraq after the situation stabilised.</p><p>In 1992, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) was formed by the Kurdistan National Assembly, the first democratically elected parliament in Iraq’s Kurdistan region. After the UN guaranteed protection for the Kurds in 1991, Saddam Hussein’s government permitted the KRG to take over administration of what is now the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq.</p><p>While the KDP and PUK agreed to share power, they experienced rifts and at times engaged in armed fighting with each other between 1994 and 1998.</p><p>However, in 2003, the two groups cooperated with the US to unseat Hussein. The KRG, led by Masoud Barzani, ruled three provinces: Duhok, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. In 2005, Talabani became Iraq’s first Kurdish president.</p><p>In 2017, the KRG held an independence referendum in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region and in disputed, Kurdish-claimed territories such as Kirkuk, which is south of Erbil in northern Iraq. More than <a href=\"/news/2017/9/27/iraqi-kurds-overwhelmingly-back-split-from-baghdad\">90 percent</a> of voters backed independence, but Baghdad rejected the poll as <a href=\"/news/2017/11/6/baghdad-court-rules-secession-attempt-unconstitutional\">illegal.</a></p><p>The Iraqi Supreme Court ruled that the referendum was contrary to the Iraqi Constitution, which calls for the preservation of Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity.</p><p>Iraqi forces then moved in and retook Kirkuk and other disputed, fragmented areas, depriving the Kurds of key oil revenues and dealing a major blow to their ambitions for statehood.</p><p>In the aftermath of that, Masoud resigned as regional president, and the post remained vacant until 2019, when his nephew, Nechirvan Barzani, was elected president of the KRG.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In the nuclear age, the United States has to refrain from all-out war since it can easily lead to nuclear escalation. Instead, it wages hybrid wars.</p><p>In recent weeks, we have witnessed two such conflicts: in Venezuela and Iran. Both have been waged through a combination of crushing economic sanctions, targeted military strikes, cyberwarfare, stoking unrest and unrelenting misinformation campaigns. Both are long-term CIA projects that have recently escalated. Both will lead to further chaos.</p><p>The US has long had two goals vis-a-vis Venezuela: to gain control over its vast oil reserves in the Orinoco Belt and to overthrow its leftist government, which has been in power since 1999. America’s hybrid war against Venezuela dates to 2002 when the CIA helped to support a coup attempt against President Hugo Chavez. When that failed, the US ramped up other hybrid measures, including economic sanctions, the confiscation of Venezuela’s dollar reserves and measures to cripple Venezuela’s oil production, which eventually collapsed. Despite the chaos sown by the US, the hybrid war did not bring down the government.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has now escalated to bombing Caracas, kidnapping President Nicolas Maduro, stealing Venezuelan oil shipments and imposing a naval blockade, which, of course, is an act of war. It also seems likely that Trump is thereby enriching powerful pro-Zionist campaign funders who have their eyes on seizing Venezuelan oil assets.</p><p>Zionist interests also have their eye on toppling the Venezuelan government since it has long supported the Palestinian cause and maintained close relations with Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cheered on the US attack on Venezuela, calling it the “perfect operation”.</p><p>The United States along with Israel is also simultaneously escalating its ongoing hybrid war against Iran. We can expect US and Israeli subversion, air strikes and targeted assassinations. The difference with Venezuela is that the hybrid war on Iran can easily escalate into a devastating regional war, even a global one. US allies in the region, especially the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/16/gulf-countries-gear-up-diplomacy-to-stave-off-us-iran-escalation\">Gulf countries</a>, have been engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts to persuade Trump to back down and avoid military action.</p><p>The war on Iran has a history even longer than the war on Venezuela. The first US intervention in the country dates back to 1953 when democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh nationalised Iran’s oil in defiance of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (today’s BP).</p><p>The CIA and MI6 orchestrated Operation Ajax to depose Mossadegh through a mix of propaganda, street violence and political interference. They reinstated Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who had fled the country, fearing Mossadegh, and helped the shah solidify his grip on power. The CIA also supported the shah by helping create his notorious secret police, SAVAK, which crushed dissent through surveillance, censorship, imprisonment and torture.</p><p>Eventually this repression led to a revolution that swept Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power in 1979. During the revolution, students seized US hostages in Tehran after the US admitted the shah for medical treatment, leading to fear that the US would try to reinstall him in power. The hostage crisis further poisoned the relations between Iran and the US.</p><p>From then onwards, the US has plotted to torment Iran and overthrow its government. Among the countless hybrid actions the US has undertaken was funding Iraq in the 1980s to wage war on Iran, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths but failing to topple the government.</p><p>The US-Israeli objective vis-a-vis Iran is the opposite of a negotiated settlement that would normalise its position in the international system while constraining its nuclear programme. The real objective is to keep Iran economically broken, diplomatically cornered and internally pressured. Trump has repeatedly undercut negotiations that could have led to peace, starting with his withdrawal from the 2016 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement that had seen Iran’s nuclear energy activities monitored and economic sanctions removed.</p><p>Understanding the hybrid war tactics helps to explain why Trump’s rhetoric oscillates so abruptly between threats of war and false offers of peace. Hybrid warfare thrives on contradictions, ambiguities and outright deceit.</p><p>Last summer, the US was supposed to have negotiations with Iran on June 15 but supported Israel’s bombing of the country two days earlier. For this reason, signs of de-escalation in recent days should not be taken at face value. They can all too readily be followed by a direct military attack.</p><p>The examples of Venezuela and Iran demonstrate just how addicted the US and Israel are to hybrid warfare. Acting together, the CIA, Mossad, allied military contractors and security agencies have fomented turmoil across Latin America and the Middle East for decades.</p><p>They have upended the lives of hundreds of millions of people, blocked economic development, created terror and generated mass refugee waves. They have nothing to show for spending billions on covert and overt operations beyond the chaos itself.</p><p>There is no security, no peace, no stable pro-US or pro-Israel alliance, only suffering. In the process, the US is also going out of its way to undermine the United Nations Charter, which it brought to life in the aftermath of World War II. The UN Charter makes clear that hybrid warfare violates the very basis of international law, which calls on countries to refrain from the use of force against other countries.</p><p>There is one beneficiary of hybrid war, and that is the military-tech industrial complex in the US and Israel. US President Dwight Eisenhower warned us in his 1961 farewell address of the profound danger of the military-industrial complex to society. His warning has come to pass even more than he imagined as it is now powered by artificial intelligence, mass propaganda and a reckless US foreign policy.</p><p>The world’s best hope is that the other 191 countries of the UN besides the US and Israel finally say no to their addiction to hybrid war: no to regime-change operations, no to unilateral sanctions, no to the weaponisation of the dollar and no to the repudiation of the UN Charter.</p><p>The American people do not support the lawlessness of their own government, but they have a very hard time making their opposition heard. They and almost all the rest of the world want the US deep state brutality to end before it’s too late.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

His decision to step down was prompted by what he described as the “political and media frenzy” surrounding the ban on Israeli fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv from their team’s match with Aston Villa in Birmingham.</p><p>Days earlier, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood publicly stated that she had “lost confidence” in Guildford’s leadership after sustained political and media pressure; it was the first time in two decades a home secretary has done so. Ministers and much of the media framed the ban as a moral outrage, even a national disgrace.</p><p>This was not a scandal involving corruption, brutality or police cover-ups but a risk assessment. The British media and public officials tore apart the internal advice on which the decision to bar Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from Villa Park in November was based. In doing so, the British state in effect sided with the fans of an Israeli football club against its own police.</p><p>West Midlands Police later acknowledged errors in its assessment. Those mistakes should be noted but be kept in proportion. They do not amount to proof of bad faith, conspiracy or prejudice. An independent review found no evidence that officers were influenced by anti-Semitism or malign intent – a finding that has been largely drowned out by the public outrage machine.</p><p>What has also been consistently erased from media coverage is context. A hooligan element within Maccabi Tel Aviv’s fanbase has a long, well-documented history of violent and racist behaviour, including explicitly anti-Palestinian chants. This is neither a marginal claim nor a recent invention. It has been acknowledged for decades, including within Israel itself.</p><p>The police risk assessment was informed by violence surrounding a Maccabi Tel Aviv match in Amsterdam in 2024 when unrest spilled into the city, locals were attacked, racist chants glorifying the Israeli military were heard and Palestinian symbols were targeted. This took place amid Israel’s genocide in Gaza at a time of intense global anger over its mass killing, displacement and starvation. Against that backdrop, the decision to err on the side of caution was neither shocking nor sinister. It was policing.</p><p>Anti-Semitism is real, dangerous and rising globally, and it must be confronted seriously. But collapsing Jewish identity into support for an Israeli football club and treating any scrutiny of its fanbase as suspect does nothing to combat anti-Semitism. Instead, it weaponises it while casting suspicion on Muslim communities and eroding trust in public institutions.</p><p>What makes the political reaction to this case even more revealing is that banning football supporters on safety grounds is not unusual in the UK. British authorities have routinely barred British fans from attending matches at home or abroad based on reputations for violence and disorder.</p><p>These collective, preventive measures have long been accepted as normal public-order policing. No ministers have cried discrimination. No police chiefs have been hounded. No national crisis has been declared.</p><p>The difference here is not principle. It is politics.</p><p>For Palestinians, this episode fits a broader and painfully familiar pattern. For more than two years, Israel has carried out a genocide in Gaza: tens of thousands of people killed, most of the population displaced, homes, hospitals, schools and universities destroyed, and starvation imposed as a method of warfare. International legal experts and human rights organisations have warned of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Britain’s response has been consistent: delay, equivocation and protection.</p><p>There has been no arms embargo. No sanctions. No meaningful accountability for Israel.</p><p>The pattern revealed in Birmingham is the same one that shapes Britain’s response to Gaza. When Israeli interests are inconvenienced, the state mobilises. When Palestinians are killed, it urges restraint. When those in Britain attempt to obstruct the supply chains of genocide, they are prosecuted. Some now sit in prison. Some are on hunger strike.</p><p>This is the reality facing Palestine Action activists today. And it is why the question at the heart of this story cannot be avoided.</p><p>If the British government cannot tolerate a policing decision that inconveniences an Israeli football club, it will never confront Israel over mass killing. If it is willing to undermine its own institutions to demonstrate loyalty, it will not deliver justice to those who challenge that impunity.</p><p>The football controversy matters not because of what happened at a stadium in Birmingham but because it exposes how power works. It shows whose fears are treated as legitimate, whose suffering demands action and whose lives can be explained away.</p><p>For Palestinians, the message is unmistakable. Justice, under these conditions, is not delayed. It is denied.</p><p data-start=\"10598\" data-end=\"11116\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The more insidious columns in the form ask the respondents to declare if they have relatives abroad, the “outfit” they are associated with, or even the model of their mobile phone and their social media handles.</p><p>A similar form has also been shared with the people running “madrasas” (religious schools) in the region.</p><p>“This is not a place where you can live in peace. Every now and then, we are asked to fill out one form or another,” Nawaz, 41, told Al Jazeera as he sat inside his grocery shop in Jawahar Nagar area of Srinagar.</p><p>“They are asking for unusually detailed information about religious institutions and those linked to them. The form seeks details about sectarian affiliation, funding sources, land ownership, charitable activities, and much more,” he said.</p><p>“I do not understand why the police need this much personal information.

He also received the form but has not filled it in yet due to privacy concerns.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“If this were just paperwork, the police would not have been asking for so many personal details again and again,” Mir, 38, told Al Jazeera.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“They also want information about relatives who live outside Kashmir or even outside India. These are private family matters and not things meant for police records … When the authorities start asking for such details at this level, it makes you worry about how the information might be used later.”</p><p>The Himalayan region of Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan, who control parts of it and have fought three wars over it since their independence from British rule in 1947. China also controls a sliver of Kashmir’s land.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><a href=\"/news/2023/12/11/whats-article-370-what-to-know-about-india-top-court-verdict-on-kashmir\">Article 370</a> of the Indian Constitution granted Indian-administered Kashmir partial autonomy over matters related to education, employment and land ownership. In 2019, however, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s right-wing government scrapped the law and divided the region into two federally-governed territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.</p><p>Since then, New Delhi’s direct control over Kashmir has seen restrictions on religious freedoms, including the denial of other rights.</p><p>The region’s main mosque, Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid, was <a href=\"/news/2021/12/16/india-kashmir-srinagar-jamia-mosque-religious-freedom-muslims\">shut for nearly two years</a> in the aftermath of the 2019 move, and still sees frequent closures and limits on the number of people allowed to congregate for Eid prayers.</p><p>India says the restrictions are temporary, calling them preventive measures to maintain law and order and curb “cross-border militancy” – a reference to Pakistan’s alleged support for Kashmiri rebels. Pakistan rejects India’s allegation, saying it provides only diplomatic backing to the Kashmiris’ struggle for self-determination.</p><p>A political analyst told Al Jazeera the profiling of mosques raises serious questions about privacy and <a href=\"/news/2023/9/22/kashmirs-top-pro-freedom-cleric-leads-friday-prayers-after-four-years\">religious freedom</a>.</p><p>“A balanced approach is needed, with clear rules, transparency, judicial oversight and involvement of local communities to maintain trust while ensuring security for everyone,” he said on condition of anonymity over fears of reprisals from the authorities.</p><p>“Many people also see the exercise as discriminatory, saying it places pressure on Muslim institutions without similar scrutiny of other faiths.”</p><h2 id=\"turning-mosques-into-crime-scenes\">‘Turning mosques into crime scenes’</h2><p class=\"pf0\">Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of the region who once led a coalition government with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), criticised the police exercise, calling it “discriminatory” and aimed at “creating fear among Muslims”.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“By doing so, they are turning mosques into crime scenes. Can the government do the same with [Hindu] temples, [Sikh] gurdwaras or churches?” she asked, holding a copy of the police form during a news conference in Srinagar.</p><p class=\"pf0\">Imran Nabi Dar, spokesman for the region’s governing party National Conference, said the party wants the profiling to stop. The region has had an elected government since 2024 – its first since the revocation of Article 370 in 2019 – but most executive powers rest with the New Delhi-appointed lieutenant governor.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“The authorities have already carried out several surveys in the Kashmir valley. There is no need to conduct another one unnecessarily,” Dar told Al Jazeera. “Once government representatives meet the lieutenant governor, we will raise the issue with him. We cannot stop the profiling ourselves because the police are not under our control, as Jammu and Kashmir is a union territory.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">Defending the profiling of mosques, Altaf Thakur, spokesman for the BJP in Kashmir, said surveillance was necessary for accountability and transparency.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“Past experience tells us that mosques were used in Kashmir by maulvis [prayer leaders] to ask people to come out and hold pro-Pakistan rallies. Though it was stopped in 2019, some elements still use mosques as a political platform and for propaganda,” he said.</p><p class=\"pf0\">“There is nothing wrong with finding out who funds mosques, the nature of the land they are built on, and the ideology they follow,” Thakur said. “We need to know what is taught in these mosques.”</p><p class=\"pf0\">Mir, the imam at the Lal Bazar mosque, fears the authorities would soon ask them to get their sermons approved by them before the prayers. “I can say we, the prayer leaders, will be asked to deliver mandatory Friday sermons only after getting approval from the concerned police station.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p><strong>Deir Az Zor, Syria</strong> – On the broad, windswept plains through which the Euphrates River snakes, the land remembers every war that has passed across it. The oil-rich soil of al-Omar, the turbines of the Tabqa Dam and the cautious return of families to towns long abandoned tell a story as old as Syria itself: one of power, survival and the struggle to unify a fractured country.</p><p>Over the weekend, Syrian government forces <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/syrian-forces-capture-tabqa-and-dam-amid-swift-raqqa-offensive\">seized</a> the al-Omar oilfield, the Conoco gas complex – both in Deir Az Zor governorate – and the Tabqa Dam, in Raqqa governorate. The operation was heralded as a military achievement, but its significance reaches far beyond maps and military lines. It touches the very structure of Syria’s political economy, the social contract between state and citizen and the fragile architecture of agreements meant to reconcile formerly hostile actors.</p><p>And the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which previously controlled the areas as well as all of northeastern Syria, soon realised the situation they faced. By Sunday evening, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/syria-announces-ceasefire-agreement-with-kurd-led-sdf-after-heavy-fighting\">announced</a> that a deal had been reached with the SDF.</p><p>“State institutions will enter the three eastern and northeastern governorates – Hasakah, Deir Az Zor and Raqqa,” al-Sharaa said.</p><h2 id=\"heartland-scarred-by-war\">Heartland scarred by war</h2><p>In eastern Syria, hydrocarbons have long been both a lifeblood and a driver of economic leverage.</p><p>Before the beginning of the conflict in 2011, oil and gas accounted for nearly 20 percent of Syria’s gross domestic product (GDP). During the war, these fields became the backbone of the fragmented war economy, exploited by armed groups and redirected to support local militias. Reclaiming these fields is therefore more than symbolic – it is a prerequisite for fiscal recovery.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Labib al-Nahhas, director of the Syrian Association for Citizens’ Dignity, said the rapid territorial losses suffered by the SDF echo the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December 2024.</p><p>“SDF are collapsing in a similar way to [the] regime in Damascus,” he said, arguing that al-Omar, Tabqa and Tishreen are pivotal for economic recovery, not only in terms of recovering resources such as oil and gas, but “because they will have a huge impact on prices and living conditions”.</p><p>Radwan Ziadeh, senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC (ACW), said controlling natural resources alone was not enough to help Syria move forward, but that it was a step in the right direction.</p><p>“It is still very early to say that there are tangible benefits from this advance,” he said.</p><p>“Oil- and gasfields require significant international investment to unlock their full potential. On their own, they cannot deliver recovery. [But] more importantly, this is a significant step towards unifying Syria. This is the first time the country has been unified under one government since 2013. Before that, Syria was divided between Free Syrian Army factions, the al-Assad government, and later ISIL [ISIS], which fragmented the country even further.”</p><h2 id=\"march-agreement\">March agreement</h2><p>In March 2025, Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the SDF who is also known as Mazloum Kobani, and al-Sharaa signed a framework agreement aimed at integrating the group into state structures while protecting local governance and Kurdish rights.</p><p>At the time, Abdi called it “a real opportunity to build a new Syria that embraces all its components”. He emphasised that “there will be no armies outside the state”, reflecting both acceptance of a unified military structure and persistent concern for Kurdish autonomy.</p><p>Al-Sharaa, meanwhile, presented the pact as an affirmation of state sovereignty first, rights second – a point that would prove decisive in the months ahead.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In November, al-Sharaa met United States President Donald Trump at the White House, and Syria became a partner in the war against ISIL. That essentially took the air from the SDF’s argument that it was the only US ally fighting against the armed group. The agreement also provided al-Sharaa’s forces with the opportunity to consolidate their deals with Arab fighters who wanted to switch sides – from the SDF to Damascus. And the Syrian president offered an olive branch to war-weary Kurdish civilians, many of whom also want an end to hostilities.</p><p>However, by late 2025, implementation of the government-SDF agreement lagged. Territorial and administrative disagreements grew, and the Syrian army advanced into SDF-controlled territory.</p><h2 id=\"tribes-decisive-role\">Tribes’ decisive role</h2><p>While foreign policy set the backdrop, local tribal dynamics have proved decisive in reshaping control. Over the past year, Damascus has invested heavily in courting Arab clans in Deir Az Zor and Raqqa who had grown disaffected with the SDF’s Kurdish-led administration. The tribes were also growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of implementation of the March agreement.</p><p>Participants at a January 17 meeting of tribal elders from Syria’s east reviewed the consequences of failing to implement the agreement’s provisions on time, including the potential political and security impacts on the region.</p><p>Several tribal sheikhs at the meeting emphasised the importance of preventing escalation, the necessity of adhering to agreements to achieve stability, and called on the SDF to implement the March deal. The tribes had made clear their dissatisfaction with the SDF, and once the opportunity presented itself, they moved to push the SDF out of their communities.</p><p>A source from the Syrian Tribal Forces, a coalition of Syrian Arab tribes, told Al Jazeera on Sunday: “Areas south of Hasakah, from Sur to al-Shaddadi, are free of SDF forces.”</p><h2 id=\"the-outside-influence\">The outside influence</h2><p>The unravelling of the March deal was also accelerated by changing regional dynamics. The US – a longstanding, primary military partner – narrowed its role to counter-ISIL operations, leaving the Kurdish-led forces without the external military help they had relied on. Without US enforcement, Damascus has had room to assert authority east of the Euphrates River, the backbone of the SDF’s territory.</p><p>Turkiye, for its part, has always remained wary of any SDF autonomy. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been quick to back al-Sharaa’s moves against the SDF and welcomed the news of Sunday’s deal.</p><p>The territory was taken from the SDF not just by force, but with the tacit consent of international and regional allies and communities weary of war, who felt disenfranchised as a result of Arab-Kurdish divisions.</p><h2 id=\"energy-water-as-levers-of-state-authority\">Energy, water as levers of state authority</h2><p>Control of the al-Omar oilfield, the Conoco gas complex and the Tabqa Dam is not just symbolic.</p><p>Tabqa Dam, the country’s largest hydroelectric facility, now governs power and irrigation across much of northern and eastern Syria. Electricity in this region is literally life-sustaining, powering hospitals, schools and industrial activity.</p><p>Yet the full potential of these assets remains unrealised. Reconstruction and international investment are necessary to convert regained infrastructure into long-term state capacity.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, the SDF’s loss of control over resource-rich areas reduces their financial independence and constrains governance in formerly autonomous zones. As ACW’s Ziadeh noted, this moment is less about immediate economic gain than the consolidation of state authority and territorial unification.</p><p>The SDF, it seems, will have to retreat from most Arab majority areas towards Hasakah governorate. That is where the historic roots of Syria’s Kurdish minority remain and provide the force with manpower, political backing and economic viability.</p><h2 id=\"human-and-social-changes\">Human and social changes</h2><p>The Syrian government’s advance eastwards is reshaping communities. Thousands have been displaced from Aleppo, Raqqa and Tabqa.<br>\nKurdish populations face the tension between guaranteed citizenship as promised by al-Sharaa in a presidential decree issued on January 16, and the erosion of the SDF’s political autonomy.</p><p>Arab tribes, meanwhile, are recalibrating alliances, balancing local interests with new state authority.</p><p>Main tribes, including al-Ukaidat, al-Bakara, al-Jabour, Anza, Shammar, Bani Khalid, al-Bu Shaaban, al-Buhamad and al-Baggara, essentially run the governorates of Deir Az Zor, Raqqa and Hasakah in northeastern Syria. Their loyalties are often transactional, depending on who runs that region. Al-Sharaa’s forces seem to have the upper hand now.</p><p>The social contract – fragile before the war – is being renegotiated in real time, amid both material deprivation and political promises.</p><p>To keep new allies happy and prevent defections, Damascus will have to care – and be seen to care, as well. The likelihood of more people tilting to the government’s side will depend on what kind of improvements they see in terms of security, inclusion and the economy.</p><p>Al-Nahhas expects the impact on living conditions would be “massive” but not immediate, stressing that expectation management is essential because recovery will take time. Central control and stability, he added, could incentivise foreign investment in oil, gas and electricity, provided corruption is minimised and governance improves.</p><p>He said after regaining vital energy sites, electricity costs and availability could also improve, but warned that outcomes depend on management – how quickly authorities can make facilities operational, given that infrastructure is not optimal, how effectively control is asserted, and how transparently assets are managed.</p><h2 id=\"no-oil-windfalls-soon\">No oil windfalls soon</h2><p>Mohamad Ahmad, economist and energy specialist at Karam Shaar Advisory Limited, said while the al-Omar field was “technically feasible for investment”, production had collapsed to about 14,200 barrels per day and reservoirs were stressed.</p><p>“The government’s recent takeover in late 2025 reclaims a critically impaired asset; its rehabilitation faces immense technical and financial hurdles, underscoring the long-term economic cost of the war,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Ahmad added that the capture of the oilfield highlights the depth of damage inflicted over the years of conflict.</p><p>“As Syria’s flagship oilfield, al-Omar’s trajectory from a high-potential asset to a war-torn symbol is both tragic and indicative of the conflict’s devastation,” he said.</p><p>“We’re looking at a field that once produced nearly 90,000 barrels per day, with original reserves of 760 million barrels of high-quality light crude. However, over a decade of conflict, which included its use as a financial engine for ISIS and subsequent targeted air strikes, has inflicted catastrophic damage – well over $800m – to its core infrastructure.”</p><h2 id=\"unification-still-fragile\">Unification still fragile</h2><p>In Deir Az Zor, Raqqa and Aleppo, energy infrastructure hums unevenly. Across the northeast, Syrians live between the promise of a unified government and the caution of decades of uncertainty – their future tethered to the intersection of energy, politics, and human resilience.</p><p>Yet economic realities, lingering distrust and complex foreign involvement mean that unification is precarious.</p><p>But for the first time since 2013, Syria is largely unified under a single government. Ziadeh added that the inclusion of Kurdish rights and social freedoms elevates this beyond a military or territorial achievement, “with the announcement to include Kurdish rights and social freedoms within the Syrian state framework, this is the first time we are seeing a unifying government in Syria. That is the most important takeaway from this rapid advance.”</p><p>The Syrian government’s battlefield advances demonstrate the return of central authority, the partial reintegration of Kurdish and Arab actors, and the resumption of control over key economic lifelines. Tribal councils have praised inclusive decrees; Abdi continues to navigate a shifting political landscape; and al-Sharaa asserts sovereignty with inclusion.</p><p>But the recovery of Syria’s northeast is not merely about military gains or legal decrees. It is about rebuilding trust, maintaining local support, and carefully managing the delicate balance between unity and autonomy. The oil, the dam, the gas, and the laws are all symbols of what is possible – but also reminders of how tenuous state power remains in a land long fractured by war.</p><p>In Syria, the Euphrates is both witness and arbiter – it remains to be seen whether its eastern and western banks could work together for a united Syria after more than five decades of being ruled by the al-Assad family.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Those contracts can then be extended to indefinite professional service.</p><p>“The pay is 2,600 euros ($3,000), and because housing is free, medical insurance is free, they will end up having something like 2,300 euros ($2,700) after taxes and deductions. It’s a lot of money for young people,” said Graf.</p><p>Germany has made a NATO commitment to reach 260,000 active duty personnel by 2035, and to double its reservists to 200,000. This would bring it close to the half-million-strong army it had at the end of the Cold War.</p><p>The news has discomfited Moscow.</p><p>“Germany’s new government is speeding up preparations for a full-scale military confrontation with Russia,” Russia’s ambassador to Germany, Sergey Nechayev, told the German news portal Apolut in an interview last month.</p><p>From the German point of view, however, it is Russia’s refusal to withdraw from Ukraine that has fuelled the political will to spend 108 billion euros ($125bn) to rebuild the armed forces this year, equivalent to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and more than twice the 2021 budget of 48 billion euros ($56bn).</p><p>“Just in one year, we have gone from 58 percent to 65 percent support of an increase in more defence spending,” said Graf.</p><p>By 2030, Germany is to spend 3.5 percent of its GDP on defence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to a December survey by Politbarometer, a German election poll and television programme, eight out of 10 Germans are now convinced Russian President Vladimir Putin is not serious about pursuing a peace agreement in the war in Ukraine, and many have begun to believe intelligence officials’ warnings that Russia plans to eventually expand its war to NATO countries.</p><p>The year “2029 has been presented as a possible date for Russia to attack NATO, and that has become the reference date for people”, Graf said. “We can see over the last four years of this war that we’ve been sleepwalking, not understanding the gravity of the situation. Europe’s future is at stake here.”</p><h2 id=\"germans-lose-faith-in-trump-s-us\">Germans lose faith in Trump’s US</h2><p>The threat perception from Russia is only one side of the equation. German society has found its loss of faith in the United States over the past year equally transformative.</p><p>A poll conducted by the state channel ZDF in June 2025 asked Germans, “Will the USA continue to guarantee Europe’s security as part of NATO?” Seventy-three percent said no. By December, this majority had risen to 84 percent.</p><p>Nine out of 10 Germans now see US political influence in Europe as pernicious, evidently fearing the open encouragement of far-right, Russia-friendly parties, as happened in <a href=\"/news/2025/1/31/is-elon-musk-a-nazi-and-can-he-get-european-far-right-hardliners-elected\">Germany’s federal election</a> in February last year.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4250392\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4250392\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4250392\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-17T153936Z_1663989799_RC2FIIAPV4W4_RTRMADP_3_GERMANY-POLITICS-MERZ-1768771497.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius talks with Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, following the December 15 meeting between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, European leaders, and EU, NATO and U.S. representatives, in Berlin, Germany, December 17, 2025.

So then it would be a more niche thing to do, maybe more for people on the right side of the political spectrum,” Minna Alander, a fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis specialising in security and defence, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Well-educated Germans, older Germans, grew up hearing about how terrible Nazi Germany was,” said General Hodges, who now lives in Germany. “And for older Germans who were children during the war, the absolute worst nightmare for them would be a war with Russia, or without the United States.”</p><p>But perceptions have changed rapidly since 2022.</p><p>Merz <a href=\"/news/2025/2/25/germanys-centrists-bang-heads-together-on-defence-immigration-economy\">came to power</a> condemning both Moscow and Washington, demanding “independence” from the US.</p><p>By the time he assumed office, parliament had already approved a suspension of constitutional <a href=\"/news/2025/2/21/debt-brake-how-this-fiscal-rule-could-shape-germanys-election\">deficit limits</a> to give him an enormous, permanent increase in defence spending. Last month, parliament approved roughly $60bn in defence procurements.</p><h2 id=\"we-never-rely-on-european-processes\">‘We never rely on European processes’</h2><p>Analysts believe pro-Kremlin narratives will still seek to exploit whatever latent scepticism exists.</p><p>“Sensitivity over conscription is something that Russians are packaging into their propaganda narratives to many societies in Europe,” said Victoria Vdovychenko, a hybrid warfare expert at Cambridge University’s Centre for Geopolitics.</p><p>“Germany is one of them, so basically, you’re going to see a spike in news in terms of how bad it is that the Germans are sending in the kids to be killed,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>She is also wary of the time it will take for money and political will to translate into industrial capacity and force.</p><p>Scholz pledged to create a brigade to defend the Suwalki gap, a vulnerable neck of Lithuanian land sandwiched between Belarus and Kaliningrad, a Russian-held territory on the Baltic Sea, but recruiting, training and equipping it is still under way.</p><p>“We are not stupid people, so we never rely on European processes, [the notion that] anyone will come as a god to help us,” said Vdovychenko, who is Ukrainian. “We definitely understand, it’s our people who will be always at the forefront.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Iranian officials have rejected both claims.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-us-and-israel-saying\">What are the US and Israel saying?</h2><p>US and Israeli officials have been openly touting the potential for toppling the theocratic leadership in Tehran over recent months, including during the 12-day war in June.</p><p>At the height of the protests, Trump urged Iranians to remain in the streets, alleging “help is on the way”, before expressing “great respect” for the Iranian leadership based on a claim that planned executions for more than 800 political prisoners were halted.</p><p>The US president “speaks a lot of nonsense”, Tehran prosecutor Ali Salehi said on Saturday in reaction to the claim, adding that “our response will be deterring and quick”.</p><p>But Trump has not stopped his comments, and on Saturday called for the end of Khamenei’s 37-year rule and branded the Iranian leader a “sick man”.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refrained from directly commenting on the protests. Israeli public broadcaster Kan reported that Netanyahu ordered his officials to stop giving interviews on the subject after Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said last week that Israeli operatives are active in Iran “right now” as they were during the 12-day war.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
