            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"387\" data-end=\"871\">For the past 25 years, Somalia’s political transitions have not succeeded by accident. They were sustained through international engagement, pressure, and mediation aimed at preserving fragile political settlements. Today, however, Somalia stands at a dangerous crossroads. The federal government’s unilateral pursuit of power, cloaked in the language of democratic reform, threatens to trigger a legitimacy crisis and undo decades of political gains and international investment.</p><p data-start=\"873\" data-end=\"1168\">Universal suffrage is an ideal that all Somalis share. However, deep political disagreement among groups, persistent security challenges, the looming expiry of the government’s mandate, and financial constraints make the timely implementation of universal suffrage nearly impossible.</p><p data-start=\"1170\" data-end=\"1442\">Pursuing universal suffrage without political consent, institutional readiness, or minimum security guarantees does not deepen democracy or sovereignty; it concentrates power in the hands of incumbents while increasing the risk of fragmentation and parallel authority.</p><p data-start=\"1444\" data-end=\"1954\">Instead of addressing these constraints through consensus, the government is engaged in a power grab, deploying the rhetoric of universal suffrage. It has unilaterally changed the constitution, which forms the basis of the political settlement. It has also enacted self-serving laws governing electoral processes, political parties, and the Election and Boundaries Commission. Moreover, the government has appointed 18 commissioners, all backed by the ruling Justice and Solidarity Party (JSP).</p><p data-start=\"1956\" data-end=\"2476\">Meanwhile, Somaliland announced its secession in 1991 and has been seeking recognition for the last three and a half decades. Most of Somalia’s national opposition, along with the leaders of Puntland and Jubbaland Federal Member States, have rejected the government’s approach and formed the Council for the Future of Somalia. These groups have announced plans to organise a political convention in Somalia, signalling their intent to pursue a parallel political process if the government does not listen.</p><p data-start=\"2478\" data-end=\"2874\">The Federal Government of Somalia does not fully control the country. Al-Shabab controls certain regions and districts and retains the ability to conduct operations well beyond its areas of direct control. Recently, the hardline group attacked a prison located near Villa Somalia, a stark reminder of the fragile security environment in which any electoral process would have to take place.</p><p data-start=\"2876\" data-end=\"3496\">Given the extent of polarisation and the limited time remaining under the current mandate, the international community must intervene to support Somalia’s sixth political transition in 2026. The most viable way to ensure a safe transition is to promote an improved indirect election model. Somalia’s political class has long experience with indirect elections, having relied on this model five times over the past 25 years. However, even with political agreement, the improved indirect election model for the 2026 dispensation must meet standards of timeliness, feasibility, competitiveness, and inclusivity.</p><p data-start=\"3498\" data-end=\"4091\">The current government mandate expires on May 15, 2026, and discussions are already under way among government supporters about a unilateral term extension. This must be discouraged. If a political agreement is reached in time, some form of technical extension may be necessary, but this should only occur while the 2026 selection and election processes are actively under way. One way to avoid this recurring crisis would be to establish a firm and binding deadline for elections. Puntland, for example, has maintained a schedule of elections held every five years in January.</p><p data-start=\"4093\" data-end=\"4572\">The improved indirect election model must also be feasible, meaning it should be straightforward to understand and implement. Political groups could agree on a fixed number of delegates to elect each seat. Recognised traditional elders from each constituency would then select delegates. Delegates from a small cluster of constituencies would collaborate to elect candidates for those seats. This system is far from ideal, but it is workable under current conditions.</p><p data-start=\"4574\" data-end=\"5134\">Unlike previous attempts, the improved indirect election model must also be genuinely competitive and inclusive. In past elections, politicians manipulated parliamentary selection by restricting competition through a practice known as “Malxiis” (bestman). The preferred candidate introduces a bestman, someone who pretends to compete but is never intended to win. For the upcoming election, the process must allow candidates to compete meaningfully rather than symbolically. A clear threshold of “no manipulation” and “no bestman” must be enforced.</p><p data-start=\"5136\" data-end=\"5646\">Inclusivity remains another major concern. Women’s seats, which should account for about 30 percent of parliament, have frequently been undermined. Any political agreement must include a clear commitment to inclusivity, and the institutions overseeing the election must be empowered to enforce the women’s quota. Government leaders have also arbitrarily managed seats allocated to Somaliland representatives. Given the unique political circumstances, a separate, negotiated, and credible process is required.</p><p data-start=\"5648\" data-end=\"6164\">Finally, widespread corruption has long tainted Somalia’s selection and election processes, undermining their integrity. In 2022, the presidents of the Federal Member States managed and manipulated the process. To curb corruption in the 2026 improved indirect election model, one effective measure would be to increase the number of voters per seat by aggregating constituencies. In practice, this would mean combined delegates from several constituencies voting together, reducing opportunities for vote buying.</p><p data-start=\"6166\" data-end=\"6644\">The international community has previously pressured Somali political actors to reach an agreement, insisting there should be “no term extension or unilateral elections by the government” and “no parallel political projects by the opposition”. This approach, combined with the leverage the international community still holds, can be effective. Somalia’s political class must again be pushed into serious, structured negotiations rather than unilateral manoeuvres.</p><p data-start=\"6646\" data-end=\"6982\">As before, the international community should clearly define political red lines. The government must refrain from any term extensions or unilateral election projects. At the same time, the opposition must abandon plans for a parallel political agenda, including Federal Member States conducting elections outside a political agreement.</p><p data-start=\"6984\" data-end=\"7494\">Somalis have repeatedly demonstrated their democratic aspirations. What stands in the way is not public will, but elite polarisation and the instrumentalisation of reform for political survival. At this critical moment, the international community cannot afford to retreat into passivity. Proactive and principled engagement is essential to prevent a legitimacy collapse, safeguard the gains of the past 25 years, and protect the substantial investments made in peacebuilding and state-building in Somalia.</p><p data-start=\"6984\" data-end=\"7494\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

My family and I have herded reindeer for generations. It is not just our livelihood, but an integral part of Sami culture – a way of life built on respect for nature, community and continuity. We make our living from the land, and we are proud of who we are and what we do.</p><p data-start=\"1028\" data-end=\"1080\">Today, that way of life is under serious threat.</p><p data-start=\"1082\" data-end=\"1511\">The Norwegian government is planning to build several hundred wind turbines on our grazing lands. These projects would disrupt reindeer migration routes, damage fragile ecosystems and undermine the very foundations of Sami reindeer herding. I am speaking out because if this goes ahead, we risk losing not just our income, but our culture. This is why I am part of Amnesty International’s <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/write-for-rights/\">Write for Rights</a> campaign this year.</p><p data-start=\"1513\" data-end=\"1845\">I grew up in a small place called Tana, where there were just 12 children in my school class. Of the five of us who were Sami, two came from families of reindeer herders. At the time, I believed the rest were Norwegian. Later, I learned that everyone in my class was Sami. Their parents had been pressured to hide who they were.</p><p data-start=\"1847\" data-end=\"2272\">When I was at school, the Norwegian state wanted all Sami people to be known simply as Norwegian. We were forced to speak the national language instead of our own. We were not allowed to speak Sami in school or sing Sami songs. At one point, even our traditional drum — used to connect with nature’s spirits — was banned by the church. These policies were designed to erase us, and they left deep scars that remain today.</p><p data-start=\"2274\" data-end=\"2564\">Thankfully, my parents allowed me to speak Sami at home, even though it was considered a forbidden language. I have always been proud of my heritage, but many others were denied that opportunity. We have struggled for decades to reclaim rights that should never have been taken from us.</p><p data-start=\"2566\" data-end=\"2877\">I decided early on that I wanted to become a reindeer herder. It felt natural, rooted in the life I knew and loved. My husband and I married young and chose to follow in our ancestors’ footsteps. For a long time, we lived peacefully, believing that we would continue this life as generations before us had done.</p><p data-start=\"2879\" data-end=\"2909\">That peace has not lasted.</p><p data-start=\"2911\" data-end=\"3319\">Today, the government is taking our land. This will have a devastating effect on our income and on the reindeer themselves. From winter to spring, the reindeer graze in one area before migrating for the summer. They migrate on their own and give birth in the same place every year. Our role as herders is to follow them, not to control them. When migration routes are broken, the entire system collapses.</p><p data-start=\"3321\" data-end=\"3634\">In 2023, several hundred wind turbines were suddenly proposed directly on our summer grazing lands in Corgas. These plans threaten to destroy grazing areas, sever migration routes and undermine ancient herding traditions. Despite fierce opposition from Sami communities, the authorities are rushing approvals.</p><p data-start=\"3636\" data-end=\"4018\">We know what wind turbines do to reindeer. The animals avoid the areas entirely. If these projects go ahead, the land will become unusable. While the Norwegian state claims ownership of the land, the Sami people were granted the right to use it hundreds of years ago. Now, that right is being pushed aside in favour of industrial development. Our children risk being left with nothing.</p><p data-start=\"4020\" data-end=\"4410\">Reindeer herding sustains our community in many ways. The reindeer provide meat and materials for traditional handicrafts. My family also runs a small company that shares Sami knowledge and culture with visitors. Every year, about 4,000 people from all over the world come to learn about our way of life. If these wind farms are built, we risk losing everything we have built together.</p><p data-start=\"4412\" data-end=\"4979\">What makes this even harder to accept is the justification. We are told this is about green energy and the future. But at what cost, and to whom? Norway already has abundant electricity. Why is nature valued only when it can be exploited? We are the ones living with the effects of climate change. When I was growing up, winter temperatures could reach minus 40 degrees Celsius (minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit). Today, winters are warmer. Sometimes it rains instead of snow, forming ice that prevents reindeer from accessing food. We need this land to survive a changing climate, not to sacrifice it.</p><p data-start=\"4981\" data-end=\"5259\">For more than a year, I have been fighting to defend our land and our community. I attend meetings with energy companies to explain how wind turbines will harm our livelihoods and the animals. I try to make our case to government officials, but it feels like no one is listening.</p><p data-start=\"5261\" data-end=\"5541\">Seven wind farm projects are now planned, involving hundreds of turbines. I have explained again and again what this will mean for us, yet the decisions seem already made. I feel like I am losing my life to this fight, simply to protect what should never have been threatened.</p><p data-start=\"5543\" data-end=\"5743\">I have three children and eight grandchildren. I worry deeply about the future they are being forced to inherit. Young people should not have to grow up constantly fighting for the right to exist.</p><p data-start=\"5745\" data-end=\"6067\">This struggle has taken a toll on my mental health. Some days, I am still trying to understand how to survive what is happening. My community supports me as best they can. They tell me I am strong, and their support gives me strength. I am not doing this only for my own family. I am doing it for the entire community.</p><p data-start=\"6069\" data-end=\"6282\">I will not stop. I protest outside government buildings with friends. We go together, because solidarity matters. I cannot sit back and watch our land be taken. As long as I have the strength to fight, I will.</p><p data-start=\"6284\" data-end=\"6500\">I have always been an activist. When I was six years old, I fought to speak Sami at school. I wanted it to be our first language, not our second, and I was not afraid to say so. That fight has never really ended.</p><p data-start=\"6502\" data-end=\"6821\">I am grateful that Amnesty International is <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/petition/help-ellinor-protect-her-ancestral-lands/\">supporting our case</a> today. Their solidarity reminds me that we are not invisible, even when our own government treats us as if we are. This is our life. I do not know another way of living. We must protect our land so that future generations can continue to live as Sami.</p><p data-start=\"6502\" data-end=\"6821\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Previously, the arts complex was slated to be called the “National Cultural Center”.</p><p>The Kennedy Center, the congressional act proclaimed, would serve as a “living memorial” to the late president. The act noted that Kennedy had been “particularly devoted to the advancement of the performing arts”.</p><p>“It is only fitting and proper that a suitable monument be dedicated to the memory of this great leader,” the act read, adding that no other memorial would be erected in Kennedy’s honour in Washington, DC.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4160087\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4160087\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4160087\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/afp_6936d48284f4-1765201026.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 07: U.S. President Donald Trump attends the 48th annual Kennedy Center Honors at the Kennedy Center on December 07, 2025 in Washington, DC.

Since taking office in January, he has also teased plans to raise a triumphal arch in the capital, similar in style to Paris’s Arc de Triomphe.</p><p>Just this month, the US Department of State <a href=\"https://x.com/StateDept/status/1996368099160080884\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that a congressionally established think tank, the US Institute for Peace, had been renamed after Trump to honour “the greatest dealmaker in our nation’s history”.</p><p>The Trump administration had forcibly taken control of the institute in March, and leadership over the think tank remains the subject of an ongoing lawsuit. A federal judge in May, however, called the nonprofit’s seizure “unlawful”.</p><p>Trump has long had his eye on the Kennedy Center in particular, and changes to the art centre arrived quickly after the Republican president took office in January.</p><p>Just a week into Trump’s second term, the president of the Kennedy Center, Deborah Rutter, stepped down amid rumours of a pressure campaign.</p><p>By early February, Trump had announced a purge of the Kennedy Center’s board members, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113964959500715895\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">claiming</a> on social media that they stood against his “Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture”.</p><p>“At my direction, we are going to make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN,” he said, offering a twist on his “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.</p><p>He added that he would take the helm as the centre’s chairman, overseeing programming.</p><p>“Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP,” Trump wrote. “The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation. For the Kennedy Center, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”</p><p>The leadership shakeup was greeted by protests and cancellations, with touring productions of hit shows like the musical Hamilton and Fellow Travelers dropping out of the Kennedy Center’s lineup.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4183097\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4183097\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4183097\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25297585935508-1766090891.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Worker paints gold columns white at the Kennedy Center\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4183097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Worker Odden Shaw paints over a gold-colored column inside the Hall of Nations at the Kennedy Center on October 24 [Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"renaming-the-kennedy-center\">Renaming the Kennedy Center</h2><p>Still, in the months since, Trump has repeatedly referred to the arts institution as the “Trump-Kennedy Center”, signalling his desire to have his name etched on its marble facade.</p><p>He also selected the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual award given for lifetime achievement in US arts and culture.</p><p>While announcing the honorees in August, Trump gave a winking allusion to his petition to change the Kennedy Center’s name.</p><p>“GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115015798555807745\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his platform, Truth Social.</p><p>He also played up the changes he had made to the art centre’s structure, including by painting its formerly gold columns white.</p><p>“Tremendous work is being done, and money being spent, on bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment,” Trump wrote. “It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!”</p><p>Certain Republicans took up Trump’s call to rebaptise the art centre. Representative <a href=\"https://simpson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=401722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Simpson</a> of Idaho, for instance, introduced a bill that would name the complex’s opera house after First Lady Melania Trump.</p><p>Congressman Bob Onder of Missouri, meanwhile, put forward another piece of legislation to wipe Kennedy’s name away entirely, calling the art complex instead the “Donald J Trump Center for Performing Arts”.</p><p>But those kinds of proposals have met significant pushback, including from the surviving Kennedy family.</p><p>On Thursday, in the wake of Leavitt’s announcement, President Kennedy’s niece Maria Shriver expressed shock that the art centre might be renamed.</p><p>“Some things leave you speechless, and enraged, and in a state of disbelief. At times such as that, it’s better to be quiet. For how long, I can’t say,” she <a href=\"http://x.com/mariashriver/status/2001737390306791682\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>When similar proposals had been floated in the past, Shriver <a href=\"https://x.com/mariashriver/status/1949954611793842186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called</a> the idea “insane” and said, “It makes my blood boil.”</p><p>Jack Schlossberg, Kennedy’s grandson and a Democratic candidate for Congress in the 2026 midterms, appeared to question whether the White House’s announcement was even legitimate.</p><p>“Microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/JBKSchlossberg/status/2001728352030232609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Democrats likewise voiced outrage at the proposed name change, with some questioning if it was even legal, given the congressional act that gives the structure its name.</p><p>Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, for instance, called the initiative “deeply troubling”.</p><p>“Renaming the Kennedy Center to include a sitting or former president’s name, particularly one who is still a partisan political figure, undermines the purpose of the institution,” Cohen said in a <a href=\"https://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-cohen-urges-president-trump-reject-inappropriate-renaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>.</p><p>“The Kennedy Center should remain what it was always meant to be: a living memorial to President Kennedy and a cultural home for all Americans, not a vehicle for personal or political branding.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The British government wants these men and women to disappear quietly,” said Adayfi.</p><p>“This hunger strike is not about food, it’s about dignity and justice. It’s about remand being used as punishment. A system that believes that silence will protect it.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The administration of President Donald Trump has proposed a suite of new rules that seek to bar hospitals across the United States from performing gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth below 18 years of age.</p><p>On Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that one of the proposed rules would block hospitals and clinics from accessing its programmes if they chose to continue providing gender-affirming care.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>A second rule would prohibit federal Medicaid funds from going to gender-affirming procedures.</p><p>Both Medicare and Medicaid are forms of government-provided health insurance, offered to vulnerable groups. Medicaid primarily serves low-income households, while Medicare offers coverage to older Americans and people with disabilities.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hhs-acts-bar-hospitals-performing-sex-rejecting-procedures-children\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a>, the Trump administration noted that the vast majority of healthcare providers work with Medicare and Medicaid to provide health coverage for their patients. The proposed rule would therefore amount to a de facto ban on gender-affirming care.</p><p>“Nearly all US hospitals participate in Medicare and Medicaid,” the CMS statement reads.</p><p>“This action is designed to ensure that the US government will not be in business with organizations that intentionally or unintentionally inflict permanent harm on children.”</p><p>In addition to the two proposed rules, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr signed a declaration on Thursday rejecting gender-affirming care as detrimental to youth.</p><p>Under his orders, the Food and Drug Administration also issued notices to 12 manufacturers of chest binders — which flatten the upper torso, where breasts are — warning that marketing to transgender youth would be considered illegal under the current administration.</p><h2 id=\"diverging-from-medical-consensus\">Diverging from medical consensus</h2><p>The string of pronouncements marked the Trump administration’s latest broadside against transgender healthcare, despite repeated warnings from top medical associations that prohibiting such treatment could have devastating, lifelong consequences.</p><p>But in a news conference on Thursday, Kennedy, who has no formal medical training, lashed out against some of the country’s leading medical groups, accusing them of violating their professional duties.</p><p>“The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics peddled the lie that chemical and surgical sex-rejecting procedures could be good for children who suffer from gender dysphoria,” Kennedy said.</p><p>“They betrayed their Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. So-called gender-affirming care has inflicted lasting physical and psychological damage on vulnerable young people. This is not medicine. It is malpractice.”</p><p>CMS Director Mehmet Oz likewise accused healthcare practitioners of abusing patients’ trust by prescribing gender-affirming treatments. He suggested the motivation was not the patients’ health but rather profit.</p><p>“ The doctor can’t look them in the eyes and treat them like a child that’s confused and lost and needs help. They become an opportunity. They become eventually a victim,” Oz said.</p><p>“ Reasonable evidence-based objections that a child’s confusion might resolve over time have been ignored, even though it makes common sense.”</p><p>The Trump administration has taken a hardline against the transgender community, denying such an identity even exists.</p><p>Instead, upon taking office on January 20, Trump issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">executive order</a> announcing that the federal government would recognise only the concept of biological sex, not gender identity, and that people would be categorised as either male or female, according to their birth certificates.</p><p>The executive order also rejected transgender identity as a “false” concept.</p><h2 id=\"problem-that-does-not-actually-exist\">‘Problem that does not actually exist’</h2><p>Eight days later, on January 28, Trump followed that executive order with a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second one</a> that called on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to end practices it described as “the chemical and surgical mutilation of children”.</p><p>That order was cited as the basis for Thursday’s proposed rule and declarations to limit gender-affirming care.</p><p>But there is a wide consensus in the healthcare community that gender-affirming care can improve the health of transgender youth, including by lowering incidents of suicide, anxiety, self-harm and depression.</p><p>Gender-affirming care can take a range of forms, from surgery to puberty blockers, a treatment considered safe and reversible for children seeking to delay the onset of puberty.</p><p>Such treatments are recommended only after in-depth consultation with a trusted healthcare professional, and surgery is incredibly rare among transgender youth.</p><p>One 2024 study from Harvard University found that, for every 100,000 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 17, an average of 2.1 teenagers sought gender-affirming surgery, according to medical insurance claims from 2019.</p><p>That average dropped to 0.1 for teens between 13 and 14 years of age, and no cases were reported under the age of 12.</p><p>One of the study’s authors, Dannie Dai, said in a news release that the results suggested that “legislation blocking gender-affirming care among TGD [transgender and gender-diverse] youth is not about protecting children, but is rooted in bias and stigma”.</p><p>Dai added that such government actions seek “to address a perceived problem that does not actually exist”.</p><p>Shortly after Thursday’s announcements, groups like the Human Rights Campaign called on the public to voice their concern about the Trump administration’s proposed new rules.</p><p>“These rules now face a 60-day ‘comment period,’ where YOU can weigh in,” the Human Rights Campaign wrote on its social media.</p><p>“A large number of comments can slow it down, force changes, or lay the groundwork for future litigation. YOUR comments are where that starts.”</p><h2 id=\"congressional-actions-under-way\">Congressional actions under way</h2><p>Already, 27 states prohibit gender-affirming care for minors, including major population centres like Texas, Ohio and Florida.</p><p>As a result, the Human Rights Campaign estimates that, out of the 300,000 transgender youth in the US, nearly 40 percent live in a state where they cannot access the healthcare they may need.</p><p>Those state actions have been supported by actions on the federal level. In June, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority voted in a six-to-three decision to uphold Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors.</p><p>Just this week, on Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/2001325085848719846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bill</a> that would criminalise providing gender-affirming care for patients aged below 18. A total of 216 representatives, including several Democrats, voted in favour of sending the bill to the Senate, where it faces uncertain odds.</p><p>Another House bill, designed to cut off Medicaid benefits for transgender youth seeking gender-affirming care, is slated to be voted upon on Thursday.</p><p>While proponents fear youths may make healthcare decisions they come to regret later in life, advocates emphasise that some gender-affirming treatments, including puberty blockers, are reversible and that they can protect teenagers from physical and emotional harm.</p><p>Standing on the steps of Congress, Representative Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of the House, said she believes there is a gap in the public’s understanding of gender-affirming treatments.</p><p>“I get that it’s hard to understand this care and understand the need for it,” McBride told reporters. “But one of the things that gets so lost in this conversation is that the transgender adults of today were kids once. I was a kid once.”</p><p>“My biggest regret in life,” she continued, “is that I never had a childhood without that pain.”</p><p>McBride voted against the legislation and denounced the “hate” she felt motivated it. “Politicians should never insert themselves into the personal health care decisions of patients, parents, and their providers — and that includes trans Americans,” she later <a href=\"https://x.com/Rep_McBride/status/2001427693070430595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media.</p><p>Kennedy, meanwhile, told reporters that he anticipates lawsuits will challenge the Trump administration’s proposed changes.</p><p>“I think that’s going to happen. The number of lawsuits with my name on it right now is almost beyond counting,” he said.</p><p>He added that the Trump administration was confident it would win any lawsuits. “It’s a disgrace to the medical establishment that they let this go on for so long.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
