Or is that precisely what he and his fellow proponents of the ideology believe?</p><h2 id=\"how-did-christian-zionism-begin-and-what-are-its-tenets\">How did Christian Zionism begin, and what are its tenets?</h2><p>In 1878, William Blackstone, a student of the prominent American evangelist Dwight Moody and a believer in the biblical restoration of Israel, published a book titled Jesus Is Coming. The best-selling work popularised among Americans a belief held by some Christian leaders: that God had given the land of Israel to the Jewish people.</p><p>This conviction, often taken from a Protestant evangelical perspective, draws on the ancient biblical idea that, nearly four millennia ago, God promised the land to the Jews, who would rule it until the return of Jesus to Jerusalem for the rapture. According to this theology, Christians will be saved upon Christ’s return while non-Christians who do not convert will face damnation.</p><p>The most commonly quoted Bible verse relating to this covenant is Genesis 12:3, in which God tells Abraham: “I will bless those who bless you and I will curse those who curse you and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed,” according to the Religion Media Centre.</p><p>According to ChristianZionism.org, a website run by professors, pastors and leaders of church-related organisations, four themes can be found in Christian Zionist thought: One, the founding of today’s nation-state of Israel in 1948 marked the final human era and signals an end of times. Two, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East is a part of God’s plan with a great and final war preceding the second coming of Christ. Three, God’s covenant with Israel is eternal and unconditional. And four, failing to support Israel’s political dominance today will incur divine judgement.</p><p>Writer and historian David Swift said that although many Christians – evangelical or otherwise – supported the creation of Israel before 1948, they cannot be called Christian Zionists in the modern parlance.</p><p>“This is because Christian Zionism essentially fuses religious belief with a military, strategic and even economic programme,” Swift told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Specifically, Christian Zionism is not just the belief that the biblical land of Israel is the ordained country of the Jewish people but that it is in America’s strategic, military and economic interest to support the expansion of Israel.”</p><p>Fathi Nimer, a policy fellow at Al-Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy Network, described the movement as one that “translates into absolute unquestioning support for the Israeli regime”.</p><p>He described hearing a podcast about a Christian Zionist woman visiting Bethlehem who, after seeing the separation wall, Israeli soldiers and the harsh conditions in Palestinian refugee camps, remarked: “I feel bad for them, but scripture is scripture.”</p><p>“‘Scripture is scripture’ – that overrides everything,” Nimer told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“That’s why it’s such a powerful tool for brainwashing.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-many-american-christian-zionists-are-there\">How many American Christian Zionists are there?</h2><p>According to author and academic Tristan Sturm, the largest population of Christian Zionists is in the US, and it numbers more than 30 million. Most are affiliated with evangelical churches in the southeast and south-central regions, often referred to as the “Bible Belt”.</p><p>The biggest organisation is Christians United for Israel, which itself boasts 10 million members, Nimer said.</p><p>“They are overwhelmingly conservative Republicans, found mostly in the Bible Belt, but also other places in the United States, and they form one of the most formidable voting blocs in the Republican Party,” he said.</p><p>Swift stated that only a few million from this group, however, are “fully signed up to the political, military and religious aspects of Christian Zionism”.</p><h2 id=\"what-impact-do-christian-zionists-have-on-us-policy\">What impact do Christian Zionists have on US policy?</h2><p>Nimer argued that Christian Zionists are “deeply intertwined” with American politics. “A lot of the major donors to the Republican Party and also the Democratic Party are Christian Zionists,” Nimer said.</p><p>According to the analyst, Christian Zionists are a cornerstone of Israeli lobbying groups, ranging from the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/4/aipac-linked-pac-ups-pressure-on-moderate-us-democrat-in-new-strategy\">American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)</a> to the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/5/why-is-adl-the-jewish-advocacy-group-receiving-blowback-from-maga\">Anti-Defamation League</a>, “that work to spread the Israeli narrative” in American society.</p><p>Meanwhile, a lot of members of the US Congress are “openly” Christian Zionist, Nimer said.</p><p>“[Politicians like] Mike Huckabee, … they reached the highest echelons of the state. And they bring these beliefs into their politics, into their policies,” the analyst said.</p><p>US foreign policy on Israel is, therefore, heavily influenced and shaped around the underlying biblical premise that the Jewish people are divinely destined to be restored to Palestine, he argued.</p><p>“When it comes to Palestine and the region in general, as you see right now with the [potential] war in Iran, they’re saying that the ballistic missile programme is now on the table,” Nimer said.</p><p>“It has nothing to do with the nuclear deal, … but the idea is that Israel must be able to maintain its superiority over every country in the region, and that’s a decree by God because if Israel prospers, then that’s another step towards the end of the world.”</p><p>Christian Zionist groups have also backed Israel’s illegal settlement project in the occupied West Bank and other measures that they see as reinforcing Israeli Jewish sovereignty.</p><p>Furthermore, for two decades, organisations such as HaYovel have been bringing in hundreds of American Christian volunteers to work in Israeli settlement agricultural projects, especially during the genocidal war on Gaza, when Jewish Israelis were called for military duty. Many also strongly endorsed US President Donald Trump’s moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017.</p><p>Swift, however, said Christian Zionists have played only a minor role in shaping US support for Israel and their influence is waning.</p><p>He argued that while Christian Zionism is integrated with a “broader neoconservative foreign policy agenda” also tied to the “US defence industry and broader military-industrial complex”, the group does not have much influence in American politics, and, in fact, it is declining.</p><p>Traditionally, US government support for Israel was driven by Cold War considerations and by pressure from the Jewish community within the US and lobbying groups like AIPAC. What played less of a role was support for Israel from evangelical Christians and the smaller community of Christian Zionists, Swift said.</p><p>“The US president is finally de facto abandoning the previous theoretical support for a two-state solution – although not for Christian Zionist reasons. When Trump talks of ethnically cleansing Gaza and turning it into a beach resort, he uses the language of real estate, not the Old Testament,” the historian said.</p><p>According to the analysts, very representative.</p><p>“It is pretty representative: Christian Zionists derive their understanding of the proper borders of Israel from the same place as people like [Israeli National Security Minister] Itamar Ben-Gvir and [Israeli Finance Minister] Bezalel Smotrich: the Old Testament. Therefore, they think Israel should expand to include all of the territory of ‘biblical Israel’,” Swift said, referring to the far-right Israeli cabinet members who have worked to expand and protect Israeli settlements and outposts in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law.</p><p>Nimer said Huckabee’s statement is also not something that can be criticised within the Christian Zionist community.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to criticise that because it’s like you’re criticising prophecy and you’re criticising God and the return of Jesus,” he said.</p><p>Huckabee’s comments, therefore, come as no surprise despite infringing upon the sovereignty of US allies in the Middle East, Nimer said.</p><p>On Monday, Smotrich said Israel would eventually occupy the Gaza Strip and establish a Jewish settlement there despite a “ceasefire” that went into effect in October.</p><p>“We are giving US President Donald Trump the opportunity to do it in his own way. If he does not succeed in eliminating Hamas, the Israeli army will get international legitimacy and American support to do it,” he said in statements to Israeli radio.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-do-jewish-israelis-view-christian-zionists\">How do Jewish Israelis view Christian Zionists?</h2><p>Mimi Kirk, the director of the Institute for the Study of Christian Zionism and the associate director of Georgetown University’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, <a href=\"/opinions/2020/2/16/christian-zionist-archaeology-a-tool-of-palestinian-subjugation\">writes</a> that “despite the matter of their supposed end-of-times demise according to this view, Jewish Israeli leaders have embraced the money and influence on US foreign policy that Christian Zionists offer,” especially as its adherents include top officials from the first Trump administration, including former Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p><p>Nimer said it’s a rather “cynical relationship”, given that the Christian Zionist worldview, which sees all non-Christians going to hell, is “anti-Semitic to the bone”.</p><p>“But they support Israel, so it’s fine,” the policy analyst said.</p><p>“They care about what they can get out of them right now as the biggest support base in the West currently.”</p><p>Israel is further banking on this support because it is quickly losing its “progressive facade” of a “liberal democracy” with “all these progressive rights”, Nimer added.</p><p>“This has completely faded over the last few decades, and especially since the genocide in Gaza, this has become completely unacceptable.”</p><h2 id=\"how-do-christians-in-palestine-view-christian-zionists\">How do Christians in Palestine view Christian Zionists?</h2><p>Palestinian Christians have long voiced concern that the Christian Zionist position threatens their existence, further entrenching Israel’s occupation while marginalising their community and undermining the historic churches of the Holy Land.</p><p>Just last month, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/18/jerusalem-patriarch-churches-say-christian-zionism-threatens-christianity\">Patriarchs and Heads of the Churches in Jerusalem said</a> activities by local individuals advancing “damaging ideologies, such as Christian Zionism” “mislead the public, sow confusion, and harm the unity of our flock”.</p><p>The Christian leaders warned that these efforts could undermine the Christian presence not only in the Holy Land but across the wider Middle East.</p><p>The statement came amid growing concern among Palestinian Christians that Israel’s policies – including land confiscation, settlement expansion and pressure on church property – are accelerating the erosion of one of the world’s oldest Christian communities.</p><h2 id=\"are-there-critiques-of-christian-zionism-among-other-christians\">Are there critiques of Christian Zionism among other Christians?</h2><p>Criticism of Christian Zionists from within Christianity is abundant.</p><p>In the US, the Institute for the Study of Christian Zionism was created to critique and combat the movement through liberation theology, seeking justice for Palestinians and a resolution to the ongoing conflict.</p><p>Swift pointed out that many of the world’s most Catholic countries, from Ireland to those in South America and Southern Europe, “tend to be quite pro-Palestinian”.</p><p>Meanwhile, Palestinian Christian scholars “have written very detailed theological critiques of Christian Zionism”, Nimer said, as have pastors from other parts of the Global South.</p><p>A prize awarded by the Nelson Mandela Foundation last year was explicitly aimed at initiatives working against Christian Zionism, and a conference next month in Turkiye is being organised to combat the ideology, Nimer said.</p><p>“The world is waking up to how insidious this ideology is and how it creeps into societies and makes it impossible to have any kind of solidarity with Palestinians as long as they believe it,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is rumoured that he was a police officer before he became a drug lord.</p><p>He rose in the ranks of Mexico’s drug-trafficking underworld in the 1990s. In 1994, he was convicted in the US of heroin trafficking and served nearly three years in prison before returning to Mexico.</p><p>There are plenty of stories about El Mencho’s outrageous methods of making threats and dealing with adversaries.</p><p>He once reportedly sent a severed pig’s head in an ice chest to a Mexican attorney as a threat, Rolling Stone magazine reported in 2015, citing an unnamed former DEA field agent.</p><p>A call recording captured him threatening a local police commander with the call sign “Delta One”, promising to kill him “and even your dogs” if his officers didn’t back off, then ending with a nonchalant “Sorry for the bad language”.</p><p>As El Mencho rose to become s powerful drug dealer, he began to heavily invest in submarines, which he used to transport drugs from South America to the US, Rolling Stone reported. It added, citing the former DEA agent, that El Mencho hired Russian naval engineers to help design the submarines.</p><p>He became one of Washington’s most wanted fugitives, and it had offered a $15m reward for information leading to his arrest.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-known-about-the-jalisco-new-generation-cartel\">What is known about the Jalisco New Generation Cartel?</h2><p>El Mencho founded the cartel in about 2009 and rapidly expanded it, using online recruitment and diversifying its income streams through fuel theft, extortion, timeshare scams and other rackets.</p><p>The US has identified the Jalisco cartel along with the Sinaloa Cartel as the organisations primarily responsible for trafficking <a href=\"/news/2023/10/5/whats-fentanyl-and-why-have-deaths-due-to-drug-overdose-spiked-in-the-us\">fentanyl</a> into the US in recent years. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) considers the Jalisco cartel to be as powerful as Sinaloa with a presence in all 50 US states. The DEA said it is active in 21 of Mexico’s 32 states.</p><p>The Jalisco cartel has become notorious for its assaults on Mexican security forces. In 2015, it shot down a military helicopter in Jalisco.</p><p>In 2020, it tried to assassinate then-Mexico City Police Chief Omar Garcia Harfuch, who now serves as the federal security secretary.</p><p>In February last year, Mexico <a href=\"/news/2025/2/28/why-has-mexico-handed-over-drug-cartel-leaders-to-us-who-are-they\">handed over</a> senior Jalisco cartel leader Antonio Oseguera Cervantes, El Mencho’s brother, to the US. This came days after <a href=\"/news/2025/2/19/us-declares-drug-cartels-criminal-gangs-global-terrorist-organisations\">the US designated</a> eight Latin American criminal and drug-trafficking groups as “global terrorist organisations”, including the Jalisco cartel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-did-el-mencho-die\">How did El Mencho die?</h2><p>El Mencho was killed by Mexican special forces during a military operation to capture him in Talpalpa in the southern part of Jalisco on Sunday.</p><p>Troops were sent in to arrest El Mencho, and his followers tried to fight them off. Authorities said he was killed during the operation.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-operation\">What do we know about the operation?</h2><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on X on Sunday that the Secretariat of National Defence reported the operation had been carried out by federal forces.</p><p>“My recognition to the Mexican Army, National Guard, Armed Forces, and Security Cabinet,” Sheinbaum wrote.</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X that the US had provided intelligence to the Mexican government to assist with the operation.</p><p>“In this operation, three additional cartel members were killed, three were wounded, and two were arrested,” Leavitt posted. Authorities have not confirmed their identities.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-significant-is-the-us-involvement\">How significant is the US involvement?</h2><p>Benjamin Smith, a professor of Latin American history at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, told Al Jazeera that the most recent captures of Mexican drug bosses have been backed by the US. “This is not new,” he said.</p><p>Vanessa Rubio-Marquez, associate dean for extended education for the School of Public Policy at the London School of Economics, said the US involvement in the operation “speaks about the need to have permanent and effective dialogue and cooperation between both countries”.</p><p>“As a transnational activity that includes import of precursors, production, trafficking, consumption, money laundering, flow of arms, extortion and corruption from both sides of the border, both countries need to work together to combat these organisations and their unlawful activities and being able to protect citizens,” said Rubio-Marquez, who has represented Mexico in various international fora, including the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund.</p><h2 id=\"what-has-happened-since-el-mencho-s-killing\">What has happened since El Mencho’s killing?</h2><p>Violence erupted on Sunday in at least 20 Mexican states, including Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan, Nayarit, Guanajuato and Tamaulipas.</p><p>Officials in Jalisco, Michoacan and Guanajuato reported that at least 14 people were killed in Sunday’s violence, including seven members of the national guard.</p><p>Jalisco’s capital, Guadalajara, which is to host several matches in this year’s FIFA World Cup, was largely shut down on Sunday night as residents sheltered indoors. Four high-level football matches planned for Sunday were <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/23/football-matches-postponed-in-mexico-after-drug-cartel-leader-killed\">postponed</a>.</p><p>Videos on social media showed passengers running in panic through Guadalajara’s airport and smoke rising over the resort city of Puerto Vallarta. Governor Pablo Lemus urged people to stay home and suspended public transport while schools were closed on Monday in several states.</p><p>The US embassy in Mexico issued a security alert for US citizens in Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon, advising them to stay indoors.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-mexicans-reacted\">How have Mexicans reacted?</h2><p>Analysts said the Mexican public is mostly supportive of the government’s actions to rein in the cartels.</p><p>The government reported in December that the average number of killings per day in Mexico had dropped by 37 percent since <a href=\"/news/2024/10/1/claudia-sheinbaum-sworn-in-as-mexicos-first-female-president\">Sheinbaum took office</a> in October 2024.</p><p>“She’s extremely popular,” Smith said. “And Mencho was broadly loathed.”</p><p>Sheinbaum had an approval rating of about 70 percent as of late January, according to the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, New York-based organisations focused on promoting cultural and political understanding and business ties in the Americas. The rating has been consistent since Sheinbaum was elected.</p><p>“It was widely known – and criticised – that President Claudia Sheinbaum’s predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador followed a policy of ‘hugs not bullets’,” Rubio-Marquez said.</p><p>“This is a clear U-turn to this former policy by a Morena [Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum’s party] government and an implicit recognition that crime has to be confronted with decision and a sophisticated strategy that includes information, intelligence and cooperation with the US and coordination and training with actors at the different levels of government.”</p><h2 id=\"what-might-happen-next\">What might happen next?</h2><p>The operation that killed El Mencho could benefit Mexico in its negotiations with US President Donald Trump’s administration, which has threatened to impose tariffs or even resort to military action if Mexico does not clamp down on drug cartels.</p><p>However, experts said the operation could spark a new wave of violence in Mexico because cartels may retaliate against security forces. Smith said the operation could result in “more public murders”.</p><p>“For the last year, the Mexican state has managed to bring down homicides. I suspect this killing will reverse that trend,” he said.</p><p>It is unclear what the future holds for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel because El Mencho’s death has left a power vacuum and it is unknown who will succeed him.</p><p>“The fight against criminal actors is not only about getting rid of leaders and bringing them to justice,” Rubio-Marquez said. “It implies a complex strategy that includes prevention, the combat of powerful arms used by cartels, the disarticulation of their multi-layered networks, security and protection for citizens, and effective policies towards social inclusion and social cohesion, economic development.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the trainer readying Chege and other fighters told him: “This is the Russian military, and once you are in, you either fight or die,” he said.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Last week, Kenya’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) unveiled a report which said more than 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited “to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war”, with 89 currently on the front line, 39 hospitalised and 28 missing in action.</p><p>Chege, a 30-year-old father of one, is one of the few who made a narrow escape, but dozens of families are demanding that the government take action to ensure their loved ones’ safe return home.</p><p>Many of the returnees and families of those still abroad say they were lured or tricked into joining the war on Russia’s side.</p><p>Chege, who used to work as a truck driver, delivering fresh vegetables from his town to the coastal city of Mombasa, was fraudulently recruited last year after he lost his job and decided to look for other opportunities.</p><p>He asked a friend who worked as a driver in the Gulf for advice. “He connected me with an agent in Nairobi who had taken him there,” Chege recounted, sitting in his living room in Kimende. “After we spoke, she [the agent] told me that jobs in Dubai, where I wanted to go to work as a driver, would take long and that she would get back to me when she had a good offer.”</p><p>Two weeks later, the agent called back, saying she had a good offer for him to work in Russia as a truck driver delivering supplies to military barracks.</p><p>He accepted, and within three days in October, Chege had a visa and an air ticket. “A Russian agent asked me whether I was ready to travel … He had called me at 6am and by 11am I already had a plane ticket for 3am the next morning,” he said.</p><p>Chege’s family took him to the airport, where he left on a connecting flight via Istanbul, Turkiye, before landing in Moscow, the Russian capital.</p><p>In Russia, he was sent for a week of ballistics training <span>before being transferred to a Russian base in Ukraine, where he says he was given a full combat uniform, and his civilian clothes were burned.</span></p><p>“On the way, some Chinese and Russians asked me through a translator why I was there, and I insisted that I was going to drive the military trucks. They were surprised but told me that they were specifically there to ‘fight and kill the Ukrainians’,” Chege recounted.</p><p>“When I asked some Ugandans and Kenyans that I met later, and seeing what training we were being given, we realised that we had been fooled and we were going to the war front.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331720\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331720\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331720\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chege-shows-army-boots-that-he-was-given-as-part-of-military-uniform-in-Russia-1771838128.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Kenya\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4331720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chege shows army boots that he was given as part of a military uniform in Russia [Dominic Kirui/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"i-saw-thousands-of-dead-bodies\">‘I saw thousands of dead bodies’</h2><p>In recent months, reports have surfaced from <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/did-ex-south-african-president-zumas-daughter-recruit-for-russias-war\">South Africa</a>, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa about young men fraudulently recruited for work abroad, only to end up on the front lines in the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>All in all, nationals from <a href=\"/news/2025/11/8/ukraines-fm-says-over-1400-africans-recruited-to-fight-for-russia-in-war\">36 African countries</a> are known to be fighting for Russia in the four-year war, Ukraine’s foreign minister said in November.</p><p>At the base he was sent to in Ukraine, Chege went through a one-month training and was sent to what he called the “yellow zone” before eventually going to the “red zone”.</p><p>“Our trainer there told us that it was going to get tough. He prepared us for the worst and told us that we should be courageous enough to see dead bodies.”</p><p>Soon after, Chege witnessed this firsthand. “I saw thousands of dead bodies that were piled into something like a wall.” That’s when he knew he had to find a way out.</p><p>“I tried to call my agent and went to the commander, asking to leave,” he said, but was told he was in it until the end.</p><p>A week into fighting, Chege thought he would not survive. He called his wife and told her that if he went offline, his family would know that he had died.</p><p>“Three of my friends from the six of us had been killed by a drone,” he lamented.</p><p>With no other options, Chege decided to feign a mental breakdown.</p><p>“I decided to discharge my firearm aimlessly into the woods, and after all 12 magazines were spent, I pretended to be mad, collecting cartridges from the ground and eating them while talking to myself, unbothered by my two friends who rushed to check on me.”</p><p>The other soldiers were ordered to take him back to base, which was “a relief”, he said, as he was afraid they would kill him then and there.</p><p>He was later taken to a military hospital for mental health treatment, where, with the help of a Russian soldier who was a patient, he got access to a phone to contact his family. He asked them to send fake car accident photos from his mother’s phone, explaining that his wife and three children had been killed and he was needed back in Kenya.</p><p>“That made the doctor give me permission to go to the commander,” he said, “and that is how I went to the Kenyan embassy and flew back home.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4325308\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4325308\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4325308\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260219__987B8H2__v1__HighRes__KenyaRussiaUkraineConflictWar-1771521865.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Relatives of Kenyan nationals conscripted by the Russian army\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4325308\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Relatives of Kenyan nationals conscripted by the Russian army in Ukraine pose with their photos during a peaceful demonstration demanding urgent government action to repatriate their kin, in Nairobi, on February 19, 2026 [Simon Maina/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fighting-shoulder-to-shoulder\">Fighting ‘shoulder to shoulder’</h2><p>Chege returned to Kenya last month at a time when more reports were surfacing of Africans trapped or killed on the front lines of the Ukraine war.</p><p>On February 10, Kenya’s Prime Cabinet Secretary (PCS) Musalia Mudavadi announced that the government had repatriated more than two dozen Kenyans from the war zone and that Moscow’s use of its citizens in combat was unacceptable.</p><p>“We have facilitated 27 Kenyans to come back home away from the front line and from what they thought were different jobs but ended up being lured into battle,” he said.</p><p>The PCS also said he would put the issue of fraudulent recruitment of Kenyan civilians into war on the agenda at a planned meeting in Russia.</p><p>“We have seen loss of lives, and I am planning to make a visit to Moscow so that we can emphasise that this is something that needs to be arrested,” he said in a statement to the media.</p><p>In its report last week, the NIS said that to facilitate Kenyans’ travel to the front lines, recruitment agencies had colluded with rogue airport staff and immigration officials of the country, as well as with staff at the Russian embassy in Nairobi and at the Kenyan embassy in Moscow.</p><p>The Russian embassy in Kenya denied wrongdoing, calling the claims a “dangerous and misleading propaganda campaign”.</p><p>“The embassy refutes such allegations in the strongest possible terms,” it said in a statement on <a href=\"https://x.com/russembkenya/status/2024443743966011712\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X</a>, adding that the Russian government had “never engaged in illegal recruitment of Kenyan citizens in the Armed Forces”.</p><p>However, it added that Moscow does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from “voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces” and fighting “shoulder to shoulder” with Russian servicemen.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331741\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331741\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331741\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_699c1b39-1771838265.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C481&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Relatives of Kenyans believed to be fighting for Russia in Ukraine attend a demonstration demanding accountability for all Kenyans in Russia, in downtown Nairobi, Kenya, February 19, 2026.

They resumed talks in Oman this month.</p><p>A third round of indirect talks is scheduled for Thursday in Geneva, but the US has yet to confirm.

The details of any negotiation process are discussed in the negotiating room. The speculation raised about an interim agreement has no basis.”</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from Tehran, said there was a “mixture of optimism and pessimism” in Iran’s capital.</p><p>“Let’s call it a pragmatically calibrated cautiousness that we see when it comes to Iran’s statements over the past few weeks, specifically following the major military <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/tracking-the-rapid-us-military-build-up-near-iran\">build-up</a> by the Americans in the region,” he said.</p><p>He said Iran is considering both scenarios “on the basis of readiness for <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/oman-confirms-us-iran-talks-will-take-place-in-geneva-on-thursday\">diplomatic engagement</a> on the one hand and regional confrontation on the other hand”.</p><p>The Trump administration said it has been intensifying its build-up of an array of military assets in the Middle East during the talks with Iran. In an interview with the Fox News TV channel on Sunday, Witkoff said Trump was wondering why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of the military deployment.</p><p>Baghaei on Monday stressed that Iranians had <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/iran-will-not-bow-down-to-us-pressure-in-nuclear-talks-pezeshkian-says\">never capitulated</a> at any point in their history.</p><p>“This is not the first time we have encountered contradictory claims,” the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p><p>“We leave the judgement to the discerning people of Iran and the country’s political elites to decide about Iran’s negotiating approach and, in turn, the negotiating approach of the United States,” he added.</p><p>“No negotiation that begins with an imposed burden and prejudgement will naturally reach a result,” the official said.</p><p>He also stressed that Iran’s positions on its nuclear programme and sanctions relief are clear-cut.</p><p>“Any negotiation process requires joint action, and there is hope for results if there is goodwill and seriousness on both sides,” Baghaei said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The retaliation was instantaneous. As news of the operation spread, a coordinated wave of violence exploded through the country, reaching at least 20 of Mexico’s 32 states.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"3\">Across the republic, suspected members of organised groups torched buses and businesses, and erected fiery roadblocks. For those caught in the crossfire, the speed of the chaos was a reminder of the cartels’ reach.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"3\">“The fear that remains in society is overwhelming,” a resident of Zitacuaro, Michoacan, one of the states hit by the unrest, told Al Jazeera, requesting anonymity.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"7\">“That’s when you realise the immense power these organisations have, because they can collapse a city in a matter of minutes.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">“They have co-opted the leaders who manage transport, and at any moment they can block the entrances and exits of a city … they can completely paralyse a city’s movement,” the Michoacan resident added. “All basic services are disrupted: going to hospitals, grocery shopping, ordering food. It becomes total chaos.”</p><p>The US Embassy in Mexico issued a security alert to its citizens in Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon, urging them to remain indoors.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"9\">According to some analysts, these actions were not merely reactive chaos; they were a form of strategic communication.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"10\">“[These] are the way a criminal order responds when it feels challenged,” security analyst Edgar Guerra shared on <a href=\"https://x.com/EdgarGuerraB/status/2025628759705919497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X</a>. “To understand them, you have to look at the meaning behind them, not just the fires or the territory.”</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332174\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-MEXICO-CLASHES-DRUG-CARTEL-FEB-23-2026-copy-1771851983.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - MEXICO - CLASHES - DRUG CARTEL - FEB 23, 2026 copy-1771851983\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><h2 id=\"absolute-coordination\" data-path-to-node=\"6\">‘Absolute coordination’</h2><p>The operation against El Mencho was carried out by Mexican special forces with intelligence support from the US.</p><p>“There is absolute coordination with the governments of all states; we must remain informed and calm,” President Claudia Sheinbaum <a href=\"https://x.com/Claudiashein/status/2025682673008878003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> on social media.</p><p>“My recognition to the Mexican Army, National Guard, Armed Forces, and Security Cabinet.

Chris Dalby, senior analyst at Dyami Security Intelligence, outlined two possible scenarios.</p><p>“One is that [El Mencho] did appoint a successor,” he told Al Jazeera. “A lot of analysts are pointing to his stepson, Juan Carlos Gonzalez Valencia, his wife’s son from a previous marriage whom he adopted as his own.”</p><p>Dalby said the heir apparent, who is in charge of the cartel’s paramilitary wing, is seen as having the best shot at keeping the Jalisco New Generation Cartel united. But he would have to assume “a huge role” to replace the cult of personality around El Mencho.</p><p>“If his stepson cannot do it, you’ve got four, five, six commanders all with the money, the power and the men to create their own criminal thiefdoms,” the analyst continued.</p><p>“If that happens, and that’s the worst-case scenario, you could see record levels of homicide in Mexico in the months to come.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">Al Jazeera’s John Holman, reporting from Mexico City, said “different bosses within the cartel, perhaps regional ones, could start disputing for power.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">“We’ve seen this happen time and time again, from Guerrero to Sinaloa,” he added, referring to other big cartels. “Eventually, that leads to a civil war between different factions.”</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">The timing is particularly sensitive in the wake of the upcoming FIFA World Cup.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">“That spells additional problems for Mexico,” Holman said. “So this, at the moment, is a triumph for the Mexican government, but it could turn into an even bigger problem in the weeks and months ahead,” he added.</p><p id=\"p-rc_302f029891128928-51\" data-path-to-node=\"12\">For common Mexicans, the fall of a kingpin could also signal the rise of extortions and forced recruitment as fractured cells within El Mencho’s cartel scramble for resources.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"13\">“A lot of people at the moment in Jalisco … are sheltering in place. There is no school tomorrow,” Holman said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"14\">Meanwhile, some residents have turned to the streets to gauge the immediate danger, closely monitoring bus stops and taxi stands for signs of movement.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"15\">“If the city wakes up without public transport, it means something is going to happen,” a resident, who requested anonymity, warned.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"15\">“Difficult days are ahead of us. Even if things had somehow felt relatively calm on one side, you don’t know what’s going to happen now.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
