Three candidates have surged to the front of the race, but none has taken a definitive lead in the polls.</p><p>They include Rixi Moncada from the LIBRE party; Nasry Asfura from the right-wing National Party; and Salvador Nasralla from the centrist Liberal Party.</p><p>The race, however, has been marred by accusations of fraud and election-tampering.</p><p>Those allegations have raised tensions in Honduras, whose political system is still recovering from the legacy of a United States-backed 2009 <a href=\"/news/2019/6/28/ten-years-after-coup-hondurans-flee-amid-violence-and-repression\">military coup</a> that was followed by a period of repression and contested elections.</p><p>“Honduras is heading into these elections amid mounting political pressure on electoral authorities, public accusations of fraud from across the political spectrum, and paralysis within key electoral bodies,” said Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas division at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch.</p><p>“These dynamics have created real uncertainty about the integrity of the process.”</p><p>Who are the candidates, what will voting look like, and what are the stakes of the election? We answer these questions and more in this brief explainer.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"when-is-the-election\">When is the election?</h2><p>The election will take place in a single round of voting, held on November 30. The candidate with the most votes will be declared the winner and should take office on January 25, 2026.</p><h2 id=\"how-long-is-the-presidential-term\">How long is the presidential term?</h2><p>Each president may serve a single four-year term in office.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-eligible-to-vote\">Who is eligible to vote?</h2><p>There are about 6.5 million Hondurans eligible to cast a ballot, including about 400,000 living abroad in the United States. That group, however, is restricted to voting on the presidential candidates.</p><p>Voting is obligatory in Honduras, but there are no penalties for those who do not participate.</p><h2 id=\"who-are-the-candidates\">Who are the candidates?</h2><p>Three of the five presidential candidates have emerged as main challengers in the race.</p><p>Competing as the candidate for the left-leaning LIBRE Party is Rixi Moncada, a close confidant of President Castro who has served first as her finance minister, from 2022 to 2024, and later as her secretary of defence.</p><p>Moncada resigned that position in May to pursue her presidential bid.</p><p>If elected, she has pledged to “democratise the economy”, pushing back against efforts to privatise state services. Her platform also promises greater access to credit for small businesses and a crackdown on corporate corruption.</p><p>Another contender is Salvador Nasralla, a familiar face in Honduran politics. A candidate for the centrist Liberal Party, he is running for president for a fourth time.</p><p>A 72-year-old with a background in civil engineering, Nasralla formerly served as Castro’s vice president before resigning in April 2024.</p><p>Nasralla has said that he will streamline government functions while seeking to bring informal workers, who make up a large portion of the country’s labour force, into the formal economy.</p><p>Finally, running as the candidate for the right-leaning National Party is Nasry “Tito” Asfura.</p><p>Previously a mayor and representative for the capital of Tegucigalpa, Asfura has said he will run the country as an “administrator” and “executor”, promoting pro-business policies to attract investment.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135921\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135921\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135921\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25328122083756-1764258908.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Supporters of Honduran candidate Salvador Nasralla cheer at a political event\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters of the Liberal Party cheer for presidential candidate Salvador Nasralla during his campaign’s closing event in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on November 23 [Delmer Martinez/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-have-foreign-relations-played-a-role-in-the-election\">How have foreign relations played a role in the election?</h2><p>On foreign relations, Moncada is expected to continue her predecessor’s pursuit of closer ties with countries <a href=\"/news/2023/6/5/honduran-president-set-to-visit-china-after-establishing-ties\">such as China</a> and support for other left-wing figures in the region.</p><p>Both Nasralla and Asfura have said they will orient Honduras towards the US and its allies, including Israel and Taiwan.</p><p>On Wednesday, in the waning days of the presidential race, US President Donald Trump expressed his support for Asfura.</p><p>Trump also cast Honduras’s presidential race as part of his broader campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, blaming the South American leader for drug trafficking and the establishment of left-wing governments across the region. There is no basis for Trump’s claims, and the US president has a history of intervening in the politics of other countries on behalf of right-wing allies.</p><p>“Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the beautiful country of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists take over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela?” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115618236412963848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on his platform Truth Social.</p><p>“The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting against Maduro, is Tito Asfura.”</p><h2 id=\"what-do-the-polls-say\">What do the polls say?</h2><p>Though pre-election surveys have shown Moncada, Nasralla and Asfura to be in the lead, no clear frontrunner has emerged.</p><p>In September, a <a href=\"https://x.com/cidgallup/status/1973141261264515198\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poll</a> released by the firm CID Gallup found that Nasralla had 27 percent support, Moncada 26 and Asfura 24. Those percentages separating the three candidates were within the poll’s margin of error.</p><p>An additional 18 percent of respondents in that survey indicated they were undecided.</p><h2 id=\"why-has-election-integrity-been-a-concern\">Why has election integrity been a concern?</h2><p>Questions of corruption have long dogged Honduras’s fragile democracy, and this election season has brought those fears back to the fore.</p><p>During the March primaries, for instance, there were “irregularities” in the distribution of election materials, and some polling stations reported delays, long lines and thin staffing that forced the vote to stretch late into the night.</p><p>There has also been discord between the two government agencies that handle Honduras’s elections: the National Electoral Council (CNE) and the Electoral Justice Tribunal.</p><p>Congress elects the main leaders for each of the two agencies. But both the tribunal and the CNE have been targeted for investigation recently.</p><p>In October, prosecutors opened a criminal probe into CNE leader Cossette Lopez over alleged plans for an “electoral coup”.</p><p>The Joint Staff of the Armed Forces has also asked the CNE for a copy of a vote tally sheet for the presidential race on election day, prompting concerns over possible interference by the armed forces.</p><p>The Electoral Justice Tribunal, meanwhile, has faced an investigation into whether it has voted without all of its members present.</p><p>Both President Castro and members of the opposition have spoken about the potential for fraud in Sunday’s vote, heightening scrutiny on the vote.</p><p>Organisations such as Human Rights Watch and the Organization of American States (OAS) have expressed concern over the pressure facing election officials.</p><p>“What matters most now is that electoral institutions are allowed to operate independently, that the Armed Forces adhere strictly to their limited constitutional role, and that all political actors refrain from actions or statements that could inflame tensions or undermine public trust,” said Goebertus.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But after he appeared on television to impose a state of emergency and suspend the legislature for eroding the rule of law, Congress swiftly voted for his removal. He was arrested the same day.</p><p>Castillo, a former teacher and union leader, was charged with rebellion and conspiracy against the state for his alleged power grab, which some have described as a “self-coup”.</p><p>A left-leaning, socially conservative politician from Peru’s rural north, Castillo had <a href=\"/news/2024/1/12/prosecutors-in-peru-seek-34-year-sentence-for-ex-president-castillo\">faced</a> up to 34 years in prison at his sentencing.</p><p>Prosecutors in the case argued that Castillo aimed to undermine Peru’s Constitution with his actions. But at trial last week, Castillo denied the charges against him. Addressing his televised 2022 speech, he said he merely read out “a document without consequence”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Castillo is part of a series of presidents in recent decades to face investigations and criminal charges in Peru. The country has had eight presidents within the last 10 years alone.</p><p>After his surprise victory in the 2021 presidential election, Castillo, now 56, was dubbed the country’s first “<a href=\"/news/2022/12/8/why-was-peru-president-pedro-castillo-impeached\">president of the poor</a>“, given his working-class roots in the northern city of Puna. He had never previously held elected office.</p><p>His brief tenure, which lasted only around 16 months, was defined by frequent shake-ups among his top ministers and clashes with the opposition-led Congress.</p><p>Castillo’s arrest in 2022 sparked pushback from Indigenous residents and his rural base, members of which blocked roads, particularly in Peru’s south.</p><p>The unrest fuelled <a href=\"/opinions/2023/2/15/understanding-the-crisis-in-peru\">widespread, years-long protests</a> across the country. His successor, former Vice President Dina Boluarte, oversaw a brutal crackdown of those demonstrations that left at least 50 people dead.</p><p>The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has accused the government of using “disproportionate, indiscriminate and lethal use of force” in its response to the protests.</p><p>Boluarte, the country’s first female president, was subsequently impeached in October, amid concerns about rising crime and investigations into her behaviour. She has been replaced by the right-wing politician Jose Jeri, who previously was the head of Peru’s Congress.</p><p>Thursday’s sentencing caps a nine-month trial punctuated by a diplomatic rift.</p><p>During the court proceedings, the Mexican embassy granted asylum to Castillo’s former prime minister, Betssy Chavel, who was also facing charges related to the former president’s effort to consolidate power.</p><p>Peru’s government <a href=\"/news/2025/11/7/peru-bans-mexicos-president-sheinbaum-as-diplomatic-dispute-grows\">subsequently labelled</a> Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, a vocal supporter of Castillo, “persona non grata”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Castillo has been denied the possibility of serving his sentence under house arrest. Instead, he is slated to join several other former presidents at Barbadillo Prison in the capital Lima. The prison, situated at a police academy, was set up to hold convicted leaders who might face safety hazards in other detention facilities.</p><p>Detainees at Barbadillo include Ollanta Humala, who served as president from 2011 to 2016 and was sentenced to 15 years in prison this year for money laundering.</p><p>Alejandro Toledo, who served from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced last year to 20 years in prison for taking bribes.

A coalition of Indigenous groups in British Columbia said this week it will not allow oil tankers on the northwest coast and that the pipeline project will “never happen”.</p><p>The Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to the British Columbia coast, which is owned by the Canadian government and is currently the only option to ship Canadian oil directly to Asian markets, tripled its capacity last year with a 34 billion Canadian dollar ($24.2bn) expansion.</p><h2 id=\"climate-concerns\">Climate concerns</h2><p>Environmentalists raised concerns about the agreement’s implications for climate change, while oil producers supported the deal.</p><p>“With this agreement, the federal government risks doing significant damage to minimum national standards that will have broader impacts on Canada’s climate change efforts,” the Pembina Institute, a clean energy think tank, said in a statement.</p><p>Industry leaders said the partnership between the province and the federal government would boost the energy sector.</p><p>“The elimination of the emissions cap, changes to the Competition Act, and the commitment to work together on new market access are all significant steps towards unlocking Canada’s vast natural energy resources,” the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said in a statement.</p><p>The federal government and Alberta also said they would conclude an agreement on industrial carbon pricing by April 1 next year.</p><p>In addition, the two agreed to cooperate on building the Pathways Plus project, expected to be the world’s biggest carbon capture project and designed to capture emissions from Canada’s tar sands.</p><p>The federal government will also assist Alberta in building and operating nuclear power plants, strengthening its electricity grid to power AI data centres, and building transmission lines to neighbouring provinces.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Civil War spanned from 1861 to 1865, and nearly 700,000 soldiers were killed.</p><p>The proclamation for the national holiday came about after a campaign led by <a href=\"https://www.npca.org/articles/5393-the-woman-behind-thanksgiving#:~:text=%2C%20and%20plenty.%E2%80%9D-,Abraham%20Lincoln,death%20of%20her%20lawyer%20husband.\">Sarah Hale</a>, a poet, editor and activist, that began in 1846.

Both were joint-stock trading companies, much like the British East India Company, which was set up in India in 1608.</p><p>This was still more than a century and a half before the US was born.</p><p>The goals of these British trading companies were to find gold, search for trade routes and compete with other European powers.</p><p>The first settlement by the English in the New World was in 1607 when the Jamestown colony was established on the banks of the James River in present day Virginia. This was the ancestral home of the Powhatan Indigenous people.</p><p>In 1619, the first recorded African slaves were brought to the colony to work in the profitable tobacco fields.</p><p>Jamestown as a colony was ravaged by famine, disease and resistance from Indigenous communities.</p><p>On November 11, 1620, a group of 102 English families, known as the Pilgrims, reached present-day Provincetown Harbor, Massachusetts, before anchoring their ship, the Mayflower, in present-day Plymouth Harbour on December 16.

This resulted in the forced migration of Indigenous people from the East Coast inland and in some cases all the way to the present-day Midwest.</p><p>The forced displacement of five Indigenous peoples from the southeastern US to what is today Oklahoma is called the Trail of Tears because of its high death toll.

She worked for the armed forces for nearly 20 years, and after she retired, she began a journey to get her tribe recognised by federal authorities.</p><p>“I took my combat boots off and put my moccasins back on to try to help our people as much as I can,” Locklear says.</p><p>Her tribe is almost 60,000 people strong, and she has been recently to Capitol Hill with help from North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis to fight for her tribe’s chance for federal recognition. The Lumbee Fairness Act, which would grant the Lumbee full federal recognition, passed the House of Representatives in December but is awaiting Senate and presidential approval.</p><p>“It’s not because of charity. It’s not. It’s not because we’re standing in line for a handout or anything like that.

Oklahoma, where Carpella lives, is a case in point.</p><p>A 2020 Supreme Court ruling declared a large portion of eastern Oklahoma as “Indian” country.</p><p>“But 80 percent of the people who live here are not Native and they live within cities, so it’s like this overlapping concept of municipalities on top of sovereign nations. And so you have regular police officers and then you have tribal police officers and then you have Bureau of Indian Affairs police officers,” he explained.</p><p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the US federal agency responsible for managing relations with American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, overseeing land, services and treaty obligations. It is housed within the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, and led by a presidentially appointed director. Many employees in the BIA are Natives, especially for tribal liaison, education and culture programmes.</p><p>As a result, Carpella says, there is a constant battle over jurisdiction. “Our cars have tribal plates, so police don’t want to stop us because we have a Native American licence plate,” he explains. If they are stopped, they have to call the tribal police, starting a time-consuming exercise.</p><p>“In our treaties, it says that Native people can hunt whenever we want wherever we want in Oklahoma in perpetuity without government intervening, but what happens is the state government will send out its wildlife officers to give tickets to individual citizens that are just out there hunting deer for their family,” he says.</p><h2 id=\"native-americans-today\">Native Americans today</h2><figure id=\"attachment_4135710\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135710\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135710\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/idc1-028635-1764253298.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Bureau of Indian Affairs -Department of Interior - US Government June 2016\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135710\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Bureau of Indian Affairs June 2016]</figcaption></figure><p>Carpella has spent the past 15 years putting together a map based on Native peoples’ voices and memories passed down from generation to generation about where their people came from and what languages they spoke.</p><p>This open source map is unique in the US. Carpella uses this map to do workshops in educational institutes to spread awareness. He copyrighted his map in 2012.</p><p>“I used to be an activist. I felt like I was outside of the fence, like shaking the fence trying to change at a city council meeting or at a school, trying to get them to change a racist mascot or something. And now I have these products that are in the schools changing minds,” Carpella says.</p><p>“It’s really good to see that there’s a growing awareness. I think 20 years ago, half of Americans didn’t even know that Native Americans still existed,” he says, citing polls that indicated at the time that about half of Americans thought Indigenous Americans were ”all gone”.</p><p>According to the 2020 US census, 9.6 million people in the US identify as having Native American heritage, which is an 85 percent increase from 2010. The growth is mainly attributed to how data are collected.</p><p>The blood quantum policy, created by the US government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, defined Native identity by calculating the fraction of “Indian blood” a person carried, often requiring at least one quarter to qualify. Many tribes say it is a colonial system that divides families and threatens the long-term survival of Native nations.</p><p>According to Locklear, there is no universal meaning of the word “Indian” in the United States.</p><p>“If both parents are Native, the child is considered 100 percent [Native],” he says. “If mixed-race parents, the child would be half, three-quarters, one-eighth or something like that.”</p><p>“Over time, blood quantum was a genocidal policy because it helps limit membership or citizenship over time,” Locklear says. “One of our sovereign powers is to decide who can be a Lumbee citizen. I think this right is essential to our ability to self-govern.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135687\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135687\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.tribalnationsmaps.com/\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135687\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Native-American-Nations-NO-Borders-1764252864.jpg?quality=80\" alt=\"Courtesy Tribal Nations/Aaron Carpella\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135687\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Courtesy Tribal Nations Maps/Aaron Carpella]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

It is not currently clear how these compounds could be expanded to accommodate all Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“If they [the US and Israel] could establish a proper situation, people might move there, but it’s not feasible,” Hussein, a Palestinian from Gaza City, said of the US plans. “What are they going to establish, with what infrastructure? It would need water, electricity. It would take years.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"who-will-pay\">Who will pay?</h2><p>Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza has killed more than <a href=\"/news/2025/3/18/gaza-tracker\">69,700 Palestinians</a>. Now, more than a month after a ceasefire officially began in Gaza, there are still questions over what the next phase of the agreement will bring and when full-scale reconstruction will begin.</p><p>In the meantime, Israel continues to attack periodically, killing at least 347 people since the ceasefire began on October 10.</p><p>For those still alive, life is incredibly difficult. At least 1.9 million people in Gaza are displaced. Many of them have had to flee multiple times. Ninety-two percent of Gaza’s housing stock has been damaged or reduced to rubble, leaving hundreds of thousands of people living in tents, a particularly precarious situation as winter approaches.</p><p>The destruction of Gaza’s buildings has come as a result of Israeli air strikes and shelling as well as a systematic campaign to deliberately demolish vast swaths of the territory.</p><p>Officials quoted in The New York Times said the first ASC compound was still months away from completion. Israeli soldiers were expected to begin clearing an area around what remains of Rafah in the south this week. But that work could be delayed if tunnels, unexploded ordnance or human remains are encountered.</p><p>Two people involved in the project estimated that the cost for just the initial compound could reach tens of millions of dollars.

They also closed off the country’s land, sea and air borders and imposed a nighttime curfew.</p><p>According to The Associated Press news agency, roads leading to the palace were closed off and checkpoints were being manned by heavily armed, masked soldiers. A palace official told the AP that a group of armed men had attacked the building, leading to a gunfire exchange with presidential guards. Officials also reported gunshots near the National Electoral Commission.</p><p>Hundreds of people fled on foot and in vehicles, seeking shelter as shots rang out, the AFP news agency reported.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4135394\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4135394\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4135394\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-26T173611Z_1032714469_RC2Y0IA66RE4_RTRMADP_3_BISSAU-SECURITY-EMBALO-1764247390.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Guinea Bissau elections\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4135394\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Supporters wear clothes featuring images of Guinea-Bissau’s incumbent President Umaro Sissoco Embalo, ahead of the presidential election scheduled for November 23, in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, on November 21, 2025 [Luc Gnago/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"who-has-been-arrested-and-where-are-they-now\">Who has been arrested and where are they now?</h2><p>French news outlet Jeune Afrique quoted President Embalo as saying he had been arrested at about 1pm in his office, in what he called a coup led by the head of the presidential military office, N’Canha. Embalo stated that he had not been subjected to violence. The president also told French broadcaster France 24 in a phone call: “I have been deposed.”</p><p>Military officials have not provided any information about where the president is being held.</p><p>Army chief of staff General Biague Na Ntam, his deputy, General Mamadou Toure, and Minister of Interior Botche Cande were arrested at the same time, and are all being held at the army headquarters, Jeune Afrique quoted Embalo as saying.</p><p>Reuters, quoting anonymous sources, reported that opposition candidate Dias of the Party for Social Renewal, as well as Domingos Simoes Pereira, former prime minister and the head of the main opposition PAIGC (African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde), had been arrested.</p><p>In a Facebook statement on Wednesday, PAIGC confirmed Pereira and Dias’s arrests and added that another party leader, lawyer Octavio Lopes, had also been detained. Pereira had been preparing to stand as the main opposition candidate in the election, but his PAIGC party was barred after the electoral commission said it had failed to submit its application on time. Pereira thereafter endorsed the little-known Dias in the elections.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"was-embalo-facing-a-legitimacy-crisis\">Was Embalo facing a legitimacy crisis?</h2><p>Yes, 53-year-old Embalo was facing a legitimacy crisis in the lead-up to the coup, and his leadership has been marred by political infighting. The former army general was first elected in 2019, backed by a coalition of parties known as Madem G15, which had separated from the then-ruling PAIGC party.</p><p>PAIGC, which launched an independence war against Portugal in 1974, has dominated the government in the decades since.</p><p>However, after Embalo was sworn in, in February 2020, the opposition challenged his victory and the Supreme Court did not recognise him as president until September 2020.</p><p>The president was subjected to what he called attempted coups in February 2022, December 2023, and in October this year, leading to multiple arrests, especially of military officers.</p><p>Embalo’s critics, however, have accused him of fabricating crises in order to crack down on dissent. Following the December 2023 coup attempt, for example, which began as a clash between a unit in the army and the presidential guard, Embalo ordered that the opposition-controlled parliament be dissolved. Parliament has not reconvened since, and Embalo has ruled through decrees.</p><p>In March, President Embalo announced he would again run for office, amid tensions with opposition groups who questioned his legitimacy.</p><p>He said he aimed to make history in the turbulent country by being the first leader in 30 years to secure a second consecutive term. But opposition groups said they did not recognise his presidency and accused him of delaying elections till November, when his mandate originally ended in February 2025. A Supreme Court ruling said Embalo’s term ended in September.</p><p>In October, PAIGC also accused Embalo of heavy-handed tactics after the party was barred from the vote on a technicality. It was the first time in the country’s history that the former governing party had been excluded from elections.</p><h2 id=\"how-did-the-election-go\">How did the election go?</h2><p>In the lead-up to Sunday’s tightly contested elections, Embalo campaigned on stability while the Pereira-backed Dias campaigned on change. Campaigns were marred by accusations of corruption and hate speech from both sides, but the votes passed without incident.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, both Embalo and Dias declared victory in the elections.</p><p>In a Facebook statement following the coup, PAIGC said the military intervention was an attempt to stop the electoral authority from declaring victory for Dias.</p><p>PAIGC “considers this fact as manoeuvres to disrupt the electoral process, which was already in the final stage of dissemination of provisional results”, the party said. It urged the electoral commission to go ahead and publish election results “which gave Dr Fernando Dias da Costa a big victory, assuring him victory right on the first lap”.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Bissau-Guinean civil society coalition, Frente Popular or Popular Front, also accused Embalo and the army of staging a “simulated coup” to block the release of election results.</p><p>“This manoeuvre aims to prevent the publication of the electoral results scheduled for tomorrow, Nov 27,” the group said in a statement on Wednesday. It claimed Embalo’s statements to international media were proof of this.</p><p>The deposed president, the group alleged, planned to name a new president and interim prime minister, then call new elections in which he intended to run again.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4132850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4132850\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132850\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251126__869964X__v1__HighRes__GbissauPoliticsElectionUnrest-1764171484.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A soldier stops a car near the scene of gunfire in Guinea-Bissau's capital\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4132850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A soldier stops a car near the scene of gunfire near the Presidential Palace in Bissau on November 26, 2025, three days after the country’s presidential and legislative elections, with both major candidates claiming victory [Patrick Meinhardt/AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"was-embalo-s-government-vulnerable\">Was Embalo’s government vulnerable?</h2><p>Beverly Ochieng, West Africa analyst at the intelligence firm Control Risks, told Al Jazeera that the constant infighting had made Embalo’s government vulnerable.</p><p>“Over the course of Embalo’s presidency, the legislature, judiciary and various government institutions have either been rendered nonoperational or operating under capacity,” she said.</p><p>Political infighting and the banning of PAIGC “likely contributed to a military intervention – even though there is a school of thought that this may have been staged to play up vulnerabilities against Embalo”, Ochieng added.</p><p>Political analyst Ryan Cummings said Embalo’s past moves lent credibility to claims of a sham coup against him that could see him reinstated by the military government. But, he added, it is also “highly plausible” the military acted alone to avoid a deadlock in a country where about 70 percent of the 2.2 million population is poor.</p><p>“There have been growing concerns that longstanding disputes between Embalo and (the opposition) had forced Guinea-Bissau into a political deadlock which has been detrimental to the socioeconomic trajectory of the country,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-there-a-link-to-the-drug-trade\">Is there a link to the drug trade?</h2><p>It’s unclear how much the country’s rising profile as a drug hub is tied to the coup. The military coup leaders claim there was an effort to “manipulate” the election by “national leaders” working with drug cartels, but have not provided any evidence.</p><p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) first warned in 2008 that Guinea-Bissau risked becoming a “narco state”. Since then, major drug busts in the country continue to cement it as a drug-trafficking hub, with dealers found by investigators to be working with help from the military.</p><p>In September 2019, a major drug operation by local security officials and backed by the UNODC led to the arrests of Bissau-Guinean, Colombian, Mexican and Portuguese nationals who were tried and sentenced to 16 years in prison.</p><p>A 2020 report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime warned that the drug trade could increase under the newly elected Embalo because key figures in the military had backed his presidency. The report did not allege direct links between Embalo and the drug trade.</p><p>Ex-navy chief Jose Bubo Na Tchuto was arrested off the country’s coast by US forces and sentenced in October 2016 to four years in prison by a Manhattan court for conspiring to import drugs into the United States. He was the highest-ranking government official to be sentenced for drug trafficking.</p><p>“The drug cartels’ influence is depending on the lack of the legitimacy (of the government),” political analyst Aly Fary Ndiaye told Al Jazeera. “If, for example, we have a military coup, they will be more likely to create an environment through which they can grow their business by supporting or funding those who are in the army, so that they can shut their eyes and let them grow their business.”</p><p>Election observers from the AU and ECOWAS were still in Bissau when Wednesday’s coup occurred, including former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan and former Mozambican president Filipe Nyusi. The delegation appears to now be trapped in the country.</p><p>In a joint AU-ECOWAS statement signed by the former leaders, the blocs condemned the coup and called for the electoral process to be resumed. Both candidates, the statement said, had agreed to accept the vote results after the delegation engaged them in talks.</p><p>“We deplore this blatant attempt to disrupt the democratic process and the gains that have been achieved thus far,” the statement read. “We express concern of the arrests of top officials including those that are in charge of the electoral process. In this regard, we urge the armed forces to immediately release the detained officials to allow the country’s electoral process to proceed to its conclusion.”</p><p>Analyst Ochieng said ECOWAS was not vocal enough during the course of Embalo’s “political overreach”, including when he unilaterally dissolved parliament. The bloc, she said, is struggling to instil respect for democratic practices and public institutions because it fails to proactively uphold strict democratic standards, something the militaries are exploiting.</p><p>Meanwhile, the governments of Ghana and Nigeria have condemned the coup. Portugal and Qatar have also called for a resumption of the electoral process.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “appeals to all national stakeholders in Guinea-Bissau to exercise restraint and respect the rule of law,” Stephane Dujarric, his spokesperson, told reporters on Wednesday.</p><h2 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next?</h2><p>On Thursday, the military announced the reopening of borders after swearing in General Horta Inta-A for a transitional period of 12 months. He formerly served as personal Chief of Staff to the president and later on, as the Chief of Army General Staff.</p><p>Bissau was quiet and still being heavily patrolled by security forces on Thursday, although PAIGC called for a rally in front of the Ministry of the Interior, according to reporting by French radio channel, RFI.</p><p>The calm, though, belies what is likely to be a period of political uncertainty ahead, whether Embalo is reinstated or not, analysts say. Opposition candidates are unlikely to accept military rule and Embalo’s return may cement the theories of a ruse, and prompt protests which could be violent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the African Union and ECOWAS will likely pressure the military to return to democratic rule as soon as possible, Cummings said. Both have, in the past, suspended and sanctioned countries in which coups have taken place, before reinstating them after clear timelines for elections are set.</p><p>ECOWAS upheld suspensions on the military-led Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger for several months before the three exited the bloc and formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) in January.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
