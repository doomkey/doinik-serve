According to the EIA, in 2024, roughly a fifth of global LNG shipments moved through the corridor, with Qatar accounting for the vast majority of those volumes.</p><h2 id=\"where-does-it-all-go\">Where does it all go?</h2><p>The strait handles both oil and gas exports and imports.</p><p>Kuwait and the UAE import supplies sourced outside the Gulf, including shipments from the United States and West Africa.</p><p>The EIA estimated that in 2024, 84 percent of crude oil and condensate shipments transiting the strait headed to Asian markets. A similar pattern appears in the gas trade, with 83 percent of LNG volumes moving through the Strait of Hormuz destined for Asian destinations.</p><p>China, India, Japan and South Korea accounted for a combined 69 percent intake of all crude oil and condensate flows through the strait last year. Their factories, transport networks and power grids depend on uninterrupted Gulf energy.</p><p>A spike in oil prices will impact countries such as China, India and several Southeast Asian nations.</p><h2 id=\"how-would-the-strait-s-closure-impact-oil-prices\">How would the Strait’s closure impact oil prices?</h2><p>According to Iranian state media, the country’s Supreme National Security Council must make the final decision to close the strait, and it has to be ratified by the government.</p><p>But energy traders have been on high alert in recent weeks amid escalating tensions in the region – home to one of the largest reserves of oil and gas in the world. Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler, told Al Jazeera that since the war began on Saturday, there has been a sharp drop in vessel traffic through the strait.</p><p>“At the same time, the number of vessels idling on either side – in the Gulf of Oman and the Gulf – has surged, as shipowners grow increasingly concerned about maritime security risks following Tehran’s warning of a potential navigation closure,” he said.</p><p>“The Strait of Hormuz is critical to the global energy market, as roughly 30 percent of the world’s seaborne crude oil transits the waterway. In addition, nearly 20 percent of global jet fuel and about 16 percent of gasoline and naphtha flows also pass through the Strait,” Muyu said.</p><p>“On Sunday, an oil tanker was struck off the coast of Oman just hours ago, signalling a clear escalation of the conflict and a shift in targets from purely military facilities to energy assets.”</p><p>Shipping data showed that at least 150 tankers, including crude oil and liquefied natural gas vessels, have dropped anchor in open Gulf waters beyond the Strait of Hormuz.</p><p>The tankers were clustered in open waters off the coasts of major Gulf oil producers, including Iraq and Saudi Arabia, as well as LNG giant Qatar, according to the Reuters news agency estimates based on ship-tracking data from the MarineTraffic platform.</p><p>Moreover, on Sunday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said it is aware of “significant military activity” in the Strait and said it has ⁠received a report of an ⁠incident two nautical miles north of Oman’s Kumzar, located in the ‌Strait of Hormuz.</p><p>Muyu from Kpler said a broad range of energy infrastructure is now under threat. “This is expected to sharply intensify the oil price rally and could keep prices elevated for a sustained period, potentially longer than during last June’s conflict.”</p><p>Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera, “Closure of the Strait of Hormuz would disrupt roughly a fifth of globally traded oil overnight – and prices wouldn’t just spike, they would gap violently upward on fear alone.”</p><p>“The shock would reverberate far beyond energy markets, tightening financial conditions, fuelling inflation, and pushing fragile economies closer to recession in a matter of weeks,” he added.</p><p>When the US and Israel bombed Iran last June, there was no direct disruption to maritime activity in the region.</p><h2 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-the-global-economy\">What does it mean for the global economy?</h2><p>Any disruption to energy flows through Hormuz will also impact the global economy, driving up fuel and factory costs.</p><p>Hamad Hussain, a climate and commodities economist at the United Kingdom-based firm Capital Economics, said that for the global economy, a sustained rise in oil prices would add upward pressure to inflation.</p><p>“If crude oil prices were to rise to $100 per barrel and remain at those levels for a while, that could add 0.6-0.7 percent to global inflation,” he said, noting that this would also lead to an increase in natural gas prices.</p><p>“This could slow the pace of monetary easing by major central banks, particularly in emerging markets, where policymakers tend to be more sensitive to swings in commodity prices,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The United States-Israeli war on Iran is just one day old, and it is already clear it will have a profound impact on the Middle East and the Gulf in particular. The US-Israeli bombardment of Iran has killed a number of high-ranking officials as well as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Tehran has responded by attacking not just Israel but also various countries in the region.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman were all struck by Iranian missiles or drones, even though none of these countries had launched attacks on Iran from their territory. Various sites across these states were targeted, including US military bases, airports, ports and even commercial areas.</p><p>If the conflict drags on, it could become a real turning point for the Gulf – one that reshapes how states think about security, alliances and even their long-term economic futures.</p><p>For years, Gulf stability has leaned on a familiar set of assumptions: The United States remained the dominant security guarantor; rivalry with Iran was managed, contained and kept below the threshold of full confrontation; and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – despite its disagreements – provided enough coordination to prevent regional politics from unravelling entirely. A sustained conflict involving the US, Israel and Iran would strain all of that at once. It would push Gulf capitals to revisit not only their defence planning but also the deeper logic of their regional strategy.</p><p>In recent years, Gulf diplomacy had already been shifting – carefully, quietly and with a strong preference for hedging rather than choosing sides. The Saudi-Iran thaw brokered by China in 2023, the UAE’s pragmatic channels with Tehran and Oman’s steady mediation role all point to the same idea: Stability requires dialogue, even when mistrust runs deep. Qatar has also kept doors open, betting on diplomacy and de-escalation as a way to reduce risk.</p><p>But a prolonged war would make that balancing act much harder to sustain. Pressure would rise from Washington to show clearer alignment. Domestic opinion would demand firmer answers about where national interests truly stand. Regional polarisation would intensify. In that kind of environment, strategic ambiguity stops looking like smart flexibility and starts looking like vulnerability because everyone wants you to pick a side.</p><p>The economic shockwaves could be just as significant. Any extended conflict tied to Iran immediately puts maritime chokepoints back at the centre of global attention, especially the Strait of Hormuz, one of the most sensitive arteries in the world economy. Even limited disruptions could trigger sharp energy price increases, higher insurance and shipping costs, and renewed investor anxiety.</p><p>Yes, higher oil prices could boost revenues in the short term, but sustained volatility carries a different cost. It could scare away long-term capital, complicate megaproject financing and raise borrowing costs at exactly the moment many Gulf states are trying to accelerate diversification.</p><p>There is also a longer-term strategic risk. Major consumers, especially in Asia, may decide that repeated instability is reason enough to speed up diversification away from Gulf energy resources. Over time, that would quietly reduce the region’s leverage, even if it remains a major energy supplier.</p><p>Inside the GCC, the war could either push states closer together or expose the cracks. The bloc has always moved between unity and rivalry, and a crisis doesn’t automatically produce cohesion. Different members have different threat perceptions and different comfort levels with risk. Oman and Qatar have typically valued mediation and communication channels with Tehran. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have leaned more heavily towards deterrence, even if both have recently invested in de-escalation. Kuwait tends to balance carefully and avoid hard positioning.</p><p>If the conflict escalates unpredictably, those differences could resurface and strain coordination. But the opposite outcome is also possible. The crisis could drive deeper cooperation on missile defence, intelligence sharing and maritime security. Which direction the GCC takes will depend less on outside pressure and more on whether member states see this as a moment to compete or a moment to close ranks.</p><p>Zooming out, a prolonged war would also accelerate larger geopolitical realignments. China and Russia would not remain passive. Beijing, deeply invested in Gulf energy flows and regional connectivity, may expand its diplomatic footprint and present itself as a stabilising intermediary. Moscow could exploit the turmoil to increase arms sales and leverage regional divisions.</p><p>Meanwhile, if US military engagement deepens but Washington’s political bandwidth narrows, Gulf states may find themselves in a complicated position – more dependent on American security support yet more cautious about relying on a single patron. That dynamic could produce a new pattern, something like conditional alignment, where Gulf capitals cooperate militarily with the US but widen their economic and diplomatic options to avoid overdependence.</p><p>The deepest change, though, may not be military or economic. It may be cultural, in strategic terms. The Gulf states have spent decades prioritising stability, modernisation and careful geopolitical manoeuvring. A sustained regional war could disrupt that model. It could force painful trade-offs between security imperatives and development ambitions, between diplomatic flexibility and alliance discipline, between the desire to avoid escalation and the reality of living next door to it.</p><p>That is why the Gulf now feels like it is standing at a crossroads. It could become the front line of a prolonged, great power-inflected confrontation – or it could leverage the diplomatic capital it has built to push for de-escalation while strengthening its defensive resilience. Either way, the outcome won’t just shape Gulf security thinking. It could influence the region’s entire political architecture for years – possibly decades – to come.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Israel and the United States attacked Iran, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip began to panic. They remembered how crossings were closed in the past, causing famine, and rushed to markets to buy whatever they could. As a result, prices of food and basic necessities skyrocketed. Soon enough, the news came that the border crossings had been closed.</p><p>All of this happened just as the grace period set by Israel for 37 NGOs to withdraw from Gaza for not fulfilling registration requirements expired. <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/which-aid-groups-is-israel-banning-from-gaza-now-and-what-will-it-mean\">Organisations</a> like Doctors Without Borders (also known by its French acronym MSF), Medical Aid for Palestinians UK, Handicap International: Humanity &amp; Inclusion, ActionAid, CARE, etc were supposed to stop operating in Gaza.</p><p>At the last moment, a ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court allowed them to continue working while it considers their appeal against the ban. But even with this court decision, these organisations cannot continue to function fully. That is because the Israeli occupation continues to prevent their supplies and foreign staff from entering Gaza.</p><p>According to these NGOs, together they are <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/aid-groups-petition-high-court-to-let-them-keep-working-in-gaza-after-ban-over-new-rules/\">responsible</a> for half of the food handouts in the Strip and 60 percent of services provided in field hospitals.</p><p>For many families in Gaza, this means hunger – because food parcels will not be distributed and livelihoods will be lost.</p><p>We know this is not about NGOs failing to meet new registration rules, just like the closure of the border crossings is not a matter of security. They are about exacting yet another form of collective punishment on the Palestinians.</p><p>Even if the Supreme Court miraculously rules against the NGO ban, the Israeli occupation would still find another way to push these foreign organisations out of Gaza. This was made clear this month when it was revealed that World Central Kitchen, which has been running dozens of soup kitchens across the Strip and which is not on the ban list, may be suspending its activities.</p><p>According to Gaza’s Government Media Office, this was because Israel blocked most of the organisation’s supply trucks from coming in. As a result, there are not enough supplies to continue cooking. World Central Kitchen previously said it serves 1 million meals daily.</p><p>So now, amid the war with Iran, which may last weeks or months, hundreds of thousands of families will not have adequate food once again.</p><p>All of this comes on top of Israel’s continuing war on UNRWA. Since its creation in late 1949, the United Nations agency has been the backbone of international support for Palestinian refugees. It has the largest capacity for emergency response and the widest spectrum of services on offer. And yet, Israel has banned its operations and has blocked its supplies from entering the Strip.</p><p>Through relentless lobbying, Israel has managed to achieve substantial cuts to UNRWA’s budget. As a result, last month 600 employees were fired. The salaries of the rest were reduced by <a href=\"/news/2026/1/30/unrwa-staff-cuts-deepen-in-gaza-as-israel-restricts-critical-aid-access\">20 percent</a>.</p><p>The NGO ban will likely result in thousands of people losing their jobs as well. And this is at a time when unemployment in Gaza has gone beyond 80 percent.</p><p>My family will also suffer. In the past, we have benefitted from food and basic supplies handouts from NGOs, and my brother has been able to find temporary work as a driver for one of them.</p><p>The possible closure of international organisations is a direct threat to the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians who depend on their services and employment. The closure of the border crossings could mean another hunger crisis.</p><p>These are a form of collective punishment that yet again will not make the news. Israel is constantly thinking of new ways to make our lives that much more unbearable, that much more impossible in our devastated homeland.</p><p>Two and half years of the Israeli genocide has destroyed hospitals, schools, universities, roads, sewage and potable water systems, water treatment plants, the electricity grid, and countless generators and solar panels.</p><p>The vast majority of the population lives primitive lives in tents or makeshift shelters that cannot protect people from extreme heat or cold.</p><p>Water is contaminated, food is insufficient, land has been destroyed and poisoned.</p><p>Now we will be deprived of the little international support we have been receiving.</p><p>And what is the goal of all this? To push us ever closer to despair and the ultimate surrender, to make us desire to leave our homeland on our own. Ethnic cleansing by mutual agreement.</p><p>All of the organisations that Israel is seeking to ban are foreign. Most of them are based in Western countries. Yet there has been little to no condemnation from Western governments of Israel’s actions against their own organisations. There has been no outrage that the occupation is trying to destroy international humanitarian provision so it can fully control aid distribution.</p><p>Collective punishment is a violation of international law. States are obliged to go beyond verbal condemnations and take action by imposing sanctions. Until that happens, we in Gaza will continue to be subjected to ever more brutal acts of collective punishment by our occupiers.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

However, in Iran, the reality suggests a far more complex situation.</p><p>Interviews with insiders, military experts and political sociologists suggest that the decapitation of Iran’s top leadership may not go the way the West envisions. Instead, it risks birthing a “garrison state” – a paranoid, militarised system fighting for its existence with no political red lines left to cross.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"the-limits-of-decapitation\">The limits of ‘decapitation’</h2><p>The central premise of the US operation is that Iran is too brittle to survive the death of its supreme leader. In a phone interview with CBS News, Trump claimed he “knows exactly” who is calling the shots in Tehran, adding that “there are some good candidates” to replace the supreme leader. He did not elaborate on his claims.</p><p>However, military analysts warn against the assumption that air strikes alone can trigger “regime change”. Michael Mulroy, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence, told Al Jazeera Arabic that without “boots on the ground” or a fully armed organic uprising, the state’s deep security apparatus can survive simply by maintaining cohesion.</p><p>“You cannot facilitate regime change through air strikes alone,” Mulroy said. “If anyone is left alive to speak, the regime is still there.”</p><p>This resilience is rooted in Iran’s dual military structure. The government is protected not just by a regular army (Artesh), but also by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – a powerful parallel military force constitutionally tasked with protecting the velayat-e faqih system – the principle of the guardianship of the Islamic jurist.</p><p>Supporting them is the Basij, a vast paramilitary volunteer militia embedded in every neighbourhood, specifically trained to crush internal dissent and mobilise ideological loyalists.</p><p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4233956\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/INTERACTIVE-Irans-military-structure-Jan-12-2026-EDIT-1768237546.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-Iran’s military structure-Jan 12, 2026-EDIT-1768237546\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></p><p>That cohesion is already being tested.</p><p>Hossein Royvaran, a political analyst based in Tehran, confirmed that the strikes wiped out the country’s top security tier, including Khamenei’s adviser and secretary of the newly-formed Supreme Defence Council, Ali Shamkhani.</p><p>The secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Larijani, said the leadership transition will begin on Sunday.</p><p>“An interim leadership council will soon be formed. The president, the head of the judiciary and a jurist from the Guardian Council will assume responsibility until the election of the next leader,” said Larijani.</p><p>“This council will be established as soon as possible. We are working to form it as early as today,” he said in an interview broadcast by state TV.</p><p>The rapid formation of an interim leadership council – comprising the president, judiciary chief, and a Guardian Council religious leader – indicates that the system’s “survival protocols” have been activated.</p><p>According to Royvaran, the system is designed to be “institutional, not personal”, capable of functioning on “autopilot” even when the political leadership is severed.</p><p>But a Tehran-based analyst said direction of Iran is still unclear as officials try to ‘project stability’.</p><p>“Officials here are trying to project stability, emphasising that the situation is under control and that state institutions are functioning effectively,” Abas Aslani, senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, said.</p><p>“Today, [the US-Israeli] air strikes targeted security and military infrastructure in the capital [Tehran] and other cities. There are expectations that such strikes could continue – and possibly intensify – in the coming hours or days,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“That prospect of escalation is not something many ordinary Iranians welcome. At the same time, Iranian officials are issuing strong warnings, suggesting they could respond with capabilities that have not previously been used against Israel or the United States.”</p><h2 id=\"from-theocracy-to-nationalist-survival\">From theocracy to nationalist survival</h2><p>Perhaps the most significant shift in the immediate aftermath is Iran’s pivot from religious legitimacy to survivalist nationalism.</p><p>Aware that the death of the supreme leader might sever the spiritual bond with parts of the population, surviving officials are reframing the war not as a defence of the clergy, but as a defence of Iran’s territorial integrity.</p><p>Larijani, a conservative heavyweight and key figure in the transition, issued a stark warning that Israel’s ultimate goal is the “partition” of Iran. By raising the spectre of Iran being broken into ethnic statelets, the leadership aims to rally secular Iranians and the opposition against a common external enemy.</p><p>This strategy complicates the US hope for a popular uprising.</p><p>Saleh al-Mutairi, a political sociologist, notes that the government’s declaration of 40 days of mourning creates a “funeral trap” for the opposition. The streets will likely be filled with millions of mourners, creating a human shield for the government and making it logistically and morally difficult for antigovernment protests to gain momentum in the short term.</p><h2 id=\"the-end-of-strategic-patience\">The end of ‘strategic patience’</h2><p>If Iran survives the initial shock, the nation that emerges will likely be fundamentally different: less calculated and probably more violent.</p><p>For years, Khamenei championed a doctrine of “strategic patience”, often absorbing blows to avoid all-out war.</p><p>Hassan Ahmadian, a professor at the University of Tehran, says the era died with the supreme leader.</p><p>“Iran learned a hard lesson from the June 2025 war: Restraint is interpreted as weakness,” Ahmadian told Al Jazeera Arabic. The new calculus in Tehran is likely to be a “scorched earth” policy.</p><p>“The decision has been made. If attacked, Iran will burn everything,” Ahmadian added, suggesting that the response will be broader and more painful than anything seen in previous escalations.”</p><p>This risks a scenario where field commanders, freed from the political caution of the clerical leadership, lash out with greater ferocity. The assassination has humiliated the security establishment, exposing what Liqaa Maki, a senior researcher at Al Jazeera Centre for Studies, calls a catastrophic intelligence failure.</p><p>“The believer is not bitten from the same hole twice, yet Iran has been bitten twice,” Maki said, referring to the pattern of US strikes. This “total exposure” is likely to drive the surviving leadership underground, turning Iran into a hyper-security state that views any internal dissent as foreign collaboration, he said.</p><p>While the “head” of Iran has been removed, the “body” – armed with one of the largest missile arsenals in the Middle East – remains, Maki said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who had mediated the indirect talks, believed a deal to ensure peace was closer than ever.</p><p>“Pres Trump gave IRAN PLENTY OF NEGOTIABLE OPPORTUNITY,” Senator Chuck Grassley wrote on X.</p><p>Congressman Randy Fine, a Trump ally with a history of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/us-congressman-randy-fine-suggests-palestinians-should-be-destroyed-first\">anti-Muslim statements</a>, also expressed support for the strikes.</p><p>“We are with you, Mr. President,” Fine wrote on X.</p><p>“We will cut off the head of the snake of Muslim terror, Bring lasting peace to the Middle East, And save the Iranian People. Bombs away.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"minimal-dissent\">Minimal dissent</h2><p>Many Republican members of Congress also rushed to hail the killing of Iran’s Supreme Leader <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/irans-supreme-leader-ali-khamenei-killed-in-us-israeli-attacks-reports\">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a>.</p><p>“President Trump just changed ‘Death to America’ to ‘Death by America,'” Senator Bernie Moreno wrote on X.</p><p>Lindsey Graham, a hawkish senator and staunch advocate for government change in Iran, said “unleashing” Washington’s military powers against Iran sent a message to Russia and China.</p><p>“All I can say about President Trump, I’ve never met a man like him. I’ve never met anybody so determined to be a peacemaker, but you don’t want to get on his bad side,” Graham told Fox News.</p><p>Even conservative commentators who had warned against the war, such as podcaster Tucker Carlson, were largely muted on Saturday.</p><p>Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former Trump ally who fell out with the US president and <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">quit Congress</a> earlier this year, shared several posts arguing that war with Iran does not advance US interests.</p><p>Greene noted that Trump had presented himself as a pro-peace candidate when running for president.</p><p>“Does war with Iran help the mental health crisis in America or help the drug addiction pandemic in America? Nope. Does war with Iran do anything to help American families stay together and survive? No, not at all,” she wrote.</p><p>“But within hours of war with Iran it was reported approximately 40 innocent girls, school children, in Iran were killed by bombs from Israel. And they don’t care; they killed thousands of innocent children in Gaza, and apparently our Pro-Peace administration doesn’t care either,” Greene added.</p><p></p><p>Congressman Tom Massie, whom Trump is trying to oust by backing a primary challenge against him, declared himself a rare Republican critic of the war.</p><p>“I am opposed to this War,” he wrote on X. “This is not ‘America First.'”</p><p>Massie promised to push forward with a bill to rein in Trump’s power to attack Iran when Congress reconvenes in the coming days.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"democrats-response\">Democrats’ response</h2><p>Many Democrats focused on the legal aspect of the attacks on Iran, arguing that Trump should have sought congressional approval. The US Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the authority to declare war.</p><p>Still, many welcomed the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/ayatollah-ali-khamenei-the-leader-who-shaped-irans-defiance\">death of Khamenei</a> while criticising Trump’s strategy.</p><p>“I’m not going to shed any tears as it relates to his death. He’s brutalised his own people and built an Iran that is the largest state sponsor of terror in the world,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told National Public Radio.</p><p>“But what comes next is unclear because the Trump administration has not been able to articulate a plan, one to ensure that US forces are not entangled in a forever war in the Middle East, which we know would be a disaster,” Jeffries said.</p><p>Democratic Senator Tim Kaine cast doubt over the assertions that Iran posed an imminent threat to the US, which will likely be cited as Trump’s legal argument for the attack.</p><p>“I’m on two committees that give me access to a lot of classified information; there was no imminent threat from Iran to the United States that warrants sending our sons and daughters into yet another war in the Middle East,” Kaine told CNN.</p><p>“I’m going to do everything I can to stop it.”</p><p>But some pro-Israel Democrats broke ranks with their party and praised the war without qualifications.</p><p>“President Trump has been willing to do what’s right and necessary to produce real peace in the region,” Senator <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/how-have-us-politicians-reacted-to-the-attack-on-iran\">John Fetterman</a> wrote on X.</p><p>“God bless the United States, our great military, and Israel,” he wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel has pushed the US to attack Iran for two decades, and they finally got it.”</p><p>Mortazavi highlighted Trump’s criticism of his predecessors, who had waged regime-change wars in the region.</p><p>“It is ironic, because this is a president who called himself the ‘<a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/5/trump-takes-the-spotlight-peace-prize-at-fifa-world-cup-draw\">president of peace</a>‘,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"history-of-warnings-of-the-iranian-threat\">History of warnings of the Iranian ‘threat’</h2><p>Netanyahu, who promoted the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, has been warning for more than two decades that Iran is on the cusp of acquiring nuclear weapons.</p><p>Iran denies seeking a nuclear bomb, and even Trump <a href=\"/video/compare-contrast/2025/6/22/tulsi-gabbard-on-irans-nuclear-capabilities\">administration officials</a> have acknowledged that Washington has no evidence that Tehran is weaponising its uranium enrichment programme.</p><p>After the US bombed Iran’s main enrichment facilities in the 12-day war in June last year – an attack that Trump says “obliterated” the country’s <a href=\"/news/2026/2/24/us-re-asserts-2025-strikes-obliterated-irans-nuclear-programme\">nuclear programme</a> – Netanyahu pivoted to a new supposed Iranian threat: Tehran’s ballistic missiles.</p><p>“Iran can blackmail any American city,” Netanyahu told pro-Israel podcaster Ben Shapiro in October.</p><p>“People don’t believe it. Iran is developing intercontinental missiles with a range of 8,000km [5,000 miles], add another 3,000 [1,800 miles], and they can get to the East Coast of the US.”</p><p><span>Trump repeated that claim, which Tehran has vehemently denied and has not been backed by any public evidence or testing, in his <a href=\"/news/2026/2/25/trumps-state-of-the-union-touts-economic-turnaround-as-approval-slumps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of the Union</a> address earlier this week.</span></p><p>“They’ve already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America,” he said of the Iranians.</p><p>Trump has been building the case for a wider war with Iran since the June conflict, repeatedly threatening to bomb the country again.</p><p>But the US president’s own <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">National Security Strategy</a> last year called for de-prioritising the Middle East in Washington’s foreign policy and focusing on the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US public, wary of global conflict after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has also been largely opposed to new strikes against Iran, public opinion polls show.</p><p>Only 21 percent of respondents in a recent University of Maryland <a href=\"https://sadat.umd.edu/sites/sadat.umd.edu/files/Questionnaire%20Prospects%20of%20War%20with%20Iran.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> said they favoured a war with Iran.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The first day of the war saw Iran fire missiles against bases and cities that host US troops and assets across <a href=\"/news/2026/2/28/multiple-gulf-arab-states-that-host-us-assets-targeted-in-iran-retaliation\">the Middle East</a> in retaliation for the joint US-Israeli strikes, plunging the region into chaos.</p><p>Trump acknowledged that US troops may suffer casualties in the conflict. “That often happens in war,” he said on Saturday. “But we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission.”</p><h2 id=\"ignoring-the-vast-majority-of-americans\">‘Ignoring the vast majority of Americans’</h2><p>The Trump administration had appeared to step back from the brink of conflict earlier this month by engaging in diplomacy with Tehran.</p><p>US and Iranian negotiators held three rounds of talks over the past week, with Tehran stressing that it is willing to agree to rigorous inspections of its nuclear programme.</p><p>Omani mediators and Iranian officials had described the last round of negotiations, which took place on Thursday, as positive, saying that it yielded significant progress.</p><p>The <a href=\"/editorial/2026/2/28/nine-months-after-12-day-war-us-israel-seek-to-topple-irans-leaders\">June 2025 war</a>, initiated by Israel without provocation, also came in the middle of US-Iran talks.</p><p>“Netanyahu’s agenda has always been to prevent a diplomatic solution, and he feared Trump was actually serious about getting a deal, so the start of this war in the middle of negotiations is a success for him, just like it was last June,” Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Trump’s embrace of regime change rhetoric is a further victory for Netanyahu, and loss for the American people, as it suggests the US may be committed to a long and unpredictable military boondoggle.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While announcing the strikes on Saturday, Trump said his aim is to prevent Iran from “threatening America and our core national security interests”.</p><p>But US critics, including some proponents of Trump’s “America first” movement, have argued that Iran – more than 10,000km (6,000 miles) away – does not pose a threat to the US.</p><p>Earlier this month, US Ambassador to Israel <a href=\"/news/2026/2/21/absurd-and-provocative-huckabee-faces-firestorm-for-israel-border-stance\">Mike Huckabee</a> told conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that “if it were not for Iran, there wouldn’t be Hezbollah; we wouldn’t have the problem on the border with Lebanon”.</p><p>Carlson said, “What problem on the border with Lebanon? I’m an American. I’m not having any problems on the border with Lebanon right now. I live in Maine.”</p><p>On Saturday, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib stressed that the US public does not want war with Iran.</p><p>“Trump is acting on the violent fantasies of the American political elite and the Israeli apartheid government, ignoring the vast majority of Americans who say loud and clear: No More Wars,” Tlaib said in a statement.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Among Democrats and Independents, approval was just 10 percent and 21 percent, respectively, while 68 percent of Republicans expressed support.</p><p>Here’s how some of the US’s most prominent elected representatives and political figures have reacted.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>President Donald Trump:</strong> “A short time ago, the United States military started major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime, a vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.”</p><p><strong>Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson:</strong> “Today, Iran is facing the severe consequences of its evil actions. President Trump and the Administration have made every effort to pursue peaceful and diplomatic solutions in response to the Iranian regime’s sustained nuclear ambitions and development, terrorism, and the murder of Americans—and even their own people.”</p><p><strong>Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune:</strong> “For years, Iran’s relentless nuclear ambitions, its expanded ballistic missile inventory, and its unwavering support for terror groups in the region have posed a clear and unacceptable threat to U.S. servicemembers, citizens in the region, and many of our allies. Despite the dogged efforts of the president and his administration, the Iranian regime has refused the diplomatic off-ramps that would peacefully resolve these national security concerns. I commend President Trump for taking action to thwart these threats.”</p><p><strong>Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries:</strong> “Donald Trump failed to seek Congressional authorization prior to striking Iran. Instead, the president’s decision to abandon diplomacy and launch a massive military attack has left American troops vulnerable to Iran’s retaliatory actions. We pray for the safety of the men and women of the US military as they have been put into harm’s way in a dangerous theatre of war.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer:</strong> “The administration has not provided Congress and the American people with critical details about the scope and immediacy of the threat. Confronting Iran’s malign regional activities, nuclear ambitions, and harsh oppression of the Iranian people demands American strength, resolve, regional coordination, and strategic clarity. Unfortunately, President Trump’s fitful cycles of lashing out and risking wider conflict are not a viable strategy.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib:</strong> “The American people do not want a war with Iran. Trump is acting on the violent fantasies of the American political elite and the Israeli apartheid government, ignoring the vast majority of Americans who say loud and clear: No More Wars.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:</strong> “The American people are once again dragged into a war they did not want by a president who does not care about the long-term consequences of his actions. This war is unlawful. It is unnecessary. And it will be catastrophic. Just this week, Iran and the United States were negotiating key measures that could have staved off war. The president walked away from these discussions and chose war instead.”</p><p><strong>New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani:</strong> “Today’s military strikes on Iran — carried out by the United States and Israel — mark a catastrophic escalation in an illegal war of aggression. Bombing cities. Killing civilians. Opening a new theatre of war.  Americans do not want this. They do not want another war in pursuit of regime change. They want relief from the affordability crisis. They want peace.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders:</strong> “This Trump–Netanyahu war is unconstitutional and violates international law. It endangers the lives of U.S. troops and people across the region. We’ve lived through the lies of Vietnam and Iraq. No more endless wars. Congress must pass a War Powers Resolution immediately.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen:</strong> “Trump is lying to the American people as he launches an illegal, regime-change war against Iran. This is endangering American lives and has already resulted in mass civilian casualties. This is not making us safer &amp; only damages the US and our interests. The Senate must immediately vote on the War Powers Resolution to stop it.”</p><p><strong>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham:</strong> “I fervently pray that the long-suffering people of Iran will have their oppression ended soon. I also fervently pray that we’re on the verge of a new dawn in the Middle East, with historic opportunity for lasting peace and prosperity. As to our allies in Israel, President Trump and all under his command, your bravery has set in motion the end of evil and darkness, and the beginning of the light. Well done.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Representative Ro Khanna:</strong> “Trump has launched an illegal regime change war in Iran with American lives at risk. Congress must convene on Monday to vote on Representative Thomas Massie and my WPR [War Powers Resolution] to stop this. Every member of Congress should go on record this weekend on how they will vote.”</p><p><strong>Republican Representative Thomas Massie:</strong> “I am opposed to this War. This is not “America First.” When Congress reconvenes, I will work with Representative Ro Khanna to force a Congressional vote on war with Iran. The Constitution requires a vote, and your Representative needs to be on record as opposing or supporting this war.”</p><p><strong>Republican Senator Tom Cotton:</strong> “Iran’s missile program poses an imminent threat to the United States and our allies. I’m thankful President Trump is taking necessary action to protect our homeland.”</p><p><strong>Democratic Senator Adam Schiff:</strong> “Trump is drawing our country into yet another foreign war that Americans don’t want and Congress has not authorised. The Iranian regime is a brutal and murderous dictatorship. But that does not give Trump the authority to unilaterally initiate a war of choice.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Democratic Senator John Fetterman:</strong> “Operation Epic Fury. President Trump has been willing to do what’s right and necessary to produce real peace in the region. God bless the United States, our great military, and Israel.”</p><p><strong>Former Democratic Presidential Nominee Kamala Harris:</strong> “Donald Trump is dragging the United States into a war the American people do not want. Let me be clear: I am opposed to a regime-change war in Iran, and our troops are being put in harm’s way for the sake of Trump’s war of choice.”</p><p><strong>Former Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene:</strong> “We said “No More Foreign Wars, No More Regime Change!” We said it on rally stage after rally stage, speech after speech. Trump, Vance, basically the entire admin campaigned on it and promised to put America FIRST and Make America Great Again. My generation has been let down, abused, and used by our government our entire adult lives and our children’s generation is literally being abandoned.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
