They labour in -15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) temperatures from early morning until midnight, according to Yurii Bryzh, who leads the Boryspil regional department at power company DTEK.</p><p>Although they have managed to restore power for four hours per day, Bryzh explained the recurring challenge: “When the power comes back on, people turn on all the electrical equipment that is available in the house” to quickly wash, cook, or recharge devices, causing the system to collapse again.</p><p>Civilians face acute hardship amid what Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko described as the longest and most widespread outages since Russia’s full-scale invasion nearly four years ago, with some homes without electricity for days.</p><p>Apartments throughout the capital are freezing.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has shone a spotlight on the type of crude held by the Latin American country.</p><p>Crude oil, which is produced by about 100 countries, comes in hundreds of varieties that differ by viscosity and sulfur content.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>While all grades of crude oil are valuable, their differing properties make certain grades more sought after in some markets than others.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-difference-between-heavy-and-light-grades-of-oil\">What is the difference between ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ grades of oil?</h2><p>Crude oils are rated as “heavy” or “light” based on their viscosities, or “gravities”.</p><p>Crude is also classified by sulfur content, with high-sulfur grades called “sour” and lower-sulfur varieties referred to as “sweet”.</p><p>Heavy, sour grades are more difficult and costly to refine into petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel.</p><p>Generally speaking, lighter and sweeter crude commands higher prices.</p><p>Some countries and regions primarily produce certain grades.</p><p>Canada mainly produces heavy, sour crude, for example, while African varieties tend to be lighter and sweeter.</p><p>Popular light, sweet varieties include Saudi Arabia’s Arabian Super Light, Iran’s South Pars Condensate, Malaysia’s Tapis Blend, and Australia’s Cossack.</p><p>Among the most traded heavy, sour varieties are China’s Shengli, the United Kingdom’s Kraken, Iraq’s Basra Heavy, and Iran’s Soroosh.</p><h2 id=\"what-type-of-oil-does-venezuela-have\">What type of oil does Venezuela have?</h2><p>Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, at an estimated 303 billion barrels.</p><p>Most of those reserves are made up of heavy, sour crude located in the Orinoco Oil Belt in the centre of the country.</p><p>The basin’s oil is especially dense and vicious, with a tar-like consistency that necessitates specialist methods such as steam injection and diluents for extraction.</p><p>Industry analysts say tapping the basin’s true potential will require huge investment due to the degraded state of the sector’s infrastructure and knowledge base, following late leader Hugo Chavez’s nationalisation of the industry and years of US sanctions that prevented Venezuela from accessing foreign capital and modern technology.</p><p>The Latin American country’s output was estimated at about 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, less than 1 percent of the world’s total, a steep decline from its 1970s peak of about 3.5 million bpd.</p><p>Rystad Energy, a consultancy based in Oslo, Norway, has estimated that about $110bn in capital investment would be needed to return to the country’s late 2000s output of about 2 million bpd.</p><p>US President Donald Trump, whose decision to kidnap Maduro has been widely condemned as a violation of international law, has said US oil companies are prepared to invest billions of dollars to revive production.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-venezuela-s-heavy-crude-particularly-attractive-for-the-us\">Why is Venezuela’s heavy crude particularly attractive for the US?</h2><p>Some industry analysts have expressed scepticism that US oil companies will be drawn to Venezuela – at least not without significant incentives and guarantees.</p><p>They point to the post-Maduro leadership uncertainty, Chavez’s past expropriation of company assets, and the excess supply of oil in the global market as reasons why firms may be hesitant to invest.</p><p>ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, two of the biggest US oil firms, pulled out of the country in 2007 following Chavez’s seizure of their facilities, and the two companies were later awarded large payouts in international arbitration.</p><p>At a meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday, ExxonMobil Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods described Venezuela as “uninvestable” in its current state and said “significant changes” would need to occur in the country to justify returning.</p><p>As the only major US oil producer in the country at present, Chevron, which operates under special exemption from Washington’s sanctions, is widely viewed as best positioned to profit on Trump’s plans.</p><p>While there are differing views on the business case for the major oil companies in Venezuela, analysts are in agreement that one group in particular stands to gain: US refineries.</p><p>While the US currently pumps more crude than any other country due to an explosion in drilling for lighter shale oil, most of the country’s refineries were built to process heavier grades.</p><p>Nearly 70 percent of US refining capacity is designed for heavier crude, according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a relic of heavy investment made before the more recent boom in shale drilling.</p><p>“You need what is referred to as a ‘complex’ refinery with deep conversion capacities. The Gulf Coast has multiple refineries like that,” Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“The coker units that are key were built to take advantage of heavy crude not just from Venezuela, but also places like Mexico and other South American producers.”</p><p>Shon Hiatt, director of the Zage Business of Energy Initiative at the University of Southern California, said US refineries would benefit “tremendously” from a boost in exports of Venezuelan crude.</p><p>“Many of the US refineries along the coast – Texas and Louisiana – were built and designed to process Venezuela crude,” Hiatt told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Venezuela has a history of exporting its oil to the US due to the fact that US oil companies were the first to go in, discover, pump, process, and export Venezuelan petroleum. Hence, refineries along the coast were built to handle this type of petroleum.”</p><p>While heavy Canadian crude has displaced imports from Venezuela over the years due to sanctions, that could change if Trump has his way, Hiatt said.</p><p>“If the Venezuelan heavy crude exports increase, it will displace the Canadian heavy crude as Venezuelan crude typically is sold at a lower price to these refineries,” he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Authorities in Iran say that more than 100 security force personnel have been killed in clashes with protesters, while opposition activists say the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/15/what-is-hrana-the-us-based-group-behind-irans-death-toll-figures\">real toll</a> includes more than 1,000 protesters, since demonstrations erupted in late December. Al Jazeera cannot independently verify these figures.</p><p>Trump called on Iranians to take over state institutions, promising that “help is on the way”. While it wasn’t clear what kind of attack he was considering, his remarks left the region bracing for an escalation.</p><p>Arab Gulf nations fear that a military strike on Iran could disrupt oil prices, shatter their reputation as safe havens for business, and trigger an Iranian retaliation on their soil.</p><p>It wouldn’t be the first time. In 2019, Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen struck Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities, temporarily reducing Saudi oil production. Last June, Tehran attacked Qatar’s Al Udeid airbase, which hosts American troops, after the US struck a key nuclear facility in Iran.</p><p>Iran gave ample warning that it would carry out the attack, which marked the end of the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, yet it created a precedent. And while that conflict weakened Iran’s military capabilities, the Islamic Republic still has an arsenal to hurt US interests in the region.</p><p>“Iran has ballistic missiles, supersonic missiles and militia groups around, so if they are given a reason to hit, they would,” said Seloom.</p><p>On Wednesday, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran had warned regional countries, from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to Turkiye, that US bases in those nations would be attacked if the US targets Iran. That was followed by the drawdown of ‍some personnel ‍from the Al Udeid airbase.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in the White House later on Wednesday, Trump said he had received information that “the killing in Iran is stopping, is stopped … and there’s no plan for executions”. While some interpreted that as an off-ramp to de-escalation, the US president did not rule out military action.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"unintended-consequences\">Unintended consequences</h2><p>Each member of the Gulf Cooperation Council has a different history with Iran but they all fear what would happen next and who would fill the vacuum should Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei be replaced or the whole system abruptly collapse, experts say.</p><p>The collapse of Iraq following the 2003 US-led invasion, and the chaos that followed – including a deadly civil war, the strengthening of al-Qaeda, and the eventual emergence of ISIL (ISIS) – is an experience Arab Gulf countries do not want to see repeated in a country with a population of more than 90 million, an arsenal of weapons at its disposal, and a badly weakened yet existent network of allies in the region.</p><p>“They may like to see the Iranian leadership weakened, but all of them are more concerned about a scenario of chaos and uncertainty and the possibility of more radical elements coming to power there,” said Khalaf.</p><p>Qatar, Kuwait and Oman have found their way to exist with their neighbour on the northern shore of the Gulf – Doha even shares with Tehran the world’s largest natural gas reservoir.</p><p>The UAE’s Dubai is also a key port for trade with Iran and the two countries enjoy a robust economic partnership. The UAE would therefore greatly suffer from unrest in Iran or an attack on its soil. Still, Emirati officials have remained silent in the past week having diverged from other GCC countries by cozying up to Israel and taking different positions in Sudan and Yemen.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been arch-foes, but in recent years the rivalry has morphed into a pragmatic relationship based on keeping channels of communication open and preventing each other from escalation.</p><p>Riyadh is especially wary of regional destabilisation as the Kingdom embarks on a series of ambitious economic reforms to diversify its reliance on oil and boost its tourism sector – goals that require stability at home and in the broader region.</p><p>“Saudi [Arabia] is not comfortable at all with regime change anywhere – it’s radical and extreme and outcomes are uncertain and risky,” Khalaf added.</p><p>“Our goal is to achieve stability and calm so that we can direct our resources toward building a better future for our people,” Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir said on Thursday.</p><p>Still, Khaled Batarfi, a Saudi political analyst, said that Riyadh would welcome changes in Iran, especially if they are gradual, bringing about a leadership willing to curtail its nuclear and missile programmes and one that is less opposed to the US.</p><p>“But a sudden change like a regime change with the risk of the country’s disintegration is not going to be good for anyone,” said Batarfi. “The whole region is on fire and we don’t need to add another fire to our doors.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

This phase is about “moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction”, said US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in a social media post.</p><p>The new phase includes a new Palestinian technocratic administration, overseen by an international “Board of Peace”, chaired by US President Donald Trump.</p><p>But while everything may sound workable on paper, the reaction from Palestinians in Gaza – one that mixes cautious hope and deep scepticism – is shaped by their lived experience since the beginning of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023.</p><p>“A lot of political decisions are distant from the reality faced in Gaza… our daily life that is filled with blockades, fear, loss, tents, and a terrible humanitarian situation,” said Arwa Ashour, a freelance journalist and writer based in Gaza City. “Even when decisions are made to ease the suffering, they are obstructed by the Israeli occupation authorities.”</p><p>“People want everything back like it was before the war: schools, hospitals, travel,” Ashour said. “If the Board of Peace is going to resolve all these crises, then we welcome it. But if it’s unable to do so, then what is its benefit?”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"palestinians-excluded\">Palestinians excluded?</h2><p>Ashour explained that after two years of war and more than 18 years of governance in the Palestinian enclave by Hamas, there is a desire for change in Gaza.</p><p>“People want to be part of the process of creating the future, not only to accept the implementation of decisions that have already been made,” she said.</p><p>The governance model envisaged in the second phase of the ceasefire plan does have a Palestinian component.</p><p>Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister, will head the Palestinian technocratic committee that will manage daily life. But that committee will be overseen by the Board of Peace, to be led by Bulgaria’s former foreign and defence minister, <a href=\"/features/2026/1/15/who-is-nickolay-mladenov-the-diplomat-tasked-with-disarming-gaza\">Nickolay Mladenov</a>.</p><p>Mladenov – who has worked as a United Nations diplomat in the Middle East – is seen as an administrator, but one who may not be capable of pushing back against Israel and representing Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“Decisions made without the meaningful participation of those most affected reproduce the same power structures that enabled this occupation and genocide,” Maha Hussaini, head of media and public engagement at Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, told Al Jazeera. “Excluding Palestinians in Gaza from shaping their future strips them of agency and turns reconstruction and governance into tools of control rather than recovery.”</p><p>For Hussaini, justice after a war in which Israel has killed at least 71,400 Palestinians and destroyed vast swathes of the territory cannot be ignored.</p><p>“Peace does not mean silence after bombardment, nor a pause between wars,” she said. “For Gaza, peace means safety, dignity, and freedom from collective punishment. It also means justice: recognising the harm suffered, restoring the rights of victims, and holding perpetrators accountable. Without justice, what is called ‘peace’ becomes only a temporary arrangement that leaves the genocide intact.”</p><p>Palestinian political analyst Ahmed Fayyad said that ultimately, Palestinians have little choice but to go along with Mladenov and the Board of Peace model, even if there is a sense that they are handing over the administration of Gaza to foreigners.</p><p>“Palestinians don’t have the luxury of choice to accept or refuse Mladenov,” Fayyad said. “No one – the Palestinian Authority and the Arab [countries] – wants to disrupt the agreement.”</p><p>But Fayyad described several potential stumbling blocks, including internal Palestinian divisions between the Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah, and its longtime rival Hamas.</p><p>The analyst also believes that the demilitarisation of Hamas – which the US and Israel insist upon, but which Hamas says is an internal Palestinian matter – will also likely cause problems.</p><p>“Israel might attach the demilitarisation to the reconstruction or the opening of [border] crossings, and investments in the education and health sectors,” Fayyad said.</p><p>“It is complicated, and it is all subject to Israeli security conditions,” he continued, adding that the formation of a new Palestinian security force that met Israel’s onerous requirements would take a long time because the process was not spelled out in Trump’s ceasefire plan.</p><p>“This will reflect negatively on the civilians who yearn for an improvement to their daily harsh reality and suffering in tents, amid outbreaks of disease and the collapse of all economic and social life,” Fayyad said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"israeli-spoiler\">Israeli spoiler</h2><p>The announcement of the second phase of the ceasefire – a move that should have been seen as a sign of positive improvement – seems disconnected to the reality on the ground for Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p>“There is more fear than hope,” said Hussaini, from the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor. “Not because people in Gaza lack resilience or imagination, but because experience has taught them that moments labelled as ‘turning points’ rarely translate into real protection or accountability. Hope exists, but it is fragile and constantly undermined by the absence of justice and by decisions imposed from outside.”</p><p>And the most influential outside force is Israel – the power that has bombarded Gaza not just in the last two years but in several previous wars, and controls access to Gaza, and the air and sea that surrounds it.</p><p>“I think Israel tries its best to distance Gaza from any political solutions, which would end with Palestine’s right to self-determination,” said the analyst Fayyad. “Israel wants Gaza to be a disarmed zone; its people’s biggest concerns are the daily struggles of life, without caring about any political solutions.”</p><p>“Israel doesn’t want any future political solutions for Gaza. These are the concerns of the Authority and the Palestinians. Israel doesn’t want independence in decision-making in Palestine,” he concluded.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"reality-of-life-in-gaza\">Reality of life in Gaza</h2><p>The daily struggle of life is all Sami Balousha, a 30-year-old computer programmer from Gaza City, can think about.</p><p>Balousha described peace not as a political agreement, conducted in far-off meeting rooms, but as physical safety and a routine.</p><p>“It is simply to sleep at night assured that I wake up the next morning, not dead, or I won’t get up in the middle of the night because of the sound of bombing,” Balousha said. “It is getting up the next morning and going to work, and being sure that I will be able to get home safely, not suspiciously turning around all the time, afraid of a strike.”</p><p>Balousha said that he had been displaced with his family 17 times – moving from place to place to escape Israeli attacks. The mental turmoil of the past two years means he no longer looks to the future, and instead focuses on the here and now.</p><p>“Tomorrow is far away, and I have no control over it,” Balousha said. “We can’t imagine the near future and plan it. We’ve been stuck in this loop for two years. The reality has always been strangely hard and unexpected.”</p><p>Like many others, Balousha feels disconnected from international decision-making.</p><p>“They don’t have a deep understanding of the Palestinians’ needs in Gaza. I don’t think that we are being listened to seriously,” he said.</p><p>It is why he ultimately does not have much faith in any solutions being cooked up for Gaza, and is instead fearful that his current horror will become a permanent reality.</p><p>“I am afraid that the coming generations accept the new reality of living in an open grave, to accept the tent as a home, to grow up not knowing the great days of Gaza,” Balousha said. “People only want an end to this all, no matter what the solution is, no matter who makes it, all that matters is the end of this misery at any cost. People are tired, so tired of this all, but want to live.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But in the Middle East, its military role has traditionally, for the most part, involved training forces of Arab allies.</p><p>That’s now changing, with a spree of deals and negotiations that could turn Pakistan into a key security provider in some cases, and give it the ability to tip the balance in delicate conflicts in other instances.</p><p>But analysts warn that divisions within the Arab world mean that Pakistan will need to tread carefully – or risk burning bridges with important partners.</p><h2 id=\"saudi-mutual-defence\">Saudi mutual defence</h2><p>Anchoring this shift in Pakistan’s military influence in the Arab world is the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) the country signed with <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/watershed-how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-reshapes-regions-geopolitics\">Saudi Arabia last September</a>, weeks after Israel bombed Qatar, setting off concerns across the region over whether the United States – historically the security provider for several Gulf states – could be trusted.</p><p>Since then, Reuters reports that Saudi Arabia is among the countries that have also expressed interest in Pakistan’s JF-17 Thunder fighter jet.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s wealthiest countries, operates a large and sophisticated air force equipped primarily with US and European aircraft and is in the process of ordering at least <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/what-is-the-f-35-fighter-jet-and-why-does-saudi-arabia-want-it\">48 US-manufactured F-35 jets</a>, considered among the most advanced fighter aircraft currently available.</p><p>But Adil Sultan, a former Pakistan Air Force air commodore, said Saudi Arabia may also be looking to diversify its defence suppliers amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.</p><p>Pakistan, as a traditional ally, and with the mutual defence treaty in place, is a “reliable partner” for Saudi Arabia. If Saudi Arabia buys JF-17s, it would “enhance interoperability of both the air forces and would be mutually beneficial”, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Amir Husain, a Texas-based defence technology analyst, agreed.</p><p>“With the SMDA between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, it makes a lot of sense for there to be a degree of commonality in systems,” he said.</p><p>“Saudi Arabia is helping countries in the region, such as Libya, Somalia and Sudan, attain stability. The JF-17, and the Royal Saudi Air Force’s [RSAF] familiarity with this platform, can achieve these regional stabilisation aims,” Husain added.</p><h2 id=\"the-jf-17-attraction\">The JF-17 attraction</h2><p>Apart from Saudi Arabia, Iraq too has shown interest in the JF-17, according to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) – the military’s media arm.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4223728\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4223728\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4223728\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Interactive_JF17_Thunder_Jan8_2026-1767866414.png?quality=80\" alt=\"Interactive_JF17_Thunder_Jan8_2026\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4223728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>The JF-17 Thunder is a lightweight, all-weather, multirole fighter jointly produced by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation.</p><p>Production is split between the two countries, with 58 percent carried out in Pakistan and 42 percent in China. Pakistan produces the airframe, while China supplies the avionics.</p><p>The latest version, the Block 3 variant, is classified as a 4.5-generation fighter. It features air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities, advanced avionics, an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, electronic warfare systems and the ability to fire beyond-visual-range missiles.</p><p>The AESA radar allows pilots to track multiple targets simultaneously and detect threats at longer distances, though the aircraft lacks the stealth characteristics of fifth-generation fighters.</p><p>According to Pakistan Air Force (PAF) sources, full assembly takes place in Pakistan, and the production line at the Kamra facility can manufacture between 20 and 25 aircraft annually.</p><p>Pakistan has marketed the JF-17 internationally for several years. Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Myanmar are currently among the aircraft’s operators. But analysts say interest in the jet has intensified since the brief but intense military confrontation between Pakistan and India last May.</p><p>During their <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2025/5/7/operation-sindoor-whats-the-significance-of-indias-pakistan-targets\">four-day air conflict</a>, both launched missiles and drones at each other’s territories, parts of Kashmir they administer, and military bases, after gunmen killed 26 civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>On the first night of fighting, on May 7, Pakistan claimed it had shot down several Indian aircraft using Chinese-made J-10 Vigorous Dragon jets.</p><p>The PAF deployed a 42-aircraft formation that included JF-17 Thunders and US-made F-16 Fighting Falcons against a 72-aircraft formation from the Indian Air Force. Indian officials initially denied any losses but later acknowledged that <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2025/5/31/india-top-general-admits-losses-in-recent-conflict-with-pakistan\">“some” planes</a> had been lost.</p><p>With a relatively low-price tag of $25m to $30m per aircraft, the JF-17 has long been seen as an attractive option for air forces seeking a cost-effective solution – it is much cheaper than comparable aircraft produced by Western manufacturers.</p><p>Analysts say that its recent combat exposure has added to its appeal, as battle-tested performance often carries greater weight than price alone.</p><p>Al Jazeera sent queries to ISPR and the PAF seeking confirmation and details about the negotiations with different countries, but received no response.</p><p>Beyond Saudi Arabia and Iraq, reports suggest that Sudan’s upcoming deal with Pakistan also involves the JF-17. Pakistan, reports in December suggested, was also planning to sell these jets to Libyan rebels. Outside the Arab world, Bangladesh and Indonesia have also shown interest in the jets.</p><h2 id=\"walking-a-tightrope\">Walking a tightrope</h2><p>But Pakistan’s expanding military clientele also means that the country will need to juggle competing interests, say analysts.</p><p>In Sudan, its weapons and jets will go to the armed forces, which are also supported by Saudi Arabia. Sudan, meanwhile, has accused the United Arab Emirates of financing and arming the paramilitary RSF – a charge the UAE has repeatedly rejected.</p><p>In Libya, Pakistan reportedly struck a $4bn deal in December with Khalifa Haftar, the rebel leader whose army controls a major chunk of the country’s north.</p><p>Sudan’s army – which Pakistan’s army is reportedly about to arm – has previously accused Haftar of helping the RSF. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been on opposing sides in Yemen in recent weeks, with Riyadh accusing Abu Dhabi of arming southern separatists. The UAE has denied those allegations.</p><p>Against that backdrop, it will not be easy for Pakistan to sell the same weapons systems to opposing sides, Umer Karim, an associate fellow at the Riyadh-based King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Karim said that he also believed that the Pakistani jets that Saudi Arabia has reportedly shown interest in are also meant for the Sudanese military.</p><p>But Pakistani platforms, and the JF-17 in particular, offer other benefits, even to Sudan’s army and Libyan rebels, said Sultan, the former PAF officer. That the JF-17 is manufactured jointly with China gives it extra geopolitical heft, he pointed out.</p><p>“These countries may buy fewer numbers [than bigger countries] as per their requirement, but Pakistan may be seen as a most reliable source to acquire aircraft due to strong support from China,” he said.</p><p>Unlike Western weapons systems, jets like the JF-17 are also appealing to Global South militaries because of their “robustness, lower lifecycle cost, ease of maintenance, and rapid operationalisation”, another retired PAF official, who requested anonymity, told Al Jazeera. This official was involved with the JF-17 programme while in service.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4223116\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4223116\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4223116\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25323288920911-1767838925.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A Pakistani Air Force JF-17 Thunder is on display at the Dubai Airshow.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4223116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Pakistani Air Force JF-17 Thunder is on display at the Dubai Air Show, United Arab Emirates, on November 19, 2025 [Altaf Qadri/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"pakistan-s-weapons-exports\">Pakistan’s weapons exports</h2><p>The JF-17 is driving a much wider weapons export push from Pakistan, say analysts.</p><p>A recent report by KTrade, a Karachi-based brokerage and research firm, said that Pakistan’s defence exports include not only fighter jets but also tanks, drones, armoured vehicles, naval systems and small arms.</p><p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says Pakistan remains one of the world’s largest arms importers, with most of its imports coming from China, while exporting less than $50m worth of arms annually.</p><p>However, data from Pakistan’s central bank shows that arms and ammunition exports jumped massively in the 2022 to 2023 fiscal year, rising from $13m to more than $400m.</p><p>While never officially acknowledged, the jump in figures is widely attributed to <a href=\"/news/2024/6/11/russia-test-will-pakistan-attend-the-ukraine-peace-summit\">Pakistan supplying ammunition</a> to Ukrainian forces fighting Russia since February 2022.</p><p>The reports of potential JF-17 sales come as Pakistan seeks to stabilise its economy and rebuild <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/how-pakistans-asim-munir-became-trumps-favourite-field-marshal\">diplomatic momentum</a>. Islamabad has recently improved ties with the United States while reinforcing partnerships with China, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye.</p><p>Pakistan is currently in its 25th International Monetary Fund programme, a $7bn loan spread over 37 months, underscoring its need for foreign inflows.</p><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif recently suggested that arms exports could ease that dependence. “Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” he said in a television interview.</p><p>KTrade estimated that existing and potential JF-17 deals, including a $1.5bn contract with Azerbaijan from 2024 and possible sales to Saudi Arabia, Libya and Sudan, could generate up to $13bn, boosting Pakistan’s foreign reserves by as much as 82 percent.</p><p>Karim, however, remains unconvinced, noting that previous efforts to market the jet did not lead to major contracts.</p><p>“It is a bit strange that all of a sudden, and without that sort of intense official and institutional engagement, so many defence deals involving the JF-17 are being discussed,” he said.</p><p>“For now, one can say they’re meant to project the narrative of the Pakistani defence industrial complex and its indigenous weapon systems coming of age and attracting customers everywhere.”</p><p>Sultan attributed the renewed interest to lessons drawn from last year’s conflict with India, “where Chinese-sourced weapon systems have proven their efficacy against the advanced Western aircraft”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4237720\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4237720\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4237720\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12T144049Z_1689813436_RC2PZIASM4NB_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-INDONESIA-DEFENCE-1768391701.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C499&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: A JF-17 Thunder fighter jet of the Pakistan Air Force takes off from Mushaf base in Sargodha, north Pakistan June 7, 2013.

In fact, we haven’t even had a formal readout from the White House of that meeting with Machado.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2></h2><p>Still, Machado struck an upbeat tone as she exited the White House and strolled onto Pennsylvania Avenue, where she was thronged by reporters and supporters seeking selfies.</p><p>She and Trump spent only a few hours together in the White House, as they discussed Venezuela’s future over lunch.</p><p>Machado confirmed to the media that she followed through with her plans to give Trump her Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the US president has long coveted for himself.</p><p>“I presented the president of the United States the medal, the Nobel Peace Prize,” Machado told reporters.</p><p>As she offered Trump the prize, Machado said she recounted a historical anecdote, about an interaction between Simon Bolivar – the Venezuelan military officer who helped liberate much of South America from colonial rule – and the Marquis de Lafayette, a Revolutionary War hero in the US.</p><p>“I told him this. Listen to this. Two hundred years ago, General Lafayette gave Simon Bolivar a medal with George Washington’s face,” Machado said. “Bolivar since then kept that medal for the rest of his life.”</p><p>The Nobel Committee, however, has clarified that the prize is non-transferable and cannot be shared.</p><p>Machado was announced as the recipient of the prize in October, in recognition of her efforts to advance Venezuelan democracy.</p><p>“I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause,” Machado <a href=\"https://x.com/MariaCorinaYA/status/1976642376119549990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on October 10. She secretly left Venezuela, where she had been living in hiding, in December to travel to Norway and collect the medal.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"willing-to-serve\">‘Willing to serve’</h2><p>Machado remains a popular figure within Venezuela’s opposition movement, which has faced oppression and violence under Maduro’s presidency.</p><p>Human rights organisations have accused Maduro of systematically suppressing dissent and arresting opposition leaders.</p><p>As of January 11, the human rights group Foro Penal estimated there were 804 political prisoners in Venezuela, though some estimates put their population in the thousands.</p><p>Machado was formerly a member of Venezuela’s National Assembly, but Maduro’s government had her removed for allegedly conspiring against the presidency.</p><p>She was considered a leading candidate for the 2024 presidential race, and during the October 2023 opposition primary, she earned more than 92 percent support.</p><p>But in January 2024, she was again disqualified from holding office, and former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez ultimately ran on behalf of the opposition coalition.</p><p>After polls closed in July 2024, the government did not publish the usual breakdown of the voting tallies, leading to widespread outcry over a lack of transparency. The opposition obtained voting tallies that appeared to show Gonzalez winning in a landslide, further fuelling the outrage.</p><p>But Maduro’s government backed his claim to a third six-year term as president.</p><p>After the US military abducted Maduro from Venezuela on January 3, it transported him to the US to face charges of narcotics trafficking.</p><p>Machado has since appeared on US television to advance the Venezuelan opposition’s claim that it has a “mandate” to take over the presidency after Maduro’s removal.</p><p>“We have a president-elect who is Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, and we are ready and willing to serve our people as we have been mandated,” she told CBS News on January 7.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"dismissing-machado\">Dismissing Machado?</h2><p>But Trump has thrown his support behind Rodriguez, whom he has described as cooperative.</p><p>“ She’s somebody that we’ve worked with very well,” Trump said at a news conference on Thursday. “I think we’re getting along very well with Venezuela.”</p><p>The US president has previously said that the US will “run” Venezuela. Last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters that the Venezuelan government’s “decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States of America”.</p><p>Still, Rodriguez has denounced the January 3 attack on Venezuela as a violation of international law, and in Thursday’s state of the union speech, she continued to express continued allegiance to “Chavismo”, the political movement Maduro followed.</p><p>She has also criticised US threats to her country’s sovereignty.</p><p>“We know the US is a lethal nuclear power. We have seen their record in history of humanity. We know and we are not afraid to face them diplomatically through political dialogue as appropriate and resolve once and for all this historical contradiction,” Rodriguez said on Thursday.</p><p>“Brothers and sisters, deputies, regardless of political affiliation, it doesn’t matter. We have to go together as Venezuelans to defend our sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and also defend our dignity and our honour.”</p><p>She nevertheless indicated she planned to revisit Venezuela’s hydrocarbon law to allow for greater foreign investment.</p><p>Renata Segura, the director of the Latin America and Caribbean programme at the nonprofit International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that Rodriguez and her government have consistently maintained that Maduro remains the rightful leader of Venezuela.</p><p>“We should not forget that Rodriguez and many other members of the government in Caracas have been very adamant about the fact that the intervention against Maduro was illegitimate. They’ve actually demanded that he be liberated,” Segura said.</p><p>“So they haven’t done a 180-degree shift in the tone of their declarations. But it’s not like they have a lot of manoeuvring room. So they are really trying to appease Trump at this moment.”</p><p>Still, Trump has long dismissed Machado’s prospects as a replacement for Maduro or Rodriguez, saying on January 3 that she “doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country”.</p><p>Segura believes the Trump administration’s choice to reject Machado as the leader of Venezuela is understandable, in the name of stability.</p><p>But, she added, Machado is the clear leader of the opposition, and her coalition therefore needs to be part of the country’s government moving forward.</p><p>“It would be very illegitimate if we just had a conversation between the regime of Chavismo, now without Maduro, and the Trump administration, without those people that really represent the Venezuelan people’s feelings,” Segura said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

States announced that the two sides had progressed to the second phase of a 20-point ceasefire deal with Hamas to end the conflict.</p><p>The Wafa news agency reported that the Israeli military bombed two houses belonging to the al-Hawli and the al-Jarou families in the central town of Deir el-Balah on Thursday evening, with health officials confirming a 16-year-old minor was among six killed.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The Israeli military announced that one of the victims, Muhammad al-Hawli, was a commander in the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas.</p><p>Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Ibrahim al-Khalili confirmed that a “senior figure of the Qassam Brigades” had been killed and that the attack underscored Israel’s message that it would be defining phase two of the ceasefire “on its terms”.</p><p>Israel, he said, had set the terms of the next phase of the ceasefire, which will see the establishment of a Palestinian technocratic administration overseen by an international “Board of Peace”, with the option of “escalation” remaining very much “on the table”.</p><p>Elsewhere in the war-torn enclave, at least one person was shot dead by Israeli forces near Al-Alam roundabout, west of Rafah city, another person was killed in an Israeli attack on a police post near Al-Nablusi Junction, southwest of Gaza City and two more people were killed in an Israeli air attack on the Al-Khatib family home in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.</p><h2 id=\"despicable-crime\">‘Despicable crime’</h2><p>Hamas condemned the targeting of the al-Hawli home as a “despicable crime”, saying that it revealed the “contempt” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the October ceasefire, but did not confirm the death of one of its commanders.</p><p>At least 451 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect, with Israel ordering residents out of more than half of Gaza, where its troops remain behind an apparently mobile “<a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/israel-extends-gaza-occupation-beyond-yellow-line-in-north-bombs-south\">yellow line</a>“.</p><p>Three Israeli soldiers have been killed over the same period.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff announced in a post on X on Wednesday that the second phase of Trump’s 20-point plan to end the conflict had been launched, “moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction”.</p><p>The next phase would bring “the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel”, he said, with reference to Hamas, which has so far refused to publicly commit to full disarmament.</p><p>The plan also calls for the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force to help secure Gaza and train vetted Palestinian police units.</p><p></p><p>The 15-member technocratic committee, named the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, will manage day-to-day governance, but leaves unresolved broader political and security issues, including the question of Israel’s post-war withdrawal from the enclave.</p><p>Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority, has been appointed to lead the committee, which is now meeting in Egypt to begin preparations for entering the territory, according to the AFP news agency report citing Egyptian state television.</p><p>In a recent interview, Shaath said the committee would rely on “brains rather than weapons” and would not coordinate with armed groups.</p><h2 id=\"a-step-in-the-right-direction\">‘A step in the right direction’</h2><p>Nevertheless, senior Hamas official Bassem Naim welcomed the establishment of the committee on Thursday, calling it “a step in the right direction” and signalling the armed group was ready to hand over administration of Gaza.</p><p>“This is crucial for consolidating the ceasefire, preventing a return to war, addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and preparing for comprehensive reconstruction,” he said.</p><p>“The ball is now in the court of the mediators, the American guarantor and the international community to empower the committee,” he added.</p><p>The US-proposed Board of Peace is expected to be led on the ground by Bulgarian diplomat and politician <a href=\"/features/2026/1/15/who-is-nickolay-mladenov-the-diplomat-tasked-with-disarming-gaza\">Nickolay Mladenov</a>.</p><p>The Reuters news agency reported that invitations were sent out on Wednesday to potential Board of Peace members personally selected by Trump.</p><h2 id=\"human-remains-in-the-rubble\">‘Human remains’ in the rubble</h2><p>The first phase of Trump’s plan began on October 10 and included a complete ceasefire, the exchange of Israeli captives for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p><p>However, with Israel having maintained a chokehold on supplies entering the enclave, nearly all of the territory’s more than 2 million people are now struggling to survive winter in makeshift homes or damaged buildings.</p><p>As Al Jazeera’s al-Khalili put it, “the situation is going from bad to worse for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians who heard about the announcement of the second phase of the ceasefire, [with] nothing implemented on the ground”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said that conditions were “inhumane” and called for an acceleration of reconstruction work. “We can’t wait, we can’t procrastinate,” he said on Thursday after a visit to the territory.</p><p>Da Silva said the launch of phase two of the Gaza truce plan marked a “historical” opportunity to kick-start reconstruction efforts, which he said would require $52bn, according to an assessment conducted by the World Bank, the UN and the European Commission.</p><p>In phase two, Shaath said that the committee would focus on providing urgent relief for Gaza, announcing that he would bring in bulldozers to “push the rubble into the sea, and make new islands, new land”.</p><p>According to Shaath, Israel’s full-scale onslaught on Gaza has left about 60 million tonnes of rubble scattered across the enclave, “with unexploded ordnance in the rubble, dangerous waste, and unfortunately also human remains”.</p><p>Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 71,441 Palestinians since it erupted on October 7, 2023.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Democrats largely rejected it, saying the accounts would not be enough to cover costs for most consumers. Currently, such accounts are used disproportionately by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked at her briefing on Thursday whether the president could guarantee that, under his plan, people would be able to cover their healthcare costs.</p><p>“If this plan is put in place, every single American who has healthcare in the United States will see lower costs as a result,” she said without elaborating.</p><p>“These are common-sense actions that make up President Trump’s great healthcare plan, and they represent the most comprehensive and bold agenda to lower healthcare costs to have ever been considered by the federal government,” Leavitt also said.</p><p>The White House said that the plan would not affect people with pre-existing conditions.</p><p>The plan also targets pharmacy benefit managers and requires insurance companies to disclose the profits they take from premiums and the frequency of denials.</p><p>Companies would publish their rate and coverage comparisons on their websites in “plain English” as well as the percentage of revenues paid out to claims compared with overhead costs and profits. They would also be required to publish the percentage of claims they reject and the average wait times for routine care.</p><p>“Instead of just papering over the problems, we have gotten into this great healthcare plan, a framework that we believe will help Congress create legislation that will address the challenges that the American people have been craving,” US Centres for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz told reporters on a White House briefing call.</p><p>The White House also did not provide a timeline for implementation, and a deeply divided Congress is unlikely to pass major healthcare legislation quickly.</p><p>Providers and insurers who accept Medicare or Medicaid money would also have to post their pricing and fees.</p><h2 id=\"obamacare-looms\">Obamacare looms</h2><p>The announcement comes as millions of Americans face higher healthcare costs this year, with open enrolment for most federally subsidised Obamacare plans closing on Thursday.</p><p>On average, <a href=\"/economy/2025/12/11/failure-of-rival-health-bills-underscores-impasse-in-us-politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">premium costs will increase</a> to $1,904 in 2026 from $888 in 2025, according to health policy firm KFF, a far greater jump than the savings promised in the Trump plan.</p><p>Congress remains divided on whether and how to reinstate generous COVID-era tax credits that expired at the end of last year.</p><p>Retroactive expanded federal subsidies are still possible, and there is a group of bipartisan lawmakers negotiating a potential extension, but Republicans remain divided on whether they should do so.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The Trump administration wants funding to go directly to consumers using health savings accounts, Oz said, rather than to insurers, a position also adopted by Congressional Republicans who oppose extending the Obamacare subsidies.</p><p>Trump has said he may veto any legislation to extend the subsidies, and the plan makes no mention of them.</p><p>“This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on. It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies,” the White House official said.</p><p>Trump has long been dogged by his lack of a comprehensive healthcare plan as he and Republicans have sought to unwind former President Barack Obama’s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act. Trump was thwarted during his first term in trying to repeal and replace the law.</p><p>When he ran for president in 2024, Trump said he had only “concepts of a plan” to address healthcare. His new proposal, short on many specifics, appeared to be the concept of a plan.</p><p>On Wall Street, healthcare insurance provider stocks surged on the news of the looming plan. UnitedHealthcare is up 0.8 percent in midday trading. Humana is up higher at 3.5 percent than the market open, and Oscar Health is up 6.4 percent.</p><p>Pharmaceutical stocks, on the other hand, are trending lower. Eli Lilly is down by about 3.7 percent, AbbVie tumbling 1.9 percent below the market open, and Bristol Myers -Squibb is down by 0.9 percent. Johnson and Johnson, on the other hand, does remain in positive territory at about 0.3 percent higher than the market open.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>In June 2025, the UK government proscribed the UK-based group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000. This was not a security decision, but a political one, marking an unprecedented escalation in the criminalisation of Palestine solidarity in the United Kingdom. Palestine Action members have engaged in non-violent direct action aimed at disrupting the UK’s complicity in the Gaza genocide, targeting facilities linked to Israel’s arms industry operating in the UK, including Elbit Systems sites and elements of British military infrastructure.</p><p>Rather than confronting its own actions, the government has sought to divert attention from the central issue: the UK’s role in the Gaza genocide. Throughout Israel’s assault on Gaza, the UK has provided sustained political and diplomatic support, supplied vital components for F-35 fighter jets, and conducted R1 surveillance flights over Gaza. Taken together, these actions render the British government not merely complicit, but materially involved in the violence itself.</p><p>At the same time, the UK has sought to obstruct international accountability. It has attempted to interfere with proceedings at the International Criminal Court — conduct that may constitute an offence under Article 70(1) of the ICC Statute — by intimidating the ICC Prosecutor and creating procedural obstacles designed to delay or prevent the issuance of arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. Rather than reassessing policies that expose it to legal and moral liability, the government has turned on those who insist on holding it to its own professed values — values it readily invokes when geopolitically convenient, such as in Ukraine and Greenland.</p><h2 id=\"anti-terror-laws-to-justify-political-imprisonment\">Anti-terror laws to justify political imprisonment</h2><p>The persecution of individuals on political grounds through the law is by no means new. As early as 399 BCE, Socrates was tried and executed in Athens on charges of “impiety”, “not recognising the gods the state recognises”, and “corrupting the youth”, with the law itself serving as the instrument of repression.</p><p>Today, Russia’s crackdown on dissent, carried out through formally lawful means, stands as one of the most widely criticised contemporary examples of political imprisonment, routinely condemned by Western governments, including the UK.</p><p>Attempts to define and legally operationalise the concept of political imprisonment have long faced resistance. While there is no consensus on what constitutes a “political prisoner” or “prisoner of conscience”, the criteria established by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), of which the UK is a member, offer clear and authoritative guidance:</p><p><em>“a. if the detention has been imposed in violation of one of the fundamental guarantees set out in the European Convention on Human Rights and its Protocols (ECHR), in particular freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and association; </em></p><p><em>b. if the detention has been imposed for purely political reasons without connection to any offence; </em></p><p><em>c. if, for political motives, the length of the detention or its conditions are clearly out of proportion to the offence the person has been found guilty of or is suspected of;</em></p><p><em>d. if, for political motives, he or she is detained in a discriminatory manner as compared to other persons; or, </em></p><p><em>e. if the detention is the result of proceedings which were clearly unfair and this appears to be connected with political motives of the authorities.”  (SG/Inf(2001)34, paragraph 10).</em><br>\nThese criteria are directly relevant to the UK’s treatment of Palestine Action. The British government is complicit in Israel’s systematic unmaking of Palestine, including its illegal occupation, its system of apartheid, and its role in the Gaza genocide, and Palestine Action has directly challenged this complicity. Where public order and civil disobedience laws once failed to suppress this activism, the state escalated to the use of exceptional anti-terror legislation.</p><p>The government has since resorted to the Terrorism Act to preemptively criminalise activists and expose them to sentences of up to 14 years’ imprisonment, a level of punishment grossly disproportionate to non-violent direct action. This disproportionality and choice of legislation signal a political motive.</p><p>The application of the Terrorism Act 2000 to non-violent direct action strips activists of ordinary legal protections and subjects them to an exceptional penal regime, including extended pre-charge detention, heightened surveillance powers, restrictions on association and expression, and dramatically increased sentencing exposure. Such measures are ordinarily reserved for acts involving mass violence, not protest aimed at preventing harm.</p><p>Under the PACE criteria, detention may be considered political where punishment is clearly disproportionate or where legal proceedings are unfair and politically motivated. Here, non-violent activism is met with the prospect of lengthy imprisonment alongside reputational destruction through terrorist designation. This combination satisfies multiple indicators of political imprisonment, particularly criteria (c) and (e).</p><p>The use of anti-terror law in this context does not merely criminalise conduct; it redefines dissent itself as a security threat, preempting fair adjudication and conditioning the public to accept extraordinary punishment for ordinary political opposition.</p><h2 id=\"the-broader-picture\">The broader picture</h2><p>In penology, a penal system may serve several recognised purposes, including just deserts and retribution, incapacitation, and deterrence. What is unfolding in the UK fits none of these aims. Instead, the penal system is being deployed to expand executive power and suppress political opposition, deviating from the purposes a penal system in a liberal democracy should serve.</p><p>The UK is complicit in grave violations of international law and has not only failed to meet its international legal obligations, but has actively breached them. Some British citizens, concerned with justice, international law, and human rights, have peacefully stepped in to challenge their government’s wrongdoing. The state’s response has been to criminalise dissent while presenting repression as democratic self-defence.</p><p>Let us be clear: proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation is not an isolated act. It is part of the UK’s broader complicity in Israel’s oppression and genocide, and it functions domestically to silence those who seek to disrupt that complicity.</p><p>This is not the first attempt to rule by law in the UK to support Israel’s policies in Palestine. The introduction of the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism was another such attempt to control and intimidate opposition through legal means. With the weaponisation of anti-terror laws, the UK government has taken a further step towards shrinking the space for dissent.</p><p>The exceptional selectivity of legal tools and the disproportionality of the chosen penal regime cannot be justified when measured against the conduct in question: non-violent activism aimed at compelling the government to halt violence and uphold the international legal obligations it claims to champion. Those participating in violence are branding the non-violent as terrorists.</p><p>Finally, it is striking that after all these decades, the UK continues to ignore its unique historical responsibility towards the Palestinians. The UK imposed its mandate over Palestine by force, governing the territory while systematically privileging colonial and settler interests, before abandoning its obligations and withdrawing unilaterally. This withdrawal was crucial to creating the conditions in which the Nakba unfolded, in breach of the responsibilities the UK had assumed under the Mandate.</p><p>Among those obligations was the commitment articulated in the White Paper of 1939 to establish a Palestinian state for all its citizens within 10 years, a promise that was never honoured. The UK planted the seeds of Palestinian suffering and then exited Palestine without securing political self-determination for its indigenous people, leaving a legacy of dispossession that continues to shape the present.</p><p>More than a century after the Mandate, it remains Palestinians — supported by allies across the world — who are risking everything to defend the values of humanity and the principles of international law. The British state, by contrast, has chosen evasion over responsibility, and repression over reckoning.</p><h2 id=\"any-hopes\" data-start=\"586\" data-end=\"600\">Any hopes?</h2><p>Hope lies in refusing the normalisation of this moment. By challenging the proscription of Palestine Action, activists are not only resisting the UK’s complicity in Israel’s crimes, but defending the space for dissent itself. The struggle is not simply to reverse one decision, but to prevent the erosion of democratic limits through the misuse of law. In the UK right now, defending democracy and acting against complicity in Israeli atrocities go hand in hand.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
