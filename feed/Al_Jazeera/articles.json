He said the United States, European partners and other allies could instead provide legally binding security guarantees.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p data-start=\"1161\" data-end=\"1402\">“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/ukraines-nato-membership-key-question-in-us-talks-says-russia\">NATO</a>; these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” Zelenskyy said in response to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat.</p><p data-start=\"1404\" data-end=\"1805\">“Thus, today, bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US, and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries – Canada, Japan – are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"1404\" data-end=\"1805\">“And it is already a compromise from our part,” Zelenskyy added, stressing that such guarantees must be legally binding.</p><p data-start=\"1807\" data-end=\"2082\">The shift would mark a significant change for Ukraine, which has long sought NATO membership despite Moscow viewing the alliance’s expansion as a threat.</p><p data-start=\"1807\" data-end=\"2082\">While the move aligns with one of Russia’s stated war objectives, Kyiv has continued to reject demands to cede territory.</p><p data-start=\"2084\" data-end=\"2418\">Zelenskyy said he was seeking a “dignified” peace and firm assurances that Russia would not launch another attack, as diplomats gathered to discuss what could become Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II.

Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner on Sunday arrived in the German capital city of Berlin for discussions involving Ukrainian and European representatives.</p><p data-start=\"2420\" data-end=\"2876\">The decision to send Witkoff, who has previously led negotiations with both Kyiv and Moscow, suggested Washington saw scope for progress.</p><p data-start=\"2878\" data-end=\"3269\">Zelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US were reviewing a 20-point plan that could culminate in a ceasefire, though he reiterated that Kyiv was not holding direct talks with Russia. He said a truce along current front lines could be considered fair, while noting that Russia continues to demand a Ukrainian withdrawal from parts of Donetsk and Luhansk still under Kyiv’s control.</p><p data-start=\"3271\" data-end=\"3513\">Despite diplomatic efforts, Russian attacks have continued, leaving thousands without <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/russian-attacks-cut-power-for-thousands-in-ukraine-as-peace-talks-press-on\">electricity</a> in recent strikes. Ukrainian officials say Moscow is deliberately targeting the power grid to deprive civilians of heat and water during winter.</p><p data-start=\"3515\" data-end=\"3844\">Fighting has also intensified in the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/13/russia-damages-turkish-owned-vessels-in-attack-on-ukrainian-ports\">Black Sea</a>. Russian forces recently struck Ukrainian ports, damaging Turkish-owned vessels, including a ship carrying food supplies.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Winter came to Gaza last month with a violent storm. I woke up at night to a disaster. Our tent was flooded with water which had transformed our “floor” into a shallow pool. The mattresses and pillows were completely soaked, cooking pots were submerged, the clothes were drenched, and even our bags— which function as our “closets”—were filled with water. Nothing inside remained dry.</p><p>As I tried to understand what was happening, I suddenly heard children crying at the entrance of our tent. I opened it quickly and found three children from the neighbouring tents, their lips blue from the cold, with their mother trembling behind them saying, “We are completely soaked… the rain leaked inside and the water reached everywhere.”</p><p>The same tragic scene was repeated all around us: women, children, and elderly people sitting in the street under the rain, their bedding drenched and their belongings scattered, while confusion and cries filled the air.</p><p>All 1.4 million displaced Palestinians who lack proper shelter suffered that day—people with no protection against the weather or its sudden storms.</p><p>For us, it took two full days for our belongings to dry because the sun barely appeared; everything stayed cold and damp. We didn’t move to another place—we stayed where we were, trying to salvage whatever we could, because there was simply nowhere else to go.</p><p>Only a week later, an even stronger winter storm arrived with severe rainfall. Tents were flooded again; little children froze in the rain again.</p><p>This week, when Storm Byron hit, we were flooded once again. Despite all our efforts to reinforce the tents, secure them tightly, and bring in stronger tarps, nothing worked. The winds were fiercer, the rain heavier, and the water pushed its way inside from every direction. The ground no longer absorbed anything. The water began rising rapidly beneath our feet, turning the entire area into a swamp.</p><p>According to the authorities, the strong winds destroyed at least 27,000 tents. These are 27,000 families who already struggled and now have nothing, no shelter, nowhere to hide from the rain and cold.</p><p>The rain also brought down damaged homes where people had been sheltering. Every time there is a storm or strong wind, we hear the sound of falling debris and concrete pillars from badly damaged buildings near us. This time, the situation was so bad that 11 people were killed by collapsed buildings.</p><p>It is clear that after everything we have endured, we – like other displaced Palestinians – cannot survive a third winter in these harsh conditions. We survived two winters in displacement, living in tents that protected neither from cold nor rain, waiting with exhausted patience for a ceasefire that would end our suffering. The ceasefire finally came, but relief did not. We remain in the same place, with bodies drained by malnutrition and illness, under tents worn out by the sun and wind.</p><p>We are a family of seven living in a tent that is four by four metres (13 feet by 13 feet). Among us are two children aged five and 10 and our grandmother, aged 80. We, the adults, can push through the cold and hardship. But how can the elderly and children bear what we live every day?</p><p>We sleep on mattresses pressed directly against the ground, with cold seeping in from below and above, with only two blankets that can’t shield us from the freezing nights. Everyone in the tent has two blankets each, barely enough to offer temporary warmth. There is no source of heating—no electricity, no heater—just tired bodies trying to share whatever warmth remains.</p><p>My grandmother cannot tolerate the cold at all. I watch her shiver through the night, her hand on her chest as if trying to hold herself together. All we can do is pile every blanket we have on top of her and watch anxiously until she is able to fall asleep.</p><p>Many people in Gaza live in conditions far worse than ours.</p><p>Most families who just want a modest tent over their heads cannot afford one. The price of tents can go as high as $1,000; the rent one has to pay to pitch a tent on a piece of land can be as much as $500. Those who cannot pay live in the street in makeshift shelters.</p><p>Salah al-Din Street, for example, is crowded with them. Most are simply blankets hung and wrapped around small spaces for minimal privacy, offering no protection from rain or cold. With any strong gust of wind, they burst open.</p><p>There are also children living directly in the streets, sleeping on the cold ground. Many have lost their mothers or fathers during the war. When you pass by, you see them—sometimes silent, sometimes crying, sometimes searching for something to eat.</p><p>Despite repeated promises of aid and reconstruction, the trickle of supplies that entered Gaza has made almost no difference on the ground. Earlier this month, the United Nations announced it had managed to distribute only 300 tents during November; 230,000 families received a single food parcel each.</p><p>We did not receive any food parcel—there are simply too many people in need, and the quantities are far too small for everyone to access. Even if we had received one, its contents wouldn’t have lasted us longer than a week or two.</p><p>Food prices continue to be high. Nutritious items like meat and eggs are either unavailable or cost too much. Most families have not eaten a proper protein meal in months.</p><p>There is no mass campaign to remove rubble or level the ground so people can pitch their tents due to an equipment shortage. No steps have been taken to provide permanent housing for families.</p><p>All of this means we now face a terrifying possibility: that life in a tent—one that can be flooded or ripped apart by the wind at any moment—may become our long-term reality. This is an unbearable thought.</p><p>During the bombardment, we lived with the constant fear of death, and perhaps the intensity of the war overshadowed everything else—the cold, the rain, the tents shaking above our heads. But now, after the mass bombing has stopped, we are facing the full ugliness of Gaza’s “new normal”.</p><p>I fear this winter will be much worse for Gaza. With no heating, no real shelter, and the weather getting worse each day, we are likely to see many deaths among the children, the elderly and the chronically ill. Already, the first deaths from hypothermia were reported – babies <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/baby-dies-of-exposure-in-flooded-tent-as-storm-byron-batters-gaza\">Rahaf Abu Jazar</a>  and Taim al-Khawaja and nine-year-old Hadeel al-Masri. If the world is really committed to ending the genocide in Gaza, it needs to take real, urgent action and ensure that we have at least the basic conditions for survival: food, housing and medical care.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The pace of the latest escalation is startling. Only weeks earlier, leaders from both countries stood before regional and international dignitaries at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, endorsing a ceasefire framework that was presented as a political breakthrough. The symbolism was heavy, a truce blessed by regional leaders and witnessed by United States President Donald Trump meant to signal that Southeast Asia could manage its own tensions responsibly.</p><p>Yet that promise evaporated almost as soon as the delegations returned home. <a href=\"/news/2025/12/14/thailand-launches-new-offensive-as-cambodia-halts-all-border-crossings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bangkok’s air strikes</a> on Cambodian positions in contested border pockets triggered immediate evacuations.</p><p>What this sequence reveals is painfully familiar. Ceasefires in this dispute have rarely been more than pauses in a long cycle of distrust. Agreements are signed in conference halls, but the frontier itself has its own rhythm – one shaped by longstanding grievances, competing national narratives and the difficulties of managing heavily armed forces operating in ambiguous terrain.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2025/10/27/whats-in-the-thai-cambodia-peace-agreement-and-can-it-hold?\">ceasefire</a> endorsed at the ASEAN summit was constructed as the foundation for a broader roadmap. It committed both sides to cease hostilities, halt troop movements and gradually scale down the deployment of heavy weapons near contested areas. Crucially, it tasked ASEAN with deploying monitoring teams to observe compliance.</p><p>On paper, these were sensible steps. In reality, they were grafted onto political soil that was nowhere near ready to sustain them. Both governments were operating under heightened global scrutiny and were eager to signal calm to foreign investors, but the core issues – unsettled borders, unresolved historical claims and mutual suspicions embedded in their security establishments – remained untouched.</p><p>The agreement thus functioned less as a resolution and more as a temporary show of goodwill to stave off international pressure. Its weaknesses were exposed almost immediately. The pact depended heavily on the momentum generated by the summit itself rather than on durable institutional mechanisms. High-profile witnesses can create ceremonial gravitas, but they cannot substitute for the painstaking work required to rebuild strategic trust.</p><p>Thailand and Cambodia entered the agreement with different interpretations of what compliance meant, particularly with regard to troop postures and patrol rights in disputed pockets.</p><p>More importantly, the proposed monitoring regime demanded close, real-time cooperation between two militaries that have long viewed one another through an adversarial lens. Monitoring missions can succeed only when field commanders respect their access, accept their findings and operate under harmonised rules of engagement. None of those conditions yet exists.</p><p>And hanging over all of this are domestic political considerations. In both Bangkok and Phnom Penh, leaders are acutely sensitive to accusations of weakness over territorial integrity. In an environment where nationalist sentiment can be easily inflamed, governments often act defensively – even preemptively – to avoid political backlash at home.</p><p><strong>Historical grievances</strong></p><p>To understand why <a href=\"/video/the-take-2/2025/7/29/aje-onl-tha_cambodiaclashes_av_v2-290725\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this conflict</a> repeatedly returns to the brink, one must situate it in its longer arc. The Thailand-Cambodia frontier reflects the legacies of colonial-era boundary-making. The French, who ruled over Cambodia until 1954, were heavily involved in delineation of the border, a process that left behind ambiguous lines and overlapping claims.</p><p>These ambiguities mattered little when both states were preoccupied with internal consolidation and Cold War upheavals. But as their institutions matured, as national narratives took firmer hold and as economic development transformed the strategic value of particular zones, the border dispute hardened.</p><p>Several of the contested areas carry deep cultural and symbolic significance, including the Preah Vihear temple, built by the Khmer Empire, which both Thailand and Cambodia claim to be successors of. In 1962, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the temple is within Cambodian territory.</p><p>When disputes erupted from 2008 to 2011, marked by exchanges of artillery fire, mass displacements and duelling legal interpretations of the ICJ ruling, the political stakes crystallised. The clashes did not just damage property and displace civilians; they embedded the border issue into the nationalist consciousness of both countries. Even periods of relative quiet in the years that followed rested on an uneasy equilibrium.</p><p>This year’s resurgence of violence follows that established pattern. Domestic politics in both capitals have entered a phase in which leaders feel compelled to demonstrate resolve. Military modernisation programmes, meanwhile, have provided both sides with more tools of coercion, even if neither desires a full-scale confrontation.</p><p>The proximity of troops in disputed pockets leaves little room for error: Routine patrols can be misread as provocations, and ambiguous movements can quickly escalate into armed responses. In such an environment, ceasefires, however well intentioned, have little chance of survival unless supported by mechanisms that address the deeper structural problems.</p><p>The fact that the ASEAN-brokered truce did not grapple directly with the border’s most contentious segments left it vulnerable. Neither Thailand nor Cambodia is prepared to accept a binding demarcation that could be interpreted domestically as giving ground. Until there is clarity – legal, cartographic and political – the zone will remain one where each side feels compelled to assert its presence.</p><p>External factors have further complicated calculations. Both countries operate in a geopolitical environment marked by larger power competition. While neither Thailand nor Cambodia seeks to internationalise the dispute, there are competing incentives to showcase autonomy, avoid external pressure or signal strategic alignment. These dynamics may not directly cause clashes, but they create a political environment in which leaders feel additional pressure to project strength.</p><h2 id=\"what-asean-must-do\">What ASEAN must do</h2><p>The implications of this escalation extend beyond the bilateral relationship. If air strikes, even calibrated ones, become normalised as tools of signalling, Southeast Asia risks sliding into a period in which hardened positions become the default posture in territorial disputes. Civilian displacements could widen. Confidence-building measures – already fragile – could evaporate outright. And the political space for diplomacy, which relies on leaders having room to manoeuvre away from maximalist rhetoric, could shrink dramatically.</p><p>ASEAN now faces a test of relevance. Symbolic diplomacy, declarations of concern and offers of “good offices” will not be enough. If the organisation wishes to demonstrate that it can manage conflicts within its ranks, it must undertake three essential steps.</p><p>First, it must insist that its monitoring missions are fully deployed and granted operational autonomy. Observers need unrestricted access to flashpoints, and their assessments must be publicly reported to reduce the temptation for either side to distort facts. Transparent monitoring will not eliminate the dispute, but it can reduce opportunities for opportunistic escalation.</p><p>Second, ASEAN should establish a standing trilateral crisis group composed of Thailand, Cambodia and the ASEAN chair. This group should be mandated to intervene diplomatically within hours of any reported incident. Timely engagement could prevent misunderstandings from hardening into military responses.</p><p>Third, ASEAN must begin laying the groundwork for a longer-term negotiation on border demarcation. This would be politically sensitive and may not yield quick breakthroughs, but a structured process supported by neutral cartographers, legal experts and historical researchers could create space for gradual movement. A slow dialogue is better than no dialogue.</p><p>The United Nations could complement, though not supplant, ASEAN’s leadership. The UN’s technical expertise in boundary disputes, its experience in managing verification processes and its capacity to support humanitarian preparation could reinforce regional efforts. Crucially, UN involvement could depoliticise highly technical issues that often become entangled with nationalist rhetoric.</p><p>Yet none of these institutional tools will matter unless political leaders in Bangkok and Phnom Penh are prepared to confront the past honestly and consider compromises that may be unpopular. Sustainable peace requires more than a respite from violence; it demands constituencies willing to accept that historical grievances must be resolved through negotiation rather than through force or symbolic posturing.</p><p>The collapse of the recent ceasefire should not be viewed merely as another unfortunate episode but as a sign that Southeast Asia’s security architecture remains incomplete. The region has made impressive progress in building economic integration and diplomatic habits, but when it comes to managing high-stakes territorial disputes, structural weaknesses persist. Without meaningful investment in transparency, shared rules and credible enforcement mechanisms, even the most celebrated agreements will remain vulnerable to political winds.</p><p>Thailand and Cambodia now stand at a crossroads. They can either continue down a path where periodic escalations are normalised, or they can choose to engage in a process, even a long and imperfect one, that leads towards a final settlement. The costs of the former would be borne by civilians, border communities and regional stability. The benefits of the latter would extend far beyond their shared frontier.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He has promised to launch mass deportations and initiate a sweeping <a href=\"/news/longform/2025/12/12/a-fearful-country-crime-concerns-grip-chile-ahead-of-presidential-run-off\">law-and-order</a> agenda as part of his rhetoric to “Make Chile Great Again”.</p><p data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"257\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Jara, the candidate for the governing left-wing coalition, was narrowly ahead of Kast in the first round last month.

Right-wing candidates had collectively secured about 70 percent of the votes in the November 16 polls.</p><p data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"257\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Analysts fear Kast’s victory could change the country’s political course for the first time since a return to democracy 35 years ago. Chileans have long prided themselves on keeping far-right politics at bay after the end of the military government of Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s and 80s. In his youth, Kast was a keen supporter of Pinochet.</p><h2 id=\"rollback-of-women-s-rights\" data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"257\">Rollback of women’s rights</h2><p data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"257\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Yet frustration runs deep among voters, many of whom feel unrepresented by either finalist.</p><p data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"257\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Many voters say they cannot bring themselves to vote for Jara, who is a member of Chile’s orthodox Communist Party.</p><p data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"257\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Jara, who served as labour minister under incumbent President Gabriel Boric, helped pass flagship welfare reforms but has struggled to shift the debate.

Still, analysts say her communist background limits her appeal.</p><p data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"257\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Leonidas Monte of the Centre for Political Studies said Chileans judge candidates largely on rejection rates, adding that “somebody from the Communist Party will be with a 50 percent or above rejection”.</p><p data-start=\"64\" data-end=\"257\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Jara says she will resign from the Communist Party if she wins, but that has not convinced some voters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p data-start=\"2026\" data-end=\"2449\">Questions also surround whether Kast could deliver on his most ambitious pledges.</p><p data-start=\"2026\" data-end=\"2449\">He has promised to cut $6bn in public spending within 18 months without touching social benefits, deport more than 300,000 undocumented migrants and expand the army’s role in fighting organised crime – proposals that revive painful memories of Pinochet’s military rule.</p><p data-start=\"2451\" data-end=\"2698\">Kast’s party lacks a congressional majority, forcing him to negotiate with more moderate right-wing allies. Any compromise could dilute his agenda, but failing to act swiftly may alienate supporters drawn to his uncompromising rhetoric.</p><p data-start=\"2892\" data-end=\"3199\">Chilean Congresswoman Lorena Fries warned that Kast’s social conservatism could roll back women’s rights. He is running on “the traditional logic of traditional family dynamics. Obviously, women will be at a disadvantage compared to men in the public and especially the political arena,” she told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"3201\" data-end=\"3586\">Crime and migration have eclipsed all other issues.

Meanwhile, others consider it to be supernatural or holy, or something to twist, tame or traverse.</p><p>As someone who has been sentenced to a <a href=\"/features/2023/11/21/as-a-muslim-prisoner-in-the-us-i-worry-i-will-be-cremated-when-i-die\">lifetime behind bars</a>, time is both abstract and defined. When you have so much time, it is all you have, yet, inside, you have almost no control over how to spend it.</p><p>Every day, I can hear it: tick, tick, tick. It’s torturous, like that dripping faucet in my cell.</p><p>So to quiet the sound, I study. I learn. I try to build something meaningful from the minutes.</p><p>At the time of my arrest in 2002, I was a 25-year-old entrepreneur who had started a successful business. I was enrolled in college, working towards my degree in Information Technology, when my world collapsed. Once in New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) in Trenton, I had a simple choice: either give up on all of my dreams, or fight for them alongside my efforts to prove my innocence. So, I decided to use my time to complete my education.</p><p>My father had brought our family to the United States from Pakistan so his two sons could have access to higher education. He passed away this past January, and it is because of him I keep studying, to fulfil the dream he carried across an ocean.</p><p>Yet on the inside, that dream has been hard to chase.</p><h2 id=\"you-guys-aren-t-going-anywhere\">‘You guys aren’t going anywhere’</h2><p>Prison life is an insidious thing. The environment is conducive to vice and illicit activities. Drugs and gambling are easy to find; doing something constructive, like education, well, that can be a monumental task.</p><p>The NJSP’s education department only offers GED-level (high-school level) education. Prisoners can also enrol in outside correspondence courses, also known as independent study. These include certifications, like in paralegal studies, costing about $750 to $1,000.</p><p>For-profit “correspondence schools” advertise mail-order college degrees, but most, costing anywhere from $500 to $1,000, are unaccredited – selling paper, not knowledge. Some men collect a bachelor’s, master’s, and even a doctorate in a single year. I could not bring myself to do that. For me, an accredited degree is something that cannot be dismissed, and would make me feel on par with those in the free world.</p><p>But the options for college degrees from reputable accredited universities can run into the thousands – a non-starter for most of those imprisoned. So I began with a <a href=\"/features/2025/12/1/how-im-fighting-the-us-prison-system-from-the-inside\">prison paralegal training course</a> taught by fellow prisoners helping others with their legal battles.</p><p>Later on, I watched a PBS documentary about the Bard Prison Initiative in New York, a real college programme, accredited and rigorous, for men and women in the state’s prisons. Inspired, I decided to write dozens of letters to reputable universities across the country, asking them to take me as a test case to do a degree. None replied.</p><p>Then I learned about NJ-STEP, a programme offering college courses to prisoners at East Jersey State Prison. But when I asked to enrol, the NJSP’s education supervisor replied that it was not offered at our prison. When I appealed to the administration, a security major told me, “Why should I bring the NJ-STEP here? You guys aren’t going anywhere.”</p><p>His words echoed, as if a sentence within a sentence.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4114706\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4114706\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4114706\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Scanned_20251109_062437-2-1-1763466969.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C619&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"[Illustration by Martin Robles]\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4114706\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Illustration by Martin Robles]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"the-myth-of-higher-education\">The myth of higher education</h2><p>Thomas Koskovich, 47, has spent nearly three decades in NJSP, where he is serving a life sentence.</p><p>When I asked him about the opportunities for higher education in the prison, he scoffed.</p><p>“What college programme?” he blurted.</p><p>“The only thing they let us do is something called independent study, and by the way, you pay for everything yourself. The prison doesn’t help you. They just proctor [meaning they provide someone to administer] the tests.”</p><p>Thomas works as a teacher’s aide, a prison job detail, in the Donald Bourne School, named after a policeman who was killed by a prison inmate in 1972. The teachers come from the outside, while aides like Thomas assist them and also tutor students requiring extra support. He helps men earn their GEDs while knowing there is no path offered beyond that to further higher education.</p><p>“I’ve seen guys stuck in GED classes for 15 years,” he said.</p><p>Prisoners get stuck for different reasons: classes get cancelled because of emergencies, or sometimes the men have little education to begin with and require years to learn to read and write. Students also get paid $70 a month to attend, so some consider it a job – particularly as prison jobs are scarce – and deliberately fail so they can stay at the school for longer.</p><p>Of the two dozen or so students, “the school averages maybe five to 10 graduates a year”, Thomas explained.</p><p>He earns about $1,500 a year, far less than the $20,000 he would need to afford an accredited correspondence degree. But he chooses to help others in the same school where he got his GED because, as he put it, “Most people in here aren’t career criminals. They just got caught in bad situations.”</p><p>He added, “If given half a chance, they’d choose a legal, meaningful life.”</p><p>Thomas sees education as key to self-betterment. It was a book, Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire, a Brazilian Marxist educator, given to him by an activist friend that showed him the power of education, he says.</p><p>Education equips us to “better handle stressful situations” and nurture creativity and “artistic expression”, he reflected. “But most importantly, we can develop skills that will allow us to earn a living legally and contribute to society in a positive way.”</p><p>The Department of Corrections may store bodies, but it does not nurture minds, though many will eventually be freed back into society after serving their terms, while others could win their freedom in court or through clemency.</p><p>And education can only help with transitioning into life on the outside. According to the Prison Policy Initiative, a research and advocacy nonprofit, limited access to education in prisons remains a major barrier to <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/education.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rehabilitation and reentry</a> into society. Decades of studies support the idea that education in prison reduces recidivism – a <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR266.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RAND meta-analysis</a> found a 43 percent lower likelihood of reoffending among inmates who pursued studies.</p><p>Kashif Hassan, 40, from Brooklyn in New York City, has been imprisoned for 15 years. Serving a life-plus-10-year sentence, he has earned multiple degrees, including two PhDs, one in business administration and one in criminal justice, through university distance education.</p><p>Unlike other prisoners, Kashif was fortunate in that his family could afford the tens of thousands in accredited college tuition fees.</p><p>“I have two sons,” he told me, “and I want to show them that no matter the circumstances, even here, you can keep learning.”</p><p>He laughed when I asked about support from the NJSP’s education department. “None,” he said. “They even cancelled the college correspondence roster [a list that allowed students enrolled in long-distance education to access the prison law library and school computers to type and print]. They say it’s for security, but really, it’s about control.”</p><p>Kashif has also been on the waiting list for a paralegal course for 10 years.</p><p>“Education is a powerful tool,” he said. “It helps you understand your rights, navigate the system, and articulate yourself better. Especially in here, it’s the difference between feeling powerless and feeling empowered.”</p><h2 id=\"a-door-where-there-was-a-wall\">A door where there was a wall</h2><p>In 2023, I learned of a glimmer of progress. The Thomas Edison State University (TESU) in Trenton – ranked among the state’s top 20 public institutions – launched a new programme enabling men in NJSP to pursue accredited college degrees.</p><p>In 2024, I began taking TESU courses for a liberal arts degree. My tuition is paid for by grants and scholarships. The programme runs independently from the NJSP’s education department, which only proctors exams. For those of us long shut out of higher learning, it felt revolutionary. As if a door opened where there had only been a wall. It has made me feel free and given me purpose.</p><p>For Michael Doce, 44, another student in the programme who is serving a 30-year sentence, the door is narrow but precious. “I want to stick it to the NJDOC, to say, ‘Look what I did all on my own.’”</p><p>Michael studied engineering at Rutgers University before he was imprisoned. Now he is earning a communications degree.</p><p>“My family buys used textbooks,” he said. These are mailed to the prison, but security checks mean they can take weeks to reach him.</p><p>“But the prison just banned used books,” he added. “Depending on how much new ones cost, I might not be able to continue.”</p><p>Al Jazeera requested clarification from the New Jersey Department of Corrections about the cancellation of the roster and the banning of used books, but did not receive a response.</p><p>Michael shrugged and gave a wry smile. “If too many guys signed up, they’d probably cancel the whole thing. I’m being funny, but not really.”</p><p>He maintains top grades and dreams of becoming a journalist. “A criminal conviction closes a lot of doors,” he told me. “I’m just trying to open new ones.”</p><h2 id=\"doing-his-own-time\">‘Doing his own time’</h2><p>There is a couplet from the 18th-century Urdu poet Mir Taqi Mir that goes:</p><p><em>Yaarān-e deyr o Ka‘bah, donon bulā rahe hain</em></p><p><em>Ab dekhen Mir, apnā jānā kidhar bane hai</em></p><p><em>My heart is torn between two calls – the world of love and the house of God.</em></p><p><em>Now it is a test to see which way my soul will turn.</em></p><p>Perhaps that captures the prisoner’s daily dilemma: between despair and determination; between giving up and growing. In the absence of rehabilitation, every man must choose his own path – “doing his own time,” as the popular prison phrase goes – towards light or darkness.</p><p>Men like Thomas, Kashif, Michael, and many others choose light. They choose education.</p><p>The Department of Corrections may store bodies, but it cannot own the will to grow. Education here is not charity. It is resistance. It is the one realm where we can still choose, and in choosing, we stay human and free.</p><p>Because in the end, freedom does not begin with release. It begins with the decision to grow. It begins with the mind.</p><p>And in this place, where time is both enemy and companion, every page turned, every lesson learned, is a way to quiet the endless ticking, a way to remind ourselves that even behind bars, time can still belong to us.</p><p>Tick. Tick. Tick.</p><p><strong><em>This is the final story in a three-part series on how prisoners are taking on the US justice system through law, prison hustles and hard-won education.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Read more from the series:</em></strong></p><p><strong><em><a href=\"/features/2025/12/1/how-im-fighting-the-us-prison-system-from-the-inside\">How I’m fighting the US prison system from the inside</a></em></strong></p><p><strong><em><a href=\"/features/2025/12/7/tailors-and-corner-stores-the-hustles-helping-prisoners-survive\">Tailors and corner stores: The hustles helping prisoners survive</a></em></strong></p><p><strong>Tariq MaQbool</strong> is a prisoner at New Jersey State Prison (NJSP), where he has been held since 2005.
