An estimated 125 people have been killed in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, including the two latest casualties.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>US Southern Command, the military unit that oversees operations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean Sea, reported that one survivor had yet to be recovered. It added that the US Coast Guard had been notified to activate its search-and-rescue operations.</p><p>“On Jan. 23, at the direction of [Secretary of Defense] Pete Hegseth, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” the command wrote in a social media <a href=\"https://x.com/Southcom/status/2014825085425877224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>.</p><p>“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.”</p><p>The deadly strike is the first such attack to take place in 2026: The last one took place on <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/News/PressReleases/Article/4369758/lethal-kinetic-strikes-dec-31-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December 31</a>.</p><p>And it is also the first to unfold since the US launched a full-scale military operation on January 3 in Venezuela to remove the country’s then-president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife Cilia Flores. The couple is now being held in a federal jail in Brooklyn, New York, on charges of narcotics trafficking.</p><p>Trump’s increasingly aggressive actions in the Latin American region have sparked alarm among world leaders and human rights advocates, who have compared the boat bombings to extrajudicial killings.</p><h2 id=\"unknown-fate-for-survivors\">Unknown fate for survivors</h2><p>The treatment of survivors during such strikes has also elicited alarm.</p><p>One survivor from an October 27 attack went missing in the waves and is presumed dead. And during a December 30 <a href=\"https://www.southcom.mil/News/PressReleases/Article/4369710/lethal-kinetic-strikes-dec-30-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attack</a>, Southern Command reported that eight survivors “abandoned their vessels” and jumped overboard before their boats could be sunk in a second strike.</p><p>Despite efforts by the US Coast Guard, the men were never found.</p><p>One of the biggest controversies came in late November, when The Washington Post revealed that the very first strike in the series, on September 2, resulted in two previously unknown survivors.</p><p>Those survivors were then killed in a follow-up “double-tap” strike as they clung to the wreckage of their boat.</p><p>Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle denounced the “double tap” as a possible crime, and pressure has mounted for the Trump administration to release video to the public depicting the second strike.</p><p>Only on one rare occasion have survivors been recovered from the Trump administration’s lethal boat strikes.</p><p>On October 16, the US military targeted a submersible vessel for bombing. Two men survived, one from Ecuador and one from Colombia, and they were repatriated to their home countries. Both men were reportedly released from custody without charges, as officials cited a lack of evidence to detain them.</p><h2 id=\"questionable-legal-justification\">Questionable legal justification</h2><p>The Trump administration has repeatedly accused the people on board the boats of being drug traffickers, though it has never offered any evidence to justify that claim.</p><p>In October, media reports emerged that the White House had issued a notice to Congress saying that the president had determined that the US was locked in an “armed conflict” with drug traffickers, whom it described as “unlawful combatants”.</p><p>Drug trafficking is a crime under international law, but not an act of armed aggression.</p><p>Without a forum in which to weigh evidence and ascertain guilt, experts at the United Nations and elsewhere have warned the killings could amount to international crimes.</p><p>“These attacks appear to be unlawful killings carried out by order of a Government, without judicial or legal process allowing due process of law,” a group of UN experts said in a statement in November.</p><p>They added that the bombing campaign violates “fundamental international human rights law prohibiting arbitrary deprivation of life”, since the attacks were not carried out “within the context of national self-defence” nor against “individuals posing an imminent threat”.</p><p>US groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, have sued the Trump administration to release a secret opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel that it uses to justify the attacks. But that legal case remains ongoing.</p><p>The US also faces questions about the manner in which it conducts the strikes, after a report in The New York Times this month claimed it had disguised the aircraft in the September 2 attack as a civilian plane.</p><p>That could explain why survivors appeared to wave at it for help before being killed in the “double tap”, according to the report. Under international law, such deception can be considered “perfidy”, a serious war crime.</p><p>No victims have ever been publicly identified by the US, raising additional concerns.</p><p>Families from countries including Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago have claimed that their loved ones were among those killed, and many insist the deceased were merely fishermen, not drug traffickers.</p><p>In December, the family of missing fisherman Alejandro Carranza <a href=\"/news/longform/2026/1/16/inevitably-difficult-inside-a-familys-fight-against-the-us-boat-strikes\">was the first to file</a> an international complaint against the US for its boat strikes.</p><p>It appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to stop the bombings, investigate the circumstances and seek compensation on the family’s behalf.</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, the vote had yet to be ​published in the country’s official gazette as of late Friday, a necessary step before ‌the decision becomes legally valid.</p><p>The TPC was established in 2024 as the country’s top executive body, a response to a political crisis stretching back to the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise. It quickly devolved into infighting, questions over its membership and allegations of corruption.</p><p>The council ousted Prime Minister Garry Conille just six months after being formed, selecting Fils-Aime as his replacement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Despite being tasked with developing a framework for federal elections, the council ended up postponing a planned series of votes that would have selected a new president by February.</p><p>Instead, tiered federal elections are now expected to start in August. Meanwhile, the council’s mandate is set to dissolve on February 7.</p><p>On Friday, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he had spoken to Fils-Aime and “emphasised the importance of his continued tenure as Haiti’s Prime Minister to combat terrorist gangs and stabilise the island”.</p><p>Rubio added that the TPC “must be dissolved by February 7 without corrupt actors seeking to interfere in Haiti’s path to elected governance for their own gains”.</p><p>In addition, on social media, the US embassy in Haiti <a href=\"https://x.com/USEmbassyHaiti/status/2014683729713627188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued</a> several statements in both French and Haitian Creole, warning that the politicians could face a steep cost.</p><p>“To the corrupt politicians who support gangs and sow trouble in the country: the United States will ensure they pay a heavy price,” the statement said, though some social media users interpreted the Creole phrase “pri final” or “final price” to imply even more dire consequences.</p><p>The volley of stark statements is being seen as a reflection of US President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2026/1/8/abduction-of-venezuelas-maduro-illegal-despite-us-charges-experts-say\">increasingly aggressive</a> actions in Latin America.</p><p>The heightened tensions come one day after the US embassy in Haiti <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/will-act-accordingly-us-threatens-action-against-haitian-council\">warned</a> that Washington would “regard any effort to change the composition of the government by the non-elected Transitional Presidential Council” as an “effort to undermine” Haiti’s security.</p><p>The US has not clearly articulated its issues with the council, but it had previously imposed visa restrictions on an unnamed Haitian official for “supporting gangs and other criminal organizations, and obstructing the government of Haiti’s fight against terrorist gangs designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>TPC member and economist Fritz Alphonse Jean later <a href=\"/news/2025/11/25/us-imposes-visa-sanctions-against-haitian-official-on-governing-council\">revealed</a> he had been the one targeted with the visa restrictions.</p><p>Jean, however, denied the US allegations and claimed the council was being pressured to acquiesce to the wishes of both the US and Canada.</p><p>The latest back-and-forth comes as more than 1.4 million Haitians remain internally displaced due to gang violence, with millions suffering from a lack of access to sufficient food as transport routes remain constricted.</p><p>Earlier this week, a United Nations report said that an estimated 8,100 people were killed in violence in the country between January and November of last year, a major uptick from 5,600 killed overall in 2024.</p><p>In a statement, Carlos Ruiz-Massieu, who leads the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), said the country had entered a “critical phase” in the push to restore democratic institutions that can properly respond to the nation’s woes.</p><p>“Let us be clear: The country no longer has time to waste on prolonged internal struggles,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He argues it lacks clarity and does not explicitly establish that private companies can hold majority ownership.</p><p>“This law is a law of ambiguity, designed to avoid openly breaking with Chavez’s oil legacy,” Guerra said. “It is not emphatic about private participation.”</p><p>He noted that, in practice, the government has already ceded ground to private capital through production participation contracts (CPP), under which companies could effectively hold more than 50 percent.</p><p>The CPP framework emerged in 2024 when Rodríguez was serving as energy and oil minister. Its operation has been marked by opacity, as it is shielded by Article 37 of the Anti-Blockade Law, enacted to circumvent sanctions imposed on PDVSA in 2019.</p><p>That provision establishes a regime of confidentiality and document classification, allowing the government to bypass the existing Hydrocarbons Law, which limits private or foreign capital to joint ventures in which PDVSA must hold a majority stake.</p><p>On January 15, Rodríguez told the National Assembly that the introduction of CPPs in April of 2024 led to a rebound in oil production, from 900,000 barrels per day to 1.2 million bpd, and that investments under this model reached nearly $900m in 2025.</p><p>But the introduction of the proposed changes were marred by controversy as the draft was not made public until just a couple of hours before lawmakers convened for its first debate. The opposition declined to vote, arguing that in a country with the world’s largest oil reserves, energy legislation should be treated as a “social pact”, the result of a broad and thorough consultation among all stakeholders.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"chevron-model\">‘Chevron model’</h2><p>Luis Oliveros, dean of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the Metropolitan University at Caracas, described it as a positive sign that the law formalises what is known as the “Chevron model”.</p><p>“It opens room for foreign companies to assume technical, operational and financial management of the joint ventures they operate, with greater flexibility,” he said. However, he added that eliminating PDVSA’s mandatory majority stake would have been more attractive to foreign investors.</p><p>Oswaldo Felizzola, coordinator of Venezuela’s International Centre for Energy and Environment (CIEA), told Al Jazeera that the reform contains enough elements to invite new capital to invest in the industry, but ultimately falls short.</p><p>“What has been proposed is necessary, but not sufficient. The law needs to be updated for the 21st century,” Felizzola said. “That said, it is no longer as statist as to paralyse the industry.”</p><p>He noted that many existing companies could shift to a different operating model to improve profitability, but warned that the framework still has significant shortcomings. “It does not take into account current or future issues – climate change, for example – and therefore it is not a law that will drive the role of oil in the years ahead,” he said.</p><p>According to Felizzola, the conditions outlined in the reform are closer to the model that prevailed in Venezuela during the last quarter of the 20th century. “Are further reforms needed? Yes. But there is at least enough in place to work with – and for the Venezuelan government to allow you to do so.”</p><p>The reform bill must now move to a consultation phase and a second, article-by-article debate in the National Assembly before it can be enacted. It is not clear when that will happen.</p><p>Meanwhile, energy cooperation with the Trump administration is already having an impact on Venezuela’s economy. This week, the country received its first $300m from US crude sales, earmarked for stabilising the foreign exchange market.</p><p>“We are witnessing a shift,” Guerra said. “The Rodriguez–Trump pact is clearly being implemented, and oil revenues are already flowing in. The lifting of sanctions allows Venezuela to sell at market prices rather than at a discount, as it has been doing. At a minimum, oil revenues this year are expected to rise by 30 percent compared with last year.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

From attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities to Tehran’s calibrated retaliation across the region, the risk of escalation has become tangible rather than theoretical. For Gulf states, whose security and economic stability are directly exposed to any US–Iran conflict, the implications are immediate. It is within this environment that Qatar’s diplomacy between Washington and Tehran should be understood: not as neutrality for its own sake, but as a calculated effort to contain risks that escalation would only magnify.</p><p data-start=\"1242\" data-end=\"2114\">Periods of heightened tension between the United States and Iran have long carried consequences well beyond Washington and Tehran. Following a wave of protests inside Iran that, according to varying estimates, resulted in the deaths of several thousand people, rhetoric between Tehran and Washington has hardened markedly. This included President Trump’s threat to intervene on behalf of the protesters, a development that further heightened the urgency of diplomacy in the Gulf. The Gulf’s geography, concentrated energy infrastructure and interlinked security environment mean that even limited confrontation risks rapid regional spillover. Against this backdrop, Qatar’s approach toward Washington and Tehran has consistently prioritised de-escalation, mediation and the maintenance of political channels at moments when such channels appeared increasingly fragile.</p><p data-start=\"2116\" data-end=\"2772\">Qatar has emerged as an effective and credible mediator at moments of acute tension between the United States and Iran, offering practical avenues that have helped prevent crises from escalating further. Drawing on its sustained relations with Tehran and its strategic partnership with Washington, Doha has maintained discreet and trusted channels that allow both sides to communicate when direct engagement becomes politically constrained. This positioning has enabled Qatar to facilitate de-escalatory outcomes that have saved face for both parties, reinforcing its role as a mediator that creates political space for restraint rather than confrontation.</p><p data-start=\"2774\" data-end=\"3291\">This role was most visibly demonstrated in September 2023, when Qatar helped facilitate a prisoner exchange between Iran and the United States, alongside the release of frozen Iranian funds for humanitarian purposes. The process required months of indirect negotiations, careful sequencing and political reassurance on both sides. While the agreement did not signal a broader rapprochement, it underscored an important point: even amid deep hostility, diplomacy remains possible when credible mediators are available.</p><p data-start=\"3293\" data-end=\"4444\">For Doha, such mediation is not an end in itself. It reflects a broader conviction that the Iranian nuclear issue, and US–Iran tensions more generally, cannot be sustainably managed through coercion alone. Qatar has consistently aligned itself with the view that dialogue rather than military action offers the only viable path toward containing risks and preventing escalation. This position does not imply indifference to Iranian regional behaviour or to proliferation concerns; rather, it reflects an assessment of costs, uncertainty and unintended consequences for regional security. As such, even in the aftermath of Iran’s calibrated missile strike on the Al Udeid airbase in Qatar — a Qatari military facility hosting US forces — launched in June 2025 in response to US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, Doha moved swiftly to engage both sides and contain the crisis. Through urgent outreach and established communication channels, Qatar contributed to broader efforts that helped support a fragile ceasefire that has broadly held since, underscoring both its capacity to be effective in mediation and the trust placed in Qatari diplomacy.</p><p data-start=\"4446\" data-end=\"5117\">A military confrontation aimed at overthrowing the Iranian regime would almost certainly generate effects that extend far beyond Iran’s borders. Internally, such a scenario risks producing state collapse, fragmentation of authority and the re-politicisation of ethnic and sectarian identities within a large and highly complex society. Externally, the spillover effects could include large-scale refugee movements toward neighbouring states, including across the Gulf, as well as severe disruptions to maritime security and energy markets. Taken together, these outcomes would pose immediate challenges to Gulf states whose own stability is closely tied to regional calm.</p><p data-start=\"5119\" data-end=\"5706\">Recent developments in the region have already altered the strategic balance. Since the October 7 attacks and the subsequent regional confrontations, Iran’s network of allied non-state actors has come under sustained pressure. Several elements of the “axis of resistance” have been weakened militarily and politically, reducing Tehran’s ability to project influence in certain theatres. At the same time, the US attacks on Iran in June 2025 have dispelled any remaining misconception about Washington’s willingness to strike Iran directly and degrade its nuclear enrichment capacity.</p><p data-start=\"5708\" data-end=\"6675\">From a Gulf perspective, however, further escalation offers diminishing returns. Weakening Iranian regional influence does not automatically translate into regional stability, particularly if pursued through strategies that risk state collapse. For Gulf states, the priority is not the dramatic remaking of Iran’s political system, but the avoidance of chaos that would be costly, unpredictable and difficult to contain. This assessment is not limited to Doha. In recent years, Qatar’s position has increasingly converged with those of Saudi Arabia and Oman, both of which have invested in reducing tensions with Tehran through dialogue and confidence-building measures. Their efforts to communicate the risks of military escalation to the Trump administration reflected a broader regional mood, one that favours containment and engagement over confrontation. This convergence is notable given the political differences that have historically separated Gulf capitals.</p><p data-start=\"6677\" data-end=\"7648\">Qatar’s mediation efforts offer a pathway that helps prevent regional chaos at a moment when escalation increasingly offers diminishing returns. By keeping channels open, facilitating limited agreements and discouraging maximalist strategies, Doha seeks to reduce the likelihood of miscalculation. Such efforts rarely produce dramatic breakthroughs, and they are often invisible by design. Yet their absence would likely make escalation more probable, not less.</p><p data-start=\"6677\" data-end=\"7648\">In an increasingly polarised regional environment, the value of de-escalation is easily overlooked. It lacks the clarity of deterrence and the euphoria of military action. Still, as Qatar’s engagement between Washington and Tehran illustrates, diplomacy, however incremental and imperfect, remains one of the few tools capable of preventing crises from spiralling into wider conflict. In a region where the costs of war are shared far beyond the battlefield, that contribution should not be dismissed lightly.</p><p data-start=\"7179\" data-end=\"8162\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
