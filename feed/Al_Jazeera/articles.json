Trump has caricatured Mamdani as an anti-Semitic communist, even threatening to strip him of his US citizenship, while Mamdani called Trump a “despot” in his election victory speech just weeks ago.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>But the pair appeared to put these seemingly irrevocable differences aside – for one day at least – with Trump describing the “great meeting” as “really productive” when talking to reporters in the Oval Office with Mamdani standing by his side.</p><p>With many left unsure of what to make of the bizarrely chummy meeting between the political polar opposites, here are a few key takeaways:</p><h2 id=\"finding-common-ground\">Finding common ground</h2><p>Trump and Mamdani exuded friendliness in their first get-together since the 34-year-old beat Democratic establishment party figures earlier this month, notably former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, to become New York City’s mayor-elect.</p><p>Mamdani said ahead of his meeting with Trump that he was willing to “meet with anyone” to push forward his affordability agenda for the US’s largest city, saying that he and Trump shared some common ground in that they ran campaigns focused on the cost-of-living crisis.</p><p>“I will speak to everyone so long as it could stand to benefit an economic agenda for New Yorkers. And that’s where I will always make the case,” he said.</p><p>The approach appears to have paid off, with Trump saying he and Mamdani “agree on a lot more than I would have thought”, as he predicted success for his tenure leading New York.</p><p>“Some of his ideas are the same ideas I have,” said Trump, adding that some of his supporters also voted for Mamdani, who pitched in, saying “one in 10”.</p><p>Trump said of Mamdani: “He wants to have a safe New York, and ultimately, a safe New York in a great New York.” Later in the media conference, Trump doubled down on how Mamdani was keen to fight crime — echoing the emphasis on strong law enforcement that is a traditional Republican focus.</p><p>The US president also suggested that he agreed with Mamdani on housing.</p><p>“He said some very interesting things. He wants to see houses go up, a lot of apartments built,” Trump said. “People would be shocked, but I want to see the same thing.”</p><p>“I want to be helping him, not hurting him,” Trump said. “A big help”.</p><h2 id=\"praise-and-banter\">Praise and banter</h2><p>But the apparent camaraderie extended beyond policy issues, with Trump also repeatedly praising Mamdani.</p><p>“I think this mayor can do some things that are going to be really great,” he said at one point.</p><p>At another point, Trump said: “The better he does, the happier I am. I feel very confident that he can do a very good job.”</p><p>Trump spoke of Mamdani’s election campaign and how he went from just 1 percent in the polls to upsetting Cuomo, first in the Democratic Party’s primary and then in the actual election. “It’s an amazing thing that he did,” the president said.</p><p>A reporter asked Trump if he would be comfortable living in New York City under Mamdani’s mayorship.</p><p>“Yeah, I would, I really would,” Trump responded instantly. “Especially after the meeting. Absolutely.”</p><p>Towards the end of the media conference, Trump described his impression of Mamdani after their meeting.</p><p>“I met with a man who is a very rational person. I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again. I think he wants to make it greater than ever before.”</p><p>In one striking moment, Trump even gave Mamdani an easy out when the mayor-elect was asked by a reporter if he stood by his previous comments describing the president as a “despot” and “fascist”.</p><p>“That’s OK, you can just say ‘yes’,” Trump interjected. “It’s easier than explaining it.”</p><p>While striking a respectful tone when talking about Trump, Mamdani appeared to draw the line at actively praising him, with the compliments largely flowing one way.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"breaking-from-white-house-and-gop-messaging\">Breaking from White House and GOP messaging</h2><p>If the plan was to pivot away from boogeyman characterisations of Mamdani, key members of Trump’s administration and the Republican party weren’t given the message.</p><p>A day before the meeting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that it “speaks volumes” that a “communist” was visiting the White House.</p><p>“That’s who the Democratic Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,” she said.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance also joked on Thursday that he might “have a stomach bug” to avoid meeting Mamdani, who is set to take office on the first day of 2026.</p><p>Republican Senator Rick Scott also derided Mamdani as a “literal communist” on Friday morning, as he predicted Trump would “school” him at the White House later that day.</p><p>Trump, however, stayed away from any aggressive talk towards Mamdani, even going as far as to contradict members of his own party when he told reporters that he did not agree with Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik’s characterisation of Mamdani as a “jihadist”.</p><p>Following Trump’s comments, Stefanik, a New York Republican gubernatorial candidate, said, “We’ll have to agree to disagree on this one.”</p><p>“If he walks like a jihadist, If he talks like a jihadist, If he campaigns like a jihadist, If he supports jihadists, He’s a jihadist,” she wrote on X.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>Why Trump took a more conciliatory approach in this meeting, starkly breaking from previous Republican messaging on Mamdani, is impossible to tell.</p><p>But the meeting and the talk of affordability as a shared concern occurred at a time when Trump faces growing scrutiny over rising prices following months of tariffs.</p><p>Major schisms have appeared in the Republican party and the Trump MAGA movement in recent days and weeks – notably <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">over the Epstein files scandal</a> and over US support for Israel. On Friday, Republican Congresswoman <a href=\"/news/2025/11/22/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-after-trump-clash\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, for long one of Trump’s staunchest supporters, and a champion of the MAGA movement, said she would resign from the House of Representatives in January, after a public clash with the US president.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"sidestepping-israel\">Sidestepping Israel</h2><p>One topic which which raised the spectre of creating a more awkward, confrontational atmosphere between Trump and Mamdani was <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/11/21/live-israel-keeps-bombing-gaza-kills-two-in-occupied-east-jerusalem\">Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza</a>.</p><p>Asked by a reporter about previous comments he had made about the US government’s complicity in Israel’s assault, including the current administration, Mamdani didn’t shy away from reiterating this criticism – despite an awkward-looking Trump sitting silently next to him.</p><p>“I have spoken about the Israeli government committing genocide [in Gaza] and I’ve spoken about our government funding it,” he said. It is the first known occasion that Israel has been accused of genocide in Gaza within the walls of the White House, even if from an opponent of the current administration.</p><p>Mamdani, however, quickly pivoted back to his core message of the cost-of-living crisis in New York.</p><p>“I shared with the president in our meeting about the concerns that many New Yorkers have of wanting their tax dollars to go towards the benefit of New Yorkers and their ability to afford basic dignity,” he said.</p><p>“I also believe that we have to follow through on international human rights, and I know that still today those are being violated,” Mamdani added, without mentioning Gaza.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But he also said Pakistan was not entirely satisfied with the outcome, and warned that “some critical suggestions” from Pakistan were not included in the final text.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Though the resolution promises a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood, Ahmed, in his comments to the council, said it did not spell that path out, and did not clarify the role of the UN, a proposed Board of Peace (BoP) to oversee Gaza’s governance, or the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/what-is-the-international-stabilisation-force-for-gaza\">mandate of the ISF</a>.</p><p>“Those are all crucial aspects with a bearing on the success of this endeavour. We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity on these issues,” he said.</p><p>But the country had already endorsed US President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/29/trump-and-netanyahu-discussed-proposal-for-ending-war-in-gaza\">20-point Gaza ceasefire plan in September</a> – the basis for the UN resolution. And while several other Arab and Muslim countries have also cautiously supported the resolution, Pakistan, with the largest army among them, is widely expected to play a key role in the ISF.</p><p>The vote in favour of the resolution, coupled with the suggestions that Pakistan still has questions it needs answers to, represents a careful tightrope walk that Islamabad will need to navigate as it faces questions at home over possible military deployment in Gaza, say analysts.</p><p>“The US playbook is clear and has a pro-Israel tilt. Yet, we need to recognise that this is the best option that we have,” Salman Bashir, former Pakistani foreign secretary, told Al Jazeera. “After the sufferings inflicted on the people of Gaza, we did not have any option but to go along.”</p><h2 id=\"pakistan-s-rising-geopolitical-value\">Pakistan’s rising geopolitical value</h2><p>In recent weeks, Pakistan’s top leaders have engaged in hectic diplomacy with key Middle Eastern partners.</p><p>Last weekend, Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited Islamabad and met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief. Munir had earlier travelled to Amman in October, as well as to Cairo in Egypt.</p><p>Pakistan has traditionally had close relations with Gulf states, and those ties have tightened amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Pakistan has long called for “Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a sovereign, independent and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with al-Quds al-Sharif [Jerusalem] as its capital”.</p><p>But in recent weeks, Pakistan – the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons – has also emerged as a key actor in the region’s security calculations, courted by both the United States and important Arab allies.</p><p>In September, <a href=\"/news/2025/9/18/watershed-how-saudi-pakistan-defence-pact-reshapes-regions-geopolitics\">Pakistan signed</a> a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA) with Saudi Arabia, days after Israel had struck Doha, the Qatari capital. Then, in October, Prime Minister Sharif and Field Marshal Munir joined Trump and a bevy of other world leaders in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh for the formal signing ceremony of the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/13/world-leaders-gather-in-egypt-for-signing-of-gaza-ceasefire-deal\">Gaza ceasefire agreement</a>. Sharif lavished Trump with praise on the occasion.</p><p>By then, Trump had already described Munir as his “favourite field marshal”. Following a brief escalation with India in May, during which Pakistan said it <a href=\"/news/2025/5/20/how-conflict-with-india-helped-boost-the-pakistan-militarys-domestic-image\">shot down Indian jets</a>, Munir <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/trumps-pakistan-embrace-tactical-romance-or-a-new-inner-circle\">met Trump</a> in the Oval Office in June, an unprecedented visit for a serving Pakistani military chief who is not head of state.</p><p>In late September, Munir visited Washington again, this time with Sharif. The prime minister and army chief met Trump and promoted potential investment opportunities, including Pakistan’s <a href=\"/news/2025/9/25/strategic-handshake-how-pakistan-is-wooing-trump-with-critical-minerals\">rare earth minerals</a>.</p><p>Now, Pakistan’s government is mulling its participation in the ISF. Though the government has not made any decision, senior officials have publicly commented favourably about the idea. “If Pakistan has to participate in it, then I think it will be a matter of pride for us,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on October 28. “We will be proud to do it.”</p><p>That’s easier said than done, cautioned some analysts.</p><p>Palestine is an emotive issue in Pakistan, which does not recognise Israel. The national passport explicitly states it cannot be used for travel to Israel, and any suggestion of military cooperation with Israeli forces – or even de facto recognition of Israel – remains politically fraught.</p><p>That makes the prospect of troop deployment to Gaza a highly sensitive subject for politicians and the military alike.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4116464\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4116464\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4116464\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/G1GofwcWkAAs8tr-1763516248.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C553&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Pakistan SMDA KSA\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4116464\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a defence agreement on September 17, in Riyadh [Handout/Pakistan Prime Minister’s Office]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"government-keeps-cards-close-to-chest\">Government keeps cards close to chest</h2><p>Officially, the government has been opaque about its position on joining the ISF.</p><p>Even while describing any participation in the force as a cause for pride, Defence Minister Asif said the government would consult parliament and other institutions before making any decision.</p><p>“The government will take a decision after going through the process, and I don’t want to preempt anything,” he said.</p><p>In a weekly press briefing earlier this month, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the question of Pakistan’s contribution would be decided “after consultation at the highest level”.</p><p>“The decision will be taken in due course, as and when required. Certain level of leadership has stated that the decision will be taken with the advice of the government,” he said.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to Asif, the defence minister, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, but received no response.</p><h2 id=\"legal-operational-ambiguities\">Legal, operational ambiguities</h2><p>Some retired senior officers say Pakistan will not decide the matter behind closed doors.</p><p>Muhammad Saeed, a three-star general who served as Chief of General Staff until his 2023 retirement, said he expects the terms of reference and rules of engagement for any ISF deployment to be debated in public forums, including Pakistan’s National Security Council and parliament.</p><p>“This is such a sensitive topic; it has to be debated publicly, and no government can possibly keep it under wraps. So once the ISF structure becomes clear, I am certain that Pakistani decision-making will be very inclusive and the public will know about the details,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy in Washington, DC, said the mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia meant that Pakistani troops in Gaza would likely be representing both countries. He, however, added that Pakistan would likely have participated in the ISF even without the Saudi pact.</p><p>Still, the lack of details about the ISF and Gaza’s governance in the UN resolution remains a stumbling block, say experts.</p><p>Several countries on the council said the resolution left key elements ambiguous, including the composition, structure and terms of reference for both the BoP and the ISF. China, which abstained, also described the text as “vague and unclear” on critical elements.</p><p>The resolution asks for the Gaza Strip to be “demilitarised” and for the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”, a demand that Hamas has rejected.</p><p>Hamas said the resolution failed to meet Palestinian rights and sought to impose an international trusteeship on Gaza that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.</p><p>So far, the US has sent nearly 200 personnel, including a general, to establish a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) near Gaza on Israeli territory. The centre will monitor humanitarian aid and act as a base from which the ISF is expected to operate.</p><p>US-based media outlet Politico reported last month that Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Indonesia – all Muslim-majority states – were among the top contenders to supply troops for the ISF.</p><p>Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates, which joined the Abraham Accords in 2020 and recognised Israel in Trump’s first tenure, has said it will not participate until there is clarity on the legal framework.</p><p>King Abdullah of Jordan also warned that without a clear mandate for the ISF, it would be difficult to make the plan succeed.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4116472\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4116472\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4116472\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/epa_691d1ff539e5-1763516405.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"epa12533972 The ruins of destroyed buildings in northern Gaza City, Gaza Strip, 18 November 2025, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

As of September 2025, UN figures show Pakistan has contributed more than 2,600 personnel to UN missions, just below Indonesia’s 2,700, ranking Pakistan sixth overall.</p><p>Qamar Cheema, executive director of the Islamabad-based Sanober Institute, said Pakistan has emerged as a security stabiliser for the Middle East and has “extensive experience of providing support in conflict zones in the past”.</p><p>Pakistan currently faces security challenges on both its borders – with India to its east and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to the west. But it “may not have to cut troops from its eastern or western borders, since the number of troops [needed in Gaza] may not be that big, as various countries are also sending troops,” Cheema told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Saeed, the retired general, said Pakistan’s historic position on Palestine remained intact and that its prior peacekeeping experience meant that its troops were well-equipped to help the ISF.</p><p>“Pakistan has one of the richest experiences when it comes to both peacekeeping and peace enforcement through the UN. We have a sizeable force, with a variety of experience in maintaining peace and order,” he said.</p><p>“The hope is that we can perhaps provide help that can eliminate the violence, lead to peace, bring humanitarian aid in Gaza and implement the UN resolution,” the former general said.</p><h2 id=\"domestic-political-risks-and-the-israeli-factor\">Domestic political risks and the Israeli factor</h2><p>Despite those arguments, many in Pakistan question the feasibility – and political acceptability – of serving alongside or coordinating with Israeli forces.</p><p>Bashir, the former foreign secretary, acknowledged the risks and said the demand that Hamas deweaponise made the ISF “a difficult mission”.</p><p>Still, he said, “realism demands that we go along with a less than perfect solution”.</p><p>Bokhari of New Lines Institute said stakeholders often sort out details “on the go” in the early stages of such missions.</p><p>“Of course, there is no way Pakistan or any other participating nation can avoid coordinating with Israel,” he said.</p><p>Saeed, however, disagreed. He said ISF would likely be a coalition in which one partner coordinates any dealings with Israeli forces, meaning Pakistani troops might not have direct contact with Israel.</p><p>“There are other countries potentially part of ISF who have relations with Israel. It is likely they will take the commanding role in ISF, and thus they will be the ones to engage with them, and not Pakistan,” he said. He added Pakistan’s involvement – if it happens – would be narrowly focused on maintaining the ceasefire and protecting Palestinian lives.</p><p>But Omar Mahmood Hayat, another retired three-star general, warned that any operational tie to Israel “will ignite domestic backlash and erode public trust”.</p><p>Hayat said Pakistan has no diplomatic ties with Israel “for principled reasons” and that blurring that line, even citing humanitarian considerations, would invite domestic confusion and controversy.</p><p>“This is not just a moral dilemma, but it is also a strategic contradiction,” he said. “It weakens our diplomatic posture.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Acting US ambassador to South Africa Marc D Dillard might be the official tasked with this responsibility, though this has not yet been confirmed.</p><p>Despite the drama over the US attendance, Johannesburg has been buzzing with activity all week in preparation for the summit, as workers clean up and decorate the bustling city. Ramaphosa himself drew surprise when he donned dungarees and picked up cleaning tools.</p><p>Bright flowers and colourful G20 billboards adorn the streets through which dignitaries will pass on their way from the OR Tambo international airport into the city.</p><p>At least 3,500 extra police officials have been deployed to bolster security for the high-level guests, while the army has been placed on standby.</p><p>Some South Africans, though, have voiced criticism of the expensive event, pointing to the economic challenges the country faces. Several protests by organisations from climate action groups to women’s rights defenders are also planned around the airport and the venue of the summit.</p><p>Here’s what we know about the summit:</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121308\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121308\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121308\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-21T080320Z_228901625_RC2V0IA59VR3_RTRMADP_3_G20-SUMMIT-1-1763716414.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"g20 MEETING\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121308\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Banners featuring European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Angola’s President Joao Lourenco are displayed inside the secured area of the G20 summit venue ahead of the meeting scheduled for November 22–23, in Johannesburg, South Africa, on November 21, 2025 [Yves Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-is-the-g20-and-when-is-the-summit\">What is the G20, and when is the summit?</h2><p>The G20 was founded in 1999 as an informal economic grouping of the world’s biggest economic powers.</p><p>But it was the 2008 economic crisis that propelled the G20 into prominence: In a world where major Global South economies like China and India were playing increasingly vital roles, the G7 grouping of seven wealthy nations was no longer equipped to stop the financial bloodbath that spanned continents.</p><p>Since then, G20 leaders have met at least once every year for summits.</p><p>The grouping originally comprised 19 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkiye, the United Kingdom, and the US), plus the European Union as the 20th entity. Since 2023, the African Union has been a member, too. Combined, they represent 85 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and two-thirds of the world’s population, according to the G20.</p><p>G20 country representatives meet throughout the year to discuss pressing issues. But in November, the leaders meet for the annual summit.</p><p>The leaders’ summit marks the culmination of the host country’s yearlong stewardship and usually ends with a non-binding leaders’ declaration. In Brazil last November, leaders issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals by a 2030 deadline.</p><p>South Africa has held the presidency since November 2024 and will hand over to the US on November 30, 2025. This weekend’s meeting will take place over two days from Saturday, November 22, at Johannesburg’s 150,000 square-metre Nasrec Expo Centre, the country’s largest convention centre.</p><h2 id=\"who-is-attending\">Who is attending?</h2><p>Forty-two countries and organisations have confirmed their attendance, according to South African officials speaking to reporters on Monday.</p><p>At least six heads of state are not attending the summit, though, apart from the US, the others are sending high-level representatives, Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said, describing this attendance rate as a “success” for South Africa.</p><p>Some of the most notable names expected at the summit include: China’s Premier Li Qiang, French President Emmanuel Macron, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</p><p></p><p>African Union Commission chairperson Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, President of the European Council Antonio Costa, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will also be present.</p><h2 id=\"why-is-the-us-boycotting-the-summit-this-year\">Why is the US boycotting the summit this year?</h2><p>Trump’s absence from the meeting will be the most notable and has threatened to overshadow the summit’s agenda and undermine South Africa’s position.</p><p>Last week, the US president denounced South Africa’s leadership of the G20 and said he would not attend, citing alleged discrimination against South Africa’s minority white population and inaccurately alleging a “genocide” of white farmers.</p><p>Trump has made several unsubstantiated claims of “genocide” since he returned to the White House in January, following South Africa’s passing of a <a href=\"/news/2025/2/5/is-south-africa-confiscating-land-targeting-some-groups-as-trump-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new law</a> seeking to address disparities in land ownership, three-quarters of which is owned by the country’s white minority.</p><p>In February, the Trump administration cut foreign aid to South Africa, a move which could be a major threat to the nation’s HIV response, according to experts.</p><p>During a <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trumps-ramaphosa-ambush-key-takeaways-from-heated-white-house-meeting\">heated exchange</a> with Trump at the White House in May, President Ramaphosa denied claims of a “white genocide” and said South Africa generally experiences high crime rates, which affect all ethnicities.</p><p>In July, Trump said that while he might not attend the G20 summit, he would send Vice President JD Vance instead. However, on November 8, Trump doubled down on claims of “human rights abuses” by South Africa in a post on his social platform Truth Social, and said <a href=\"/news/2025/11/8/trump-says-us-to-boycott-south-africa-g20-summit-over-white-genocide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no US official </a>would be attending the forum.</p><p>“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa,” he wrote, while recounting his claims again. “No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue. I look forward to hosting the 2026 G20 in Miami, Florida!” he added.</p><p>South African officials have attempted to downplay the US’s absence. Ramaphosa, speaking to journalists in Cape Town after Trump’s announcement, said the action would likely not have an impact.</p><p>“It is unfortunate that the United States has decided not to attend the G20,” he said. “All I can say in my experience in politics is that boycotts never really work. They have a very contradictory effect.”</p><p>In another comment to the media, Ramaphosa told reporters the US boycott was “their loss”. The South African leader, this week, however, said he would hand over the presidency to an empty seat meant for the US representative in a symbolic gesture, and stressed the need to repair ties with Washington.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3725273\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3725273\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3725273\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-21T175538Z_211099346_RC2GMEAOPQ99_RTRMADP_3_USA-SAFRICA-1747856541.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"U.S. President Donald Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa looks towards a monitor (not pictured) that shows videos allegedly pertaining to the genocide of white people in South Africa, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 21, 2025.

Milei did not state why he withdrew.</li>\n<li>China’s Foreign Ministry on November 14 also announced that President Xi Jinping had cancelled his attendance at the meeting, and would instead be represented by Prime Minister Li Qiang. The ministry did not state why, but South Africa and China have a thriving trade relationship. President Xi was in the country for the 2023 BRICS summit, another informal grouping of developing powers.</li>\n<li>The Kremlin announced in October that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin would not attend the meeting and would instead send his deputy head of the presidential administration, Maxim Oreshkin. Putin is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, and as a signatory, South Africa is legally obliged to arrest him if he sets foot in the country.</li>\n<li>Nigeria’s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu cancelled his trip after 25 girls were kidnapped this week from their school amid a security crisis in the country.</li>\n<li>Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum will not attend due to scheduled appointments in the country, the government announced this week. Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente usually represents her abroad.</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"what-s-on-the-agenda\">What’s on the agenda?</h2><p>South Africa, as host, will emphasise issues which affect Global South countries and is hoping to persuade leaders to collectively pledge their commitment to addressing topics from economic inequalities to improving development financing for vulnerable countries.</p><p>South Africa will also lobby countries to commit to scaling up their spending on climate-disaster resilience and disaster responses globally; increase the amount of climate finance flowing from richer to poorer nations; provide better debt restructuring and relief for poorer nations via international financial institutions and bilateral lending; and prioritise local communities and source countries amid a race among global powers for access to critical minerals, some of which are concentrated in African countries.</p><p>South Africa has not hosted an international event on this scale since the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Despite the snub from the US, this is an important moment for the country, and for Africa, Gilad Isaacs, executive director of South African think tank, the Institute for Economic Justice, told Al Jazeera, saying Pretoria has put “real issues” affecting African countries on the agenda this time.</p><p>“The US boycott will not derail the work,” Isaacs said. “The credibility of the presidency will be measured not by the presence of any one country, but by whether the agenda set in the interests of the Global South is carried through and used in other forums.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4121315\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4121315\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4121315\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-21T074732Z_1002669083_RC2U0IAB4B0J_RTRMADP_3_G20-SUMMIT-1763716594.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"g20\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4121315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Banners featuring world leaders are displayed inside the secured area of the G20 summit venue ahead of the meeting scheduled for November 22–23, in Johannesburg, South Africa, on November 21, 2025 [Yves Herman/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-protests-are-planned\">What protests are planned?</h2><p>Several protests are planned around the event, and started on Friday. Deputy national commissioner for policing, Lieutenant General Tebello Mosikili, told reporters on Tuesday that authorities are expecting protests in Johannesburg and other major South African cities.</p><p>“We will allow that right [to protest] to be exercised,” she said. “But within the proper directives and proper confines of the law.”</p><h3 id=\"femicide-protests\">Femicide protests</h3><p>One of the largest demonstrations was planned by the Women for Change advocacy group, which called for a national shutdown on Friday, the eve of the summit, to protest against South Africa’s soaring rates of violence against women and femicide. Three women are killed by intimate partners every day, according to government figures.</p><p>The organisation had led a significant social media campaign in the days leading up to the event to create awareness. On Friday, it asked South African women to boycott work and school and to wear all black to signify mourning. Women were also urged to lie down for 15 minutes at 12pm local time (10:00 GMT) in honour of the women murdered.</p><p>“Because, until South Africa stops burying a woman every 2.5 hours, the G20 cannot speak of growth and progress,” Women for Change said in a campaign statement.</p><p>In an impassioned statement during a sideline G20 event on Thursday evening, President Ramaphosa attempted to show solidarity with women, declaring gender-based violence and femicide both a national and global crisis. Women’s rights groups, however, say they are pushing for femicide to be declared a national disaster.</p><h3>Climate change protests</h3><p>On Thursday, a coalition of climate change and wealth inequality activists called The Citizen began an alternative summit in Johannesburg, decrying the G20 gathering as “for the rich”.</p><h3>White minority protests</h3><p>Separately, Solidarity, a trade union representing members of South Africa’s Afrikaner white minority, is also set to protest against the alleged marginalisation of white South Africans. The organisation has put up controversial billboards around Johannesburg that say: “Welcome to the most RACE-REGULATED country in the world.”</p><h3>Unemployment protests</h3><p>Meanwhile, Operation Dudula, a South African anti-immigration group, protested on Friday against joblessness and poverty in the country. South Africa’s 31 percent unemployment rate is one of the highest in the world.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

“always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I’ve been despised in Washington, DC, and never fit in”.</p><p>“I will be resigning from

responded to the news, saying: “I think it’s great news for the country”.</p><p>“It’s great,” ABC News quoted Trump as saying in an interview.</p><p></p><p>Previously an icon of Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, Greene had a very public falling out with Trump, with the president announcing earlier this month that he was withdrawing all support for the congresswoman he described as “‘Wacky’ Marjorie”.</p><p>Greene has cited as a cause for her rift with Trump her outspoken advocacy for releasing the government’s files on <a href=\"/video/the-take-2/2025/11/21/aje-onl-usa_epstein_av_v3-201125\">convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p><p>Trump had dismissed the Epstein issue as a “Democrat hoax” and has struggled

the case.</p><p>But under mounting pressure from within his own party and Democrats, Trump signed a bill this week to release the Epstein files after a motion to release them passed in the House and Senate with overwhelming support.</p><p>In her resignation statement, Greene referenced the Epstein controversy.</p><p>“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for,” Greene said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Greene also this year became the first Republican lawmaker to call US ally Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide.</p><p>Trump followed up his withdrawal of support for Greene earlier this month with multiple posts on his Truth Social platform attacking the lawmaker as a “lightweight” and even a “traitor” to the Republican Party.</p><p>Greene subsequently said she was being targeted by a wave of threats.</p><p>The move by Greene to resign from Congress before the 2026 midterms is the clearest sign yet of a growing split in the MAGA world amid strong Democratic victories in this month’s off-year elections, and Trump’s warm White House meeting earlier on Friday with <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/trump-and-mamdani-hope-for-positive-relationship-after-productive-meeting\">New York’s

We never thought about it.”</p><p>But Mahmood, an anthropology professor and postcolonial scholar at Columbia University, framed his son’s electoral success as evidence of a shifting political landscape.</p><p>Zohran, for instance, campaigned heavily on questions of affordability and refused to back away from his criticisms of <a href=\"/news/2025/6/26/mamdanis-new-york-victory-boosts-pro-palestine-politics-in-us\">Israel’s abuses against Palestinians</a>, long considered a taboo subject in US politics.</p><p>He is the first Muslim person to become mayor of the country’s largest city by population, as well as its first mayor of South Asian descent.</p><p>“There were certain things that were near and dear to him,” Mahmood explained. “Social justice was one of them. The rights of Palestinians was another.”</p><p>“These two issues he has stuck by. He’s not been willing to trade them, to compromise them, to minimise them.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"inside-the-mamdani-family\">Inside the Mamdani family</h2><p>The son of Mahmood and Indian American director Mira Nair, Zohran first emerged as the frontrunner in the mayoral race in June, when his dark-horse campaign dominated the Democratic Party primary.</p><p>He earned 56 percent of the final tally, besting former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>When Cuomo ran as an independent in the November 4 election, Zohran once again beat him by a wide margin, with more than 50 percent of the vote to Cuomo’s 41 percent.</p><p>Mahmood told Al Jazeera that, while his son’s sudden political ascent came as a surprise, his resilience did not.</p><p>“It didn’t surprise us, with his grit and determination,” he said of the election. “I don’t think he joined the race thinking that he was going to win it. I think he joined the race wanting to make a point.”</p><p>He traced back some of Zohran’s electoral finesse to his upbringing. Zohran, Mahmood explained, was not raised in a typical US nuclear family but instead shared his home with three generations of family members.</p><p>Living with a diverse age range allowed Zohran to expand his understanding and build his people skills, according to Mahmood.</p><p>“He grew up with love and patience. He learned to be very patient with people who are slower, people who were not necessarily what his generation was,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“He was very different from the American kids around here who hardly ever see their grandparents.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4122211\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4122211\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-05T050247Z_1026356933_RC24QHAXIBXO_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-NEW-YORK-MAYOR-1-1763758816.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Zohran Mamdani and his family\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4122211\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani stands with his wife Rama Duwaji, mother Mira Nair and father Mahmood Mamdani after winning the 2025 New York City mayoral race [Jeenah Moon/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-mood-of-change\">A ‘mood of change’</h2><p>Mahmood also credited his son’s victory to a shifting political landscape, one where voters are fed up with the status quo.</p><p>“There’s a mood of change. The young voted like they never voted before,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“Sections of the population which had been completely thrown into the sidelines – Muslims, recent immigrants whether Muslim or not – he gave them enormous confidence. They came out and they voted. They mobilised.”</p><p>Local media outlets in New York reported that turnout for November’s mayoral race was the highest in more than 50 years. More than two million voters cast a ballot in the closely watched race.</p><p>Mahmood cast his son’s upcoming tenure as mayor as a test of whether that voter faith would be rewarded.</p><p>“America is marked by low levels of electoral participation, and they’ve always claimed that this is because most people are satisfied with the system,” Mahmood said.</p><p>“But now the levels of political participation are increasing. And most people, it’s not just that they are not satisfied, but they no longer believe – or they begin to believe that maybe the electoral system is a way to change things. Zohran’s mayoral term will tell us whether it is or it is not.”</p><p>Mahmood was frank that his son faces an uphill battle as mayor.
