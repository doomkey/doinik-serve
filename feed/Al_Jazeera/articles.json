The Libyan government has announced three days of national mourning.</p><p>Here is what we know so far:</p><h2 id=\"who-was-mohammed-ali-ahmed-al-haddad\">Who was Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad?</h2><p>General al-Haddad was Libya’s chief of the General Staff, the highest-ranking military officer in the country’s armed forces.</p><p>General al-Haddad worked within the United Nations-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli to bring together competing armed factions.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Malik Traina said people in Libya were mourning al-Haddad, whom he said was a key figure in efforts to unify the country’s fractured military. “He really was someone who tried to build up the military institutions, especially in western Libya, a place that is divided with powerful armed groups and militias controlling vast areas of land,” Traina, reporting from Tripoli, said.</p><p>“You have powerful armed groups, militias controlling different parts of land. They hold a huge influence on the government. He refused to let these militias hold sway on the government,” Traina added, and was seen as “someone that people could rally behind and support to try to bring some kind of unity to Libya.”</p><p>General al-Haddad had served in that post since 2020 and was seen as a key figure in efforts to unify Libya’s divided military structures, a crucial element of broader attempts to stabilise the country, which descended into chaos following the toppling of its long-term leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Traina said General al-Haddad was one of the first military officials who joined the rebel forces in the revolution that toppled Gaddafi.</p><p>Libya is currently divided between the internationally recognised government based in Tripoli and the rival administration in the east led by military commander Khalifa Haftar.</p><p>“He was a very charismatic and strong leader. General Mohammed was someone who was respected by all sides,” Al Jazeera’s Traina said. “He was someone who believed in the rule of law, always talked about values of democracy, and wanted to transition Libya into civilian rule.”</p><p>Al-Haddad’s death is being mourned in the eastern part of Libya governed by a rival administration, including Haftar, who expressed sorrow and offered his condolences.</p><p>During his Turkiye trip, al-Haddad held talks in Ankara with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and his Turkish military counterpart, Selcuk Bayraktaroglu. Ankara has cultivated close military and economic ties with the Tripoli-based administration, but recently, Ankara has moved to strengthen relations with the eastern administration led by Haftar.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4192905\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4192905\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4192905\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap_694b07ba102d2-1766524858.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"In this photo released by the Turkish Defense Ministry, Turkey's Chief of General Staff Gen.

The jet was 37 years old, according to flight tracking site Flightradar24.</p><p>Controllers directed the aircraft back towards Esenboga and initiated emergency protocols, but it vanished from radar at 17:36 GMT while descending to land, and communication was lost, Duran said.</p><p>Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said had earlier reported that the plane requested an emergency landing while flying over Ankara’s Haymana district.</p><p>Yerlikaya added that the wreckage was later located near Kesikkavak village in the area. Search and rescue teams reached the crash site after operations were launched by the Interior Ministry.</p><p>The Interior Minister later said that authorities had recovered cockpit voice and flight data recorders, collectively known as black boxes. An investigation is under way to “fully clarify” the cause of the crash, he told reporters in Ankara.</p><p>Investigations into the cause are continuing with the participation of all relevant agencies, Duran said. Turkiye has appointed four prosecutors to lead the probe, and Yerlikaya noted that 408 personnel were deployed for the search and recovery effort.</p><p>A group of military officials from Libya is carrying out inspections at the crash site, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4193537\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4193537\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4193537\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-Libyan-army-chief-killed-in-plane-crash-1766566241.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - Libyan army chief killed in plane crash-1766566241\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4193537\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"were-other-people-killed-in-the-crash\">Were other people killed in the crash?</h2><p>Yes.

It is really going be very difficult for authorities to find somebody as charismatic and strong who can unify the country like Mohammed al-Haddad,” Al Jazeera’s Traina said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been briefed by envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and that Moscow was formulating a response.</p><h2 id=\"donbas-most-difficult-point\">Donbas ‘most difficult point’</h2><p>Kyiv has been pressing Washington to modify Trump’s peace plan, which had initially been criticised as a Kremlin wish list, including demands that Ukraine cede more territory, accept curbs on its forces and give up on joining the NATO military alliance.</p><p>Zelenskyy said the latest 20-point framework draft was a considerable evolution on the earlier plan, with Ukraine keeping its army at its current strength of 800,000 at peacetime, and additional documents agreed with the US and European allies providing robust security guarantees.</p><p>But despite the progress, Ukraine and the US have still not found common ground on territorial issues, particularly on control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas. This is “the most difficult point”, Zelenskyy said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While Kyiv has proposed “to remain where we are”, halting fighting at the current battle lines, Moscow wants it to withdraw troops from all of the eastern Donetsk region. Ukraine still controls about a quarter of the region and has rejected demands to give it up.</p><p>With the Kremlin unlikely to abandon its maximalist territorial demands, the US has proposed a compromise arrangement that would transform disputed areas into free economic zones. Ukraine insists that any arrangement must be contingent upon a referendum.</p><p>Additionally, there is still no agreement on the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Zelenskyy said. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant is located in territory under Russian military control near the front line. The president said Kyiv was proposing a small economic zone there.</p><p>“We are saying: If all regions are included and if we remain where we are, then we will reach an agreement,” Zelenskyy said. “But if we do not agree to remain where we are, there are two options: Either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones.”</p><p>The document also proposes the withdrawal of Russian forces from the regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, and that international troops be stationed along the contact line to monitor the implementation of the agreement.</p><p>“Since there is no faith in the Russians, and they have repeatedly broken their promises, today’s contact line is turning into a line of a de facto free economic zone, and international forces should be there to guarantee that no one will enter there under any guise,” Zelenskyy said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Audrey MacAlpine said the key question of territory appears to still be “on the table”, adding that “there has not been anything fleshed out when it comes to exactly how to answer that question.”</p><p>She said: “What it offers is a bit more colour in the form of sub-clauses of how peace might be achieved.</p><p>“They propose things, for example, like a … monitoring system of the front line. If we look back to the Minsk agreements around 2015, there were issues about how to monitor ceasefire infractions between Russia and Ukraine, so this has historically been an issue of contention.</p><p>“He [Zelenskyy] has also said that there are some things that we are probably not ready for, meaning Ukraine, and [he is] sure there are things that Russians are not ready for either, suggesting that both sides may need to make some concessions on these key issues.”</p><h2 id=\"eu-membership-reconstruction-funds\">EU membership, reconstruction funds</h2><p>The draft also ensures that Ukraine will be provided with “strong” security guarantees that mirror NATO’s Article 5, which would obligate Ukraine’s partners to act in the event of renewed Russian assault.</p><p>Zelenskyy said a separate bilateral document with the US will outline these guarantees. This agreement will detail the conditions under which security will be provided and will establish a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire. The mechanism will use satellite technology and early warning systems to ensure effective oversight and rapid response capabilities.</p><p>“The mood of the United States of America is that this is an unprecedented step towards Ukraine on their part. They believe that they are giving strong security guarantees,” he said.</p><p>The draft contains other elements, including Ukraine becoming a European Union member at a specifically defined date, holding elections after the signing of the agreement and accelerating a free trade deal with the US.</p><p>Also included are funds for reconstruction and economic investment.</p><p>“Ukraine will have the opportunity to determine the priorities for distributing its share of funds in the territories under the control of Ukraine. And this is a very important point, on which we spent a lot of time,” Zelenskyy said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

camps and disarmed.</p><p>Al-Basha Tibiq, adviser to the commander of the RSF, which agreed to the Quad’s proposal for a humanitarian truce back in November, rejected Idris’s plan, saying that the notion of the group withdrawing was “closer to fantasy than to politics”.</p><p>In an RSF statement posted on Facebook, Tibiq was quoted as saying that the plan was “nothing more than a recycling of

the Kordofan region, where thousands are currently fleeing violence.</p><p>Sudanese officials said on Wednesday that 1,700 people had fled to Sudan’s White Nile state, east of the Kordofan region,

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Every December, much of the Christian world enters a familiar cycle of celebration: carols, lights, decorated trees, consumer frenzy and the warm imagery of a snowy night. In the United States and Europe, public discourse often speaks of “Western Christian values”, or even the vague notion of “Judeo-Christian civilisation”. These phrases have become so common that many assume, almost automatically, that Christianity is inherently a Western religion — an expression of European culture, history and identity.</p><p>It is not.</p><p>Christianity is, and has always been, a West Asian / Middle Eastern religion. Its geography, culture, worldview and founding stories are rooted in this land — among peoples, languages and social structures that look far more like those in today’s Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan than anything imagined in Europe. Even Judaism, invoked in the term “Judeo-Christian values”, is itself a thoroughly Middle Eastern phenomenon. The West received Christianity — it certainly did not give birth to it.</p><p>And perhaps nothing reveals the distance between Christianity’s origins and its contemporary Western expression more starkly than Christmas — the birth story of a Palestinian Jew, a child of this land who was born long before modern borders and identities emerged.</p><h2 id=\"what-the-west-made-of-christmas\">What the West made of Christmas</h2><p>In the West, Christmas is a cultural marketplace. It is commercialised, romanticised and wrapped in layers of sentimentality. Lavish gift-giving overshadows any concern for the poor. The season has become a performance of abundance, nostalgia, and consumerism — a holiday stripped of its theological and moral core.</p><p>Even the familiar lines of the Christmas song Silent Night obscure the true nature of the story: Jesus was not born into serenity but into upheaval.</p><p>He was born under military occupation, to a family displaced by an imperial decree, in a region living under the shadow of violence. The holy family were forced to flee as refugees because the infants of Bethlehem, according to the Gospel narrative, were massacred by a fearful tyrant determined to preserve his reign. Sound familiar?</p><p>Indeed, Christmas is a story of empire, injustice and the vulnerability of ordinary people caught in its path.</p><h2 id=\"bethlehem-imagination-vs-reality\">Bethlehem: Imagination vs reality</h2><p>For many in the West, Bethlehem – the birthplace of Jesus – is a place of imagination — a postcard from antiquity, frozen in time. The “little town” is remembered as a quaint village from scripture rather than a living, breathing city with actual people, with a distinct history and culture.</p><p>Bethlehem today is surrounded by walls and checkpoints built by an occupier. Its residents live under a system of apartheid and fragmentation. Many feel cut off, not only from Jerusalem – which the occupier does not allow them to visit – but also from the global Christian imagination that venerates Bethlehem’s past while often ignoring its present.</p><p>This sentiment also explains why so many in the West, while celebrating Christmas, care little about the Christians of Bethlehem. Even worse, many embrace theologies and political attitudes that erase or dismiss our presence entirely in order to support Israel, the empire of today.</p><p>In these frameworks, ancient Bethlehem is cherished as a sacred idea, but modern Bethlehem — with its Palestinian Christians suffering and struggling to survive — is an inconvenient reality that needs to be ignored.</p><p>This disconnect matters. When Western Christians forget that Bethlehem is real, they disconnect from their spiritual roots. And when they forget that Bethlehem is real, they also forget that the story of Christmas is real.</p><p>They forget that it unfolded among a people who lived under empire, who faced displacement, who longed for justice, and who believed that God was not distant but among them.</p><h2 id=\"what-christmas-means-for-bethlehem\">What Christmas means for Bethlehem</h2><p>So what does Christmas look like when told from the perspective of the people who still live where it all began — the Palestinian Christians? What meaning does it hold for a tiny community that has preserved its faith for two millennia?</p><p>At its heart, Christmas is the story of the solidarity of God.</p><p>It is the story of God who does not rule from afar, but is present among the people and takes the side of those on the margins. The incarnation — the belief that God took on flesh — is not a metaphysical abstraction. It is a radical statement about where God chooses to dwell: in vulnerability, in poverty, among the occupied, among those with no power except the power of hope.</p><p>In the Bethlehem story, God identifies not with emperors but with those suffering under empire — its victims. God comes not as a warrior but as an infant. God is present not in a palace but in a manger. This is divine solidarity in its most striking form: God joins the most vulnerable part of humanity.</p><p>Christmas, then, is the proclamation of a God who confronts the logic of empire.</p><p>For Palestinians today, this is not merely theology — it is lived experience. When we read the Christmas story, we recognise our own world: the census that forced Mary and Joseph to travel resembles the permits, checkpoints and bureaucratic controls that shape our daily lives today. The holy family’s flight resonates with the millions of refugees who have fled wars across our region. Herod’s violence echoes in the violence we see around us.</p><p>Christmas is a Palestinian story par excellence.</p><h2 id=\"a-message-to-the-world\">A message to the world</h2><p>Bethlehem celebrates Christmas for the first time after two years without public festivities. It was painful yet necessary for us to cancel our celebrations; we had no choice.</p><p>A genocide was unfolding in Gaza, and as people who still live in the homeland of Christmas, we could not pretend otherwise. We could not celebrate the birth of Jesus while children his age were being pulled dead from the rubble.</p><p>Celebrating this season does not mean the war, the genocide, or the structures of apartheid have ended. People are still being killed. We are still besieged.</p><p>Instead, our celebration is an act of resilience — a declaration that we are still here, that Bethlehem remains the capital of Christmas, and that the story this town tells must continue.</p><p>At a time when Western political discourse increasingly weaponises Christianity as a marker of cultural identity — often excluding the very people among whom Christianity was born — it is vital to return to the roots of this story.</p><p>This Christmas, our invitation to the global church — and to Western Christians in particular — is to remember where the story began. To remember that Bethlehem is not a myth but a place where people still live. If the Christian world is to honour the meaning of Christmas, it must turn its gaze to Bethlehem — not the imagined one, but the real one, a town whose people today still cry out for justice, dignity and peace.</p><p>To remember Bethlehem is to remember that God stands with the oppressed — and that the followers of Jesus are called to do the same.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He left in June 2022 when LIV signed him to a reported $100m contract to jump-start its bid to compete ⁠with the PGA Tour.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“We have amicably and mutually agreed that Brooks Koepka will no longer compete ​in the LIV Golf League, following the 2025 season,” LIV Golf CEO ‍Scott O’Neil said in a statement. “Brooks is prioritizing the needs of his family and staying closer to home.”</p><p>Koepka’s tenure with LIV was laden with highs and lows. When he won the 2023 PGA Championship after spending most of ‍his days playing ⁠in LIV’s comparatively non-competitive environment that featured 54-hole, no-cut tournaments, it gave LIV a big boost of credibility.</p><p>On the flipside, Koepka occasionally expressed his frustration with his situation – sounding like the 2017 and 2018 US Open champion and 2018, 2019, 2023 PGA titlist was marking time.</p><p>“I’ve got a contract obligation out here to fulfil, and then we’ll see what happens,” Koepka said at one LIV event.</p><p>His official third-person statement did not offer ​any hints as to his future.</p><p>“Brooks Koepka will be stepping ‌away from LIV Golf. He is deeply grateful to Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Scott O’Neil, and the LIV Golf leadership team, his teammates, and the fans. Family has always guided Brooks’s decisions, and he feels this is the right moment to spend ‌more time at home. Brooks will continue to be a huge supporter of LIV Golf and wishes the league and its players continued ‌success. Brooks remains passionate about the game of golf and will ⁠keep fans updated on what’s ahead.”</p><p>While Koepka can tee it up for all four majors next year thanks to his 2023 PGA Championship victory, the PGA Tour requires LIV exiles to sit out one year from their last LIV ‌tournament. His last appearance was on August 24 at the one-day LIV Golf Michigan event.</p><p>The PGA Tour could offer an exemption, but it also opted not to offer any hints in its statement.</p><p>“Brooks Koepka is ‍a highly accomplished professional, and we wish him and his family continued success. The PGA Tour continues to offer the best professional golfers the most competitive, challenging and lucrative environment in which ‌to pursue greatness.”</p><p>LIV Golf is financed by the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4193456\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4193456\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4193456\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2024-05-05T120159Z_967241331_MT1USATODAY23196096_RTRMADP_3_GOLF-LIV-GOLF-SINGAPORE-THIRD-ROUND-1766563678.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Brooks Koepka reacts.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4193456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Koepka cited family as the primary reason for his early departure from LIV Golf [File: Edgar Su/Reuters via USA TODAY Sports]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Weihai, in China’s eastern Shandong province, said on Wednesday that a probe into the incident showed that two Taiwanese men had been operating the ship involved – the Togo-registered Hong Tai 58 – as part of a longstanding operation smuggling frozen goods into China.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3

Progressive Party of falsely claiming that Beijing had used the Hong Tai 58 to deliberately sabotage an undersea cable off the island in a bid “to stir cross-Strait confrontation”.</p><p>Taiwan has accused Beijing of severing the cable as a so-called “grey zone” or “hybrid warfare” tactic to apply pressure on the self-ruled island of 23 million people, which China views as its territory.</p><p>The terms refer to low-grade coercive acts such as sabotage that hold a certain degree of plausible deniability.</p><p>But China has denied its involvement, calling the incident a “common” maritime occurrence that has been “exaggerated” by Taiwanese authorities.</p><p>In June, a Taiwanese court sentenced the Chinese captain of the Hong Tai 58 to three years in ⁠jail after finding him guilty of intentionally damaging the cables off Taiwan.</p><p>Seven Chinese crew members were sent back to China without charge, and were interviewed by authorities on the mainland as part of their probe into the incident.</p><h2 id=\"reward-offered\">Reward offered</h2><p>Announcing the probe’s findings, the Weihai public security bureau offered a reward of up to 250,000 yuan ($35,569) for information ‌or assistance regarding the Taiwanese suspects, who it said had the surnames Chien and Chen.</p><p>The pair had been on a Chinese customs office wanted list since 2014, it

cable breakdowns around Taiwan, although some were later ruled as accidents or due to the old age of the equipment.</p><p>Countries around the Baltic Sea have also seen an increase in undersea cable breakdowns since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and they have struggled to bring legal cases against China and Russia-linked ships and their owners.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was later destroyed.</p><p>The couple had endured bombardment, hunger, and repeated displacement with their families, making the idea of a wedding seem impossible.</p><p>“Our families occasionally pressured us to go ahead with the wedding since the war was dragging on, but we both refused,” Nesma said, with Mustafa nodding in agreement. “We kept asking ourselves how we could celebrate or hold a wedding amid war and displacement.”</p><p>What further distanced the idea of marriage was Mustafa’s grief after losing two of his older brothers during the war, one in December 2023, when their home in Jabalia was bombed, and another in March 2025, during the second half of the war.</p><p>“Losing my brothers cast an overwhelming shadow of grief over us, especially my mother, who cannot stop crying whenever she remembers them,” Mustafa said, glancing at his mother as she listened to the conversation.</p><p>After <a href=\"/opinions/2025/1/19/the-ceasefire-will-not-bring-our-lives-back\">a ceasefire began</a> on January 19, 2025, the couple decided to proceed with the wedding, believing the war had ended. But it quickly resumed.</p><p>“At that time, my uncle’s house in Jabalia was still standing, so we decided to take an apartment there and started preparing it. My bride began preparing herself and her clothes.”</p><p>“But we were shocked when the war broke out again in mid-March 2025,” Mustafa said.</p><p>With the return of the war, both were forced to flee with their families from northern Gaza to the west of Gaza City, where they lived in tents under harsh conditions until a <a href=\"/news/2025/10/10/gaza-city-residents-set-to-return-as-israel-bombs-before-ceasefire-starts\">second ceasefire</a> came into effect on October 10, 2025.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4192856\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4192856\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4192856\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A7272-1766523225.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mustafa and Nesma sit on the rubble of the building that was shelled \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4192856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is the third time Mustafa and Nesma have prepared for marriage, only to lose everything [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"refuge\">Refuge</h2><p>After the October ceasefire was announced, Mustafa and his family moved to a shelter in the Tuffah neighbourhood, about half a kilometre (0.3 miles) from the so-called <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/palestinians-squeezed-as-israel-moves-beyond-yellow-line-in-gaza-city\">“yellow line”</a>, beyond which Israel retains control in Gaza.</p><p>“We wanted to escape life in the tents during the winter, so we decided to move into the school despite our concerns about its proximity to the yellow line,” he said.</p><p>Following family discussions, both families agreed to hold the wedding on December 19, with a modest celebration in a tent adjacent to the shelter.</p><p>“Once the date was set, I prepared what I could. Other displaced families in the shelter helped me, and they provided a classroom for us. Everything seemed to be going well,” Mustafa said.</p><p>Mustafa said he never expected the shelter to be attacked, as it was housing a large number of displaced families, the surrounding neighbourhood was densely populated, and the area lay outside the yellow line.</p><p>The educational centre was located in an area from which Israeli forces had withdrawn, in line with the ceasefire agreement.</p><p>Despite the truce, hundreds of Israeli violations have been recorded, with more than 400 Palestinians killed in repeated attacks over recent months.</p><p>Eight people were killed in the shelling of the building next to the wedding tent, all neighbours and relatives of Mustafa’s family, who had been sheltering on the second floor, he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4192868\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4192868\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4192868\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/873A7455-1766523475.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Youssef, 7, with a bandage around his head, holds a mobile phone showing an image of him before his injury\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4192868\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Youssef, 7, Mustafa’s nephew, was injured during the air attack on the shelter, just moments after leaving the wedding tent nearby [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"displaced-again\">Displaced again</h2><p>“Among those killed were a mother, her husband, and their child, as well as my young nephew, who had been dancing with joy just moments earlier,” Mustafa said.</p><p>“What justification is there for targeting these people?

Is there suffering greater than this?” Mustafa added in despair.</p><p>“I am displaced, my bride is displaced, our families are displaced, living in tents with relatives.”</p><p>“We insisted on holding our wedding during the war, but the war returned in the blink of an eye on the very day of our wedding,” Nesma said, her eyes heavy with grief.</p><p>“My joy is shattered. I have no desire for life. Everything feels dark here, and there is no space for happiness, not even one step.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

We are subjected to systematic persecution aimed at emptying the Holy Land of Christians and forcing them into displacement, so that Israel can portray the conflict as one between itself and Muslims.”</p><p>Kisiya said she is looking towards Christian world leaders, in particular, the leaders of the world’s churches, to stand by the ancient Christian population of Palestine.</p><p>“I hope that His Holiness the Pope, along with all church leaders and clergy, will intervene more broadly to protect the Christian presence in the city of Bethlehem and throughout Palestine,” she said.</p><p>“We are part of the struggle and the building of the Palestinian state.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
