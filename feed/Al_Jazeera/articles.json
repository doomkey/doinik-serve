Led by Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Tigri and calling themselves the “Military Committee for Refoundation”, eight uniformed men declared President Patrice Talon “removed from office”, suspended the constitution, dissolved state institutions, and ordered border closures.</p><p>Observers prepared for a now-familiar scenario: A forced resignation, <a href=\"/news/2023/8/30/gabon-military-officers-claim-power-say-election-lacked-credibility\">leaders detained or under house arrest</a>, and routine condemnations from the African Union (AU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</p><p>However, by midday, those expectations were upended.</p><p>Within hours of the broadcast, <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/7/benin-attempt-coup-live-soldiers-on-state-tv-claim-to-have-toppled-talon\">Interior Minister Alassane Seidou</a> announced that the coup attempt had been thwarted.</p><p>Talon reappeared publicly, on TV, and authorities reported the arrest of at least 14 plotters, including 12 soldiers.</p><p>The announcement and subsequent drama sent shockwaves across the region, yet it was not a sudden rupture, but the visible peak of a deeper political crisis years in the making.</p><p>The attempted coup was merely the final symptom.</p><p>In its aftermath, order was restored, but not legitimacy.</p><p>Benin’s real coup – the systematic overthrow of its democracy – had already occurred under Talon.</p><p>All the attempted takeover did was to lay bare a political system that had already been undermined from within.</p><p>Before Talon came to power in April 2016, Benin was widely recognised for its peaceful transfers of power, a dispensation anchored in the February 1990 National Conference, which ended one-party rule and laid the foundations for a multi-party democratic system.</p><p>Talon, a multi-millionaire cotton magnate, positioned himself as a reformer in his first electoral campaign, promising political, administrative, and economic change for the better.</p><p>Once elected, his course shifted.</p><p>Instead of strengthening democracy, Talon began to systematically dismantle the democratic institutions that had made Benin, a country of nearly 15 million people, known as an early democratic success in Africa.</p><p>Since 2016, Benin’s democratic institutions have been hollowed out through legal engineering, judicial capture, and electoral rules rewritten to <a href=\"/news/2019/4/28/no-opposition-candidates-as-benin-votes-in-general-election\">exclude opponents from power</a>.</p><p>Talon began quietly with court-packing in 2017-18, using presidential appointments to remake the Constitutional Court into a compliant body. Within a year, it would legitimise electoral exclusion and constitutional changes that consolidated executive control.</p><p>The timeline of extreme political regression is instructive.</p><p>The first decisive legal break came in April 2019, when a new electoral code introduced a “certificate of conformity” requirement, empowering authorities to disqualify entire opposition lists from that year’s parliamentary elections.</p><p>Consequently, only two pro-government parties, the Progressive Union for Renewal (UPR) and the Republican Bloc (BR), appeared on the ballot in the April 2019 parliamentary elections.</p><p>All major opposition blocs, including alliances linked to former Speaker Bruno Amoussou, who was once aligned with Talon, were barred.</p><p>Amnesty International documented a wave of arbitrary arrests, detentions and crackdowns on peaceful protesters and journalists in the run-up to the 2019 vote.</p><p>The public reacted.</p><p>Voter turnout tanked from nearly two-thirds in the previous election to just 27 percent.</p><p>In the ensuing months, widespread protests erupted in Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and elsewhere.</p><p>Security forces responded with force, killing several protesters and <a href=\"/news/2019/5/2/protesters-in-benin-clash-with-police-in-post-election-violence\">arresting dozens</a>.</p><p>In June 2019, former President Thomas Boni Yayi endured 52 days of house arrest over alleged election protest incitement.</p><p>Consequently, parliament became entirely opposition-free, and reviving political dissent after this upheaval became perilous.</p><p>The transformation was complete by 2021: In the April presidential election, held amid violent protests and a boycott by several opposition parties, vote counting began under an atmosphere of intimidation, and civil society observers reported widespread irregularities, underscoring how the political environment had changed. Talon won re-election with an impressive 86 percent of the vote.</p><p>After this, any illusion of democracy in the country disappeared, and all political competition was squashed through politicised arrests, show trials, and lengthy imprisonments.</p><p>In December 2021, constitutional scholar Joel Aivo, a prominent opponent of President Patrice Talon, was sentenced to 10 years by the Court for the Repression of Economic Offences and Terrorism (CRIET) after being convicted of plotting against the state and money laundering.</p><p>Days later, the same court sentenced another Talon opponent, former Justice Minister Reckya Madougou, to 20 years for “complicity in terrorist acts” in a verdict her lawyers and international rights organisations described as politically motivated.</p><p>By 2022, more than 50 opposition figures had been imprisoned on charges ranging from terrorism to economic sabotage, including 30 freed during French President Emmanuel Macron’s 2022 visit, although high-profile leaders Aivo and Madougou remained jailed.</p><p>Repression, however, was only one part of the project.</p><p>Institutional entrenchment followed.</p><p>Just weeks before the attempted coup, on November 16, parliament passed amendments extending presidential and legislative terms from five to seven years and creating a partly appointed senate.</p><p>The amendment, while retaining the two-term presidential limit, passed with 90 votes in favour and 19 against. Opposition lawmakers criticised both its timing and long-term implications, arguing it would disrupt the political calendar and recalibrate the balance of power between state institutions.</p><p>By the time these warnings were voiced, the damage was already done.</p><p>So the soldiers who appeared on television and claimed power two days ago did not destroy Benin’s democracy.</p><p>They revealed how far it had already decayed.</p><p>Benin fits a broader African trajectory of term-stretching in <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/zimbabwes-governing-party-moves-to-extend-mnangagwa-presidency-to-2030\">Zimbabwe</a> and <a href=\"/news/2024/4/20/togo-approves-constitutional-reform-changing-how-president-is-elected\">Togo</a>, constitutional conflict in Zambia, and the spectre of military intervention experienced in <a href=\"/news/2023/9/16/mali-niger-and-burkina-faso-establish-sahel-security-alliance\">Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso</a>.</p><p>Public opinion underscores the dilemma.</p><p>Afrobarometer’s latest survey across 39 African countries finds that while 66 percent still prefer democracy, more than half now consider military intervention acceptable when leaders abuse their power.</p><p>In Benin, as elsewhere, confidence in the military now exceeds trust in political institutions, amid declining faith in elections and democratic governance.</p><p>Courts widely viewed as politicised and polls stripped of credibility have eroded voters’ sense of agency.</p><p>Coups seldom arise spontaneously from military barracks.</p><p>Instead, they follow the systematic erosion of democratic institutions through judicial capture, electoral manipulation, and constitutional changes that entrench incumbents.</p><p>Elections are still held, and courts still convene, but they no longer function as <a href=\"/news/2023/8/28/zimbabwe-opposition-alleges-blatant-and-gigantic-fraud-in-election\">instruments of accountability</a>. They serve as the procedural shell of a system that has been emptied of political competition and choice.</p><p>When civilian institutions collapse, militaries exploit the vacuum.</p><p>They do not repair it.</p><p>In Benin, this progression is unmistakable.</p><p>The AU and ECOWAS condemned the attempted coup and pledged support for constitutional order, but stopped short of sanctions, sustained mediation, or binding guarantees of electoral intervention.</p><p>These days, democratic backsliding in Africa produces statements, not consequences.</p><p>The failure of the coup attempt in Benin will not usher in stability.</p><p>On the contrary, the failed coup risks speeding securitisation and prompting further unrest.</p><p>The plotters said their reasons were rooted in policy failures. They cited Talon’s handling of the threat from al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS)-linked fighters in northern Benin, the neglect of fallen soldiers and their families, and unpopular tax and spending decisions.</p><p>Genuine recovery demands reversing years of democratic backsliding.</p><p>Political prisoners should be freed, special courts abolished or reformed, and unfair electoral laws scrapped.</p><p>Electoral commissions need full independence from executive control.</p><p>The constitution itself needs an open, inclusive review, with civil society, opposition groups and independent institutions at the table.</p><p>These demands are not radical.</p><p>They represent the democratic minimum necessary for legitimacy and stability.</p><p>Talon entered office as Benin’s democratic hope, a businessman promising to clean up governance and modernise the state.</p><p>Nearly a decade later, he embodies the return of Africa’s post-independence strongman: A throwback to an era of control, fear, and arrested possibility.</p><p>What Talon did through law is no less violent than what soldiers attempted with guns on December 7.</p><p>Still, Benin’s window for reform remains open.</p><p>Only just.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

one Thai soldier was killed, forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes and shattering an uneasy peace that had held since five days of clashes in July.</p><p>That bout of fighting, involving the exchange of rockets and heavy artillery fire and fuelled by competing territorial claims along their border, resulted in at least 48 deaths on both sides and the temporary evacuation of more than 300,000 civilians before a ceasefire was brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and United States President Donald Trump.</p><p>Thailand, however, <a

drones.</p><p>Each side blames the other for firing the first shots.</p><h2 id=\"no-space-for-diplomacy\">‘No space for diplomacy’</h2><p>In a statement on Tuesday morning, the Thai navy said it was taking action to expel Cambodian forces from its territory in the coastal province of Trat.</p><p>The navy said Cambodian forces there were increasing their presence, deploying snipers and heavy weapons, developing fortified positions and digging trenches, in what it viewed “as a direct and serious threat to Thailand’s sovereignty”, prompting the launch of operations to expel them.</p><p>Speaking to Al Jazeera, Thailand’s Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said Cambodia is “not ready” for peace negotiations.</p><p>“They say they’re ready on one hand, but their actions on the ground are entirely in the opposite direction,” he said.</p><p>“Diplomacy will work when the situation provides the space for diplomacy,” he said. “I’m sorry to say that right now we don’t have that space.”</p><p>Although the ongoing hostilities and military operations are bringing losses to both sides, Phuangketkeow added that “we want the Cambodian side to show that they’re ready to stop what they’re doing – and then, of course, we can consider the prospect for diplomacy and negotiations”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Both sides say the renewed violence has forced civilians on either side of the border to flee to shelter.</p><p>A statement from Thailand’s 2nd Army Region, situated along the border, said almost 500 temporary shelters have been set up in four border provinces, accommodating more than 125,000 people.</p><p>For more than a century, Thailand and Cambodia have contested sovereignty at points along their 817km (508-mile) border, first mapped in 1907 by France when it ruled Cambodia as a colony.</p><p>Simmering tension has occasionally exploded into skirmishes, such as a weeklong artillery exchange in 2011, despite attempts to resolve the dispute peacefully.</p><p>A 2013 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) upheld a 1962 judgement by the same body awarding part of the land around Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,

They gave me a gun, I shot a round in the direction of a target, and they ticked a box next to my name,” he said.</p><p>Tymofey asked to withhold his last name and personal details because he is hiding from the authorities.</p><p>He claimed he has not been officially charged with desertion or going AWOL (absent without leave), charges that can be seen in the online and publicly-accessible registry of pretrial investigations.</p><p>His explanation is simple: “Half the country is on the run”, while military and civilian authorities do not have the capacity to track down and apprehend each deserter.</p><p>Prosecutors said in October that some 235,000 servicemen went AWOL, and almost 54,000 have deserted since Russia began its full-scale invasion in 2022.</p><p>Those numbers began to snowball last year. Some 176,000 AWOL cases and 25,000 desertions were registered between September 2024 and September 2025.</p><p>“Even in Russia, there aren’t that many soldiers going AWOL,” Valentyn Manko, top commander of storm troops, told the Ukrainian Pravda on Saturday.</p><p>The desertion crisis exacerbates the disastrous shortage of servicemen amid the gradual, grinding loss of Ukrainian territory to Russia.</p><p>In November, Russian forces occupied some 500 square kilometres (190 sq miles), mostly in eastern Ukraine, while the Washington-mediated peace talks stalled again.</p><p>Manko said that about 30,000 men are mobilised monthly, but the preferred number is 70,000 to “restaff” all military units.</p><p>A serviceman can be accused of deserting 24 hours after leaving his military unit, and can face between five and 12 years in jail, according to wartime regulations, while going AWOL is punishable by up to 10 years in jail.</p><p>Many prefer jail.</p><p>“The number of our deserters, servicemen gone AWOL is too high,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s General Staff of Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. “They think that from the legal standpoint, it’s easier to go to jail than to the front line.”</p><p>Romanenko has long been advocating for the introduction of stricter wartime laws and harsher punishment for deserters and corrupt officials, who he believes should be sent to the front line instead of jail.</p><p>The legal difference between desertion and going AWOL is an “intention to leave the service for good”.</p><p>But since November 2024, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government has declared an amnesty for first-time deserters, who can return to their unit without any punishment.</p><p>Some 30,000 have, counting on the lenience of military authorities and their commanding officers.</p><p>“There’s more understanding towards them,” a psychologist at a military unit in southern Ukraine told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, because he is not authorised to talk to the media.</p><p>Desertion does not always stem from fear of death, and is often caused by inattentive commanding officers who ignore their servicemen’s issues, the psychologist said.</p><p>“Some say their commander didn’t let them go on leave, didn’t let them visit their sick relatives, didn’t let them get married,” he said.</p><p>In one case, a man in his early twenties deserted after learning he would be dispatched to the front-line town of Pokrovsk, the psychologist said.</p><p>After fleeing, the deserter worked in a factory job despite the risk of being caught, the psychologist found out later.</p><p>Meanwhile, the military police force is severely understaffed and cannot detain a serviceman without a court order unless he is drunk or threatens them with a weapon – while courts are swamped with thousands of cases that cannot be processed promptly.</p><p>So, a deserter’s nightmare is the “<a href=\"/news/2025/8/8/ukraines-conscription-crisis-alleged-abuse-leads-to-protests-emigration\">conscription patrols</a>” that comprise military and police officers who comb public places asking men of fighting age to show IDs and “soldier’s tickets”, QR-coded documents about their conscription status.</p><p>But many deserters know their way around such places, or even carry enough cash to pay a bribe of up to several hundred dollars.</p><p>Deserters can also be caught while driving cars registered to them, or even connected to them via traffic fines paid for from their cards.</p><p>That is how Tymofey got caught.</p><p>For months, he had been driving his brother’s car, but in April, he used his own credit card to pay a fine for running a red light.</p><p>Days later, traffic police rounded him up, saying that a conscription notice had been sent to him months earlier.</p><p>Tymofey claimed to have never received the notice.</p><p>He was sent to a training centre in the central Zhytomyr region and escaped after finding a gap in the barbed wire and securing a ride from a friend.</p><p>To reach the car, he said he walked for five hours in the rain through a forest, stumbling and scratching his face and arms.</p><p>“The friend almost drove away without me,” Tymofey said.</p><p>Once in Kyiv, he moved to his friend’s apartment, went back to work, and even started using his old SIM card.</p><p>But two months later, he was caught again while driving his brother’s car.</p><p>His second escape was an easier, fast-forwarded version of the first one, because “the training centre was in Kyiv and the fence was lower”, he said, showing his scarred palms.</p><p>Tymofey shrugged off the opinion of his friends and relatives who condemn his “cowardice” and a “lack of patriotism”.</p><p>Some have cut ties with him altogether, he said.</p><p>Many former servicemen despise draft dodgers and deserters, thinking they should face tougher punishment and have their civil rights limited.</p><p>“They shouldn’t be allowed to vote or receive pension,” suggested Yevhen Galasiyk, who lost his right eye near the eastern town of Bakhmut in 2023, and still suffers from severe headaches.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the country’s largest political party, is decisively breaking its decades-long alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami, the South Asian nation’s biggest Islamist group, repositioning itself instead as a liberal, democratic force before national elections.</p><p>The shift comes 16 months after the toppling of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, following a mass uprising against her decade-and-a-half-long rule marked by widespread human rights excesses, including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, arrests of critics and opposition leaders, and a brutal crackdown on protesters in August 2024.</p><p>Hasina’s Awami League party, historically the BNP’s principal rival, had over the decades proclaimed the mantle of a secular, liberal pillar in Bangladeshi politics, though critics disputed that assertion.</p><p>By contrast, the BNP and Jamaat were pulled together by their shared opposition to the Awami League. But their ideological differences were never hidden: The BNP subscribed to a nationalist worldview, while the Islamic identity of most Bangladeshis is the raison d’etre of the Jamaat.</p><p>Now, those differences have erupted into a full-fledged split between the parties that had ruled together in the last non-Hasina government elected in Bangladesh, between 2001 and 2006.</p><p>Addressing party supporters this week, BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rehman invoked the blood-soaked memory of Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War against Pakistan, saying “people saw” what happened then. He did not name the Jamaat, but the reference was clearly understood across Bangladesh: The Jamaat had opposed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan.</p><p>He also accused the Jamaat of misusing religion to seek votes.</p><p>In similar comments last month, BNP Secretary-General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir cautioned against dividing the country “in the name of religion” and stressed that the BNP’s politics ought to rest on national unity, democratic principles, and the foundational spirit of 1971.</p><p>So what’s behind this shift?</p><p>The BNP’s recent narrative suggests that it wants to appropriate the moral vocabulary of secular nationalism that the Awami League long monopolised through its lopsided historical revisionism of the true spirit of the liberation war. Awami League founder Sheikh Mujibur Rehman led the liberation struggle, but was also responsible for an independent Bnagladesh’s early descent into authoritarianism, when he banned all other political parties to try to set up a one-party system in 1975.</p><p>Hasina carried forward that legacy when she was in power between 2009 and 2024, banning the Jamaat and arresting thousands of BNP leaders and workers – including its longtime chief and former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, who is currently in hospital in what her party and family have described as a “very critical condition”. The Hasina government’s ruthless crackdown on the political opposition and other critics turned the 2014, 2018 and 2024 elections into a sham, with the Awami League winning landslides against a landscape of repression.</p><p>To occupy the secular nationalist void left by the Awami League – which itself has now been banned, while Hasina is in exile in India – the BNP needs to sever ties with an Islamist party whose historical baggage could hinder its attempt to appeal to an audience seeking pluralistic politics.</p><p>To be sure, the BNP-Jamaat split did not appear overnight. For months, both parties have drifted apart over core questions: Whether broader reforms must precede elections, how to restructure the Constitution, and what political model should define the post-Hasina era.</p><p>The Jamaat pushed for sweeping structural changes before polls; the BNP insisted on early elections and minimal constitutional revisions. Their disagreements slowly hardened into open rifts.</p><p>But this break is not merely about strategic disagreements. It reflects an ideological recalibration driven by the new political environment.</p><p>The centre-left, liberal-secular space that the Awami League once claimed is now vacant.</p><p>The BNP sees an opportunity to occupy it, before national elections scheduled for February.</p><p>BNP’s calculation is anchored in the shifting mood of the electorate. The youth-led uprising of 2024, the collapse of one-party authoritarianism, and the civic awakening of urban middle-class voters have all produced a renewed demand for democratic governance and political moderation.</p><p>Jamaat’s religion-driven leanings, the BNP believes, could clash with that sentiment. By rebranding itself, the BNP believes it can resonate with voters who are disillusioned with both the Awami League’s authoritarianism and the Jamaat’s religious conservatism.</p><p>The reorientation also aims to reclaim the moral high ground of 1971. For decades, the Awami League weaponised the Jamaat’s wartime collaboration with Pakistan to delegitimise the BNP by association. Now the BNP is flipping that narrative.</p><p>By denouncing the Jamaat’s role in 1971, the party is challenging the ideological monopoly the Awami League exercised for half a century – trying to appeal to younger citizens who view 1971 through narratives of democracy and human rights rather than loyalty to any one party.</p><p>This attempted transformation is not without risks. The BNP must overcome scepticism about whether this rebranding is genuine or opportunistic. Elements within the BNP’s own ranks may resist the shift towards a more liberal identity.</p><p>Furthermore, the post-Hasina political space is crowded: Youth-driven groups like the National Citizen Party (NCP) and civil society networks are also vying for the liberal-centrist vote.  Vote fragmentation could dilute the BNP’s gains unless it manages to unify disparate pro-democracy constituencies.</p><p>Yet the strategic logic behind BNP’s recalibration appears compelling for now.</p><p>The party is no longer positioning itself as a centre-right force competing with the Awami League; it is attempting to transform into a broad democratic platform that absorbs former Awami League voters, urban liberals, minority communities, and politically awakened youth, all searching for a new political home.</p><p>Whether this shift succeeds will depend on how consistently the BNP maintains this new ideological line and whether the public believes that the party’s rupture with Jamaat is a principled decision rather than electoral choreography.</p><p>But what is clear already is that the BNP of 2025 is not the BNP of the past decade. Its leaders are speaking a new language – rooted in inclusiveness, anti-sectarianism, and democratic reform.</p><p>And they are speaking it loudly.</p><p>In breaking with Jamaat and stepping into the ideological ground Awami League once owned, the BNP is reshaping the political landscape of Bangladesh. If the transformation holds, it may become the most consequential realignment in the country’s politics since the early 1990s – an ideological inversion in which the former centre-right party becomes the primary custodian of liberal democratic politics in a post-Hasina Bangladesh.</p></div></div></body></html>"
