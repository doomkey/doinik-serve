Only one of the infections involved a fully vaccinated person.</p><p>Measles, a highly infectious and sometimes deadly virus, was declared eliminated in the US more than 25 years ago. But the past year has presented increasing challenges to maintaining that status.</p><p>Diseases are generally declared eliminated when there is no local transmission in a given region, although cases can still be “imported” from abroad.</p><p>The US’s elimination status is largely credited to the success of the MMR vaccine.</p><p>In 1963, the first measles vaccine was licensed in the US, and by 1971, the combination MMR vaccine was unveiled to protect against the three illnesses at once. Two shots are typically recommended to achieve full vaccination status.</p><p>Initially, in 1978, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) set 1982 as a deadline to achieve the elimination of measles in the country. It missed that target by nearly 18 years, reaching elimination status in 2000.</p><p>But vaccine hesitancy has been blamed for allowing the virus to spread in the US, both then and now.</p><p>While the death rate for measles is relatively low, its infection rate is high. The CDC estimates that, if one person has the virus, they could infect nine out of every 10 people around them.</p><p>The World Health Organization says that, for every 1,000 reported cases, there are about two to three deaths.</p><p>Children are especially vulnerable. Complications can include high fever, hearing or vision loss and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.</p><p>Typically, medical professionals recommend children be vaccinated early in their lives, receiving their first dose before 15 months of age and their second by age six. The vaccine is widely accepted as safe.</p><p>But vaccine scepticism has been on the rise in the US, with critics blaming, in part, policies implemented under the administration of President Donald Trump.</p><p>According to CDC data, the MMR vaccination rate in the US was 95.2 percent among kindergarteners during the 2019-2020 school year.</p><p>That number, however, tumbled to 92.7 percent by the 2023-2024 school year, representing a difference of 280,000 kindergarteners.</p><p>2025 represented a high-water mark in the resurgence of the measles virus. The CDC reported 2,065 cases of measles last year, the most since 1991 — and more than seven times the rate of 2024, when only 285 cases were reported.</p><p>One of the biggest outbreaks took place in Texas, where three people died from the virus, with the first reported last February. Prior to that incident, no death had been reported from measles in the US <a href=\"/news/2025/2/27/us-reports-first-measles-death-since-2015\">since 2015</a>.</p><p>In the wake of that death, Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr <a href=\"/news/2025/3/3/rfk-jr-noted-vaccine-sceptic-backs-measles-jab-amid-deadly-us-outbreak\">encouraged</a> vaccination, <a href=\"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing</a> on social media, “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”</p><p>But Kennedy, who is not a medical professional, has since expressed views that appeared to discourage the vaccine’s use.</p><p>In late April, for instance, he told NewsNation, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles.”</p><p>Experts, however, have denounced that claim as false. While the rubella part of the vaccine was developed using a cell culture that came from an elective abortion in the 1960s, no fetal tissue has been used since, nor is there any fetal issue in the vaccine.</p><p>Kennedy has also spread unfounded claims that purport to link vaccination to autism, despite widespread outcry from the medical community.</p><p>In South Carolina, the current measles outbreak is concentrated in the northwest. The South Carolina Department of Public Health says that the reported infections are largely in children under the age of 17.</p><p>One Democratic candidate running in the state’s 2026 midterm elections, paediatrician Annie Andrews, has made combating the outbreak a central part of her campaign. She hopes to unseat incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, in November’s vote.</p><p>“If you told me back in medical school that someday I would be running for the Senate and my campaign slogan would be ‘It’s me or the measles’ I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT HAVE BELIEVED YOU,” she wrote on social media on Friday.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We’re all buying the things we need to celebrate. And we could have had a significant, significant loss of life, a significant injury here.”</p><p>Ferguson explained that Sturdivant was arrested on New Year’s Eve, the day of his planned attack. The 18-year-old has been charged with “attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation”, and he made his first court appearance on Friday.</p><p>Sturdivant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to Ferguson.</p><p>But during his news conference, Ferguson, an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared to voice frustration with the court system for failing to approve an earlier effort to detain Sturdivant on mental health grounds.</p><p>“ I think it is notable that, as part of their efforts, the FBI took Mr Sturdivant to a state magistrate judge to try to have him involuntarily committed,” Ferguson said.</p><p>“And that was because he had threatened not only other people’s lives, but in the process said that he planned to die by a policeman shooting him. So he had threatened other people’s lives and self-harm, but the state magistrate judge denied involuntary commitment.”</p><p>Authorities later specified that the hearing with the magistrate judge took place on Monday, days before his arrest. Sturdivant, they said, turned 18 last month.</p><h2 id=\"authorities-detail-arrest\">Authorities detail arrest</h2><p>During Friday’s news conference, officials said this week’s arrest was part of a multiyear effort to investigate Sturdivant, whom they described as a “prolific social media user”.</p><p>The suspect had previously been an employee at a local Burger King in North Carolina.</p><p>James Barnacle, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s North Carolina field office, said the suspect first came to the bureau’s attention in 2022, after he tried to contact the armed group ISIL (ISIS) through social media.</p><p>The US considers ISIL a foreign terrorist organisation and has conducted <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/trump-says-us-launched-large-scale-attacks-on-isil-in-syria\">numerous military operations</a> in the Middle East — and one <a href=\"/video/newsfeed/2025/12/26/us-releases-missile-launch-video-after-northwest-nigeria-strike\">recently in Nigeria</a> — on the premise of combating the group.</p><p>Barnacle alleged that Sturdivant received instructions to knock on doors and attack people with hammers, but his initial attempts were thwarted by his family. He was about 14 years old at the time.</p><p>“ No charges were filed at that time,” Barnacle said. “He underwent psychological care, of which I don’t know the details.”</p><p>Then, in December, Barnacle said the FBI discovered that Sturdivant had returned to social media and posted threatening messages.</p><p>He had also allegedly made contact with two undercover officers: one from the New York Police Department and the second a covert agent with the FBI.</p><p>“Within just a few days, Sturdivant direct-messaged the online covert employee with a picture of two hammers and a knife,” Barnacle said. “The message was significant since in recent years an ISIS propaganda magazine promoted the use of knives to conduct terrorist attacks in Western countries.”</p><p>Barnacle added that later messages contained a loyalty oath to ISIL and a request for help obtaining firearms.</p><p>“The JTTF [Joint Terrorism Task Force] collected evidence showing he turned his back on his country and his fellow citizens by pledging allegiance to ISIS with the intent of becoming a martyr,” Barnacle said of the 18-year-old.</p><p>“We allege Sturdivant was willing to sacrifice himself by committing a terrorist attack, using knives and a hammer to support the murder, torture and extreme violence that ISIS represents.”</p><p>An FBI search of his home reportedly recovered hammers and knives hidden under Sturdivant’s bed, as well as notes allegedly detailing his attack plans.</p><p>“I could tell you the FBI had 24/7 surveillance on this subject, all hours of night, Christmas Day, Christmas Eve,” Barnacle said. He described the suspect’s targets as “Jews, Christians and LGBTQ individuals”.</p><p>FBI Director Kash Patel quickly promoted Sturdivant’s arrest on social media, praising his bureau and its partners for “undoubtedly saving lives”.</p><p>The arrest comes one year after a pickup truck driver intentionally rammed his vehicle down Bourbon Street, New Orleans’s famed entertainment district, in a deadly New Year’s Day attack.</p><p>Fourteen people were killed, and authorities recovered an ISIL flag in the truck.</p><p>But critics have questioned the use of undercover agents to make “terrorism-related” arrests with some defence lawyers arguing that agents have encouraged suspects to make incriminating statements or take actions they otherwise would not have.</p><p>Lawyers for the 18-year-old have yet to publicly comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A range of international restrictions means that Tehran is struggling to access international financial markets and frozen foreign assets<strong>.</strong> The country’s increasing reliance on imports is exacerbating the situation and fuelling inflation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/31/we-want-the-mullahs-gone-economic-crisis-sparks-biggest-protests-in-iran-since-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">On Sunday</a>, the Iranian rial dropped to 1.42 million against the US dollar – a 56 percent drop in value in just six months. The plummeting currency has driven inflation with food prices soaring by an average of 72 percent compared with last year.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“If only the government, instead of just focusing on fuel, could bring down the price of other goods,” taxi driver Majid Ebrahimi <a href=\"/video/inside-story/2026/1/1/how-far-will-the-latest-protests-go-in-iran\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told</a> Al Jazeera. “The prices of dairy products have gone up six times this year and other goods more than 10 times.”</p><h2 id=\"these-protests-are-large\">These protests are large</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">What began as a single protest about the collapse of the Iranian economy by shopkeepers in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar on Sunday had spread to <a href=\"https://understandingwar.org/research/middle-east/iran-update-december-31-2025/#:~:text=Small%20protests%20broke%20out%20in,31%2C%20compared%20to%2024%20protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">17 of Iran’s 31 provinces</a> by New Year’s Eve with students and demonstrators from across Iranian society joining the wave of demonstrations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Thousands of people have mobilised across the country with security forces responding forcefully in some places.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Thursday, Iran’s semiofficial Fars news agency reported that three people had died in confrontations between security forces and protesters in Lordegan in southwestern Iran. A further three deaths were reported in Azna and another in Kouhdasht, both in central Iran.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“Some protesters began throwing stones at the city’s administrative buildings, including the provincial governor’s office, the mosque, the Martyrs Foundation, the town hall and banks,” Fars reported of protests in Lordegan, adding that police had responded with tear gas.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4209903\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209903\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4209903\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AFP__20260102__89EV3ZR__v4__HighRes__IranEconomyProtestSecurity-1767364482.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iran protests\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209903\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Images posted on social media on December 31, 2025 show protesters attacking a government building in Fasa in southern Iran during nationwide protests [Screengrab via AFP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"it-s-hard-to-know-how-the-government-will-respond\">It’s hard to know how the government will respond</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Tehran’s previous hardline responses to public unrest have been marked by the deaths of protesters. However, so far, despite a number of isolated clashes between protesters and security forces, Pezeshkian’s government has held back from an outright crackdown and appears ready to listen to the “legitimate demands” of protesters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f079a18-78bc-4e12-b6d5-957526761298\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In an effort</a> to address protesters’ concerns, the government appointed a new governor of the central bank on Wednesday. Abdolnaser Hemmati has pledged to restore economic stability after the rial’s dramatic collapse.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Tuesday, the Ministry of Higher Education removed campus security managers from the University of Tehran and two other major universities. Local media reported that their removal was due to “a record of misconduct and failure to properly handle recent student protests”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking at a ceremony in Tehran on Thursday to mark the assassination of senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander <a href=\"/news/2020/1/3/who-was-qassem-soleimani-irans-irgcs-quds-force-leader\">Qassem Soleimani</a> in a US drone attack five years ago, Pezeshkian also took the opportunity to emphasise his government’s commitment to economic reforms and addressing corruption.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We are determined to eradicate all forms of rent-seeking, smuggling and bribery,” he told attendees. “Those who benefit from these rents will resist and try to create obstacles, but we will continue on this path.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">“We must all stand together to solve the people’s problems and defend the rights of the oppressed and the underprivileged,” he added.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Protecting people’s livelihoods is a “red line” for his government, he declared.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"mass-protests-have-happened-before\">Mass protests have happened before</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Mass protests erupted across Iran in 2022 after the death in custody of 22-year-old <a href=\"/news/2022/10/7/iranian-coroner-denies-mahsa-amini-died-from-blows-to-body\">Mahsa Amini</a>, who was arrested in September that year for not wearing her hijab correctly.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Demonstrations first broke out after Amini’s funeral in the western city of Saqqez when women ripped off their headscarves in solidarity with the dead woman before they <a href=\"/news/2022/9/28/what-we-know-after-11-days-of-protests-in-iran\">spread across much of the country</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Iran’s brutal response to the unrest involved the arbitrary arrest of tens of thousands of people, the extensive use of tear gas, the firing of live ammunition and, according to human rights organisations, the unlawful deaths of hundreds of people.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"/news/2024/3/9/iran-condemns-un-experts-report-on-protest-crackdown-as-false-biased\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A 2024</a> investigation by United Nations experts into the government’s response found that its actions amounted to “crimes against humanity”, a claim rejected by authorities in Tehran as “false” and “biased”.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The so-called morality police were briefly suspended in December 2022 after the protests before being <a href=\"/news/2023/7/16/irans-morality-police-return-as-authorities-enforce-hijab-rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"/news/2023/7/16/irans-morality-police-return-as-authorities-enforce-hijab-rule\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">reinstated</a> the following year.

He posted on his Truth Social platform: “If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On Thursday, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on its <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/fight-against-darkness-foreign-ministry-appears-to-back-iranian-protests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/fight-against-darkness-foreign-ministry-appears-to-back-iranian-protests/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Farsi social media account</a> pre-revolutionary Iranian images of a lion and a sun with the lion’s paw resting on an hourglass featuring the country’s current flag.

According to the UK’s Public Records Act 1958, the government is required to release records of historical value to the National Archives after 20 years.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/news/more-than-600-government-files-released-under-20-year-rule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to</a> the National Archives website, most of the newly added documents relate to the policies implemented by the Blair government between 2004 and 2005, from domestic decisions to ensure the UK would not break up by delegating power to Wales and Scotland, to foreign policy decisions on Iraq and other countries.</p><p>According to UK media reports, the declassified files record that Blair told Antony Phillipson, his private secretary for foreign affairs at the time, that it was “essential” that civil courts did not prosecute British soldiers accused of abusing Iraqi civilians in their custody during the war in Iraq.</p><p>“We have, in effect, to be in a position where the ICC is not involved and neither is CPS (UK Crown Prosecution Service),” he said in a written memo. “That is essential.”<strong> </strong></p><p>According to UK media reports, Blair’s comments followed a written memo Phillipson sent him in July 2005 about a meeting between the country’s attorney general at the time and two former UK military chiefs. He wrote that they had discussed the case of British soldiers who were accused of beating an Iraqi hotel receptionist, <a href=\"/news/2011/9/8/abuse-of-iraqi-by-british-army-appalling\">Baha Mousa</a>, to death.</p><p>Mousa, who was killed in September 2003 in Basra, Iraq, had been in the custody of UK troops.</p><p>According to records among the newly declassified documents, Phillipson told Blair that the case would be one which would end with a court martial. But he added that “if the Attorney General felt that the case was better dealt with in a civil court, he could direct accordingly”.</p><p>“It must not,” Blair stressed.</p><p>Christopher Featherstone, associate lecturer at the Department of Politics, University of York, said: “Blair didn’t want prosecution through international law, and wanted military justice – he saw this as less punitive in the punishments – and he didn’t want the perception that the military couldn’t operate effectively in war zones.”</p><p>Featherstone told Al Jazeera that the Iraq war has become synonymous in UK politics with Blair and his legacy.</p><p>“He [Blair] was convinced that he could persuade the British public of the rightness of the Iraq war, both morally and strategically. However, this became more and more difficult to achieve. As such, he was very concerned about potential prosecution for UK soldiers as this would only amplify opposition to the war, at home and abroad,” he said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4209715\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209715\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4209715\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-828597092-1767356664.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C595&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Blair Iraq\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209715\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Protesters against the war in Iraq gather outside the Houses of Parliament in London, UK, in January 2003 [File: Michael Stephens/PA Images via Getty Images]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-was-the-uk-s-role-in-the-iraq-war\">What was the UK’s role in the Iraq war?</h2><p>The Blair government justified the UK’s decision to support the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 using now-debunked claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The UK said its aim was to eliminate these and to liberate the people of Iraq from the rule of then-President Saddam Hussein.</p><p>In 2003, the US sent more than 100,000 soldiers, the UK sent about 46,000, Australia sent 2,000, and Poland sent about 194 special forces members.</p><p>But there was a great deal of public debate in the UK about the legality of going to war in Iraq on the basis of what was suspected to be flawed evidence about weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>Featherstone, who wrote the book The Road to War in Iraq: Comparative Foreign Policy Analysis, said Blair was “frustrated” by worries from officials about the legality of going to war in Iraq.</p><p>“From the interviews I carried out for my book research, senior military and civil servants were worried about the legality and asked for reassurance from the attorney general. However, Blair was frustrated at all the discussion of the legality of the invasion,” he said.</p><p>“Blair saw the UK role as showing the international support for the US war on terror, and saw his personal role as building the case for the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam,” he added.</p><p>Speaking to the media in July 2016 after the release of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-report-of-the-iraq-inquiry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chilcot report</a> – a British public inquiry into the UK’s role in the Iraq war – Blair said joining the invasion had been “the hardest decision” he had ever taken during his tenure as prime minister.</p><p>The <a href=\"/opinions/2016/7/14/chilcot-report-and-the-delusions-of-western-democracy\">Chilcot report</a> concluded that there had been no “imminent threat” from Saddam Hussein and said the intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was “not justified”.</p><p>Blair acknowledged that the intelligence was wrong but said invading Iraq was nevertheless the “right decision” at the time, as Saddam Hussein was a “threat to world peace”.</p><p>“The world was and is, in my judgement, a better place without Saddam Hussein,” Blair told journalists in reply to the findings of the Chilcot report.</p><p>However, he apologised to families who were bereaved during the war and said that “no words can properly convey the grief and sorrow of those who lost ones they loved in Iraq – whether our armed forces, the armed forces of other nations or Iraqis”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"did-uk-soldiers-abuse-iraqis-during-the-war\">Did UK soldiers abuse Iraqis during the war?</h2><p>There is a large amount of evidence showing that they did.</p><p>Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), have documented cases of UK soldiers abusing hundreds of Iraqi civilians in their custody during the war.</p><p>“Their testimonies [Iraqi civilians] show a pattern of violent beatings, sleep and sensory deprivation, ‘stress positions’, deprivation of food and water, sexual and religious humiliation, and, in some cases, sexual abuse,” the ECCHR <a href=\"https://www.ecchr.eu/en/case/war-crimes-by-uk-forces-in-iraq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in a report in 2020.</p><p>In 2005, three UK soldiers were tried by court martial at a British military base in northern Germany, where photographs showing evidence of the abuses they engaged in had been produced. The soldiers denied the charges but were found guilty of abusing Iraqi civilians during the war and were <a href=\"/news/2005/2/23/british-soldiers-convicted-of-iraq-abuse\">dismissed</a> from the army.</p><p>In 2007, Corporal Donald Payne became the first British soldier to be sentenced. He went to prison for a year after being court-martialled by the army for mistreating Iraqi prisoners during the war.</p><p>Payne was involved in the death of the Iraqi civilian and hotel receptionist Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 after enduring 93 beatings.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-the-icc-intervened\">Has the ICC intervened?</h2><p>In 2005, the ICC <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/iraq#:~:text=The%20Preliminary%20Examination%20into%20Iraq/UK%20was%20initially%20terminated%20on,other%20forms%20of%20ill%2Dtreatment.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">opened</a> an inquiry into the UK’s role in the Iraq war, but closed it in February 2006 when ICC judges agreed that the case did not fall into the top court’s jurisdiction.</p><p>However, the inquiry was reopened in May 2014 by ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda after rights groups submitted evidence of UK soldiers’ systematic abuse, including murder and torture, of Iraqi civilians during the war.</p><p>But in December 2020, Bensouda abandoned the inquiry, saying that while there was “reasonable basis to believe” that “members of the British armed forces committed the war crimes of wilful killing, torture, inhuman/cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and/or other forms of sexual violence”, the UK government had not tried to block investigations into the case.</p><p>In a 184-page report, Bensouda’s office <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-prosecutor-fatou-bensouda-conclusion-preliminary-examination-situation-iraq/united\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> in December 2020: “If shielding had been made out, an investigation by my Office would have been warranted. Following a detailed inquiry, and despite the concerns expressed in its report, the office [of the prosecutor] could not substantiate allegations that the UK investigative and prosecutorial bodies had engaged in shielding [ie, blocking inquiries], based on a careful scrutiny of the information before it.</p><p>“Having exhausted reasonable lines of enquiry arising from the information available, I therefore determined that the only professionally appropriate decision at this stage is to close the preliminary examination and to inform the senders of communications. My decision is without prejudice to a reconsideration based on new facts or evidence,” she added.</p><p>The prosecutor’s decision has been condemned by rights groups.</p><p>“The UK government has repeatedly shown precious little interest in investigating and prosecuting atrocities committed abroad by British troops,” Clive Baldwin, senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch said in a statement in December 2020.</p><p>“The prosecutor’s decision to close her UK inquiry will doubtless fuel perceptions of an ugly double standard in justice, with one approach for powerful states and quite another for those with less clout,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"what-did-blair-say-about-the-icc\">What did Blair say about the ICC?</h2><p>Tuesday’s declassified documents have revealed that Blair was confident the ICC would not prosecute UK soldiers.</p><p>According to the documents, in June 2002, a month before the ICC statute entered into force and about a year before the UK joined the Iraq war, Blair had told John Howard, the Australian prime minister at the time, that countries like the UK had no reason to fear the ICC.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/2024-05/Rome-Statute-eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Rome Statue</a> of the ICC is the top court’s main treaty which states that the ICC has jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for serious crimes including crimes against humanity and engaging in committing a genocide.</p><p>Blair wrote to Howard after officials in Australia expressed fears about the ICC’s jurisdiction, as Australia had also joined the US and UK in the Iraq war.</p><p>But Blair reassured Howard in his letter that the top court “acts only in the case of failed states or where judicial processes have broken down”.</p><p>“We believe that responsible democratic states, where the rule of law is respected, have nothing to fear from the ICC,” he wrote.</p><p>According to UK media reports, Blair’s administration had agreed to sign the ICC’s Rome Statute in 1998 after the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office negotiated with the court that “the court [ICC] may only act when national legal systems are unable or unwilling to do so”.</p><p>“It’s certainly true that the ICC has historically been accused of being biased in terms of where it has focused its attention and effort in investigating and prosecuting cases,” Featherstone said.</p><p>“However, there are some reasons for this around resources for investigating, the ability to bring the cases to fruition, and the relative power of those being accused,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Does that make sense?”</p><p>He added: “They’d rather have me take the smaller one [dose]. I take the larger one, but I’ve done it for years, and what it does do is it causes bruising.”</p><p>Trump told the newspaper that he has been taking the larger dose of aspirin for 25 years.</p><p>Trump is the second oldest person to serve as US president after Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left office in January and pulled out of his re-election campaign in 2024 amid rising concerns about his health.</p><p>Concerns about Trump’s health have also arisen after bruises were spotted on his hands in the summer.</p><p>In July, Trump was diagnosed with <a href=\"/news/2025/7/18/what-is-chronic-venous-insufficiency-how-serious-is-trumps-condition\">chronic venous insufficiency</a>, which White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt described as a “benign and common condition” in which damaged veins prevent blood from flowing properly.</p><p>Leavitt said the bruises were “consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen”.</p><p>Additionally, in October, it was reported that Trump had undergone an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. The White House said the MRI was “preventative”.</p><p>The WSJ report, however, stated that Trump and his doctor said he had received a CT (computed tomography) scan, not an MRI.</p><p>“It was less than that. It was a scan,” Trump said.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-aspirin\">What is aspirin?</h2><p>Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It has antiplatelet, or blood-thinning, properties.</p><p>It can be bought over the counter or prescribed by a doctor. It is usually prescribed for pain, fever and inflammation caused by immune responses to infections.</p><p>Additionally, low doses are prescribed to people at risk of heart attacks and strokes because it helps prevent blood clots from forming. It does this by inhibiting the production of a substance called thromboxane A2 within platelets, which are the blood cells responsible for clotting.</p><p>Thromboxane signals the platelets to clump together. When there is less thromboxane in the system, there is a lower chance of blood clots and a lower chance of heart attacks or strokes, which happen when blood flow is blocked to the heart and brain, respectively, by clots.</p><h2 id=\"does-aspirin-produce-side-effects\">Does aspirin produce side effects?</h2><p>Common side effects of aspirin use include mild indigestion and bleeding more than usual, according to the website for the National Health Service (NHS), the United Kingdom’s publicly funded healthcare system.</p><p>The website recommends contacting a doctor in case of serious side effects, such as coughing up blood or the whites of the eyes turning yellow.</p><p>Aspirin can also cause ulcers in the stomach or gut if it is taken for a long time or in high doses, according to the NHS.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-normal-daily-dose-of-aspirin\">What is the ‘normal’ daily dose of aspirin?</h2><p>According to the NHS, aspirin is usually available in 300mg tablets and the usual dosage for headaches and other pain or fever is one or two tablets, taken every four to six hours.</p><p>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that adults aged 40 to 59 at risk of cardiovascular disease start treatment with a much lower dose of aspirin of 81mg per day.</p><p><span>The USPSTF is an independent panel of experts that reviews medical evidence and issues recommendations on preventive health services, such as screenings, counselling and medicines.</span></p><p>The panel says the cardiovascular benefit of taking aspirin diminishes in older adults as the risk of excessive bleeding increases with age.</p><p>“For patients who are eligible and choose to start taking aspirin, the benefits become smaller with advancing age, and data suggest that clinicians and patients should consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years,” the USPSTF says.</p><p>The health information website Healthline states that doctors may recommend a daily dose of 81mg to 325mg for people who have had or are at risk of conditions that include heart attacks and strokes.</p><h2 id=\"can-you-take-too-much-aspirin\">Can you take too much aspirin?</h2><p>A Healthline article reviewed by clinical pharmacist Dr Alan Carter states that people can experience aspirin poisoning if they take more aspirin than their body can clear.</p><p>There can be mild, moderate or severe forms of this, depending on the amount of aspirin and a person’s body weight.</p><p>Mild poisoning can take place if a person has taken less than 300mg of aspirin per kilogramme of body weight in one go.</p><p>Moderate poisoning takes place if a person has ingested 300mg to 500mg of aspirin per kilogramme of body weight in one go. Severe poisoning takes place when the aspirin exceeds 500mg per kilogramme of body weight.</p><p>Based on these numbers, if a man weighing 90kg took 45,000mg of aspirin in a single dose, it would likely be life-threatening.</p><p>However, “chronic” toxicity can also occur in someone who regularly takes aspirin for a long period of time, depending on how well their kidneys and liver are able to process it.</p><p>Symptoms of aspirin overdose include burning throat pain, decreased urination, double vision, drowsiness, fever, hallucinations, nervousness, restlessness, ringing in the ears or inability to hear, seizures, stomach pain, uncontrollable shaking and vomiting.</p><p>An aspirin overdose can cause death within one day.  An overdose can make blood dangerously acidic, disrupting the body’s regular functioning. It can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, making it hard to breathe. It can increase body temperature and cause the heart, kidneys and other organs to fail.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>When rumours about a ceasefire started circulating in October, it felt like a distant dream. We clung to any thread of hope, even though deep inside we feared believing it. For two years, we had become accustomed to hearing about “ceasefires” that never lasted.</p><p>When the announcement was finally made, the streets erupted with ululations and cheers. Yet, fear crept into my heart that this calm might just be a pause before another round of attacks.</p><p>My fears were justified. Israel’s daily deadly attacks have continued; more than 400 people have been killed so far by its army. Many others have died in circumstances caused by Israel’s decimation of the Strip.</p><p>And yet the level of global attention began to decline. In November, I noticed that engagement with what I wrote about Gaza started to diminish, whether on social media or media outlets – something other Palestinian journalists and writers also observed. The world’s interest waned because the global public was easily convinced that the war had ended.</p><p>It became clear to me that the real goal of the ceasefire was not to stop the violence or death, nor to protect people or limit bloodshed and genocide. The real goal was to stop the world from talking about Gaza, about the crimes being committed there, and about the daily suffering of people.</p><p>Gaza has now become mostly invisible, as other news and other “hot spots” have taken the global media spotlight.</p><p>Meanwhile, mass death continues.</p><p>A little more than two weeks after the ceasefire was announced, on October 28, the Israeli army carried out a huge bombing campaign, killing 104 people. The overwhelming fear for the future and for my loved ones returned.</p><p>On November 20, Israel struck closer to my heart. The Israeli army attacked the home of the Abu Shawish family in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. My friend Batoul Abu Shawish lost her whole family – her sisters Habiba, 11, and Tima, 16; her brothers Youssef, 14, and Mohammed, 18; and her mum, Sahar, 43, and dad, Rami, 50. They were massacred despite the fact that the family had no political affiliation; they were all civilians. Batoul now has to face the genocide alone.</p><p>The Israeli attacks continue, and so does mass death by other means: Collapsed buildings, unexploded bombs, floods, hypothermia, starvation and illness – all creations of the Israeli genocidal strategy. We continue to struggle with no proper shelter or food, no heating, electricity or potable water.</p><p>The situation is so bad that winter itself is killing people.</p><p>We just had <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/tents-flooded-by-heavy-rains-in-gaza-amid-calls-for-israel-to-let-in-aid\">another storm</a>. Tents were flooded and blown off again. Thirty-year-old Alaa Juha was killed by a wall that the rain collapsed onto her. Two-month-old baby Arkan Musleh died from hypothermia. In total, <a href=\"/news/2025/12/28/gaza-storm-kills-palestinian-woman-as-israeli-curbs-on-aid-compoun\">15 have died</a> from the cold weather this month. My family’s tent was flooded again; it is hard to describe the feeling of helplessness that overwhelms you when you can find no escape from the water and the freezing cold.</p><p>Israel continues to violate the ceasefire not only with its attacks but with its refusal to comply with its obligation to allow in the negotiated number of aid trucks, a full supply of necessary medicines and tents, shelter materials and mobile homes.</p><p>Israel is also curbing access to international organisations that try to provide some relief for the people of Gaza. New rules are making it hard for NGOs to register, including some as big as Save the Children. This, along with Israel’s continuous denial of requests to bring in aid by NGOs, is stifling international efforts to provide some relief to us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Palestinian organisations that try to ease our suffering are facing a collapse of donations. For example, the Samir Project, a donations-based initiative that provides material support for impoverished families and students, has lost a large number of individual donors and followers after the ceasefire was announced. Dr Ezzedine al-Lulu, the project’s director, confirmed to me that the decreased flow of donations has hindered their ability to provide essential assistance.</p><p>Israel is also keeping the Rafah border closed. There is no opportunity to travel outside unless you pay an exorbitant amount of money to <a href=\"/opinions/2025/11/16/israel-cant-fly-us-all-out-to-south-africa\">Israeli-linked war profiteers</a> and agree to never return. More than 16,000 people who urgently need medical evacuation are prevented by Israel from leaving; more than 1,000 have died waiting to be allowed to leave.</p><p>Gaza has entered a new stage of genocide – low-grade mass killing which does not make headlines because it is not as explosive as carpet-bombing campaigns. But the ultimate result is the same: The extermination of Palestinian life in Gaza. It is no wonder that Israeli politicians have not stopped talking about colonising our land. They still see Gaza free of Palestinians as a very real possibility that is within reach.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Forced into silence. Our words were redacted. Our letters were stamped secret. Lawyers were blocked. Time stretched and rotted. No court dates were given. No real charges were made.</p><p>I was reduced to a number in an orange uniform, locked in a metal cage. The US government had already named me. “The worst of the worst.” “Terrorist.” “Enemy combatant.” Labels designed to make torture sound necessary.</p><p>And torture came. Day and night. Relentless. Mechanical. Meant to break the mind first, then the body. So I stopped eating. Not as a gesture. Not as a plea. I stopped because everything else had been taken from me. My body was the only territory this foreign state hadn’t yet occupied.</p><p>A hunger strike is not symbolic. It is not dramatic. That’s a lie sold by the media, by people who have never watched a body collapse from the inside, who turn slow death into headlines and panels and clean sentences.</p><p>A hunger strike is a slow, painful journey towards death. It dismantles you piece by piece. Muscles shrink. Vision fades. The heart falters. Organs begin to fail. Every beat is a warning. Every hour drags you closer to death, whether you want it or not.</p><p>A hunger strike begins when every other door is slammed shut. When the system makes it clear your life has no value, as long as you stay quiet and obedient. When it looks straight at you and tells you you’re already dead.</p><p>So you answer with your body.</p><p>At least <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/pro-palestine-activists-target-uk-labour-offices-over-hunger-strikers\">eight imprisoned pro-Palestine activists</a> in the UK have refused food. One has been on hunger strike for more than two months. Others have passed 50 days without eating. Some have already been taken to hospital. They are scattered across prisons, cut off from each other, torn from their families, buried under the word “terrorist” so cruelty can be dressed up as law.</p><p>They are <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/heba-muraisi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heba Muraisi</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/qesser-zuhrah/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qesser Zurah</a>, <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/12/31/live-israels-ban-on-aid-organisations-in-gaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amu Gib</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/teuta-hoxha/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Teuta Hoxha</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/kamran-ahmed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kamran Ahmed</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/lewie-chiaramello/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lewie Chiaramello</a>, <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/jon-cink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jon Cink</a>, and <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/prisoner/umer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Umer Khalid.</a></p><figure id=\"attachment_4209607\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4209607\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4209607\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/photo_2025-12-25_10-46-11-1767352273.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A room with poster with photos of 8 Palestine Action hunger strikers\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4209607\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos of the eight Pal Action hunger strikers are displayed during an event in Rome, Italy on December 13, 2025 [Courtesy of Mansoor Adayfi]</figcaption></figure><p>United Nations human rights experts have expressed grave concern for hunger strikers’ lives. They warned the activists face heightened risks of organ failure, neurological damage, and death without proper medical care and called on the UK government to ensure timely emergency care, to engage with the activists’ demands and to address rights issues linked to prolonged pretrial detention and restrictions on protest activity.</p><p>I have been inside this story before. Violent words are meant to strip you of your humanity so the public doesn’t have to feel the sting of your suffering.</p><p>When Jeremy Corbyn raised the hunger strike in Parliament, some MPs laughed. Laughed. Not whispers. Not quiet discomfort. But open mockery. Smirks from padded seats while people’s bodies were breaking down in cells. While people were collapsing, being dragged to hospital wards, organs failing. This is untouchable power.</p><p>David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, has dodged meeting the families of the hunger strikers. He has avoided even the barest human gesture of listening. Cowardice wrapped in protocol. This is deliberate contempt.</p><p>In 1981, during the Irish hunger strike, men were dying in prison cells while politicians dismissed them as criminals, attention-seekers, terrorists. The mockery came first. The jokes. The coldness. The refusal to engage. Then came the funerals. Power always laughs before it kills. Humour becomes a shield for cowardice.</p><p>Nothing has changed. The accents are different. The suits are better tailored. The cruelty is the same.</p><p>This is not democracy. This is rot at the centre of the state.</p><p>We were held for years in Guantanamo without charges, without evidence, without a path to release. In the UK today, people are kept on extended remand, sometimes for years, while trial dates are pushed further away. Time itself becomes the punishment. Time becomes a weapon. A weapon against prisoners and their families.</p><p>Isolation comes next.</p><p>In Guantanamo, isolation was designed to break us. Months, sometimes years, without meaningful human contact. Silence so heavy it pressed against your skull. A silence meant to erase you. <a href=\"https://prisonersforpalestine.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In UK prisons, hunger strikers</a> are separated. Transferred. Harassed. Stripped of routine, stripped of connection. Isolation is framed as safety. It is not. It is punishment. It is control.</p><p>Then comes censorship. Letters delayed. Phone calls cut short. Visits restricted. Information filtered. Families left in the dark. Lawyers forced to fight for the barest access. At Guantanamo, every word leaving the camp was monitored. In the UK, the same instinct survives. Control the narrative. Control the person.</p><p>Then comes medical coercion. In Guantanamo, hunger strike was met with force. Shackles. Restraint chairs. Tubes forced through noses into stomachs while guards pinned our limbs. They called it medical care. It was violence. Pure, deliberate, crushing violence designed to make resistance unbearable.</p><p>The UK likes to pretend Guantanamo was an American mistake. Something distant. Something finished. It was not. It was a laboratory. The experiments were exported. Absorbed. Normalised. And now, they are applied inside their prisons.</p><p>You see it in the extended remand.</p><p>You see it in the proscription laws twisted to criminalise protest.</p><p>You see it in prisons used as warehouses, places to store people indefinitely while the state takes its time building a case.</p><p>And you see it in the quiet cooperation between systems. Guantanamo fed the black sites. Black sites fed domestic counterterror policing. The same logic shows up again and again. In places like Alligator Alcatraz in Florida. In British prisons holding political activists under terrorism laws. Different flags. Same playbook.</p><p>Abuse travels faster than accountability.</p><p>I have watched governments study each other. Share techniques. Refine the language. Learn how to cage people legally. How to stretch the law without snapping it. How to crush dissent while calling it order.</p><p>This is not about agreeing with the politics of the prisoners. This is about whether a state is allowed to disappear people before trial, isolate them, censor them, then punish them for refusing to cooperate with their own erasure. If the UK wants to claim it is nothing like Guantanamo, then it has to prove it with action.</p><p>End prolonged remand without trial.</p><p>End isolation as a response to protest.</p><p>Restore full access to lawyers and families.</p><p>Provide medical care that protects life, not policies that quietly endanger it.</p><p>Listen to the hunger strikers. Meet their families face to face.</p><p>Abolish the terror laws used to criminalise dissent, stretch guilt by association, and disappear people behind language instead of evidence.</p><p>Force members of parliament to step out of silence and take responsibility.</p><p>These are not radical demands. They are the bare minimum. The floor, not the ceiling, for any society that claims to respect human rights.</p><p>I am not writing this as an observer. I am writing as someone who has already lived the ending. I am telling you plainly, without euphemism and without distance. Systems like this do not correct themselves. They do not slow down out of shame. They only stop when they are confronted, directly and without fear. Now.</p><p>I refuse to be silent. I am joining this hunger strike in solidarity. I do this because I recognise the system at work. I do this because I know Guantanamo did not end, it spread. It embedded itself in other prisons, other laws, other governments that tell themselves they are better. I do this because standing with the oppressed against the oppressor is not symbolic for me. It is a responsibility earned through survival. I do this because I am able to, and because doing nothing would make me complicit.</p><p>This hunger strike is not about food. It is about dignity. It is about justice. It is about remand used as punishment, silence used as policy, and a state that believes if it waits long enough, people will break and disappear. It believes silence will protect it, shield it, absolve it. It will not.</p><p>I stand with the hunger strikers. I will not look away. I will not soften this. I will not be polite about slow death carried out in clean buildings and legal language.</p><p>And I will not let them be erased. Free the hungers strikers!</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Their chants echoed past murals that do not merely decorate the city, but testify to its troubled past.</p><p data-start=\"1148\" data-end=\"1509\">Along the Falls Road, Irish republican murals sit beside Palestinian ones. The International Wall, once a rolling canvas of global struggles, has become known as the Palestinian wall. Poems by the late Palestinian writer Refaat Alareer, killed in an Israeli air strike in December 2023, run across its length. Images sent by Palestinian artists have been painted by local hands.</p><p data-start=\"1511\" data-end=\"1884\">More recently, new words have appeared on Belfast’s famed walls. “Blessed are those who hunger for justice.” Painted alongside long-familiar images of Irish republican prisoners like Bobby Sands are new names now written into the city’s political conscience: the four pro-Palestinian activists currently on hunger strike in British prisons, their bodies weakening as the days stretch on.</p><p data-start=\"1886\" data-end=\"2100\">“This is not a city that will ever accept any attempt to silence our voice or our right to protest or our right to stand up for human rights,” said Patricia McKeown, a trade union activist who spoke at the protest.</p><p data-start=\"2102\" data-end=\"2353\">“These young people are being held unjustly and in ridiculous conditions – and they have taken the ultimate decision to express their views … and most particularly on what’s happening to people in Palestine – why would we not support that?” she asked.</p><h2 id=\"a-hunger-strike-reaches-belfast\">A hunger strike reaches Belfast</h2><p data-start=\"2392\" data-end=\"2852\">The protest in Belfast is part of a growing international campaign urging the British government to intervene as the health of four detainees deteriorates behind prison walls. All are affiliated with Palestine Action and are being held on remand while awaiting trial, a process campaigners say could keep them imprisoned for more than a year before their cases are heard. With legal avenues exhausted, supporters say the hunger strike has become a last resort.</p><p>The Palestine Action members are being held over their <a href=\"/news/2025/7/4/palestine-action-what-has-the-group-done-as-it-faces-a-ban\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alleged involvement in break-ins</a> at the United Kingdom subsidiary of Elbit Systems in Filton near Bristol, where equipment was reportedly damaged, and at a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, where two military aircraft were sprayed with red paint. The prisoners deny the charges against them, which include burglary and violent disorder.</p><p data-start=\"2854\" data-end=\"3050\"><a href=\"/news/2026/1/1/who-are-the-palestine-action-hunger-strikers\">The prisoners</a> are demanding release on bail, an end to what they describe as interference with their mail and reading materials, access to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action. In July, the British government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer banned Palestine Action under a controversial anti-terrorism law.</p><p data-start=\"3052\" data-end=\"3359\">Heba Muraisi is on day 61 without food. Teuta Hoxha is on day 55. Kamran Ahmed on day 54. Lewie Chiaramello on day 41. Hoxha and Ahmed have already been hospitalised. Campaigners describe it as the largest hunger strike in Britain since 1981, one they say is explicitly inspired by the Irish hunger strikes.</p><p data-start=\"3361\" data-end=\"3739\">In 1981, Irish Republican Army and other republican prisoners went on hunger strike in Northern Ireland, demanding the restoration of their political status. Ten men died, including their leader, Bobby Sands, who was elected to the British parliament during the strike. Margaret Thatcher took a hardline public stance, but behind the scenes, the government ultimately sought a way out as public opinion shifted.</p><p data-start=\"3741\" data-end=\"3918\">One prisoner, 29-year-old Martin Hurson, died on the 46th day. Others, including Raymond McCreesh, Francis Hughes, Michael Devine and Joe McDonnell, died between days 59 and 61. Sands died after 66 days on a hunger strike.</p><p data-start=\"3920\" data-end=\"4002\">Sue Pentel, a member of Jews for Palestine Ireland, remembers that period vividly.</p><p data-start=\"4004\" data-end=\"4224\">“I was here during the hunger strike,” she said. “I went through the hunger strikes, marched, demonstrated, held meetings, protested, so I remember the callous brutality of the British government letting 10 hungers die.”</p><p data-start=\"4226\" data-end=\"4444\">“The words of Bobby Sands, which are ‘Our revenge will be the laughter of our children’. And we raised our families here, and they’re the same people, this new generation who are standing in solidarity with Palestine.”</p><h2 id=\"if-this-continues-some-will-die\">‘If this continues, some will die’</h2><p data-start=\"4486\" data-end=\"4680\">Standing beneath a mural of Bobby Sands, Pat Sheehan fears history is edging dangerously close to repeating itself. He spent 55 days on a hunger strike before it was called off on October 3, 1981.</p><p data-start=\"4682\" data-end=\"4819\">“I was the longest on that hunger strike when it came to an end in 1981, so in theory I would have been the next person to die,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"4821\" data-end=\"4918\">By that stage, he said, his liver was failing. His eyesight had gone. He vomited bile constantly.</p><p data-start=\"4920\" data-end=\"5105\">“Once you pass 40 days, you’re entering the danger zone,” Sheehan said. “Physically, the hunger strikers must be very weak now for those who have been on hunger strike for over 50 days.”</p><p data-start=\"5107\" data-end=\"5266\">“Mentally, if they have prepared properly to go on hunger strike, their psychological strength will increase the longer the hunger strike goes on.”</p><p data-start=\"5268\" data-end=\"5349\">“I think if it continues, inevitably some of the hunger strikers are going to die.”</p><p data-start=\"5351\" data-end=\"5581\">Sheehan, who now represents West Belfast as an MLA for Sinn Fein, believes that Palestine Action-linked hunger strikers are political prisoners, adding that people in Ireland understand Palestine in a way few Western countries do.</p><p data-start=\"5583\" data-end=\"5791\">“Ireland is probably the one country in Western Europe where there’s almost absolute support for the Palestinian cause,” he said. “Because we have a similar history of colonisation; of genocide and detention.”</p><p data-start=\"5793\" data-end=\"5890\">“So when Irish people see on their TV screens what’s happening in Gaza, there’s massive empathy.”</p><h2 id=\"ireland-s-stance\">Ireland’s stance</h2><p data-start=\"5914\" data-end=\"6160\">That empathy has increasingly translated into political action. Ireland formally recognised the state of Palestine in 2024 and has joined South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice, alleging genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel denies.</p><p data-start=\"6162\" data-end=\"6400\">The Irish government has also taken steps to restrict the sale of Israeli bonds, while Ireland has boycotted the Eurovision Song Contest over Israel’s participation and called for its national football team to be suspended from international competition.</p><p data-start=\"6162\" data-end=\"6400\">But many campaigners say the government’s actions have not gone far enough. They argue that the Occupied Territories Bill, which seeks to ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements, has been stalled since 2018, and express anger that United States military aircraft transporting weapons to Israel are still permitted to pass through Ireland’s <a href=\"https://www.ontheditch.com/state-admits/\">Shannon Airport</a>.</p><p data-start=\"6402\" data-end=\"6506\">Meanwhile, in the northern part of Ireland that remains part of Britain, the war in Gaza has dominated domestic politics.</p><p data-start=\"6508\" data-end=\"6788\">The Stormont Assembly was thrown into crisis after Democratic Unionist Party education minister Paul Givan travelled to Jerusalem on a trip paid for by the Israeli government, prompting a no-confidence vote amid fierce criticism from Irish republican, nationalist, left-wing and unaligned political groups.</p><p data-start=\"6790\" data-end=\"6941\">Belfast City Hall’s decision last month to fly a Palestinian flag was also fervently opposed by unionist councillors before it was eventually approved.</p><p data-start=\"6943\" data-end=\"7120\">For some loyalist and unionist groups, support for Israel has become entwined with loyalty to Britain, with Israeli flags also flying in traditionally loyalist parts of Belfast.</p><p data-start=\"7122\" data-end=\"7262\">With a legacy of identity rooted along sectarian lines, the genocide in Gaza has at times been recast along the old fault lines of division.</p><h2 id=\"solidarity-reaches-palestine\">‘Solidarity reaches Palestine’</h2><p data-start=\"7300\" data-end=\"7418\">Yet on the streets of Belfast, protesters insist their solidarity is not rooted in national identity, but in humanity.</p><p data-start=\"7420\" data-end=\"7574\">Damien Quinn, 33, a member of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, said hunger strikes had always carried a particular weight in Ireland.</p><p data-start=\"7576\" data-end=\"7741\">“We are here today to support the hunger strikers in Britain. But we are also here for the Palestinian people for those being slaughtered every single day,” he said.</p><p data-start=\"7743\" data-end=\"7877\">Palestine Action, he said, “made it very clear they have tried signing petitions, they have tried lobbying, they’ve tried everything”.</p><p data-start=\"7879\" data-end=\"7991\">“So when I see the way they are being treated in prison, for standing up against genocide, that’s heartbreaking.”</p><p data-start=\"7993\" data-end=\"8111\">For Rita Aburahma, 25, a Palestinian who has found a home in Belfast, the hunger strike carries a painful familiarity.</p><p data-start=\"8113\" data-end=\"8213\">“My people don’t have the luxury of speaking out, being in Palestine – solidarity matters,” she said.</p><p data-start=\"8215\" data-end=\"8434\">“I find the hunger strikers are really brave – it’s always been a form of resistance. It does concern me, and many other people, how long it has taken the government to pay attention to them, or take action in any form.</p><p data-start=\"8436\" data-end=\"8673\">“Nothing will save those people if the government doesn’t do something about them. So it is shocking in a way, but not that surprising because the same government has been watching the genocide unfold and escalate without doing anything.</p><p data-start=\"8675\" data-end=\"8734\">“Every form of solidarity reaches the people in Palestine.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
