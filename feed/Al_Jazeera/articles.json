            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>At the transit camp in Islam Qala in western Afghanistan, Fatima steps out of the bus into the blazing heat and an uncertain future. She is one of 10,000 people who has arrived from Iran that day and one of 800,000 who has arrived over the last six months. She hurries her three children to an empty spot, slumps onto the dusty ground, and shelters her family with bed sheets. When asked where she goes from here, she says a brother might take them in in her home town.</p><p>The IFRC supports the Afghan Red Crescent Society to provide hot food and healthcare at the camp. UN agencies provide some cash. But within a day, it’s time to leave. Bus drivers call out the names of Afghan cities and towns. Fatima lugs her cases towards a bus to Owbeh, in Herat province. Her three children trail behind her. She explains that she learned carpet weaving in Iran, but wasn’t allowed to bring any materials or instruments with her. How can she start from scratch without money, she asks. And who would buy her carpets in her village anyway? They have nothing. Not even to eat.</p><p>The departure from Iran has been traumatic, but her real challenges start now. When she arrives in her hometown, there will be no jobs in the public sector for her. Men will be reluctant to hire her because of the rules and regulations associated with employing women. Her one chance to cope will be to get her own enterprise going. For that, she’ll need start-up capital. She may also need assistance from her brother to access markets. It will be a struggle, but increasing numbers of Afghan women are rising to this challenge. Fatima could, too. If only she could get access to credit.</p><p>But will anyone in her community be able to buy her products? Like most Afghans, her neighbours will largely depend on agriculture, which will depend on irrigation and rain. In much of Herat province, and across the country, irrigation is becoming impossible because of drought. Rivers are dust. Underground water sources are drying up. With no possibility to farm, men are pouring into the cities in search of daily labour, only to find the battle for water is raging there, too. Mercy Corps has claimed that half of the boreholes in Kabul have dried out and the city could run out of accessible groundwater in five years. This trajectory could be slowed down or reversed, but only with major investment in water conservation, rain vats, storage dams, and check dams. Just the sort of investment that Afghanistan is struggling to raise.</p><p>If Fatima can earn a little money and live close to water, then she can focus on her children’s schooling. Her daughter will have to attend a madrassa. This will be a significant downgrade from her education in Iran. But if she’s lucky, it will be one of the many madrassas that are already introducing more varied subjects and offering classes until 12th grade. If she’s resourceful and can invest some funds, there may be other options too, including vocational training and online courses. The restrictions she will have to navigate are extreme, but not new. They reflect a long-running struggle between cities and the countryside, between desires for self-realisation and deeply rooted patriarchy. Foreign aid may help by quietly creating multiple and flexible opportunities to exchange and learn, while recognising that the ideological battles are for the Afghans themselves and will take time. Some organisations are trying to do this, but not to scale.</p><p>It will take a lot of luck for Fatima to get investment in her social enterprise, to access clean drinking water and to get an education for her children. The alternative is grim, and sadly, much more likely. Like most new arrivals, she will probably be destitute within weeks. She won’t access the rare opportunities for business support. Lack of water will empty the villages around her. If she stays put, her health will fail. Medical care will be too far to reach or too expensive. She may be forced to marry her daughter off early and nudge her boys away from school into some cheap, daily labour. This is what is happening across the country. If she can, to avoid such a terrible fate, she will try to get back to Iran.</p><p>Can foreign aid play a role in supporting Fatima and the millions like her? Despite all the reservations, humanitarian funding has been generous in the last four years. More than $7bn has been spent on assistance. Enough to have helped tens of thousands of women to start small businesses. Enough to have irrigated farms, deepened bore holes and stored water across the country. Enough to have created thousands of alternative learning options for children. Humanitarian agencies have tried to assist in all these areas, but the demand for emergency relief has taken the bulk of the funds, and many donors have been reticent to invest in anything longer term for fear of appearing to legitimise those in power.</p><p>The need for a new approach is compelling. There is less money available now due to aid cuts, but what little is left can still be invested into locally led strategies for livelihoods, water infrastructure, health and learning. This may give people like Fatima a spark of hope in their futures. This is what IFRC will focus on, as much as its resources allow.</p><p>If the moral case for that is not compelling enough, it is worth reflecting that on the current trajectory, the historic repatriation to Afghanistan taking place this year is likely to be a prelude to a much bigger exodus in the years to come. It would be far wiser to invest now and give people a chance to thrive in their home country than to invest much more in refugee camps and anti-trafficking work in the near future.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He remained sanguine about China.</p><p>“Just to tamp down that rhetoric, the meetings were very constructive. We just haven’t given the sign off,” he said.</p><p>Bessent stressed that “nothing is agreed until we speak with President Trump”.</p><p>The treasury secretary and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were due to brief Trump on Wednesday about the Stockholm discussions, he added.</p><p><span>Bessent also said that, given US <a href=\"/news/2025/7/15/trump-threatens-tariffs-in-50-days-what-harm-will-it-do-to-russia\">secondary tariff legislation</a> on sanctioned Russian oil, China could face high tariffs if Beijing continued with its Russian oil purchases. </span></p><p>Similarly, the US recently announced an <a href=\"/news/2025/7/30/trump-hits-india-with-25-tariff-extra-penalty-for-russian-oil-purchases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unspecified penalty for India’s purchase of Russian oil</a>, on top of a 25 percent tariff on Indian exports.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-are-the-central-issues-in-the-trade-talks\">What are the central issues in the trade talks?</h2><p>Technology exports, specifically <a href=\"/news/2025/5/30/from-students-to-tech-how-us-china-ties-are-sliding-despite-tariff-truce\">chips used for artificial intelligence</a>, are understood to have been at the centre of this week’s talks. In particular, US security officials have raised concerns that high-tech American semiconductor chips could be used by China’s military.</p><p>In April, Trump was poised to block the export of Nvidia’s H20 chip, which has been designed to comply with Biden-era export curbs. But Trump reversed course following direct appeals from Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang.</p><p>In the run-up to this week’s talks, the UK’s Financial Times newspaper reported that Washington had frozen restrictions on technology sales to China to ease negotiations and to avoid retaliation from Beijing in the form of export restrictions on rare earth minerals, as happened in May.</p><p><a href=\"/economy/2025/6/12/why-chinas-rare-earth-exports-are-a-key-issue-in-trade-tensions-with-us\">Rare earths</a> are a group of 17 elements essential to numerous manufacturing industries, from auto parts to clean energy technology to military hardware. They are also a central issue for trade talks.</p><p>China has long dominated the mining and processing of rare earth minerals, as well as the production of related components, like rare earth magnets.</p><p>China’s hold over the industry has been a <a href=\"/economy/2025/6/12/why-chinas-rare-earth-exports-are-a-key-issue-in-trade-tensions-with-us\">key concern for US trade representatives</a> since Donald Trump’s return to the White House.</p><p> </p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-state-of-us-china-trade-before-the-recent-truce\">What was the state of US-China trade before the recent truce?</h2><p>For years, Trump has criticised Beijing for what he deems to be unfair trade practices – namely, import quotas, government subsidies and tax breaks. He has even argued that <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/tariff-wars-has-donald-trump-killed-the-wto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the US’s trade deficit with China</a>, which snowballed to $20 trillion between 1974 and 2024, constitutes a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/what-legal-tests-are-donald-trumps-tariffs-facing\">national emergency</a>.</p><p>When Trump <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2025/4/9/trump-tariffs-stocks-dive-as-world-braces-for-duties-to-begin-at-midnight\">paused</a> reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries on April 9, he made an exception for China. Beijing, in turn, retaliated with import levies of its own.</p><p>Tit-for-tat exchanges quickly snowballed into eye-watering sums. By April 11, US tariffs on Chinese goods had reached 145 percent, while duties on US products entering China had swelled to 125 percent.</p><p>Tensions were defused in May, when Bessent and He Lifeng agreed to a truce which slashed respective tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months.</p><p>For now, US duties on Chinese products are set at 30 percent while China’s tariffs on the US have dropped to 10 percent.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>This week’s talks may pave the way for a potential meeting between Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later in the year, although on Tuesday, Trump <a href=\"/news/2025/7/29/trump-denies-seeking-summit-with-xi-says-he-may-visit-china\">denied</a> going out of his way to seek one.</p><p>For Thomas Sampson, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics, a face-to-face meeting has “the potential to be significant”. Equally though, it could be “a grip-and-grin style summit, where nothing substantive is discussed”, he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Sampson added that US-China negotiations are more complex than those with other Asian countries, owing to China’s grip on rare earth minerals, in addition to the fact that China “has long been a target of Trump’s”.</p><p>For now, Sampson said he believes that the “mood around the [Sweden] talks seems more positive than earlier this year. Both sides, it seems, have stepped back from the brink”. His expectation is for a “more restrained trade war” than before, if one is to resume.</p><p>On Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said trade talks with China were “moving in the right direction” and that Washington remains in “direct communication” with Beijing.</p><h2 id=\"what-other-trade-deals-has-trump-concluded-in-recent-weeks\">What other trade deals has Trump concluded in recent weeks?</h2><p>On top of Trump’s Thursday tariff blitz, the latest US-China talks come after Washington struck deals with both the EU and <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/23/trump-announces-massive-trade-deal-with-japan\">Japan</a> last week.</p><p>Last Sunday, Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a trade agreement, ending a months-long standoff between two economic giants.</p><p>The EU accepted a 15 percent tariff on most of its exports, while the bloc’s average tariff rate on US goods will drop below 1 percent once the deal goes into effect.</p><p>Brussels also said it would purchase $750bn in American energy products and invest $600bn more into the US, on top of existing commercial agreements.</p><p>France’s Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said the EU had capitulated to Trump’s trade threats, labelling the deal struck on Sunday as a “dark day” for the EU.</p><p>Elsewhere, the US has also struck tariff deals with <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/31/trump-announces-trade-deal-with-south-korea-setting-tariff-at-15-percent\">South Korea</a>, <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/15/trump-announces-19-percent-tariff-on-indonesia\">Indonesia</a>, <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-secures-trade-deal-with-vietnam-as-negotiations-continue-with-s-korea\">Vietnam</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/7/22/trump-sets-19-tariff-on-philippines-in-new-trade-deal\">the Philippines</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

A 30 percent combined tariff will, however, be applied, following an agreed pause until August 12. That followed an earlier escalation to a 145 percent tariff on imports.</p><h2 id=\"taiwan\">Taiwan</h2><p>Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te has called its 20 percent tariff announced by Trump “temporary … with the possibility of further reductions should an agreement be reached”.</p><p>The US president had threatened to hit the island with a 32 percent tax and possible duties on its huge semiconductor shipments.</p><h2 id=\"japan\">Japan</h2><p>A tariff of 15 percent agreed last week between Japan and Washington – down from a threatened 25 percent – is due to be applied from August 7.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“We continue to urge the US to take prompt measures to implement the agreement, including lowering tariffs on automobile and auto parts,” Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Friday.</p><p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ), however, warned that profits of Japanese firms are likely to fall this year because of US tariffs, leading them to downgrade capital expenditure plans.</p><p>Automakers have swallowed the rising costs from the tariffs instead of passing them on to US consumers, as seen in a fall of roughly 20 percent in export prices since April, the BOJ said in a full version of its quarterly outlook report.</p><p>“This suggests Japanese automakers are averting price hikes that may lead to falling sales volume, at the cost of seeing profitability worsen,” the BOJ added.</p><h2 id=\"south-korea\">South Korea</h2><p>The US tariff on South Korean imports will be 15 percent, Trump said on Wednesday, down from a threatened 25 percent. But there is no written agreement yet on a trade deal, the Asian nation’s trade minister said on Friday.</p><p>Speaking to reporters as he arrived home from a visit to Washington, Minister Yeo Han-koo said the two sides had an oral negotiation because of time constraints.</p><p>“What we felt during this negotiation is that the US trade environment is fundamentally changing. This is completely different from the first Trump term,” Yeo said of the deal.</p><p>“I think we are entering a new normal era. So, although we have overcome this crisis, we cannot be relieved, because we do not know when we will face pressure from tariffs or non-tariff measures again.”</p><h2 id=\"malaysia\">Malaysia</h2><p>Malaysia’s Trade Ministry has said its rate, down from a threatened 25 percent, was a positive outcome without compromising on what it called “red line” items.</p><h2 id=\"thailand\">Thailand</h2><p>Thailand’s finance minister said the reduction from 36 to 19 percent in tariffs, would help his country’s struggling economy face global challenges ahead.</p><p>“It helps maintain Thailand’s competitiveness on the global stage, boosts investor confidence and opens the door to economic growth, increased income and new opportunities,” Pichai Chunhavajira said.</p><h2 id=\"cambodia\">Cambodia</h2><p>The US on Friday slashed the tariff rate for Cambodia to 19 percent from earlier levies of 36 percent and 49 percent, a major boost for its crucial garments sector, its biggest economic driver and source of about a million manufacturing jobs.</p><p>“If the US maintained 49 percent or 36 percent, that industry would collapse, in my opinion,” Cambodia’s Deputy Prime Minister and top trade negotiator Sun Chanthol told the Reuters news agency in an interview.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"european-union\">European Union</h2><p>The EU’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, said the bloc’s exporters now benefit from a “more competitive position” following a framework agreement between the EU and the US, although he added that “the work continues.</p><p>“The new US tariffs reflect the first results of the EU-US deal, especially the 15 percent all-inclusive tariff cap,” Sefcovic wrote in a post on social media platform X.</p><p>“This reinforces stability for businesses as well as trust in the transatlantic economy,” he added.</p><h2 id=\"switzerland\">Switzerland</h2><p>Switzerland expressed “great regret” that it was hit with 39 percent – up from the threatened 31 percent – despite its “very constructive position”.</p><p>The levy – more than double the EU’s 15 percent – appeared to catch the rich Alpine nation off guard.</p><p>Switzerland ranks sixth in terms of direct investment in the US, with pharma giants Roche and Novartis announcing major spending plans in recent months.</p><p>Swiss foreign minister Ignazio Cassis said on Friday that his country will continue to strive for an agreement with the US. “We are not discouraged and continue to strive for an agreement in the interests of both sides,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"sri-lanka\">Sri Lanka</h2><p>Sri Lanka expressed relief that it will face a 20 percent hit – a sharp reduction from the 44 percent originally floated – and expressed hope of a further cut.</p><p>“We are happy that our competitiveness in exports to the US has been retained,” Finance Ministry official Harshana Suriyapperuma told reporters.</p><h2 id=\"bangladesh\">Bangladesh</h2><p>Bangladesh negotiated a 20 percent tariff on exports to the US, down from the 37 percent initially proposed by Trump.</p><p>Muhammad Yunus, the head of the country’s interim government, called it a “decisive diplomatic victory”.</p><h2 id=\"pakistan\">Pakistan</h2><p>Pakistan secured a tariff rate of 19 percent with the US on Thursday.</p><p>“This deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration, especially in energy, mines and minerals, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors,” the Pakistani Finance Ministry said in a statement.</p><h2 id=\"india\">India</h2><p>Trump on Wednesday said Indian goods would face a 25 percent US tariff starting August 1, slightly below an earlier threatened level.</p><p>The country would also face an unspecified “penalty” over New Delhi’s purchases of Russian weapons and energy, Trump said on social media.</p><p>India is engaged in trade talks with the US, an Indian government source with knowledge of the discussions told the Reuters news agency on Friday.</p><p>“We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"south-africa\">South Africa</h2><p>South Africa will use the weeklong delay in the US’s imposition of 30 percent tariffs to negotiate, to avoid the penalty and save jobs, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday.</p><p>“Intensive negotiations are now under way,” Ramaphosa told journalists.</p><p>“Our task is to negotiate as strongly and as hard as we can with the United States,” he said. “Our objective, really, is to save jobs.”</p><h2 id=\"australia\">Australia</h2><p>Australian products could become more competitive in the US market, helping businesses boost exports, Trade Minister Don Farrell said.</p><p>Trump has the minimum tariff rate of 10 percent for Australia.</p><h2 id=\"canada\">Canada</h2><p>Trump said on Thursday that the US would raise tariffs on certain Canadian goods from 25 percent to 35 percent.</p><p>He had warned of trade consequences for Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September.</p><p>Unlike the new levies hitting dozens of other economies, there is no delay, and these begin on Friday, according to a White House fact sheet.</p><p>Carney said his government is “disappointed” by Trump’s decision.</p><p>Trump’s order also cited Canada’s failure to “cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs” as well as its “retaliation” against his measures.</p><p>Carney outlined Ottawa’s efforts to crack down on fentanyl and to increase border security. “Canada accounts for only 1 percent of US fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,” he said.</p><p>Products covered by the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – which covers a wide swath of items – will, however, be exempt from the tariff rate.</p><h2 id=\"markets\">Markets</h2><p>European stocks hit a three-week low as investors worried about the effect of the new US levies on dozens of countries.</p><p>Asian shares were also headed for the worst week since April after the tariffs were announced.</p><p>Oil prices have, however, changed very little, heading for a weekly gain.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

According to Oxfam, this figure exceeds the total wealth of approximately 750 million Africans, roughly half of the continent’s population.</p><p data-start=\"402\" data-end=\"549\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Moreover, the top 5 percent of Africans now control nearly $4 trillion in wealth, more than double the combined assets of the remaining 95 percent.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"509\">Titled Africa’s Inequality Crisis and the Rise of the Super‑Rich, the report profiles the four wealthiest individuals on the continent. At number one is Aliko Dangote of Nigeria, estimated to be worth $23.3bn. Next is Johann Rupert and his family from South Africa, with about $14.2bn in wealth. Following them are Nicky Oppenheimer and his family, also South African, with a fortune of $10.2bn. Finally, Egyptian Nassef Sawiris holds approximately $9.4bn in net worth.</p><p data-start=\"511\" data-end=\"932\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">I find myself among the bottom 95 percent, the hopeful yet under‑resourced individuals who have laboured for modest incomes while yearning for socioeconomic transformation. At the dawn of the 21st century, in 2000, Africa had no billionaires. Today it is home to 23 billionaires, predominantly male, whose combined wealth has soared by 56 percent over the past five years, reaching an astounding $112.6bn.</p><p data-start=\"44\" data-end=\"281\">Today, no two nations better illustrate Africa’s stark wealth disparity and oligarchic dominance than Nigeria and South Africa, and no business leader exemplifies the rise of crony capitalism on the continent more than Aliko Dangote.</p><p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"299\">Here is why.</p><p data-start=\"301\" data-end=\"340\">Twenty‑five years ago, Dangote was simply an ambitious multimillionaire businessman. Then, on February 23, 1999, he made a substantial donation to General Olusegun Obasanjo’s presidential campaign. That seemingly benign investment proved decisive for his business trajectory.</p><p data-start=\"342\" data-end=\"379\">A year later, the Obasanjo administration embarked on a sweeping privatisation of state‑owned enterprises, aiming to liberalise the economy, attract private investment and foster domestic entrepreneurship under the Backward Integration Policy (BIP). Dangote acquired Benue Cement in 2000 and Obajana Cement in 2002, laying the foundations for Dangote Cement, now Africa’s largest cement producer.</p><p data-start=\"381\" data-end=\"418\">Between 2010 and 2015, Dangote Cement reportedly paid an effective tax rate of less than 1 percent on profits of approximately 1 trillion Nigerian naira (about $6bn at 2015 exchange rates). Dangote himself became Nigeria’s richest entrepreneur in 2007, attaining billionaire status amid the company’s rapid expansion.</p><p data-start=\"420\" data-end=\"457\">Since then, the quid pro quo strategies between Dangote and the Obasanjo administration have become a conventional aspect of Nigerian politics and business, albeit a controversial one.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p data-start=\"459\" data-end=\"496\">Critics argue that the BIP has stifled competition and fostered monopolistic practices in key sectors like sugar and cement, disproportionately benefitting politically connected elites – including Dangote – at the expense of smaller enterprises and ordinary Nigerians.</p><p data-start=\"2476\" data-end=\"2935\">Nigeria is richly endowed with natural resources and possesses world-class human capital. Nevertheless, more than 112 million people, nearly half of Nigeria’s population, live in poverty, based on the most recent population estimates of around 227 million. At the same time, the country’s five wealthiest individuals, dominating sectors such as oil and gas, banking, telecommunications, and real estate, have amassed a combined fortune of $29.9bn.</p><p data-start=\"2937\" data-end=\"3194\">The dysfunctional system that has enabled Nigeria’s “big five” entrepreneurs and fostered oligarchic patterns is not unique to Nigeria. South Africa, Africa’s most industrialised nation, confronts similar but distinct challenges in its post-apartheid era.</p><p data-start=\"3196\" data-end=\"3526\">After apartheid ended on April 27, 1994, the African National Congress (ANC) introduced Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and Broad-Based BEE initiatives (BBBEE). These policies aimed to advance the effective participation of Black people in the economy, achieve higher growth, increase employment and ensure fairer income distribution.</p><p data-start=\"3528\" data-end=\"3908\">However, over time, the ANC itself acknowledged that these affirmative action programs have not appreciably benefitted most Black South Africans, especially Black women. In the 31 years since apartheid, economic conditions have only marginally improved. While a few Black business leaders have emerged, they continue to succeed within a system engineered to favour a narrow elite.</p><p data-start=\"3910\" data-end=\"4427\">One such example is Patrice Motsepe, a mining magnate and among Africa’s richest individuals, with an estimated net worth of approximately $3bn. Supporters view him as a tangible beneficiary of post-apartheid economic transformation, but critics, including economist Moeletsi Mbeki, argue that his wealth reflects crony capitalism rather than broad-based entrepreneurship. Motsepe, who is also the brother-in-law of President Cyril Ramaphosa, remains a rare exception in a system marked by elite capture.</p><p data-start=\"4429\" data-end=\"4771\">By April 2025, South Africa’s official unemployment rate stood at 32.9 percent, equating to about 8.2 million people actively seeking work, while the broader rate, including discouraged jobseekers, rose to 43.1 percent. Around the same time, approximately 34.3 million South Africans, or more than half the population, were living in poverty.</p><p data-start=\"4773\" data-end=\"5188\">Meanwhile, the Oppenheimer family, whose immense fortune in diamond mining has deep historical roots tied to South Africa’s colonial past, continues to expand its wealth. A Harvard Growth Lab study published in November 2023 concluded that three decades after the end of apartheid, the economy is defined by stagnation and exclusion, and current strategies are not achieving inclusion and empowerment in practice.</p><p data-start=\"5190\" data-end=\"5490\">Unsurprisingly, the most prominent beneficiaries of BEE initiatives have been ANC insiders and aligned business elites, including President Ramaphosa, former Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale, Saki Macozoma, a former ANC MP, and Bridgette Radebe, sister to Motsepe and wife of ANC stalwart Jeff Radebe.</p><p data-start=\"5492\" data-end=\"5799\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">This distinct class of elites starkly contrasts with BEE’s intended beneficiaries, everyday South Africans. Instead, these individuals are grappling with the lingering consequences of oligarchic state capture, widespread corruption, poor service delivery, and sustained cuts to education and health budgets.</p><p data-start=\"84\" data-end=\"564\">Nigeria shares this pattern. At the very least, Dangote’s vast wealth should represent the pinnacle of success in a thriving African economy. Instead, he exemplifies Africa’s most prominent and wealthiest oligarch, demonstrating how proximity to political power can create controversial paths to fortune. Regrettably, almost every African country has its own Dangote or Motsepe whose influence hinders fair and inclusive economic development.</p><p data-start=\"566\" data-end=\"903\">Crony capitalism is a sharp break from free market ideals, where political connections override merit and innovation. This distortion breeds corruption, economic inefficiency and social inequality. It also weakens democratic norms by allowing private interests to gain excessive influence over public policy.</p><p data-start=\"905\" data-end=\"1293\">A 2015 study by Columbia University concluded that wealth accumulated by politically connected oligarchs has a strongly negative impact on economic growth, while the fortunes of unconnected billionaires have little effect. This finding suggests African economies could grow more rapidly if the enormous influence of politically connected elites was curtailed.</p><p data-start=\"1295\" data-end=\"1337\">Now is the time for meaningful reform.</p><p data-start=\"1339\" data-end=\"1497\">African nations must implement a wealth tax on high-net-worth individuals and direct the revenue towards essential services in impoverished areas.</p><p data-start=\"1499\" data-end=\"1806\">According to Oxfam, a modest tax increase consisting of a 1 percent levy on wealth and a 10 percent income tax on the richest individuals could generate $66bn annually, equivalent to 2.29 percent of Africa’s gross domestic product, and help close critical funding gaps in education and electricity access.</p><p data-start=\"1808\" data-end=\"1937\">Above all, African countries must adopt economic policies focused on equity to reduce poverty and improve wellbeing.</p><p data-start=\"1939\" data-end=\"2017\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">We, the neglected and disenfranchised 95 percent, stand against oligarchy.</p><p data-start=\"1939\" data-end=\"2017\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

In June, in the centre of Torun, central-north Poland, a Venezuelan man stabbed 24-year-old Klaudia, a Polish woman, to death as she was walking home from work through a park.</p><p>That horrific incident led to a silent march by thousands of protesters through Torun on Sunday, July 6. Local media reported that the march had been organised by supporters of the far-right Konfederacja political alliance and people carried signs saying “stop illegal immigration”.</p><p>Then came the rumours and misinformation. On July 14, someone in Walbrzych, southwestern Poland, called the police to report a Paraguayan man who had allegedly taken pictures of children on a playground.</p><p>The police stopped the man but did not find anything incriminating on his phone. That didn’t stop two Polish men from beating him up soon afterwards. And, the next day, a group of about 50 people stormed the hostel he and other migrants were living in. Some people threw flares into the building, and the owner has since been forced to close the hostel down.</p><p>In recent weeks, anti-migrant sentiment in Poland has been on the rise, spurred by far-right rhetoric, which asserts that Poland has been flooded with “unconstrained illegal migration”. Claims that migrants take local jobs and that they pose a threat to Poles both physically and figuratively, with their “foreign lifestyle”, are common and even encouraged by lawmakers.</p><p>One MP from Konfederacja – Konrad Berkowicz from Krakow – told TOK FM radio: “Xenophobia is an important element of our national unity. Condemning xenophobia and stifling it in the West has led to rapes and terrorist acts, that’s why we should cherish xenophobia.”</p><p>Elmi Abdi, 62, a Somali who came to Poland in 1996 as a refugee, told Al Jazeera: “Today, migrants are seen as responsible for all of Poland’s problems; we are scapegoats that all parties attack, even though politicians know it’s all untrue.” Today, Abdi is head of the Good Start foundation, which supports migrants, offering help with access to language classes, legal assistance and other matters.</p><p>“It is sad because we [immigrants] do everything to work safely here, pay taxes, and integrate into society.”</p><p>As misinformation – such as in the Walbrzych incident – about immigrants spreads, the Polish Migration Forum, a rights group, has called the atmosphere in Poland “pre-pogrom-like”.</p><p>“What distinguishes today’s situation is the violence. We are in a very bad place,” said Agnieszka Kosowicz, head of the forum. “Acts of violence already take place, people are subject to insults, threats and displays of hostility and contempt. This is a very alarming situation that requires a decisive response from the state.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_3867404\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3867404\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3867404\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25202530527656-1-1753963975.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Belarus border\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3867404\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Border guard officers stand guard at the Polish-Belarusian border, in Polowce, Poland, on Monday, July 21, 2025 [Czarek Sokolowski/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"rumours-of-illegal-returns\">Rumours of ‘illegal returns’</h2><p>On July 7, Poland reinstated border controls with Germany and Lithuania.

These are people who arrived in Poland from outside the EU before crossing to Germany.</p><p>These returns of migrants by the German authorities are legal, but as rumours on the internet about “illegal returns” of migrants continue to spread, unofficial, far-right patrols have appeared at the borders to monitor the situation and make “citizen arrests” of individuals they believe to be entering the country illegally – so far without much success.</p><p>The EU <a href=\"/news/2021/11/21/poland-says-belarus-still-bringing-migrants-to-its-border\">accused</a> Belarusian and Russian authorities of fomenting the EU’s migration crisis to destabilise the continent, by encouraging people from the Global South to travel to Belarus and then onwards into Europe via Poland.</p><p>In 2022, Poland built a fence along the border with Belarus to prevent migrants from entering the country irregularly. The fence, however, did little to physically stop migrants from coming in.</p><p>So, in March this year, Poland suspended the right to claim asylum altogether in a bid to deter people from coming.</p><p>All of this has served to stir up anti-migrant fear in Poland, which has been further amplified by far-right groups for their own political purposes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3854179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3854179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3854179\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Far-right-groups-on-Saturday-march-through-central-Krakow-1753342339.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Anti-migrant protests in Poland\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3854179\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Far-right groups march through central Krakow on Saturday, July 19 [Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"we-are-being-humiliated\">‘We are being humiliated’</h2><p>The hysteria reached a new high nearly two weeks ago, when, on Saturday, July 19, anti-migrant marches organised by the far-right Konfederacja party and football fans swept through 80 Polish towns and cities, shouting racist slurs and slogans.</p><p>Sixteen-year-old Nikola, who did not want to give her surname, told Al Jazeera that she had travelled 125km (80 miles) from her home in Gorlice, southern Poland, to attend the march in Krakow. She said she came along after watching videos on YouTube claiming that, in Western Europe, people are “afraid to leave their homes” because of the number of undocumented immigrants.</p><p>She said it was important to her to join a cause that “unites Poles today”.</p><p>“I wanted to be part of a community. People are showing those at the top that they care about security and that Poland is our country. We should do everything we can to prevent what’s happening in Western Europe,” she said.</p><p>“I’d like to feel safe in my city, and I’ve already seen a few people who looked like they are not from here,” she added.</p><p>On the march, Nikola joined a large column of several hundred people, many of them wearing Polish patriotic T-shirts and emblems of the Wisla football club, walking to Market Square. On the way, they passed tourists, some of whom were filming the protesters.</p><p>Three elderly women proudly waved white-and-red Polish flags among the football fans. “The nation has had enough of what’s happening. It’s waking up because we’re living under terror, being humiliated,” said Danuta, 60, who also did not want to give her full name. “The borders are not sealed and have to be defended by civilians,” she added, referring to the right-wing groups who patrol the Polish-German border.</p><p>On Market Square in the centre of the city, the march crossed paths with a smaller counterdemonstration organised by local left-wing groups, and the two groups exchanged insults while separated by the police.</p><p>The police did not record any major incidents during the day. But Abdi and other migrants Al Jazeera spoke with by telephone said they did not dare to leave their homes on Saturday.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3867418\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3867418\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3867418\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25200488216520-1-1753964344.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Krakow demo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3867418\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Police officers try to separate and secure a small group of counter-demonstrators who attempt to block an anti-immigration demonstration in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday, July 19, 2025 [Czarek Sokolowski/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"fake-news-fans-the-flames\">Fake news fans the flames</h2><p>According to experts, anti-migrant sentiment in Poland has been spurred by misinformation and fake news about the number of people entering the country, which does not reflect reality.</p><p>“Poland is not experiencing any large-scale irregular migration,” said Kosowicz. “Within the Dublin procedure [under EU rules], Germany returns people who claimed asylum in Poland and then crossed into Germany. In 2024, there were 688 such people, and this year – 318. This is nothing new.”</p><p>According to the International Migration Outlook report for 2024 from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2.2 percent of Poland’s population was foreign-born in 2023. This is low compared with other European countries such as the UK (15.4 percent), Germany (18.2 percent) and France (13.8 percent).</p><p>In 2022, 152,000 immigrants obtained residence permits for more than one year in Poland, the OECD said.</p><p>At the Polish-Belarusian border, which has been used by migrants from Global South countries trying to reach Europe since 2021, incoming numbers of migrants have not been particularly high, either. According to official data, from January to late June this year, 15,022 illegal crossing attempts were recorded, of which only 5 percent were successful.</p><p>In 2024, there were nearly 30,000 attempts, out of which, by contrast, one-third (10,900) were successful. In 2021, before Poland built a fence at the border with Belarus, the number of attempts reached 52,000.</p><p>Kosowicz also blames the government, which she says has failed to build awareness about the costs and benefits of development and migration, making all foreigners potential victims of hate attacks.</p><p>“A study by Deloitte and UNHCR says that 2.7 percent of Polish GDP comes solely from the work of Ukrainian refugees. But this isn’t the information we hear from politicians,” she said.</p><p>Abdi, who is married to a Polish woman with whom he has two children, worries greatly about their future.</p><p>“When I arrived here, the Poles welcomed me wonderfully, and I care deeply about Poland; it’s my home. I want it to be safe for everyone,” he told Al Jazeera in fluent Polish.</p><p>“At the marches, people shout that they want a white Poland. I’m old enough, I’m not afraid of anything.

It was necessary to issue new rules; otherwise, everything would snap back to rates set on April 2,” she said.</p><p>Elms told Al Jazeera the latest round of rates from July 31 was based on unusual calculations.</p><p>“The numbers are all over the place. The original formula was nonsense, but at least it had a logic. These rates do not appear to fit known facts. Some countries that bargained hard got better outcomes. Some did not. Some that didn’t get a hearing went down while others were increased,” she said.</p><p>Inu Manak, a trade policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said many countries may try to negotiate tariff rates before the August 7 deadline.</p><p>“The new rates won’t be implemented for seven days, so that gives countries that were already well into negotiations another week to secure a deal and never have these new tariffs imposed,” Manak said. The incentive is high for countries with a tariff of 15 percent or more to strike a deal, she added.</p><h2><strong>Tariff calculations</strong></h2><p>The July 31 tariffs retain a 10 percent “universal tariff” for most countries with which the US holds a trade surplus, or where the US exports more goods than it receives.</p><p>The major changes were for countries with which the US holds a trade deficit, or where the US sells fewer goods than it receives.</p><p>These countries face a base 15 percent tariff, although rates vary depending on whether they reached a deal with the White House or how Trump feels about their economy.</p><p>The White House previously announced tariff agreements with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Pakistan, Thailand and the UK. It is also setting separate tariffs for key industries and exports such as semiconductors, automotive, auto parts, steel and aluminium.</p><p>Rates have dropped for most countries with which the US holds a trade deficit, although there were some surprises.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Taiwan’s initial tariff rate of 32 percent dropped to 20 percent, but the figure is still higher than a deal made by neighbouring Japan and South Korea.</p><p>India also faces a 25 percent tariff despite its close relationship with the US, while tariffs for Pakistan fell from 29 to 19 percent.</p><p>Experts were scratching their heads over the decision to raise tariffs for Switzerland from 31 to 39 percent, and set tariffs at 41 percent and 40 percent for war-torn Syria and Myanmar, respectively.</p><p>Other notable tariffs include 40 percent for Laos, 35 percent for Iraq and Serbia, and 30 percent for Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Libya and South Africa.</p><p>“The Trump administration takes a country-by-country approach when it comes to trade. There is no overarching theory to explain the specifics for each country. Each country gets its own tariff rate based on the view of the president at that given time, for trade reasons or otherwise,” said Steve Okun, founder and CEO of APAC Advisors in Singapore.</p><h2><strong>Canada in the firing line</strong></h2><p>In a separate White House fact sheet, Trump said he would raise tariffs on Canada from 25 to 35 percent. China and Mexico, however, were notably absent from Trump’s latest list despite drawing his ire earlier this year.</p><p>Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, told Al Jazeera that Trump may still be deciding how to respond after US and Chinese officials met in Stockholm this week to discuss tariffs.</p><p>China is set to face an additional 30 percent tariff on most of its goods if an agreement is not reached by August 12.</p><p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on social media that Washington had agreed to a 90-day extension thanks to ongoing dialogue.</p><p>The US is also set to implement new rules of origin to determine tariff rates on transshipped goods in the coming weeks, the Reuters news agency reports, citing an unnamed senior Trump administration official.</p><p>Transshipped goods are those moved between vessels at an intermediate destination during transit to their final destination. The technicalities of the rules are being worked out, the official added.</p><p></p><p><em>Translation: We had a very good call with the president of the United States, Donald Trump. We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow and secured 90 days to build a long-term agreement through dialogue. I was joined by Juan Ramón de la Fuente, secretary of foreign affairs; Marcelo Ebrard, secretary of economy; and Roberto Velasco, undersecretary for North America.</em></p></div></div></body></html>"

She can either sign it into law, allow it to take effect automatically or send it back to Congress for revisions.</p><p>But the bill has prompted international outcry, not least because it is seen to shield security forces from accountability for the atrocities that unfolded during Peru’s war.</p><p>The legislation would also offer “humanitarian” amnesty to perpetrators over age 70 who have been convicted of wartime crimes.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3868146\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3868146\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3868146\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25209686358919-1-1754002459.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Protesters hold up model coffins to represent the dead.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3868146\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">People carry fake coffins representing their relatives who died amid political violence, on July 28, 2025 [Martin Mejia/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>Some 70,000 people were killed in the internal conflict, the majority of them from rural and Indigenous communities.</p><p>Soldiers and police officers were ostensibly tasked with combatting armed uprisings from rebel groups like the Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. But the conflict became infamous for its human rights abuses and massacres of civilians with no ties to any rebel group.</p><p>Francisco Ochoa was 14 years old when residents in his Andean village, Accomarca, were slaughtered by soldiers. He <a href=\"/features/longform/2025/7/30/dramatic-setback-will-perus-new-amnesty-law-put-justice-out-of-reach\">told Al Jazeera earlier this week</a> that he and other survivors felt “outraged and betrayed” by the new amnesty law.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>International organisations have likewise denounced the law as a step backwards for Peruvian society.</p><p>Nine human rights experts with the United Nations signed a statement on July 17 expressing “alarm” at the bill’s passage through Congress. They called on the government of Peru to veto the bill.</p><p>“The proposed legislation would prevent the criminal prosecution and condemnation of individuals who committed gross human rights violations during Peru’s internal armed conflict,” they said.</p><p>“It would put the State in clear breach of its obligations under international law.”</p><p>A week later, on July 24, the president of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Nancy Hernandez Lopez, ordered Peru to “immediately suspend the processing” of the bill. She ruled that the legislation violated previous rulings against such amnesty laws in the country.</p><p>“If it is not suspended, the competent authorities refrain from enforcing this law,” she said.</p><p>She noted that a session would be convened with survivors, Peruvian officials and members of the <a href=\"https://www.oas.org/en/iachr/jsForm/?File=/en/iachr/media_center/preleases/2025/128.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR).</p><p>In previous rulings, the Inter-American Court has found that amnesty laws and statutes of limitations are unlawful in the case of serious human rights violations like forced disappearances and extrajudicial executions.</p><p>It also declared that age is not a disqualifying factor for suspects accused of grave human rights abuses. Such exemptions, the court said, are only acceptable under international law for lesser or nonviolent offences.</p><p>The National Human Rights Coordinator, a coalition of humanitarian groups in Peru, estimates that the country’s latest amnesty law could overturn 156 convictions and disrupt more than 600 ongoing investigations.</p><p>A previous amnesty law implemented in 1995, under then-President Alberto Fujimori, was later repealed.</p><p>Still, President Boluarte on Thursday sought to frame her government’s actions as in line with international human rights standards.</p><p>“We are defenders of human rights, of citizens,” she wrote on social media, while emphasising that her government was “free”, “sovereign” and “autonomous”, apparent jabs at the Inter-American Court’s decision.</p></div></div></body></html>"
