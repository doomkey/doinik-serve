It’s the implementation area. That’s where they implement. And that is no longer around.”</p><p>Trump declined to say if the US military or the CIA had carried out the strike on the dock, or where it occurred.</p><p>“I know exactly who it was, but I don’t want to say who it was. But, you know, it was along the shore,” he said.</p><p></p><p>There was no immediate comment from Venezuela on the attack, and there have been no independent reports from the country about a US attack.</p><p>The claim came as the Trump administration escalates its <a href=\"/news/2025/12/3/us-venezuela-tensions-your-questions-answered\">pressure campaign</a> against Venezuela, part of a broader effort to target what the president says are drug-smuggling operations bound for the US.</p><p>Caracas denies any involvement in drug trafficking and insists that Washington is seeking to overthrow Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to seize the <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/does-the-us-have-any-real-claim-on-venezuelan-oil-as-stephen-miller-says\">country’s oil reserves</a>, which are the world’s largest.</p><p data-start=\"918\" data-end=\"1105\">The latest US action appears to mark a shift closer to shore-based strikes, following months of military operations in international waters in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.</p><p>The attacks have killed at least 107 people in 30 strikes since early September, according to numbers announced by the Trump administration.</p><p>The strikes are widely considered illegal under both US and international law and have been described as <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/experts-say-us-boat-strikes-are-illegal-killings-can-they-be-stopped\">extrajudicial killings</a> by legal scholars and rights groups.</p><p>The US Southern Command described the latest victims of its strikes on Monday as “two male narco-terrorists” and said their vessel was engaged in “narco-trafficking operations”.</p><p>The attacks come amid a large US military buildup in the region, including more than 15,000 troops, as well as the seizure of several oil tankers as part of a blockade Trump has ordered on sanctioned vessels entering and leaving Venezuela.</p><p data-start=\"2399\" data-end=\"2629\">For months, Trump has suggested that the US could expand its operations to include land strikes in South America, particularly in Venezuela, and has recently said the US would move beyond targeting boats and strike on land “soon”.</p><p data-start=\"2631\" data-end=\"2809\">In October, Trump confirmed that he had authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela.

Our homes, workplaces, sporting fields, and public spaces no longer feel secure.”</p><p>The response of Albanese’s Labor government to the attack, including proposals to tighten gun laws and introduce tougher legislation against hate speech, was “not nearly enough,” the families said.</p><p>“The dangerous rise of antisemitism and radicalism in Australia is not going away,” they said.</p><p>“We need strong action now. We need leadership now.”</p><p>The calls for an inquiry into anti-Semitism came as Albanese on Monday announced the terms of an independent review into whether law enforcement and intelligence agencies could have done more to prevent the attack.</p><p>Albanese and his government colleagues have resisted calls for a public inquiry into the attack, arguing that such a process would take years and could undermine social cohesion by platforming extremist voices.</p><p>Albanese told a news conference that the review, led by former intelligence chief Dennis Richardson, would examine what authorities knew about the suspected gunmen before the attack and information sharing between federal and state agencies, among other issues.</p><p>“Just over two weeks ago, anti-Semitic terrorists tried to tear our country apart, but our country is stronger than these cowards,” Albanese said.</p><p>“They went to Bondi Beach to unleash mass murder against our Jewish community. We need to respond with unity and urgency rather than division and delay.”</p><p>Anti-Jewish sentiment, as well as anti-Islam and anti-immigration sentiment, are rising in Australia. Many Australians have expressed their concerns over a rise in right-wing extremism in the country, where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas.</p><p>In September, thousands of people held rallies in cities, including Sydney, Perth, Canberra and Brisbane, demanding an end to “mass migration”.</p><p>The Australian government has condemned the rallies, which took place under the banner of “March for Australia”, as racist, while Minister for Multicultural Affairs Anne Aly said the gatherings were “organised by Nazis”.</p><p>The group behind “March for Australia” said on its website and social media that “mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together” and that its rallies aimed to do “what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration”.</p><p>But Australia also experienced a sharp rise in both anti-Semitic and Islamophobic incidents since October 7, 2023.</p><p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, which supports the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, documented 1,654 anti-Jewish incidents nationwide between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025, after more than 2,060 incidents the previous year.</p><p>The Islamophobia Register Australia recorded 309 in-person incidents of Islamophobia and 366 online incidents between January 1, 2023 and November 31, 2024.</p><p>Numerous rights organisations, including some Jewish groups, have criticised the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, arguing that it has been used to conflate legitimate criticism of Israel – particularly of its genocidal war on Gaza – with anti-Jewish bigotry.</p><p>One of Albanese’s highest-profile critics in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – he blamed Albanese’s government for failing to protect Australia’s Jewish community and also linked the shooting to Australia’s recent decision to <a href=\"/news/2025/9/21/canada-australia-join-uk-in-recognising-palestinian-statehood\">recognise Palestinian statehood</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Tipu has since spent his days on the pavement opposite the hospital gate, promising to stay put until he receives news of her recovery.</p><p>“She is like my mother. She sacrificed everything for democracy,” he told Al Jazeera. “My only prayer is that God allows her to see the upcoming election,” he added, referring to the national elections scheduled for February 12.</p><p>But it was not to be. Early in the morning, on December 30, the 80-year-old Khaleda passed away in hospital, her party announced.</p><p>“Our beloved national leader is no longer with us. She left us at 6am today,” the BNP said in the statement posted on Facebook.</p><p>With her archrival and fellow former prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, now in exile in India, Khaleda’s death closes a more than three-decade-long chapter when the two leaders – who came to be known as the ‘battling begums’, an honorific traditionally reserved for Muslim women of authority – dominated Bangladeshi politics.</p><p>But as with Hasina, Khaleda’s legacy is grey: Both women fought for democracy, against authoritarianism. While Khaleda, unlike Hasina, was never accused of carrying out mass atrocities against critics, she was also a polarising figure. Her uncompromising style while in opposition – leading election boycotts and prolonged street movements – combined with recurring allegations of corruption while she was in power, inspired intense loyalty among supporters and equal distrust among her critics.</p><h2 id=\"the-rise\">The rise</h2><p>Begum Khaleda Zia was born on August 15, 1946, in Dinajpur – then part of British India’s East Bengal, now northern Bangladesh.</p><p>Her father, Iskandar Majumder, originally from Feni in the country’s southeast, had previously run a tea business in Jalpaiguri (in present-day India) before relocating with his family to East Bengal, which would soon become East Pakistan after the 1947 partition of India.</p><p>Khaleda spent her early years in Dinajpur, where she studied at the Dinajpur Government Girls’ High School before enrolling at Surendranath College.</p><p>Her entry into politics was shaped not by early ambition but by upheaval.</p><p>The assassination of her husband, President Ziaur Rahman, in an abortive military mutiny in Chattogram on May 30, 1981, plunged Bangladesh into deep uncertainty. Rahman – who had stabilised the country after years of coups and counter-coups – left behind a fragile political order and a governing party, the BNP, that was suddenly without its founder.</p><p>Although Khaleda had not been politically active during her husband’s presidency, senior BNP leaders saw her as the only figure who could unify the party’s competing factions and preserve Ziaur Rahman’s legacy. After his death, Vice President Abdus Sattar became acting president and later won an election. But within months, Army Chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in March 1982, imposing martial law. It was in this volatile context – with the military back in control and political parties fighting for survival – that Khaleda began her ascent, eventually emerging as a central civilian figure challenging authoritarian rule.</p><p>Khaleda joined the BNP as a general member in January 1982, became its vice chair in 1983, and was elected party chairperson in August 1984. In the decades that followed, she would win three elections to become prime minister in a political landscape that she dominated alongside her longtime rival, Sheikh Hasina, and her Awami League party.</p><p>Her public life unfolded alongside personal struggles: her elder son, Tarique Rahman, went into exile in 2008 after being arrested during a military-backed caretaker government’s anticorruption drive; her younger son, Arafat Rahman Koko, died of cardiac arrest in 2015 while living abroad. Khaleda herself later spent long periods in prison after her 2018 convictions in corruption cases brought under the Awami League government, followed by years of political isolation and deteriorating health.</p><p>Tarique eventually returned to Dhaka on December 25, after the cases against him were dropped by the interim government of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus that yook office after Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>“Her [Khaleda’s] entire life was filled with hardship, yet she chose her country over personal comfort,” said Dilara Choudhury, a political scientist who observed both Khaleda and her husband closely. “That is why she is remembered across political lines as one of the most emblematic leaders of her time.”</p><h2 id=\"private-life-before-politics\">Private life before politics</h2><p>People who knew Khaleda before she entered public life describe her as a woman who was reserved, soft-spoken and consistently courteous. She married army officer Ziaur Rahman in 1960 when she was about 15, long before he emerged as a national figure. Rahman rose to prominence after Bangladesh’s 1971 independence war, later assuming the presidency in 1977 and founding the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1978. Zia would later inherit her husband’s politics – centred on nationalism, multi-party democracy and a market-oriented economy.</p><p>From 1978 to 1981, she lived with her family in a modest military residence at 6 Moinul Road in Dhaka Cantonment, then designated as the residence of the deputy chief of the army, where then-Captain (later Colonel) Harunur Rashid Khan served as aide-de-camp to her husband, President Rahman.</p><p>“She coordinated the house herself, welcomed guests and managed family matters,” Colonel Khan told Al Jazeera. “I never saw her raise her voice. She was humble, kind and thoughtful.”</p><p>He recalled her calm approach to parenting: When her younger son, Arafat, then aged 7, struggled to gain admission to a school, she asked only for other alternative school options; when the boy later injured himself imitating a television stunt, she expressed no anger towards the staff who were supposed to be minding him.</p><p>“That was the kind of person she was,” Khan said. “Graceful, composed and considerate.”</p><p>But everything changed on May 30, 1981.</p><p>At dawn that day, Khan learned President Rahman had been assassinated in the port city of Chattogram, in an attempted coup by a group of army officers that would eventually be crushed by Ershad, Rahman’s army chief, though Ershad would himself grab power months later.</p><p>“For a moment [after learning of the assassination], I felt the ground slip beneath my feet; but I did not share the information with Madam [Begum Zia] for moments,” he said.</p><p>Fearing that the family residence might be the next target, he immediately ordered an entire company of about 120 soldiers to be ready to defend the family.</p><p>In the early morning, the two boys came out of their bedrooms, preparing to leave for school, but he stopped them. Minutes later, Khaleda stepped out of her bedroom. “She asked me, ‘What has happened?’ I told her there was unrest outside,” he said.</p><p>Without asking anything else, she retreated to her bedroom as a member of the house staff switched on the radio – and the announcement of her husband’s death filled the room.</p><p>“She stepped back, looked at my eyes – and she understood,” the former aide-de-camp said. “She sank into the floor.”</p><p>Khan remained to support the family for two more months. “She was mentally shattered,” he said.</p><p>As Ziaur Rahman had left no other personal residence for his family, the government later permanently allocated the house at 6 Moinul Road to Khaleda, and she lived there until she was evicted in 2010 by Hasina’s administration.</p><h2 id=\"from-first-lady-to-first-female-prime-minister\">From first lady to first female prime minister</h2><p>Following Ziaur Rahman’s assassination in 1981, senior leaders of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) urged Khaleda – who was not even a party member at the time – to take on a public role.</p><p>Her rise coincided with growing public sentiments against Ershad’s military rule: After taking over as president, the army chief suspended the constitution and imposed martial law.</p><p>Throughout the 1980s, the BNP and the Awami League – the two largest political parties – led parallel but often coordinated street movements calling for the restoration of parliamentary democracy.</p><p>According to Choudhury, the political scientist, a key turning point arrived in 1986, when Ershad announced a national election that the opposition denounced as unconstitutional because martial law remained in force and political freedoms were restricted. While the Awami League eventually chose to contest the polls, the BNP under Khaleda’s stewardship boycotted the election entirely.</p><p>“Her decision to boycott the 1986 election – which she denounced as illegal even as the Awami League participated – reinforced her public image as someone unwilling to trade principle for expediency,” she said.</p><p>Repeated house arrests under the Ershad regime cemented this perception about her. “Khaleda Zia was unwavering in her objective to remove Ershad and restore democracy,” Choudhury said. “Her readiness to endure arrest, even in ill health, earned her respect.”</p><p>The 1991 election – the first after the end of military rule in December 1990 – produced a hung parliament.</p><p>The BNP won 140 seats, short of the 151 needed to form a government. The Awami League won 88 seats, the Jatiya Party 35 and Jamaat-e-Islami 18.</p><p>Jamaat chief Ghulam Azam opened negotiations with Sheikh Hasina. Meanwhile, Golam Wahed Choudhury, the husband of Dilara Choudhury, and a former minister of communications of undivided Pakistan, arranged a discreet meeting at his Dhaka residence, bringing together Khaleda, Jamaat leaders Ghulam Azam and Motiur Rahman Nizami, and the army chief, Lieutenant General Nuruddin.</p><p>Khaleda arrived alone, without informing other BNP leaders. The negotiations ultimately paved the way to allow Bangladeshi citizenship for two very contrasting political figures. Jamaat chief Azam, who had supported Pakistan during the war of independence, had previously been stripped of his citizenship as a result. Kader Siddique, a prominent 1971 war hero aligned with the Awami League’s political legacy, had been in exile in India after leading his private militia against the government and military following the 1975 assassination of Hasina’s husband, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – the leader of the country’s independence struggle and its first prime minister and president.</p><p>In return, Jamaat agreed to back the BNP in parliament, giving Khaleda the numbers needed to form a government.</p><p>“This negotiation showed her political prudence and firmness,” Choudhury said. “It could easily have failed.”</p><p>Khaleda was sworn in as Bangladesh’s first elected female prime minister – joining a line of South Asian women who had already held the region’s highest offices, including Indira Gandhi, Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Benazir Bhutto.</p><h2 id=\"governance-reforms-and-cries-of-cronyism\">Governance, reforms and cries of cronyism</h2><p>Khaleda led Bangladesh thrice: first between 1991 and 1996, then for a few months in 1996 during a short-lived second term, and finally between 2001 and 2006.</p><p>Recalling the negotiation mediated by her husband in early 1991, Choudhury, the political scientist, said that as Khaleda was leaving the meeting, she paused to speak with the women of the household and asked what they expected from her.</p><p>“My elder sister, Professor Husneara Khan, replied, ‘We want you to give the country a comparatively honest and corruption-free administration’.”</p><p>Whether she ultimately delivered on that, Choudhury said, is a complex question. “She genuinely had that intention – inspired by her husband’s nationalist philosophy. She succeeded in many areas.”</p><p>Supporters credit her government with policies aimed at stabilising a state emerging from years of authoritarian rule. Her administration pursued economic liberalisation, export-led growth, revival of industry, expansion of the garment sector, and wider access to education – particularly for girls. Her tenure also coincided with the expansion of a relatively free press.</p><p>When her last elected term ended in 2006, Bangladesh’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate stood at about 7 percent – one of the highest in the country’s post-independence history and well above the average of roughly 4.8 percent in the 1990s and about 3.8 percent in the 1980s. At that time, the World Bank described Bangladesh as “Asia’s next tiger economy”.</p><p>Her administrations, however, did draw criticism too.</p><p>In 1995, an acute fertiliser shortage and a resulting sharp increase in prices – driven by hoarding and distribution failures at a crucial time for the winter paddy crop – led to protests by thousands of farmers. Police opened fire in several districts: At least a dozen farmers and one officer died in clashes, a moment that damaged her government’s reputation amid widespread rural frustration.</p><p>During her 2001–2006 term, critics accused her elder son, Tarique Rahman, of building an alleged parallel centre of influence around his political office, widely known as Hawa Bhaban.</p><p>Allegations of corruption and claims that key decisions were being influenced through this parallel structure fuelled persistent questions about governance under her watch.</p><h2 id=\"political-missteps\">Political missteps</h2><p>Chaudhury pointed to two episodes in which Khaleda’s governments were also accused of trying to influence electoral outcomes. A 1994 by-election in the Magura-2 parliamentary constituency was widely criticised as having been manipulated to benefit the BNP. Later, towards the end of her 2001–06 term, Zia was accused of trying to install a partisan caretaker government tasked with carrying out the next election.</p><p>Political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed, the author of the book Khaleda – an independent historical account of the former PM’s legacy – pointed to other instances too that he said hurt her credibility.</p><p>A grenade attack on a rally of Hasina’s then-opposition Awami League on August 21, 2004, in Dhaka, killed at least 24 people and injured hundreds. The investigation under the BNP-led government was widely criticised for failing to promptly pursue credible leads into the role of Islamist armed groups that were ultimately blamed by investigators. These include the Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami group.</p><p>A Dhaka court in 2018 convicted several individuals in connection with the attack. However, subsequent appeals and High Court rulings have overturned some convictions, acquitting others, and questions about accountability for the 2004 attack remain unresolved for many Bangladeshis.</p><p>In another incident in April 2004, police and coastguard intercepted a large consignment of illegal weapons believed to be destined for the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), an armed separatist group in India’s Assam region.</p><p>“These incidents deepened political hostility at home and created significant discomfort in Bangladesh’s relations with neighbouring India,” Ahmed told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Zia’s missteps during her 2001-06 rule contributed to the political instability that culminated in a military-backed takeover of power on January 11, 2007.</p><p>The army’s senior leadership pressed then-President Iajuddin Ahmed to declare a state of emergency, resign as chief adviser of the sitting caretaker government and cancel elections scheduled for later that month. With the armed forces’ backing, former Bangladesh Bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed was appointed chief adviser of a new interim caretaker government tasked with stabilising the country and preparing for future elections. The move effectively sidelined both Khaleda and Hasina from front-line politics for nearly two years.</p><p>“Her [Khaleda’s] party created the circumstances [for the events of January 11, 2007], and the party – as well as her family – eventually became the victims of it,” Ahmed, the political historian, said.</p><h2 id=\"commitment-to-democracy\">‘Commitment to democracy’</h2><p>Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, a former commerce minister in Khaleda’s 2001–04 cabinet and a current BNP leader, said that his former boss never wavered from her political positions even when she was under immense pressure to compromise.</p><p>“Her commitment to democracy and her patriotism had a profound impact on party workers,” he said. “Attempts to break the BNP – during 1/11 and later under Sheikh Hasina – never succeeded because her ideals held the organisation together,” he added, referring to the events of January 11, 2007.</p><p>Ahmed, the political historian, also said that while “many have benefited from politics in recent decades”, Khaleda had “paid a very high price, especially after 2006″. He was referring to the years of imprisonment, political persecution and sustained pressure endured by her and her family.</p><p>“Right or wrong, she rarely walked back from her stated positions, which we did not see among other contemporary politicians,” Ahmed said, citing her firmness during the anti-Ershad movement and her insistence on elections only under caretaker governments.</p><p>That she became the first woman to occupy the nation’s highest elected office in a socially conservative society traditionally sceptical of female leadership will always also remain a part of her legacy.</p><p>Her refusal to flee the country during crises – whether after January 2007, when her elder son was forced into exile as they faced numerous cases, or when she faced retribution under Hasina – also helped hold the BNP together, say analysts.</p><p>“She could have left, but she chose to stay and face the consequences. That determination set her apart,” Ahmed said.</p><p>The political historian also pointed to Khaleda’s restraint in political language. “Even when she was targeted with harsh propaganda and abusive remarks, she did not respond in that manner.”</p><p>Her message following the fall of Hasina in August 2024 was an example.</p><p>Freed from house arrest on August 6, after student-led protests forced Hasina to flee to India, Khaleda urged her supporters not to pursue retaliation.</p><p>“For many, it was an almost unimaginable moment,” Mohiuddin said. “She avoided inflammatory language even when the political tide turned in her favour.”</p><p>For many everyday Bangladeshis, this trait is central to how she will be remembered. “Both Hasina and Khaleda ruled the country well, but in my opinion, Khaleda did better,” said 77-year-old Nazim Uddin, speaking to Al Jazeera in early December while chatting with friends outside a commercial complex not far from Evercare Hospital.</p><p>But a key question now looms: What awaits the BNP in a post-Khaleda era?</p><p>At the centre of any answer to that question is Khaleda’s only surviving son, Tarique Rahman.</p><p>“Like the Awami League, the BNP has become a one-person-centric party,” political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed said. “With Tarique Rahman’s leadership still untested, the BNP is likely to face a serious leadership crisis.”</p><p>Choudhury, the political scientist who knew Khaleda well, offered a sharper assessment: “Leaders in the post-Khaleda BNP will likely split into two or three factions, as she served as a symbol of unity for party members. That fragmentation, I fear, will create a serious political vacuum in the country.”</p><p>But others disagree.</p><p>Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, the former minister under Khaleda, said that he believes Tarique, who has led the party as acting chair since 2018 from exile in the United Kingdom, has already “taken up the torch that his mother carried from his father, Ziaur Rahman”.</p><p>Tarique was greeted with a significant show of support by the party faithful when he returned to Dhaka from exile on Christmas Day, weeks ahead of the national election, in which the BNP is in a close race for poll position with its former ally, the Jamaat-e-Islami.</p><p>In his first comments since returning, Tarique spoke of wanting to build an inclusive Bangladesh. Some experts believe the 60-year-old might also be able to repair ties with India, which have suffered since Hasina’s removal and her decision to flee to New Delhi. Though India and the BNP have traditionally not enjoyed warm ties, with New Delhi preferring Hasina’s Awami League as its partner in Dhaka, both have sent overtures to each other in recent days.</p><p>Now the BNP’s, and Tarique’s, big test awaits: February’s elections will not just determine who leads Bangladesh, but could reveal whether the country trusts Khaleda’s heir to continue her legacy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She was 80 years old.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>“Our beloved national leader is no longer with us,” the BNP said.</p><p>“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.</p><p>Khaleda died at the Evercare Hospital in Dhaka, where she was admitted on November 23 with symptoms of a lung infection, according to The Daily Star. Her doctors said she had advanced ​cirrhosis ‌of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, and chest ‌and heart ‌problems.</p><p>During her final days, Bangladesh’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, had asked the people to pray for Khaleda, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.</p><p>Khaleda was jailed for corruption in 2018 under then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.</p><p>She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In November, Hasina was sentenced to death in absentia for her deadly crackdown on the student protesters who toppled her government.</p><p>With Hasina now in exile in India, Khaleda’s death closes a more than three-decade-long chapter when the two leaders – who came to be known as the ‘battling begums’ – an honorific traditionally reserved for Muslim women of authority – dominated Bangladeshi politics.</p><p>But as with Hasina, Khaleda’s legacy is grey.</p><p>Both women fought for democracy, against authoritarianism. But while Khaleda – unlike Hasina – was never accused of carrying out mass atrocities against critics, she too was a polarising figure.</p><p>Her uncompromising style while in opposition – leading election boycotts and prolonged street movements – combined with recurring allegations of corruption when she was in power, made her a figure who inspired intense loyalty among supporters and equal distrust among her critics.</p><p>Khaleda was born on August 15, 1946, in Dinajpur, then part of India’s East Bengal, now northern Bangladesh. She married army officer Ziaur Rahman in 1960 when she was about 15. Rahman rose to prominence after Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971, later assuming the presidency in 1977 and founding the BNP in 1978.</p><p>Khaleda’s entry into politics was shaped not by ambition but by upheaval.</p><p>Her husband was assassinated in an abortive military military in 1981, plunging Bangladesh into deep uncertainty. Rahman – who had stabilised the country after years of coups and counter-coups – left behind a fragile political order.</p><p>Khaleda, then a 35-year-old mother of two, inherited the BNP leadership.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Initially dismissed as a political novice, she proved a formidable opponent, rallying against military dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad, and later joining forces with Hasina – the daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – to remove Ershad in 1990.</p><p>The following year, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election and Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the country’s largest Islamic ​party, Jamaat-e-Islami.</p><p>In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim ‌nation after Benazir Bhutto, elected to lead Pakistan three years earlier.</p><p>Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.</p><p>She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.</p><p>Their intractable rivalry fuelled crises, including a standoff in January 2007 that brought military-backed emergency rule.</p><p>Both women were detained for more than a year.</p><p>Hasina later dominated, ruling from 2008 until her violent downfall in 2024.</p><p>In 2018, Khaleda, her son Tarique Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister – charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.</p><p>She ‍was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.</p><p>In early 2025, Khaleda and her son were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of a 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month ‌earlier.</p><p>He returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, and was welcomed back by large crowds of joyous supporters.</p><p>Rahman will lead the BNP through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div></div></body></html>"

We’ll knock the hell out of them. But, hopefully, that’s not happening.”</p><p>In recent weeks, Israeli officials and their US allies have shifted the focus to Iran’s missile programme, arguing it should be dealt with before it poses a threat to Israel.</p><p>When asked whether the US would back an Israeli attack targeting Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/netanyahu-pushes-for-iran-conflict-clashing-with-trumps-priorities\">missile programme</a>, Trump said, “If they will continue with the missiles, yes. The nuclear? Fast. OK? One will be: Yes, absolutely. The other is: We’ll do it immediately.”</p><p>Iran has ruled out negotiating over its missile programme, and it has denied seeking to build a nuclear weapon.</p><p>Israel, meanwhile, is widely believed to have an undeclared nuclear arsenal.</p><h2 id=\"bromance-festival\">Bromance festival</h2><p>Since the early days of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, US media reports have suggested that the US president, first Joe Biden, then Trump, was <a href=\"/news/2023/12/22/a-biden-netanyahu-rift-distraction-palestinian-rights-advocates-say\">angry or frustrated</a> at Netanyahu.</p><p>But the US military and diplomatic support for Israel has never been interrupted.</p><p>Ahead of Netanyahu’s visit, similar reports emerged about a potential rift between him and Trump.</p><p>Nonetheless, the two leaders put on a show of brotherly romance on Monday<span>.</span></p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump called Netanyahu a “hero”, stressing that Israel may not have existed without his wartime leadership.</p><p>“We’re with you, and we’ll continue to be with you, and a lot of good things are happening in the Middle East,” Trump told Netanyahu.</p><p>“We have peace in the Middle East, and we’re going to try and keep it that way. I think we will be very successful in keeping it that way. And you’ve been a great friend.”</p><p>The US president also highlighted his efforts to secure a <a href=\"/news/2025/11/12/trump-formally-asks-israeli-president-to-pardon-netanyahu-after-gaza-truce\">presidential pardon</a> for Netanyahu, who is facing corruption charges in Israel.</p><p>The Israeli prime minister announced that the US president will be awarded the Israel Prize, which is normally given to Israeli citizens.</p><p>“I have to say that this reflects the overwhelming sentiment of Israelis across the spectrum,” Netanyahu said.</p><p>“They appreciate what you’ve done to help Israel, and to help our common battle against the terrorists and those who would destroy our civilisation.”</p><p>Netanyahu has notably not been pardoned.</p><h2><span>Trump calls for Israel-Syria rapprochement</span></h2><p>One area where Trump appeared to press Netanyahu was Syria.</p><p>Trump said Netanyahu is “going to get along” with Syria, lauding Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p><p>Since the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad last year, Israel has expanded its occupation of southern Syria beyond the Golan Heights, seizing large areas in Jabal al-Sheikh. The Israeli military has also been carrying out raids, reportedly <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/israeli-incursions-abductions-stoke-fear-in-syrias-occupied-golan-heights\">abducting and disappearing</a> people in the country.</p><p>The new Syrian authorities have stressed that they do not seek conflict with Israel, but talks to reach a security agreement between the two countries have stalled.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“We do have an understanding regarding Syria,” Trump said. “Now, with Syria, you have a new president. I respect him. He’s a very strong guy, and that’s what you need in Syria.”</p><p>Netanyahu was non-committal on Israel’s approach to Syria.</p><p>“Our interest is to have a peaceful border with Syria,” he said. “We want to make sure that the border area right next to our border is safe — we don’t have terrorists, we don’t have attacks.”</p><h2 id=\"on-renewed-war-in-lebanon-we-ll-see-about-it\">On renewed war in Lebanon: ‘We’ll see about it.’</h2><p>Since the start of the truce in Gaza, Israel has intensified its attacks in Lebanon, leading to fears that it may re-launch its full-scale war against the country.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Lebanese government issued a decree to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/20/first-phase-of-hezbollahs-disarmament-close-to-complete-lebanons-salam\">disarm Hezbollah</a>, but the group pledged to hold onto its weapons to defend the country against Israel.</p><p>On Monday, Trump did not rule out renewing the conflict in Lebanon.</p><p>“We’ll see about it,” the president said when asked whether he would support more Israeli strikes in Lebanon.</p><p>“The Lebanese government is at a little bit of a disadvantage, if you think of it, with Hezbollah.

I am bringing acute awareness to the unjust application of UK laws by our Government and I’m glad that people can now see this after a year of imprisonment and human rights violations. Keep going, keep fighting.”</p><p>The three other detainees still on hunger strike are Teuta Hoxha on day 51, Kamran Ahmed on day 50 and Lewie Chiaramello on day 36. Hoxha and Ahmed have previously been hospitalised during the protest.</p><p>A spokesperson for Justice for the Hunger Strikers criticised the Labour government, saying it has failed to intervene despite advance warning of the hunger strike.</p><p>“Despite being given two weeks notice of the hunger strike, the Labour government has refused to engage with the hunger strikers or their families and legal representatives, even as they have reached a critical stage, with death a very real possibility,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>The hunger strikers are being held in five prisons across England over their alleged involvement in break-ins at the UK subsidiary of the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems in Bristol and at a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The detainees deny the charges against them, including burglary and violent disorder, and said the UK government should itself be held accountable for its alleged role in Israel’s genocidal war on the Palestinian people.</p><p>All eight hunger strikers are members of Palestine Action and were charged before the group was designated a proscribed organisation under “antiterrorism” laws. They are expected to spend more than a year in prison before their trials begin – well beyond the UK’s usual six-month pretrial detention limit.</p><p>According to the Prisoners for Palestine group, their trials are expected to begin between April and January 2027.</p><p>The detainees’ demands include release on bail, an end to what they describe as interference with their mail and reading materials, access to a fair trial and the de-proscription of Palestine Action.</p><p>Additional demands issued this week include transferring Muraisi back to HMP Bronzefield, closer to her family; lifting non-association orders between prisoners; and allowing detainees access to prison activities and courses.</p><h2 id=\"international-concern\">International concern</h2><p>Campaigners have described the protest as the largest hunger strike in Britain since the Irish hunger strikes of 1981, saying it has prompted hundreds of solidarity demonstrations across the country.</p><p>On Friday, a group of United Nations experts – including Gina Romero, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on occupied Palestinian territory – issued a statement expressing alarm at the detainees’ treatment.</p><p>“Hunger strike is often a measure of last resort by people who believe that their rights to protest and effective remedy have been exhausted,” the experts said. “The state’s duty of care toward hunger strikers is heightened, not diminished.”</p><p>Separately, more than 800 doctors have signed a letter addressed to Justice Secretary David Lammy urging him to intervene. The letter, written on December 17, raised “grave concern” about the prisoners’ health, warning they were at high risk of organ failure, irreversible neurological damage, cardiac arrhythmias and death.</p><p>Lawyers for the hunger-striking detainees said last week that they had initiated legal proceedings against the government, alleging it had abandoned its own prison safety policy. The detainees said they have written repeatedly to Lammy and other justice officials without receiving a response.</p><p>James Timpson, the UK minister of state for prisons, probation and reducing reoffending, said the government would not engage directly with the hunger strikers or their representatives.</p><p>“We are very experienced at dealing with hunger strikes,” Timpson said. “Over the last five years, we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year. I do not treat any prisoners differently to others. We have a justice system based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The armed group has previously said it will not give up its weapons as long as Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory continues, but was willing to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/11/hamas-has-its-own-disarmament-vision-as-gaza-truce-enters-critical-phase\">set them aside</a> and offered a long truce of seven to 10 years.</p><h2 id=\"strikes-on-iran\">Strikes on Iran</h2><p>Trump went on to suggest that Iran may be working to restore its nuclear programme after the US <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/us-says-its-strikes-degraded-irans-nuclear-programme-by-one-to-two-years\">air strikes</a> in June damaged three Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p>“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump told reporters. “We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But, hopefully, that’s not happening.”</p><p>If Iran was trying to build up its nuclear programme again, “we’re going to have no choice but very quickly to eradicate that buildup”, he said. The consequences of such a move could be “more powerful than the last time”.</p><p>“We know exactly where they’re going, what they’re doing, and I hope they’re not doing it, because we don’t want to waste fuel on a B-2,” Trump added, referring to the bomber used in the earlier strike. “It’s a 37-hour trip both ​ways. I don’t want to waste a lot of fuel.”</p><p>The US president declined to offer evidence to support his allegations against Iran. But he added that the US and Israel have been “extremely victorious” against their enemies, and that if the US “didn’t beat Iran, you wouldn’t have had peace in the Middle East”.</p><p>When asked whether the US would back an Israeli attack on Iran’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/26/netanyahu-pushes-for-iran-conflict-clashing-with-trumps-priorities\">missile programme</a>, Trump said, “If they will continue with the missiles, yes. The nuclear? Fast. OK? One will be: Yes, absolutely. The other is: We’ll do it immediately.”</p><p>There was no immediate comment from Iran.</p><p>Tehran has denied seeking to build a nuclear weapon and ruled out negotiating over its missile programme, which is at the core of its defence strategy.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>During the conflict in June, sometimes referred to as the 12-day war, Iran fired hundreds of missiles in response to Israeli attacks that killed the country’s top generals, several nuclear scientists and hundreds of civilians.</p><p>US Senator Lindsey Graham, an Iran hawk who is close to Trump, visited Israel this month and repeated the Netanyahu government’s talking points about the dangers of Iran’s long-range missiles. He warned that Iran is producing them “in very high numbers”.</p><p>“We cannot allow Iran to produce ballistic missiles because they could overwhelm the Iron Dome,” he told The Jerusalem Post, referring to Israel’s air defence system. “It’s a major threat.”</p><h2 id=\"much-harsher-response\">‘Much harsher’ response</h2><p>On Monday, Trump said Iran should “make a deal” with the US.</p><p>“If they want to make a deal, that’s much smarter,” Trump said. “You know, they could have made a deal the last time, before we went through a big attack on them, and they decided not to make the deal. They wish they made that deal.”</p><p>While the US has brokered three ceasefires involving its longtime ally – between Israel and Hamas, Israel and Iran, and Israel and Lebanon – Netanyahu is wary of Israel’s ​foes rebuilding their forces after they were considerably weakened in multiple wars.</p><p>Overall, Trump’s comments suggest he remains firmly in Netanyahu’s camp, even as some aides have privately questioned the Israeli leader’s commitment to ‌the Gaza ceasefire. Trump’s comments also suggest that he is willing to risk additional hostilities related to Gaza and Iran, even as the US president has taken credit for resolving Israel’s wars in both places.</p><p>The sabre-rattling on Monday also came weeks after the Trump administration released a <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">National Security Strategy</a> that called for the US to shift its foreign policy resources away from the Middle East and instead focus on the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>But advocates of the strategy warn that another episode of attacking Iran may escalate into a longer, broader war.</p><p>In June, Iran responded to the US strikes with a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/23/hld-irans-attack-on-al-udeid-air-base-in-qatar-all-you-need-to-know\">missile attack</a> against a US airbase in Qatar, which did not result in any US casualties. Trump announced a ceasefire to end the war shortly after the Iranian response.</p><p>Trita Parsi, the executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a US think tank that promotes diplomacy, told Al Jazeera last week that the Iranian response would be “much harsher” if the country is attacked again.</p><p>“The Iranians understand that, unless they strike back hard and dispel the view that Iran is a country that you can bomb every six months, unless they do that, Iran will become a country that Israel will bomb every six months,” Parsi said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It can’t exert enough power to bring those minority groups into the fold,” he said, adding that it also doesn’t want to do so in an “oppressive or repressive way that would only alienate them further”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-will-happen-next\">What will happen next?</h2><p>Over the next few days, Geist Pinfold said, there could be two potential outcomes.</p><p>“The positive outcome would be that the Syrian government reaches some kind of understanding or a tentative understanding with the SDF in eastern Syria that points towards a kind of roadmap for a future integration,” he noted, adding that such a step could ease tensions not only in eastern Syria but in other regions as well.</p><p>However, he warned that continued violence could spark deeper ethnic and sectarian divides.</p><p>“Syria stands on the edge of a very, very dangerous precipice,” he cautioned, comparing the risk to Iraq’s descent into mass sectarian violence after the 2003 United States-led invasion.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In 2021, such groups held only 17 seats.</p><p>Their growing presence in parliament potentially presents a problem not only for Iraq’s relations with foreign powers, but for Iraqi Shias who resent Tehran’s powerful influence in the country.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Still, Congress has passed “numerous statutes that grant the president limited emergency powers under limited circumstances to do specific things”.</p><p>Nearly every modern president has used emergency powers with varying degrees of gusto, with Congress and the Supreme Court historically wary of reining in those actions.</p><p>Like many US presidents, Trump has also used broad and ambiguous national security claims to justify expanding his reach.</p><p>But several factors have set Trump’s second term apart, most notably the lack of distinct inciting events for many of the powers claimed, Driesen said.</p><p>“I’ve never seen a president invoke emergency powers to justify practically all of this policy agenda,” he told Al Jazeera, “and I’ve also never seen a president use them to seize powers that really are not in the statutes at all.”</p><p>Put simply, he added, “to Trump, everything is an emergency”.</p><p>The tone was set on <a href=\"/news/2025/1/22/how-trumps-executive-orders-will-roll-out-if-courts-allow\">day one</a>, with Trump’s broad executive order declaring that irregular crossings at the southern border meant nothing less than “America’s sovereignty is under attack”. The order has been used to indefinitely suspend <a href=\"/news/2025/11/17/us-supreme-court-to-weigh-metering-of-asylum-claims-at-us-mexico-border\">US asylum obligations</a>, surge forces to the border, and seize federal land.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The same day, Trump declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to designate Tren de Aragua (TdA) and La Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) as “foreign terrorist organizations”, posing a threat to the “national security, foreign policy, and economy” of the US.</p><p>The administration has, in part, relied on and expanded that order in efforts to circumvent due process in its mass deportation push and to rhetorically justify a militaristic approach to Latin America.</p><p>Simultaneously, Trump also declared a <a href=\"/news/2025/1/23/as-trump-turns-to-fossil-fuels-europe-sprints-ahead-with-renewables\">wide-ranging energy emergency</a> on his first day in office, laying the groundwork to bypass environmental regulations.</p><p>To be sure, as Bowman explained, Trump’s use of official emergency statutes has been only a piece of the puzzle, combined with his broad interpretation of constitutionally mandated power to reshape the government in ways big and small.</p><p>That has included cleaving civil servants from congressionally created government departments via the <a href=\"/podcasts/2025/6/2/the-take-what-did-elon-musk-get-from-doge-and-whats\">Department of Government Efficiency</a> (DOGE), trying to fire heads of independent agencies, renaming institutions – possibly illegally – in his likeness, and allegedly bypassing required approvals to physically transform the White House.</p><p>But the invocation of emergency statutes has remained a backbone of his second term. Trump invoked an emergency to justify <a href=\"/news/2025/12/12/icc-judges-stoic-in-face-of-us-sanctions-over-israeli-war-crimes-cases\">sanctioning</a> the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its investigations into Israeli war crimes in Gaza.</p><p>He used the “emergency” of fentanyl smuggling to justify tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, later unilaterally labelling the drug “weapons of mass destruction”.</p><p>In April, in one of his most challenged uses of an emergency authority, Trump cited an emergency statute to impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs against nearly all US trading partners.</p><h2 id=\"a-mixed-picture\">A ‘mixed picture’</h2><p>In review, 2025 has shown virtually no willingness from Congress, where both chambers remain narrowly controlled by Trump’s Republican Party, to challenge the president.</p><p>Rulings from lower federal courts, meanwhile, have offered a “mixed picture”, according to the University of Missouri’s Bowman, while the country’s top court has left wider questions unanswered.</p><p>Bowman noted the six conservative members of the nine-judge panel ascribe to varying degrees to the “unitary executive theory”, which argues the drafters of the constitution envisioned a strong consolidation of presidential power.</p><p>“On the one hand, Trump is obviously willing to declare emergencies where no rational person would really believe they exist,” Bowman said.</p><p>“On the other hand, at least the lower courts have pushed back, but it remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court will back them up.”</p><p>For example, Trump has been <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/trump-can-keep-national-guard-in-washington-dc-for-now-appeals-court\">temporarily allowed</a> to continue the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, DC, a federal district where he declared a “crime emergency” in August. City officials have said the characterisation defies facts on the ground.</p><p>Despite claiming similar overlapping crime and immigration crises in liberal-led cities in states across the country, Trump has had far less success. Lower courts have limited deployments of the National Guard in California, Illinois, and Oregon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has also floated, but not yet invoked, the <a href=\"/news/2025/10/16/insurrection-act-what-is-it-and-does-us-president-have-plenary-authority\">Insurrection Act</a>, another law in the crisis portfolio dating back to 1792 that allows the president to deploy the military for domestic law enforcement to “suppress insurrections and repel invasions”.</p><p>A judicial response to the tactics behind Trump’s deportation drive has also been mixed.</p><p>Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act – a 1798 law designed to quickly expel foreign nationals during times of war – to swiftly deport undocumented individuals without due process has been <a href=\"/news/2025/5/16/us-supreme-court-blocks-the-trump-administrations-use-of-alien-enemies-act\">constrained</a>, but allowed to proceed by the Supreme Court with limited due process protections.</p><p>In one of the most-watched cases on the docket, the Supreme Court is expected to make a ruling when it returns to session in January on the legal justification of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs.</p><p>A lower court has <a href=\"/news/2025/5/29/trumps-tariffs-ruled-illegal-what-that-means-for-us-trade-war\">previously ruled</a> that Trump deployed the emergency statute illegally. Some conservative justices on the top court have also expressed wariness over the president’s claim.</p><p>The panel has appeared more amenable in a landmark case determining whether Trump can fire heads of independent agencies, also set to be decided in the new year.</p><h2 id=\"the-spectre-of-war\">The spectre of war</h2><p>When it comes to unilaterally making war, Trump has been bounding down a well-trodden path of misused presidential power, according to Matt Duss, the executive vice president of the Washington, DC-based Center for International Policy.</p><p>The end of the year has been marked by US military strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats from Venezuela, decried by rights groups as <a href=\"/news/2025/12/19/war-on-terror-defence-of-trump-boat-strikes-doesnt-hold-water-experts\">extrajudicial killings</a>.</p><p>The administration has claimed, without evidence, that over 100 people killed had sought to destabilise the US by flooding it with drugs. Trump has made a similar claim about the Nicolas Maduro-led government in Venezuela, as he has continued to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/opening-pandoras-box-what-happens-if-the-us-attacks-venezuela\">rattle the sabre</a> of land strikes.</p><p>The actions have been accompanied by a <a href=\"/news/2025/9/5/us-department-of-defense-to-be-renamed-department-of-war-report\">pugilistic rebranding</a> of the Department of Defense as the Department of War, a reframing of criminal Latin American cartels as so-called “narcoterrorists” and <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-national-security\">declaring</a> a new drive to bring the Western Hemisphere firmly under the US sphere of influence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“We have to understand this in the context of multiple administrations of both parties abusing executive authority to essentially go to war,” said Duss, who explained that the practice accelerated in the so-called “<a href=\"/news/2023/5/1/the-us-war-on-terror-20-years-after-mission-accomplished\">global war on terror</a>” post-September 11, 2001 attacks.</p><p>Most recently, Republicans – and a handful of Democrats – in the House of Representatives voted down two separate war powers resolutions that would require congressional approval for future strikes on alleged drug boats or on Venezuelan territory.</p><p>The vote, Duss said, underscored “Trump’s near-total control of the Republican Party despite the fact that he is blatantly violating his own campaign promises to end wars, rather than to start them”.</p><h2 id=\"public-opinion\">Public opinion</h2><p>Trump’s control over his party and his influence writ-large over the country will largely be tested in next year’s midterm elections. The vote will determine control of the House and the Senate.</p><p>A slate of polls has indicated at least some degree of wariness in Trump’s use of presidential power.</p><p>In particular, a Quinnipiac poll released in mid-December found 54 percent of voters think Trump is going too far in his authority claims, while 37 percent think he is handling the role correctly. Another 7 percent believe Trump should go further in using the power of the presidency.</p><p>Another Politico poll in November found that 53 percent of US residents think Trump has too much power, while the president has seen an overall slump in his approval ratings since taking office.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>To be sure, a panoply of factors determine US elections, and it remains unclear if voters were more likely to respond to the results of Trump’s approach to the presidency, or to the approach itself.</p><p>“Does the average person really think much about any of the theoretical bases for the things Trump is doing? And frankly, would the average person care very much if the results were, in the short term, results of which they approved?” University of Missouri’s Bowman mused.</p><p>“I don’t know the answer … How all this is perceived across the country, and what’s going to happen next, is anybody’s guess.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
