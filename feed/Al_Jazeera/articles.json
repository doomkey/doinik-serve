He is the first US president to not only face criminal charges but to be convicted.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>James, meanwhile, was among the officials who spearheaded civil proceedings against him.</p><p>She took office in January 2019 and has since filed several lawsuits against Trump and his policies.</p><p>But one of the most high-profile has been the 2022 case in which she accused Trump of inflating the value of his assets — including his real estate properties and golf clubs — to defraud banks and lenders.</p><p>In February 2024, Trump and his sons were ordered to pay $454m in the case, though the president continues to appeal that ruling. Trump has argued his financial statements actually under-valued his assets.</p><p>Separately, James successfully filed a lawsuit against the NRA and its founder, Wayne LaPierre, for misusing millions in funding for the group. Trump maintains close ties to the anti-gun control lobby group.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"revenge-on-political-adversaries\">Revenge on political adversaries?</h2><p>For years, Trump has alleged that he is the subject of a political “witch hunt”.</p><p>Those who prosecuted him, he argues, have abused their office for political gain, in an alleged effort to dampen his popularity among voters.</p><p>Trump has expressed <a href=\"/news/2025/3/20/lunatic-trumps-long-history-of-abusing-judges-who-oppose-him\">particular ire</a> towards James, calling her a “horrible person” and a “total crook” in May.</p><p>That month, the Justice Department, under his authority, opened an investigation into James’s real estate holdings, alleging she misrepresented her property records to obtain more favourable loans.</p><p>Trump has also argued that statements James made on the campaign trail indicate her political bias against him.</p><p>While running for office in 2018, for instance, James called Trump “illegitimate”, “incompetent” and “ill-equipped to serve in the highest office of this land”.</p><p>Friday’s subpoenas come on the heels of other investigations that critics perceive as retribution from Trump against his political adversaries.</p><p>Just this week, the Department of Justice also announced it would open an investigation into members of the administration of former President Barack Obama, a longtime target of Trump’s criticisms.</p><p>The probe centres on intelligence community reports examining whether Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election, which Trump won.</p><p>The reports concluded that Russia sought to sway the election through disinformation, though no votes were tampered with. They also suggested that Russia favoured Trump over his Democratic rival, something Trump has since described as an effort to delegitimise his victory.</p><p>Trump has since accused Obama of “treason”, although no evidence has emerged of wrongdoing.</p><p>The Department of Justice has also recently sought to purge career employees who worked on two federal criminal cases filed against Trump after he left office in 2021.</p><p>The first related to <a href=\"/news/2024/11/14/us-special-counsel-seeks-pause-in-trump-classified-documents-case\">classified documents</a> Trump took from the White House after his 2020 election defeat.

Trump went so far as to call for Boasberg’s removal, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114183576937425149\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writing</a> on Truth Social in March: “This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"weighing-penalties-for-contempt\">Weighing penalties for contempt</h2><p>In April, Boasberg determined that the Trump administration’s actions showed a “willful disregard” for his ruling. He concluded that “probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt”.</p><p>A contempt finding can result in <a href=\"/news/2025/4/18/trump-faces-contempt-risk-what-happens-if-president-violates-court-orders\">various sanctions</a>, including fines and prison time, although it remains unclear what penalties the Trump administration could have faced.</p><p>“The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily,” Boasberg continued. “Indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.”</p><p>Trump’s Department of Justice, for its part, maintained that Boasberg had tread on the president’s executive power in issuing the order.</p><p>Also in April, the US Supreme Court lifted Boasberg’s temporary restraining orders against using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.</p><p>But it nevertheless ruled that the targeted immigrants “are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal” before their deportations.</p><p>The Trump administration has faced persistent scrutiny over whether it was complying with that order, as well as other decisions from lower courts that interfered with its deportation campaign.</p><p>Critics have accused the president and his allies of simply ignoring rulings they disagreed with, raising questions of contempt in other cases, as well.</p><h2 id=\"inside-friday-s-appeals-court-ruling\">Inside Friday’s appeals court ruling</h2><p>But the two Trump-appointed judges on the appeals court, Katsas and Rao, upheld the Trump administration’s position that Boasberg’s rulings had gone too far.</p><p>“The district court’s order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses,” Katsas wrote.</p><p>He compared Boasberg’s order to recall the deportation flights to a district court’s order in July 1973 that sought to halt the US bombing of Cambodia. Within hours, however, the Supreme Court upheld a stay on that opinion, allowing the bombing to proceed.</p><p>“Any freestanding order to turn planes around mid-air would have been indefensible,” Katsas wrote, citing that 1973 case.</p><p>But Pillard — the Obama-appointed judge — offered a counterargument in her dissent, pointing out that the US is not currently at war.</p><p>She also noted that the Venezuelan men who were deported on the March flights had, by and large, not faced criminal charges. Yet, the US had chosen to deport them to El Salvador for imprisonment in a maximum-security facility with a history of human rights abuses.</p><p>“Whatever one might think about a Supreme Court Justice’s emergency order superintending an ongoing military operation, the authority of a federal district court to temporarily restrain government officials from transferring presumptively noncriminal detainees to a foreign prison without any pre-removal process is well recognized,” Pillard wrote.</p><p>The appeals court’s decision comes just days after the Department of Justice announced it had filed a formal complaint against Boasberg, accusing him of misconduct for public comments he made criticising the Trump administration’s approach to the judiciary.</p><p>Critics have called the complaint a blatant retaliation and evidence of an increasing <a href=\"/news/2025/7/31/pam-bondi-who-is-trumps-attorney-general-handling-the-epstein-files\">politicalisation</a> of the Justice Department.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She emphasised that her country is not at risk of US intervention.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“There will be no invasion of Mexico,” <a href=\"/news/2025/5/15/claudia-sheinbaum-denounces-proposed-us-remittance-tax-as-unacceptable\">Sheinbaum</a> said.</p><p>“We were informed that this executive order was coming and that it had nothing to do with the participation of any military personnel or any institution in our territory.”</p><p>The Mexican leader has previously warned that any US military activity on Mexican territory would be a serious violation of the country’s sovereignty.</p><p>The possibility, however, has been raised in the past, particularly by politicians on the US right. In 2023, for instance, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis — then a candidate for president — repeatedly pledged to authorise use of force against drug cartels on Mexican soil.</p><p>Other Republican politicians, like Representative Dan Crenshaw, also <a href=\"/news/2023/3/9/mexicos-president-slams-calls-for-us-military-to-target-cartels\">proposed legislation</a> to greenlight military action against the cartels.</p><p>Such claims have been met with anger in Mexico, where a long history of US intervention has contributed to a strong belief in the need to uphold national sovereignty.</p><p>Still, in May, Trump confirmed that, earlier this year, he offered to send US troops to help combat drug trafficking in Mexico. For her part, Sheinbaum said she <a href=\"/news/2025/5/3/sheinbaum-says-she-rejected-trumps-offer-to-send-us-troops-to-mexico\">firmly rebuffed</a> the idea.</p><p>“I told him, ‘No, President Trump, our territory is inviolable, our sovereignty is inviolable, our sovereignty is not for sale,’” she said at the time.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"wide-consequences-for-the-region\">Wide consequences for the region</h2><p>Trump’s heavy-handed approach has also caused frustration in other parts of Latin America, as well as thorny legal and ethical issues.</p><p>Since taking office for a second term in January, Trump has repeatedly stretched the bounds of executive power by claiming that the US faces an “invasion” of criminal immigrants, thereby authorising him to take extreme action.</p><p>But legal experts say it is unclear what the US military might be able to do within the constraints of domestic and international law.</p><p>The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prohibits the military from being used as a domestic policing force. Local and federal law enforcement are, therefore, the entities that helm operations on domestic soil to disrupt and arrest gangs.</p><p>International laws, meanwhile, restrict military actions abroad except in instances of self-defence. The United Nations charter, for instance, includes language that calls on its members to refrain from “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.</p><p>Attacking people outside of combat situations might also infringe upon international humanitarian law.</p><p>Critics have also questioned the efficacy of taking such a strong-armed approach to gangs, drug cartels and other groups.</p><p>After Trump designated many such groups as “terrorist organisations”, human rights groups pointed out that civilians who live in gang-controlled territory could inadvertently be sanctioned, as they are often forced to pay the gangs through coercion.</p><p>Reports that Trump signed the authorisation for military action also come at a tense time for US-Latin American relations.</p><p>The US president recently placed high tariffs on Brazil, in an effort to end a trial against his right-wing ally Jair Bolsonaro over his alleged involvement in a coup plot.</p><p>Brazilian President <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/6/brazil-requests-world-trade-organization-consultation-over-trump-tariffs\">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> called Trump’s actions “unacceptable” and described them as an effort to interfere in the sovereignty of another country.</p></div></div></body></html>"

One of the officials who spoke to Reuters said the defence purchases could go ahead once India had clarity on tariffs and the direction of bilateral ties, but “just not as soon as they were expected to”.</p><p>Written instructions had not been given to pause the purchases, another official said, indicating that India had the option to quickly reverse course, though there was “no forward movement at least for now”.</p><p>New Delhi, which has forged a close partnership with the US in recent years, has said it is being unfairly targeted and that Washington and its European allies continue to trade with Moscow when it is in their interest.</p><p>Reuters reported that discussions on India’s purchases of Stryker combat vehicles, made by General Dynamics Land Systems, and Javelin antitank missiles, developed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, had been paused due to the tariffs.</p><p>Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in February announced plans to pursue procurement and joint production of those items.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>Singh had also been planning to announce the purchase of six Boeing P8I reconnaissance aircraft and support systems for the Indian Navy during his now-cancelled trip, two of the people said.</p><p>Talks over procuring the aircraft in a proposed $3.6bn deal were at an advanced stage, according to the officials.</p><p>Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics referred queries to the Indian and US governments.

India has in recent years, however, shifted to importing from Western powers like France, Israel and the US, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute think tank.</p><p>The shift in suppliers was driven partly by constraints on Russia’s ability to export arms, which it is utilising heavily in its invasion of Ukraine. Some Russian weapons have also performed poorly in the battlefield, according to Western analysts.</p><p>The broader US-India defence partnership, which includes intelligence sharing and joint military exercises, continues without hiccups, one of the Indian officials said.</p><p>India also remains open to scaling back on oil imports from Russia and is open to making deals elsewhere, including the US, if it can get similar prices, according to two other Indian sources speaking to Reuters.</p><p>Trump’s threats and rising anti-US sentiment in India have “made it politically difficult for Modi to make the shift from Russia to the US”, one of the people said. Nonetheless, discounts on the landing cost of Russian oil have shrunk to the lowest since 2022.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>While the rupture in US-India ties was abrupt, there have been strains in the relationship. New Delhi has repeatedly rebutted Trump’s claim that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after four days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Trump also hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.</p><p>In recent months, Moscow has been actively pitching India on buying new defence technologies like its S-500 surface-to-air missile system, according to one of the Indian officials, as well as a Russian source familiar with the talks.</p><p>India currently does not see a need for new arms purchases from Moscow, two Indian officials said.</p><p>But India is unlikely to wean itself off Russian weapons entirely as the decades-long partnership between the two powers means Indian military systems will continue to require Moscow’s support, one of the officials said.</p><p>The Russian embassy in New Delhi did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The United States did it again. Just a week before the United Nations Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development in Seville, the Trump administration walked out, pulling out of negotiations and refusing to attend the world’s most important conference for coordinating how countries finance sustainable development. It was a dramatic, if familiar, abdication of responsibility. And although the rest of the world adopted the Seville Commitment (Compromiso de Sevilla) outcome document by consensus, the result was far from bold.</p><p>Wealthy creditor nations pushed back against a proposal to establish a meaningful UN-led process for addressing debt distress among lower-income countries. The document’s most ambitious provisions on debt triggered formal objections from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and others. Their resistance made it painfully clear that transformational change in the global financial system will not come with wealthy countries in charge. If low and middle-income countries are to secure the resources and policies they need to invest in their futures, they should take a page from rich countries’ playbook: organise into a club to protect their own interests.</p><p>The global economy is held back by a destabilising disconnect between creditor-led promises and borrower realities. The poorest and most vulnerable countries paid a record $96.2bn to service their external debt in 2023, according to the World Bank, with interest costs surging to $34.6bn. More than half of low-income countries are in or near debt distress. Governments are being forced to shift limited public resources away from health, education, infrastructure and climate adaptation to repay debt taken on during periods of low interest rates and looser global financing. These countries may not yet be defaulting on their debt obligations, but they are defaulting on development. The question now is not whether the system must change, but who will lead that change. As UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed put it, it is time to “flip the orthodoxy”.</p><p>By pooling resources, sharing data and coordinating strategies, debtor countries could begin to shift the balance of power and negotiate from a position of collective strength. A Borrower’s Club offers a path towards a more equitable and strategic approach to debt and development. Without it, governments will remain constrained by a system that drains public resources, weakens institutions, and limits progress on everything from healthcare to climate resilience.</p><p>The mounting debt pressures facing the Global South reflect a financial system that consistently disadvantages borrower countries. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), at least half of low- and middle-income countries spend more than 10 percent of their tax revenues on interest payments alone. More than 3.3 billion people live in countries where debt service outpaces health spending, and more than two billion people live in countries where education receives less funding than creditors. These pressures are worsening. Loans taken out during the era of ultra-low interest rates are now being refinanced at far higher costs, even as global growth slows and government revenues stagnate. With development assistance falling and financing conditions tightening, public budgets across the Global South are stretched to breaking point.</p><p>This is not the first time the world has faced a debt crisis. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) spearheaded the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), securing debt write-offs for dozens of low-income countries and enabling increased investment in poverty reduction. But those programmes were narrow in scope, slow to implement and left many struggling countries behind. More recently, the G20 introduced the Common Framework for Debt Treatments, intended to offer a coordinated process for restructuring debt. Yet only a few countries have used it, and none have completed it with a durable solution. The process remains opaque, creditor-dominated, and too sluggish to meet the urgency of the current crisis.</p><p>In a recent report, economists Joseph Stiglitz and Martin Guzman outlined one of the most credible reform agendas yet proposed: a detailed framework for restructuring sovereign debt that includes longer loan maturities, lower interest rates, and, when necessary, reductions in principal. Their approach is designed for today’s more complex creditor landscape, where commercial lenders and non-traditional actors like China play a major role. But even the best technical proposals need political backing. A Borrower’s Club could help consolidate and amplify these ideas, enabling debtor countries to move in concert rather than in isolation.</p><p>By aligning strategies, sharing information, and speaking with one voice, such a club could help shift the balance of power and turn sound reform proposals into actionable policies. It would mirror tactics long employed by wealthy creditors, who have historically coordinated through clubs of their own: the Paris Club, the G7, the G20. Even private lenders have the Institute of International Finance (IIF) to safeguard their interests. Borrowers rarely have comparable collective leverage. A club could begin to change that.</p><p>To work, a Borrower’s Club will need political champions, a shared strategy and a clear mandate. It must also confront real challenges. Some governments may hesitate to publicly align themselves with a coalition of heavily indebted countries, fearing market or political backlash. Finance ministers in distress may worry about signalling weakness. There are also complex questions about how to involve major creditors, including private bondholders and lenders such as China. Chinese loan contracts often include confidentiality clauses that prevent borrowers from disclosing their existence or terms, complicating transparency and coordination. What incentives could joint repayment arrangements offer? How would the club interact with the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, whose cooperation is helpful but never guaranteed?</p><p>Answering these questions will take coordination and creativity. One option could be to establish a standing borrower-led secretariat to provide technical assistance, legal support and shared data infrastructure for joint negotiations. Participation in the club could be conditional on adopting a transparency commitment, long demanded by civil society. To bring in new lenders, the club could offer pooled repayment mechanisms or third-party trustees, reducing risk for creditors while protecting the fiscal space of borrower nations. Multilateral institutions may not welcome a shift in bargaining power, but they cannot afford to ignore it either.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>The idea is not new. In the 1980s, Latin American countries launched an early initiative to coordinate as debtors and increase their collective bargaining power. That effort quickly fell apart as creditors isolated key countries and weakened their unity. Today, however, the context is different. Borrowing countries face shared global shocks, more diffuse creditors, and a fractured international financial order. Efforts by Global South coalitions such as the Organisation of Southern Cooperation and economists like Grieve Chelwa show that momentum is building for borrower coordination. With more data, more cooperation, and more experience, a Borrower’s Club formed today could avoid past missteps and build real influence.</p><p>Coordination is never easy, and some governments will be cautious. But with debt burdens rising, budgets under pressure and global financial governance stuck in gridlock, the greater risk is doing nothing. Creditors have had their clubs for decades. It is time borrowers had one, too.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

Over that period of time, researchers tracked specific blue whale vocalisations linked to feeding (called D-calls) and mating (called patterned songs).</p><p>Researchers used continuous recordings from underwater devices called hydrophones, which can log sounds over thousands of kilometres, and which were placed in the South Taranaki Bight – a known foraging spot for blue whales off the west coast of New Zealand.</p><p>They discovered that during some periods, particularly in the warmer months of spring and summer when whales usually fatten up, the frequency and intensity of sounds related to feeding activity dropped – suggesting a reduction in food sources. That decline was followed by reduced occurrences of patterned songs, signalling a dip in reproductive activity.</p><p id=\"article-newsletter-slot\" data-testid=\"article-newsletter-slot\"></p><p>“When there are fewer feeding opportunities, they put less effort into reproduction,” lead researcher Dawn Barlow told reporters. The results of that study were<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36861024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> published </a>in the journal Ecology and Evolution in 2023.</p><p>Then, in a <a href=\"https://www.mbari.org/news/a-tale-of-two-whales-songs-reveal-levels-of-resilience-among-whales/\">study</a> published in the scientific journal PLOS One in February this year, researchers tracked baleen whale sounds in the California Current Ecosystem, the area in the North Pacific Ocean stretching from British Columbia to Baja California. Blue whales are a type of baleen whale, and the study focused on them, alongside their cousins, humpback whales and fin whales.</p><p>Over six years starting in 2015, the scientists found distinct patterns. Over the first two years, “times were tough for whales”, lead researcher John Ryan, of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California, noted in a press statement, as the whales, particularly blue whales, were found to be singing less. Over the next three years, however, all three whale species were back to singing more frequently, the study noted.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3877132\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3877132\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3877132\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP793437681499-1754568744.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C597&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A blue whale\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3877132\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A blue whale swims in the waters of Long Beach, California, the US [Nick Ut/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"why-are-blue-whales-singing-less\">Why are blue whales singing less?</h2><p>Both studies found one main reason for the reduction of whale song: food or, in this case, the lack of it.</p><p>It turns out that the research, conducted between 2015 and 2020, captured periods of extreme marine heatwave events that killed off krill, the small shrimp-like animals that blue whales feed on.</p><p>Those heatwaves are part of a looming environmental catastrophe scientists have been warning about: ongoing global warming marked by increases in global average temperatures, and caused by high-emission human activities, chief among them being the burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>Scientists say the world could soon reach a tipping point at which there will be irreversible change to the planet. Already, 2016, 2023 and 2024 have been recorded as the warmest years ever.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-food-sources-disappearing-for-whales\">Why are food sources disappearing for whales?</h2><p>Krill, which blue whales primarily feed on, are highly sensitive to heat and can all but vanish during heatwaves, the studies found. Their movement patterns also change drastically: instead of staying together, as they usually do, krill disperse when it is hot, making them harder for predators like blue whales to find.</p><p>Typically, when foraging, blue whales sing to others to signal that they have found swarms of krill. If there is no food to sing about, it makes sense that there will be no singing.</p><p>Heatwaves can also trigger harmful chemical changes in the oceans that encourage the growth of toxic algae, which causes poisoning and death to mammals in the oceans and sea birds, researchers have previously <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL070023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found,</a> suggesting that blue whales are also at risk of being poisoned.</p><p>In the more recent study in California, researchers found that in the first two years when whales were singing less frequently, there was also a reduction in other fish populations.</p><h2 id=\"are-blue-whales-more-vulnerable-than-other-whales\">Are blue whales more vulnerable than other whales?</h2><p>The second period of three years witnessed a resurgence of krill and the other fish, along with more whale singing. When krill again declined, blue whales again sang less frequently, while singing from humpback whales continued, the study noted.</p><p>“Compared to humpback whales, blue whales in the eastern North Pacific may be more vulnerable due to not only a smaller population size but also a less flexible foraging strategy,” Ryan, the lead author of the California study said in a statement.</p><p>“These findings can help scientists and resource managers predict how marine ecosystems and species will respond to climate change,” he added.</p><p>It is likely, both studies say, that blue whales need to spend more time and energy finding food when it is scarce, instead of singing.</p><figure id=\"attachment_3877206\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3877206\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3877206\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2407211675-1754571409.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"krill\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3877206\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A mass of krill in the sea [Shutterstock]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"are-other-animals-changing-their-sounds\">Are other animals changing their sounds?</h2><p>Studies have found that climate change is altering the sounds of several other species as well. Nature-related sounds, such as birdsong from certain species, could disappear altogether in some places as warming temperatures alter animal behaviour. For example, some animals might move permanently away from their traditional habitats.</p><p>In New York, scientists <a href=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.0150041175.x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">found</a> that over a century (1900-1999), four frog species changed their calling patterns, which males use to attract females for mating, and which are usually tied to the warming of spring and early summer. Over time, some frogs were calling about two weeks earlier than usual, researchers found, adding that it signified summer was arriving earlier.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
