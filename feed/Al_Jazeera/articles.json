The bill has not yet received a public reading.</p><p>Rodriguez had announced the amnesty legislation last month, saying it was designed “to heal the wounds left by the political confrontation fuelled by violence and extremism”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>She said it would cover what she described as the “entire period of political violence from 1999 to the present”.</p><p>The amnesty bill covers charges of treason, terrorism and spreading hate that were used to lock up dissidents over the past two decades.</p><p>It would not apply to those convicted of murder, drug trafficking, corruption or human rights violations, according to media reports about the legislation.</p><p>Alex Neve, a member of the United Nations’ Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for Venezuela, said earlier this week that the bill “offers an opportunity to provide justice and alleviate the suffering of the many people who have been unlawfully detained for political reasons in Venezuela”.</p><p>However, Neve said that transparency was essential, and civil society groups “must be at the centre of this process”.</p><p>Already, human rights groups have questioned the Rodriguez government’s efforts to free political prisoners.</p><p>The Venezuelan-based human rights group Foro Penal has confirmed at least 431 people have been released – a figure lower than the government’s stated number.</p><p>More than 600 political prisoners remain in custody, according to Foro Penal’s statistics.</p><p>Critics also point to the case of Juan Pablo Guanipa, an opposition politician who was recently released, only to be placed under house arrest.</p><h2 id=\"scrutiny-over-elections\">Scrutiny over elections</h2><p>Still, the amnesty bill has been hailed as a breakthrough for a country that, up until recently, denied having political prisoners at all.</p><p>The bill is also slated to lift measures banning several opposition leaders from running for office, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado.</p><p>The Maduro government had been accused of using state violence to suppress the opposition, including through forced disappearances and torture.</p><p>It had also faced accusations of election rigging, most recently in 2024, when Maduro controversially claimed a third term as president.</p><p>Machado had been elected the opposition coalition’s nominee for the 2024 election, but she was barred from running only months before the vote, as was her successor, <a href=\"/news/2024/3/22/faced-with-an-election-ban-venezuela-opposition-leader-names-alternate\">Corina Yoris</a>.</p><p>Edmundo Gonzalez ultimately took on the role as the opposition’s candidate. The opposition has maintained Gonzalez was the rightful winner of the election, a position backed by independent experts.</p><p>On Monday, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodriguez, the president’s brother, ruled out holding new presidential elections in the immediate future, telling the US media outlet Newsmax that “stabilisation” must first be achieved.</p><p>The Trump administration has also dismissed pressure for new elections in Venezuela, despite Machado’s claims that the opposition has a “mandate” to govern.</p><h2 id=\"trump-denies-oil-magnate-s-role\">Trump denies oil magnate’s role</h2><p>Also on Thursday, Trump took to his Truth Social account to deny that the US oil magnate Harry Sargeant III had authority to make decisions on behalf of his administration in Venezuela.</p><p>“He has no authority, in any way, shape, or form, to act on behalf of the United States of America, nor does anyone else that is not approved by the State Department. Without this approval, no one is authorised to represent our Country,” Trump wrote.</p><p>The post appeared to be in response to media reports that Sargeant had been advising the US administration about how to gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, a top goal for Trump.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Sargeant, who has longstanding ties to Venezuela’s oil industry, is a Republican donor who also plays golf with Trump.</p><p>In his post, Trump added his administration was “dealing very well” with the Rodriguez-led government.</p><p>“Relations between Venezuela and the United States have been, to put it mildly, extraordinary!” Trump said in his post.</p><p>“But we speak only for ourselves, and don’t want there to be any confusion or misrepresentation.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, met with Rodriguez in Caracas, where he touted cooperation on oil production.</p><p>The trip marked the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/us-energy-secretary-chris-wright-touts-oil-production-on-venezuela-visit\">first time</a> a member of Trump’s cabinet had visited the country.</p></div></div></body></html>"

When they return, we are going to send more support of a different type.”</p><p>She also described her country’s role as “opening the doors for dialogue to develop” between Cuba and the US, but she insisted that maintaining Cuba’s sovereignty would be paramount among her priorities.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-pressure-campaign\">A pressure campaign</h2><p>Since January, the administration of US President Donald Trump has sought to cut off the oil supplies that power Cuba’s energy grid and other critical infrastructure.</p><p>The campaign is part of a long-running series of sanctions imposed by the US on the Caribbean island nation, stretching back to the Cold War.</p><p>But the latest effort, under Trump, has experts at the United Nations warning of an imminent humanitarian “collapse” in Cuba, as oil supplies dwindle.</p><p>The oil embargo began on January 3, when Trump authorised a US military operation to attack Venezuela and abduct its then-leader, President Nicolas Maduro, and his wife Cilia Flores.</p><p>Venezuela has long been a close ally of Cuba, not to mention a major oil supplier. But in the aftermath of Maduro’s abduction, Trump <a href=\"/news/2026/1/11/trump-says-no-more-venezuelan-oil-or-money-to-go-to-cuba-and-demands-deal\">announced</a> that much of the economic exchange between the two countries would cease.</p><p>“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115876460615555838\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on January 11 on his Truth Social account.</p><p>“THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA – ZERO!”</p><p>He also indicated that <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/trump-threatens-colombias-petro-says-cuba-looks-like-its-ready-to-fall\">he expected</a> Cuba’s communist government to crumble in the wake of Maduro’s removal.</p><p>“Cuba is ready to fall,” he told reporters on board Air Force One on January 4. “Cuba now has no income. They got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil. They’re not getting any of it.”</p><p>Trump has repeatedly pushed Cuba to “make a deal” to resolve the impasse, though it is unclear what such an agreement would include.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"threat-of-tariffs\">Threat of tariffs</h2><p>But when weeks passed without a negotiated solution, the Trump administration upped the ante. On January 29, it <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">declared</a> the situation in Cuba a “national emergency” for the US.</p><p>It <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/addressing-threats-to-the-united-states-by-the-government-of-cuba/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accused</a> the government in Havana of being an “extraordinary threat” and supporting “hostile actors, terrorism, and regional instability that endanger American security and foreign policy”.</p><p>Paired with this emergency declaration was the announcement that the US would impose tariffs on countries that supply oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly.</p><p>That put Mexico on the defensive. Mexico, like Venezuela, was among the regional trading partners that supplied Cuba with oil.</p><p>But it is also one of the top trading partners for the US. As many as 80 percent of Mexico’s exports go to its northern neighbour, and the two countries are currently part of a regional free-trade agreement.</p><p>Sheinbaum has nevertheless criticised Trump’s oil blockade against Cuba, calling the situation “unfair”.</p><p>Cuba has long suffered from economic instability, which its government blames on the US sanctions regime. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the island saw shortages of basic supplies, including fuel, sparking one of the island’s largest exoduses in recent history.</p><p>Still, the new Trump-era restrictions on fuel exports to Cuba have brought the island to the brink of a new humanitarian crisis.</p><p>In early February, Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the situation on the island had grown dire. Already, blackouts are a chronic problem.</p><p>“I can tell you that the secretary-general is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,” Dujarric said.</p><p>The US has also announced this month it will supply <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/mexico-promises-food-support-for-cuba-as-us-stifles-the-islands-fuel-supply\">$6m in humanitarian aid</a> to Cuba, though it said it would avoid disbursing the funds through the Cuban government by going through the Catholic Church instead.</p><p>As the two Mexican ships unloaded their humanitarian cargo on Thursday, locals told international news agencies they were grateful for the show of support.</p><p>Ediberto Rodriguez, a 65-year-old Havana resident, told the news outlet Reuters that the delivery was an “unforgettable gesture” from an ally.</p><p>“Mexico hasn’t abandoned us,” he said. “Even with pressure from a global superpower [the United States], they weren’t afraid.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

His supporters say the allegations were a <a href=\"/news/2022/9/25/what-really-happened-during-labours-anti-semitism-crisis\">manufactured crisis</a> to undermine him because of his support for Palestinian rights.</p><p>Streeting – long seen as a rising star on the right of the party – became one of the most prominent detractors of Corbyn at the time.</p><p>In 2020, Starmer succeeded Corbyn as leader and suspended him from the party months later over accusations of anti-Semitism as he purged Labour of many officials critical of Israel.</p><p>Corbyn retained his Parliament seat as an independent candidate <a href=\"/news/2024/7/5/uk-general-election-2024-results-five-key-takeaways\">in the 2024 vote</a> that swept Labour into power.</p><p>Last year, he cofounded the socialist Your Party.

But securing a foothold in the West Bank – which Smotrich and his settler movement believe they are biblically entitled to – was <a href=\"/news/2022/12/29/who-are-the-ministers-leading-israels-new-far-right-government\">among his demands</a> before agreeing to join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government in 2022.</p><p>Little known internationally before the genocidal war in Gaza began in 2023, Smotrich and his fellow far-right figure, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have become regular fixtures in headlines and government sanction lists around the world. Each has sought to fuel the Gaza war, threatening to collapse the coalition at the first sign of any change in intensity, and pressing on with an illegal campaign of settlement and occupation.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“It’s not that Smotrich is particularly charismatic, or that he’s being driven by his base,” Orly Noy, journalist and editor of the Israeli Hebrew-language magazine Local Call, told Al Jazeera. “It’s more that he’s incredibly ideological and he’s smart,” she said, explaining how, over the years, Smotrich had painstakingly worked to have the mechanisms of West Bank governance shifted from the military to his own, civil control.</p><p>“There shouldn’t be anything surprising in this,” Noy continued.</p><p>“In his early days as a political nonentity, he published what he called his ‘Decisive Plan’,” she said, outlining the strategy published by Smotrich in 2017 whereby Palestinians in the West Bank would be left with three essential options: to leave, to accept Israeli domination, or to face annihilation.</p><p>“People, even those on the right wing, laughed at that and dismissed it,” she said, pausing. “They really shouldn’t.”</p><h2 id=\"religious-zionist-upbringing\">Religious Zionist upbringing</h2><p>Bezalel Smotrich is, in every sense, a child of Israel’s settler movement, and one who draws ideological inspiration from Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, a key figure in shaping religious Zionism in the 20th century.</p><p>Unlike the better-known American rabbi <a href=\"/news/2025/11/14/normalising-hate-israel-leans-in-to-anti-palestinian-violence-rhetoric\">Meir Kahane</a>, whose teachings have been invoked by figures including Ben-Gvir to justify violence, Kook’s ideas have underpinned what their adherents think of as a more high-minded form of ethnic supremacy and colonialism. This ideology casts Israel’s victory in the 1967 war as divinely mandated, but also adds a future Israeli settlement of Palestinian territory as the will of God.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4307361\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4307361\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4307361\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-1371429326-1770884136.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Israel/Palestine: Zvi Yehuda Kook (1891-1982), rabbi, leader of Religious Zionism and Rosh Yeshiva of the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva.

Smotrich remained in the chamber through a shifting variety of right-wing alliances, briefly serving as transport minister for a year in 2019.</p><p>However, it wasn’t until 2022, after Netanyahu brokered a joint electoral slate between Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party and Ben-Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) bloc, that the two finally got access to real power.</p><h2 id=\"far-right-alliance\">Far-right alliance</h2><p>Both men have exploited their positions ruthlessly since, acting in concert to urge Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza on, irrespective of the political and international cost, while seeking to maximise the power of the government ministries under their control.</p><p>For Ben-Gvir, that has meant politicising the security force to such a degree that he now finds himself confronting Israel’s Supreme Court over it. Smotrich, for his part, has continued to channel millions to the settler movement, even as other ministries’ budgets have been cut, while settlements and <a href=\"/news/2025/1/22/mapping-1800-israeli-settler-attacks-in-the-occupied-west-bank-since-october-7\">settler violence</a> have increased.</p><p>Smotrich has also continued to expand his influence over both Palestinian and Jewish residents of the occupied West Bank.</p><p>He was appointed head of the Settlements Administration under his initial deal with Netanyahu, and by <a href=\"/news/2024/6/21/is-israels-smotrich-fulfilling-his-dream-of-annexing-the-west-bank\">June 2024</a>, as global attention focused on the war in Gaza, additional authority was transferred from the military to the Smotrich-headed body.</p><p>“They’re different,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said of Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who, too often, are lumped together. While both politicians rely on the fundamental idea of Jewish supremacy, Goldberg said, “Smotrich wants order. He has a vision for the future; Ben-Gvir isn’t interested in any of that. He’s about hate, racism and a keen desire to burn it all down”.</p><p>“The thing is, many Israelis feel the same way.”</p><p>Throughout, attacks on Palestinians by settlers have become <a href=\"/features/2026/1/22/if-you-sleep-settlers-will-burn-your-house-fear-in-the-west-bank\">more brazen</a> and lethal – and conducted with even greater impunity. Even politicians, such as the parliamentarian Ofer Cassif, who have vocally objected to the settlers’ activities, are <a href=\"/news/2021/4/9/video-shows-police-beating-israeli-politician-in-jerusalem\">not safe from physical assault</a>.</p><p>For Cassif, the blame extends beyond just the settlers’ patrons in government to the more mainstream political establishment, including self-styled opposition figures, such as Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid, who Cassif describes as turning a blind eye to both the settlers’ violence and Smotrich’s agenda.</p><p>“They don’t dare confront these neo-Nazi bigots in the West Bank, who are launching daily pogroms,” Cassif said.</p><p>“They’ve emboldened them. Now they’re attacking both Arabs and activists within Israel proper, and no one does anything,” he said. “Netanyahu, Smotrich and other ministers don’t interfere with these groups and, in return, these groups help finance them.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4300230\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4300230\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4300230\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_6989d7913b305-1770641297.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich holds a map that shows the E1 settlement project during a press conference near the settlement of Maale Adumim, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Aug. 14, 2025.

It will open the way to transfer them based on political reasons,” Jabareen told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“This is the first law that we know in any Western democracy that allows the state to revoke the citizenship of their citizens only for political reasons.</p><p>“As Netanyahu said, this is just the beginning. This means that they are going to revoke more and more citizenships. This is a way of transferring Palestinian citizens,” who make up about 20 percent of Israel’s overall population of about 10 million people.</p><p>Jabareen added that the Israeli government has done this to stoke tension between Palestinian citizens and the state ahead of the October legislative elections. The Israeli “right wing” wants to be seen as attacking Palestinians for “populist reasons and for electoral reasons”, Jabareen said.</p><p>Prior to the 2023 legislation, the Citizenship Law of 1952 already allowed for the revocation of citizenship or residency of Palestinians in Israel and Jerusalem on the grounds of “breach of loyalty to the State of Israel”.</p><p>“Breach of loyalty” is defined to include carrying out an “act of terror,” aiding or soliciting such an act, or “taking an active part” in a “terrorist organisation,” among other activities.</p><h2 id=\"apartheid-which-other-israeli-laws-discriminate-against-palestinians\">‘Apartheid’: Which other Israeli laws discriminate against Palestinians?</h2><p>The 2023 citizen revocation law is aimed primarily at Palestinians and adds to a longstanding body of legislation that is <a href=\"/news/2018/7/19/five-ways-israeli-law-discriminates-against-palestinians\">applied differently</a> to Palestinians in Israel than to Jewish Israelis.</p><p>There are currently about 100 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens in Israel and Palestinian residents of the occupied Palestinian territory, according to Adalah.</p><p>In 2018, Israel’s parliament adopted a controversial “Jewish nation-state” law defining the country as a Jewish homeland, further marginalising Palestinian citizens of Israel. The law stipulates that Jewish people have “an exclusive right to national self-determination”.</p><p>Last November, Israel <a href=\"/news/2025/11/11/israeli-parliament-nods-to-bill-to-introduce-death-penalty-for\">passed</a> a first draft of a death penalty bill, introducing capital punishment for those convicted of killing Israelis if they had “racist” motives or were doing it “with the aim of harming Israel”. The bill is under discussion in the Knesset.</p><p>Legal experts say the law is discriminatory in how it defines “terrorism”. Palestinians’ attacks will most likely be dubbed “racist”, attracting the death penalty.</p><p>In a statement on February 3, Amnesty International <a href=\"/news/2026/2/3/amnesty-demands-israel-drop-death-penalty-bills-entrenching-apartheid\">called on Israel</a> to abandon the bill, warning that the measures would violate international law and “further entrench Israel’s apartheid system” against Palestinians.</p><p>Amnesty’s statement said: “If adopted, these bills would distance Israel from the vast majority of states which have rejected the death penalty in law or in practice, while further entrenching its cruel system of apartheid against all Palestinians whose rights Israel controls.”</p><p>Last week, the Israeli cabinet passed measures aimed at expanding its power across the occupied West Bank, making it easier to seize Palestinian land illegally. This has come despite <a href=\"/news/2024/9/18/un-general-assembly-overwhelmingly-calls-for-end-of-israeli-occupation\">the 2024 UN resolution</a> calling for an end to the illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank.</p><h2 id=\"how-many-palestinians-live-in-israel\">How many Palestinians live in Israel?</h2><p>There are about 1.9 million Palestinians with Israeli citizenship as of 2019, according to Israel’s census.</p><p>Most are descendants of Palestinians who remained inside Israel when it was founded in 1948. About 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled, and thousands more were killed by the Zionist militias, in the lead-up to Israel’s creation. Israel continues to block their right of return while granting Jews from across the world the right to immigrate to Israel, as well as to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.</p><p>More than 750,000 Israelis live in illegal settlements built on Palestinian-owned land in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>In very limited cases, Palestinians who hold residency in East Jerusalem can apply to obtain Israeli citizenship.</p><p>They have to undergo a difficult naturalisation process, and a small number can apply via family links – but for most Palestinians in the illegally occupied territory, current Israeli law makes acquiring citizenship virtually impossible.</p><p>In 2022, Israeli outlet Haaretz reported that only 5 percent of Palestinians in East Jerusalem had successfully obtained Israeli citizenship since 1967.</p><p>For Palestinians who have “permanent” residency status to live in Jerusalem, entry into and residency in Jerusalem is “a revocable privilege, instead of an inherent right”, according to human rights organisation <a href=\"http://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/topics/population-transfer-and-residency-right/1127-residency-revocation-israels-forcible-transfer-of-palestinians-from-jerusalem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Al-Haq</a>.</p><p>Israel does not explicitly deny citizenship to people who are not Jewish.</p><p>However, it has the preferential Law of Return for Jewish people, which provides Jewish people with an almost automatic right to immigrate and receive citizenship. Everyone else, including Palestinians, has to undergo regular naturalisation.</p><p>Palestinians who live in Gaza or the West Bank are typically not allowed to enter Israel, and, in exceptional circumstances, require permits, which are extremely rare and difficult to obtain.</p><p>Even after they obtain permits, they have to pass through several checkpoints and other barriers such as roadblocks, earth mounds, road gates, road barriers and trenches.</p><p>In 2023, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) documented 565 such obstacles in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and excluding the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron.</p><p>However, Palestinian men from the West Bank over the age of 55 and women over the age of 50 can enter East Jerusalem without a permit.</p><p>Jabareen told Al Jazeera that the recent revocations are “part of the war against Palestinians”.</p><p>“Palestinians in Gaza under genocide, Palestinians in West Bank are facing the violence of the settlers and army, and now Palestinian citizens are facing the threat of revoking their citizenship.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-status-of-palestinian-citizens-in-israel\">What is the status of Palestinian citizens in Israel?</h2><p>Besides being subjected to discriminatory legislation, Palestinian citizens face <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/palestinian-citizens-israel-demand-government-do-more-stop-crime\">violence</a> in Israel. In 2025, 300 people were murdered inside Israel. Out of these, <a href=\"/opinions/2026/2/5/heres-why-israel-is-allowing-record-murder-rates-in-its-palestinian-towns\">252</a> were Palestinian citizens.</p><p>Al Jazeera has reported how crime has surged in Palestinian towns and villages across Israel. Gunmen target the homes and businesses of Palestinian citizens.</p><p>About 38 percent of Palestinian households fall below the poverty line in Israel, many well below it, according to Israel’s National Insurance Institute.</p><p>Thousands of Palestinian citizens of Israel are “unable to live a normal life,” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Palestinian member of the Israeli parliament representing the left-wing Hadash-Ta’al faction, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Unemployment is also a crisis facing Palestinian citizens in Israel. Only 54 percent of Palestinian men and 36 percent of Palestinian women in Israel have jobs, after already low employment levels plummeted in tandem with the genocide in Gaza, according to figures from 2024.</p></div></div></body></html>"

bid to clamp down on free speech amid the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/11/russian-drone-kills-father-3-children-in-ukraine-wounds-pregnant-mother\">war in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced the move on Thursday, attributing it to WhatsApp’s “reluctance to comply with the norms and letter of Russian law”.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

turn instead to MAX, a state-sponsored platform touted as a one-stop shop for messaging, online government services and other services like making payments.</p><p>Experts warn that MAX, which openly
