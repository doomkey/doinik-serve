He had been convicted in September.</p><p>But shortly after Bolsonaro was remanded into custody, his defence team <a href=\"/news/2025/11/21/former-president-jair-bolsonaro-asks-to-serve-house-arrest-in-brazil\">filed a request</a> for house arrest, warning of life-threatening conditions behind bars.</p><p>“It is certain that keeping the petitioner in a prison environment would pose a concrete and immediate risk to his physical integrity and even his life,” his lawyers wrote.</p><p>That request, and a subsequent one in December, have been denied.</p><p>On December 23, though, the Supreme Court approved Bolsonaro’s request to leave prison, in order to undergo surgery for a hernia, resulting from damage to his abdominal muscles.</p><p>He travelled to Brasilia’s DF Star hospital to receive treatment and has since pursued other procedures, including a phrenic nerve block treatment and an endoscopy, to address his persistent hiccups.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"election-controversy\">Election controversy</h2><p>A former army captain, Bolsonaro became a rising star in Brazil’s far right and served as president for a single term, from 2019 to 2023.</p><p>During his term, he faced scrutiny for comments he made praising Brazil’s military dictatorship, which ruled the country from 1964 to 1985 and oversaw the systematic torture and killings of political dissidents.</p><p>He also allegedly used his office to cast doubt on the integrity of Brazil’s electronic voting system.</p><p>In 2023, Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) would ultimately bar Bolsonaro from holding public office for eight years, citing instances where he broadcast unfounded allegations about the election system on state TV and social media.</p><p>Still, Bolsonaro was considered a frontrunner going into the 2022 presidential race, where he faced two-term former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p><p>The race advanced to an October 30 run-off. Lula eked out a narrow win, besting the incumbent Bolsonaro by less than two percentage points, with 50.9 percent of the vote.</p><p>In the aftermath, Bolsonaro refused to publicly concede defeat, although media reports indicate he may have done so in private.</p><p>Meanwhile, he and his allies filed a legal challenge against the election outcome that was <a href=\"/news/2022/11/24/brazilian-judge-rejects-attempt-to-overturn-lula-election-victory\">quickly rejected</a> for its “total absence of any evidence”. Bolsonaro’s coalition was fined nearly $4.3m for the “bad faith” petition.</p><p>But the unfounded belief that Bolsonaro’s defeat was somehow illegitimate prompted his supporters to take to the streets. Some blocked highways. Others attacked the federal police headquarters.</p><p>The tensions culminated on January 8, 2023, a week after Lula’s inauguration, when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed Brasilia’s Three Powers Plaza and broke into buildings representing Congress, the presidency and the Supreme Court.</p><p>Some supporters expressed hope that they could lead to a military coup that would remove Lula from power.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4208649\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208649\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4208649\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-22T153855Z_149330271_RC2SJIABOYFY_RTRMADP_3_BRAZIL-ELECTION-BOLSONARO-1767285863.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Flavio Bolsonaro holds bobble heads of his father and Donald Trump\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4208649\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Senator Flavio Bolsonaro holds bobble-head dolls depicting US President Donald Trump and Bolsonaro on December 19, 2025 [Adriano Machado/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"legal-jeopardy\">Legal jeopardy</h2><p>That attack prompted wide-ranging investigations, and in November 2024, federal police <a href=\"/news/2024/11/21/police-accuse-brazil-ex-president-bolsonaro-of-involvement-in-coup-attempt\">issued a sweeping report</a> accusing Bolsonaro and 36 allies of attempting to “violently dismantle” Brazil’s constitutional order.</p><p>The report detailed alleged instances where Bolsonaro and his allies discussed invalidating the election results — or even assassinating Lula.</p><p>Last February, prosecutors <a href=\"/news/2025/2/19/brazilian-prosecutors-charge-ex-president-bolsonaro-over-alleged-coup-plot\">formally charged</a> Bolsonaro and dozens of codefendants for attempting to overthrow the 2022 election.</p><p>His trial unfolded despite high-level international pressure from right-wing figures like United States President Donald Trump, who imposed steep tariffs on Brazil in August to protest against the prosecution.</p><p>Still, in September, Bolsonaro was found guilty on five counts, including attempted coup d’etat, armed conspiracy, attempted abolition of the rule of law, destruction of public property and damage to national heritage.</p><p>Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing throughout the case and has called his prosecution an attempt to silence a political rival.</p><p>He remains a popular figure on the right, and his eldest son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, announced last month his intention to challenge Lula for the presidency this upcoming October.</p><p>Last month, Brazil’s conservative-led Congress also <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/brazils-chamber-of-deputies-passes-bill-to-lower-bolsonaros-sentence\">passed a bill</a> that could shorten Bolsonaro’s sentence, though Lula has pledged to veto it.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Three-quarters of those displaced from el-Fasher had already been displaced previously during the war.</p><p>The IOM also reports that more than 50,000 people were displaced from Sudan between October 25 and December 17. In total, the IOM has recorded more than 9.3 million internally-displaced people (IDPs) in Sudan, with 55 percent of them children.</p><p>Nearly a third of the displaced households reported “at least one member going a whole day and night without eating within the past month due to insufficient food”, according to an IOM <a href=\"https://dtm.iom.int/reports/sudan-displacement-and-return-overview?close=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4208628\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208628\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4208628\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-01-111820-1767284589.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C327&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Drone view of a displacement camp \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4208628\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Displaced Sudanese arriving in Kosti have pitched up tents on the outskirts of town [Screengrab/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"aid-cuts-loom-as-needs-rise\">Aid cuts loom as needs rise</h2><p>Reporting from Kosti camp, Al Jazeera’s Almardi described a grim reality as the humanitarian response is collapsing just as needs skyrocket.</p><p>Despite the influx, international humanitarian organisations have announced reductions in aid starting this month due to <a href=\"/news/2025/12/10/un-rights-office-in-survival-mode-amid-deep-funding-cuts\">funding shortages</a> as donor governments cut spending. This comes as the camps face a severe lack of medical facilities.</p><p>“The biggest challenge is health,” Almardi reported. “There is a significant shortage of medical staff to monitor the displaced, a lack of medicine, and a desperate need for field hospitals.”</p><p>That is particularly important considering the journeys made by the people arriving in Kosti.</p><p>Many of the new arrivals trekked for up to 20 days, some crossing into South Sudan before looping back into Sudan’s White Nile state to find safety. They arrive exhausted, malnourished, and terrified of the approaching winter.</p><p>“The displaced are waiting for the unknown in harsh conditions,” Almardi said. “And the war has not yet ended.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Mohamud, who <a href=\"/news/2025/12/31/israels-recognition-of-somaliland-strange-unexpected-somali-president\">told</a> Al Jazeera that Somaliland had accepted three conditions from Israel: The resettlement of Palestinians, the establishment of a military base on the Gulf of Aden coast, and joining the Abraham Accords to normalise ties with Israel.</p><p>Reports began circulating earlier this year that Somaliland was interested in assisting Israel’s widely condemned aim of <a href=\"/news/2025/9/8/somaliland-recognition-for-forced-transfer-of-palestinians-not-worth-it\">ethnically cleansing Palestinians</a>, as officials in Hargeisa pushed for recognition.</p><p>Somaliland’s foreign minister said no talks had taken place on the issue but stopped short of rejecting the possibility, unlike other countries rumoured to be of interest to Israel.</p><p>Only the final condition has been publicly acknowledged.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Somaliland would join the Accords, telling United States media outlet Newsmax he wanted to “support a democratic, moderate country, a Muslim country, that wants to join the Abraham Accords”.</p><p>Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland as an independent state last week, ending more than three decades of failed bids by the breakaway region of

planning an official visit to Israel in the coming weeks, according to Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster.</p><p>Sources told Kan on Wednesday evening that the visit could take place as early as the second week of January, during which Abdullahi would formally join the Abraham Accords.</p><p>Netanyahu initially invited Cirro during a video call announcing the mutual recognition.</p><p>Somalia’s president warned that Israel’s recognition “was not merely a diplomatic gesture but a cover for specific, high-stakes Israeli strategic objectives”.</p><p>He claimed Israel would “export its problem in Gaza” to the Horn of Africa and described the move as opening “a box of evils in the world”.</p><p>Israel’s motives for suddenly recognising Somaliland remain unclear, though analysts point to the

At the time of the incident, more than 100 people were present, Swiss media outlet Blick reported, quoting police.</p><p>Crans-Montana is about 200km south of the Swiss capital, Bern.</p><p>“There has been an explosion of unknown origin,” Gaetan Lathion, a police spokesperson in Wallis canton in southwestern Switzerland, told the AFP news agency.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p> </p><p>It is unclear how the fire was ignited and spread. However, later on Thursday, AP reported that Swiss officials were calling the blaze an “embrasement generalise”. It explained that this is a French firefighting term which describes how a fire can release combustible gases which can then “ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft”.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-victims\">What do we know about the victims?</h2><p>Frederic Gisler, the police commander in the Valais canton in southwestern Switzerland, said on Thursday that around 40 people had been killed and 115 injured. He added that it would take several days to return bodies to their families.</p><p class=\"p1\">A medical source told broadcaster RTS that hospitals in French-speaking Switzerland had been overwhelmed with burn victims. Most of those injured were in a serious condition, regional councillor Mathias Renard said. Police said that some victims were from other countries.</p><p class=\"p1\">Valais hospital’s intensive care ‌unit is full, and patients were being transferred elsewhere, he added. University Hospital Zurich said it is currently treating 12 patients for burns.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">A spokesperson at Lausanne University Hospital said its burns and intensive care units are treating 22 patients, the youngest of whom is 16 years old.</p><p>In neighbouring Italy, the major burns unit at Milan’s Niguarda hospital has been made available to treat the injured.</p><p>Italy’s ambassador to Switzerland told Italian reporters that it may take “weeks” to identify many of the victims, as their burns are so severe.<strong> </strong></p><figure id=\"attachment_4208180\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4208180\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4208180\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26001387281184-1767266278.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C425&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Swiss fire\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4208180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The interior of a building where a fire broke out, leaving people dead and injured during a New Year’s Eve celebration, in Crans-Montana, Swiss Alps, Switzerland, on Thursday, January 1, 2026 [Police Cantonale Valaisanne via AP]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-have-authorities-responded\">How have authorities responded?</h2><p>After being alerted to the blaze, 10 helicopters, 40 ambulances and 150 responders were sent to the scene. Police said most of the injured have “significant” injuries with severe burns. Many have been taken to the Valais hospital.</p><p>The area around the bar has been completely closed off to the public and a no-fly zone over Crans-Montana has been imposed.</p><p>So far, there is no information about what may have caused the fire. Specialist forensic investigators from Zurich arrived at the scene later on Thursday.</p><p>“We’re just at the beginning of our investigation, but this is an internationally renowned ski resort with lots of tourists,” Lathion said.</p><p>Beatrice Pilloud, the prosecutor-general of the Valais canton in southwestern Switzerland, told the news conference, “currently we are favouring a fire and at no time is there question of any attack”.</p><p>Lathion added that a reception centre and helpline – +41 848 112 117 – have been set up to provide support to affected families. “The intervention is still ongoing,” he added.</p><p>“What was meant to be a moment of joy turned, on the first day of the year in Crans-Montana, into mourning that touches the entire country and far beyond,” Guy Parmelin, the president of the Swiss confederation, wrote in an X post on Thursday.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"how-common-is-an-incident-like-this-in-switzerland\">How common is an incident like this in Switzerland?</h2><p>Incidents like this are uncommon in Switzerland – fires and explosions in recent years have been minor.</p><p>In June 2024, two people were found dead following a blast in an underground parking garage at an apartment building in northern Switzerland, which also injured 11 people. Police told local media that the explosion had been caused by homemade fireworks.</p><p>Possibly the biggest explosion in Swiss history happened at Mitholz Ammunition Depot in December 1947 when 3,000 tonnes of Swiss army ammunition from World War II, which had been buried in the mountains above Mitholz, blew up. Nine people were killed and several others were injured.</p><p>In February 1970, a bomb exploded on a Swissair flight bound for Israel, killing 39 passengers and nine crew members on board. It is unclear who was behind the attack. Some local media reported that a Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) splinter group was behind the bombing, but this has never been confirmed or proven.</p></div></div></body></html>"
