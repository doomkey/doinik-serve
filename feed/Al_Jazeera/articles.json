Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) last-16 tie.</p><p>The game at the Moulay El Hassan Stadium in Rabat, Morocco on Tuesday was edging towards a penalty shootout when Boulbina, a forward who plays club football in Qatar, was released on the left in the 119th minute and advanced into the area before unleashing a vicious strike into the net.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2

sparked wild celebrations within the stadium, with the majority of the 18,837 fans in attendance backing Algeria.</p><p>The 2019 champions, who won all their group games, are looking like serious contenders to win a third continental title, but now face a fascinating quarterfinal showdown with <a href=\"/sports/2026/1/5/osimhen-double-for-nigeria-downs-mozambique-to-seal-afcon-quarterfinal-spot\">Victor Osimhen’s Nigeria</a> in Marrakesh on Saturday.</p><p>The outcome is a painful one for the Congolese, who came into the AFCON with big ambitions and had been hoping to set up another clash with Nigeria, having defeated the Super Eagles on penalties in a World Cup qualifying play-off in November.</p><p>The Leopards will now at least be able to console themselves with the fact they have an intercontinental playoff to come in March, where a win against either New Caledonia or Jamaica will see them qualify for a first World Cup since 1974.</p><p>Algeria, having already guaranteed a berth at the finals in North America, remain focused for now on going all the way in Morocco.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4220001\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4220001\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770

leading nations, had the makings of the tie of the round but never quite lived up to its billing.</p><p>There was a lack of quality in the final third from both sides despite all the attacking talent on the pitch, with neither captain Riyad Mahrez nor the thrilling Ibrahim Maza lasting 90 minutes for Vladimir Petkovic’s Algerian team.</p><p>Burnley defender Axel Tuanzebe headed just wide from a corner for DR Congo and Maza fired narrowly past the goal from the edge of the box at the other end in the first half.</p><p>An Edo Kaymbe shot fizzed in from range that forced a good save from Algeria goalkeeper Luca Zidane was the closest either team came in the second half as the match drifted to extra time.</p><p>Algeria had been the more consistently threatening team, though, and began to turn the screw in the extra half-hour, with Congolese goalkeeper Lionel Mpasi saving well from Fares Chaibi and Baghdad Bounedjah in quick succession in the 111th minute.</p><p>But a shootout appeared an inevitability until Ramiz Zerrouki and Boulbina, who both emerged from the bench together in the second half of extra time, combined for the winning goal.</p><p>Zerrouki released Boulbina with a terrific pass in behind, and the 22-year-old Al-Duhail player did the rest.</p></div></div></body></html>"

An impeached president would then stand trial in the Senate, which can convict and remove him from office with a two-thirds vote.</p><p>All 435 House seats will be up for grabs in November as well as 33 positions in the Senate.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>House members are elected in districts drawn by the states in accordance with the size of their populations. Senators are elected in state-wide elections.</p><p>Trump has been pushing Republican-controlled states to pass new congressional district maps that would favour the right-wing party — a strategy known as gerrymandering, which critics say is inherently undemocratic.</p><p>Texas, Missouri and North Carolina have <a href=\"/news/2025/12/5/us-supreme-court-allows-texas-to-use-redrawn-district-map-for-2026-midterms\">passed redistricting</a> to boost Republican candidates. Democrats have responded with their own gerrymandering in California, which was approved through a ballot initiative.</p><p>Trump heads into the midterm elections with an approval rating of around 42 to 45 percent, according to various polls.</p><p>With the economy starting to show <a href=\"/news/2025/12/30/is-the-us-economy-strong-heading-into-2026-the-picture-is-complicated\">signs of stagnation</a> and the recent US military action to abduct Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro proving unpopular, Democrats may capitalise on the discontent to win back control of Congress.</p><p>Trump nevertheless appeared optimistic about his party’s chances on Tuesday. “We’re going to make history and break records with the epic midterm victory that we’re going to pull off,” he said.</p><p>Still, he expressed bewilderment at why Republicans do not have more support.</p><p>“I wish you could explain to me what the hell is going on with the mind of the public, because we have the right policy,” Trump said. “They [Democrats] have horrible policy. They do stick together. They’re violent. They’re vicious.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Over the past year, some Democrats have called for impeaching Trump over alleged misconduct, pointing to incidents like June’s military strikes against Iran, which were not authorised by Congress. But with the left-wing party in the minority, no impeachment proposals have advanced.</p><p>Trump was impeached twice during his first term. The first instance came in 2019, when he was accused of <a href=\"/news/2019/12/19/us-house-votes-to-impeach-trump-for-abuse-of-power-obstruction\">abuse of power</a> for allegedly using US aid to Ukraine as leverage to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate former US President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.</p><p>The second impeachment came in 2021, after Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6 of that year. Trump was accused of inciting an insurrection, after he spread false claims about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost.</p><p>The Senate acquitted Trump both times. In the 2021 trial, 57 senators <a href=\"/news/2021/2/13/donald-trump-acquitted-on-charge-of-inciting-us-capitol-riot\">found him guilty</a> after he had left office, but the result fell short of the 67 votes required for a conviction.</p><p>Had Trump been convicted, he would not have been able to run again in 2024.</p><p>No US president has ever been removed from office by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned from the White House over the Watergate scandal in 1974 before a vote was taken on his impeachment.</p><p>In more recent times, Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 for lying under oath about having sexual relations with a White House intern. The Senate also acquitted him.</p></div></div></body></html>"

United States presidents conduct unilateral military actions abroad. Congress shrugs.</p><p>On Saturday, in the hours after the US military <a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/abduct\">abducted</a> Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, Democrats in the Senate pledged to raise yet another <a href=\"/news/2025/6/19/what-is-the-war-powers-act-and-can-it-stop-trump-from-attacking-iran\">resolution</a> to rein in US President Donald Trump’s military actions.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has said the party will push for a vote within the week. By all accounts, the odds of its success remain long.</p><p>Since Trump took office for a second term in 2025, Congress has weighed multiple bills that would force him to seek legislative approval before initiating a military strike.</p><p>But the latest attack on Venezuela offers a stark instance of presidential overreach, one that is “crying out for congressional action”, according to David Janovsky, the acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight.</p><p>Experts say it is also one of the clearest tests in recent history of whether Congress will continue to cede its authority to check US military engagement abroad.</p><p>“There are a lot of angles where you can come at this to say why it’s a clear-cut case,” Janovsky told Al Jazeera.</p><p>He pointed out that, under the US Constitution, Congress alone wields the authority to allow military action. He also noted that the Venezuela attack “is in direct contravention of the UN Charter, which is, as a treaty, law in the United States”.</p><p>“Any of the fig leaves that presidents have used in the past to justify unilateral military action just don’t apply here,” Janovsky added. “This is particularly brazen.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"an-uphill-battle\">An uphill battle</h2><p>Since August, the Trump administration has signalled plans to crank up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela.</p><p>That month, Trump reportedly signed a secret memo calling on the US military to prepare for action against criminal networks abroad. Then, on September 2, the Trump administration began conducting dozens of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts.</p><p>That deadly bombing campaign was itself condemned as a violation of international law and an affront to Congress’s constitutional powers. It coincided with a build-up of US military assets near Venezuela.</p><p>Trump also dropped hints that the US military campaign could quickly expand to alleged drug-trafficking targets on Venezuelan soil. “When they come by land, we’re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats,” Trump said on September 16.</p><p>The strikes prompted two recent votes in the House of Representatives in December: one that would require congressional approval for any land strikes on the South American country, and one that would force Trump to seek approval for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats.</p><p>Both resolutions, however, failed roughly along party lines. A similar resolution in the Senate, which would have required congressional approval before any more attacks, also fell short in November.</p><p>But speaking to reporters in a phone call just hours after the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/how-the-us-attack-on-venezuela-abduction-of-maduro-unfolded\">US operation</a> on Saturday, Senator Tim Kaine said he hoped the brashness of Trump’s latest actions in Venezuela would shock lawmakers into action.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Republicans, he said, can no longer tell themselves that Trump’s months-long military build-up in the Caribbean and his repeated threats are a “bluff” or a “negotiating tactic”.</p><p>“It’s time for Congress to get its a** off the couch and do what it’s supposed to do,” Kaine said.</p><p>In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, US Senator Chris Murphy also agreed that it was “true” that Congress had become impotent on matters of war, a phenomenon that has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations.</p><p>Bash pointed to former President Barack Obama’s 2011 military deployment to Libya, which went unchecked by Congress.</p><p>“Congress needs to own its own role in allowing a presidency to become this lawless,” Murphy responded.</p><h2 id=\"republicans-ho-hum-about-resolutions\">Republicans ho-hum about resolutions</h2><p>Under the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war, something it has not done since World War II.</p><p>Instead, lawmakers have historically passed Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to approve committing troops to recent wars, including the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the strikes on alleged al-Qaeda affiliates across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p><p>No AUMFs have been passed that would relate to military action in Venezuela.</p><p>When lawmakers believe a president is acting beyond his constitutional power, they can pass a <a href=\"/news/2025/6/16/us-senator-introduces-bill-to-curb-trumps-power-to-go-to-war-with-iran\">war powers resolution</a> requiring Congressional approval for further actions.</p><p>Beyond their symbolism, such resolutions create a legal basis to challenge further presidential actions in the judiciary.</p><p>However, they carry a high bar for success, with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress needed to override a presidential veto.</p><p>Given the current makeup of Congress, passage of a war powers resolution would likely require bipartisan support.</p><p>Republicans maintain narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, so it would be necessary for members of Trump’s own party to back a war powers resolution for it to be successful.</p><p>In November’s Senate vote, only two Republicans — co-sponsor Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska — split from their party to support the resolution. It failed by a margin of 51 to 49.</p><p>December’s vote on a parallel resolution in the House only earned 211 votes in favour, as opposed to 213 against. In that case, three Republicans broke from their party to support the resolution, and one Democrat opposed it.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump’s abduction of Maduro has so far only received condemnation from a <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/us-republicans-back-trump-on-venezuela-amid-faint-maga-dissent\">tiny fragment</a> of his party.</p><p>Overall, the response from elected Republicans has been muted. Even regular critics of presidential adventurism have instead focused on praising the ouster of the longtime Venezuelan leader, who has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.</p><p>Senator Todd Young, a Republican considered on the fence ahead of November’s war powers vote, has praised Maduro’s arrest, even as he contended the Trump administration owed Congress more details.</p><p>“We still need more answers, especially to questions regarding the next steps in Venezuela’s transition,” Young said.</p><p>Some Democrats have also offered careful messaging in the wake of the operation.</p><p>That included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents a large Venezuelan diaspora community in Florida.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/DWStweets/status/2007515364553568526?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> on Saturday, Wasserman Schultz focused on the implications of Maduro’s removal, while avoiding any mention of the military operation that enabled it. Instead, she asserted that Trump owed Congress an explanation about next steps.</p><p>“He has failed to explain to Congress or the American people how he plans to prevent the regime from reconstituting itself under Maduro’s cronies or stop Venezuela from falling into chaos,” she wrote.</p><p>In December, however, Wasserman Schultz did join a group of Florida Democrats in calling for Congress to exercise its oversight authority as Trump built up military pressure on Venezuela.</p><h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2><p>For its part, the Trump administration has not eased up on its military threats against Venezuela, even as it has <a href=\"/news/2026/1/4/fact-checking-trump-following-us-capture-of-venezuelas-maduro\">sought to send</a> the message that Maduro’s abduction was a matter of law enforcement, not the start of a war.</p><p>Trump has also denied, once again, that he needed congressional approval for any further military action. Still, in a Monday interview with NBC News, he expressed optimism about having Congress’s backing.</p><p>“We have good support congressionally,” he told NBC. “Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn’t they support us?”</p><p>Since Saturday’s attack and abduction, Trump has warned that a “second wave” of military action could be on the horizon for Venezuela.</p><p>That threat has extended to the potential for the forced removal of Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, who was <a href=\"/news/2026/1/5/delcy-rodriguez-sworn-in-as-venezuelas-president-after-maduro-abduction\">formally sworn in</a> as the country’s interim president on Monday.</p><p>“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine.</p><p>The administration has also said that strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela will continue and that US military assets will remain deployed in the region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Constitutional expert Janovsky, however, believes that this is a critical moment for Congress to act.</p><p>Failure to rein in Trump would only further reinforce a decades-long trend of lawmakers relinquishing their oversight authorities, he explained. That, in turn, offers tacit support for the presidency’s <a href=\"/news/2025/12/29/2025-trumps-year-of-emergency-invasion-and-narcoterrorism\">growing power</a> over the military.</p><p>“To say this was a targeted law enforcement operation — and ignore the ongoing situation — would be a dangerous abdication of Congress as a central check on how the United States military is used,” Janovsky said.</p><p>“Continued congressional inaction does nothing but empower presidents to act however they want,” he added.</p><p>“To see Congress continue to step back ultimately just removes the American people even farther from where these decisions are actually being made.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

His contract with the club expires at the end of the current season, and the Austrian has indicated that talks on a new contract are currently on hold.</p><p>The 51-year-old has an 11-year managerial experience, having coached two teams in the Austrian top tier, as well as Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt in the German league.</p><h3 id=\"darren-fletcher\">Darren Fletcher</h3><p>The former United midfielder, who graduated from the Manchester United Academy to first time in 2003 and spent 12 years playing under Ferguson, is among the favourites after landing the interim manager’s role.</p><p>Fletcher has been the head coach of United’s academy since July and was the first choice to steer the ship after Amorim’s exit.</p><p>A firm fan favourite during his playing days, the 41-year-old could take the route of his former teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who earned the full-time manager’s role after coming on as interim manager.</p><h3>Enzo Maresca</h3><p>While Maresca’s departure from Chelsea was similar to Amorim’s at United, the Italian had a successful first season in London, winning the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup.</p><p>The former Manchester City U-23 and Parma manager led Leicester City back to the Premier League in 2024 before being snapped up by Chelsea.</p><p>Maresca has been favoured to swiftly find a role in the top tier of European football, and Old Trafford could be his next stop.</p><h2 id=\"ole-gunnar-solskjaer\">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h2><p>Solskjaer’s playing and managerial spells at United have endeared him to the club’s faithful, who insist that his knowledge of the “Fergie Way” could bring back the glory days.</p><p>In terms of results, the Norwegian did not land any major trophies during his reign at United but managed to lead the team to a Europa League final and a second-place finish in 2021.</p><p>Solskjaer is currently out of work, having been sacked by Turkish side Besiktas after eight months in charge, and any long-term appointment would most likely require another successful interim period first.</p><h2 id=\"thomas-tuchel\">Thomas Tuchel</h2><p>The current England manager is focused on leading the Three Lions at the upcoming World Cup, but his name is being thrown around for the job at United before the new season’s beginning in August 2026.</p><p>The German is no stranger to winning trophies at major European clubs, having done it at Chelsea, PSG and Bayern Munich.</p><h2 id=\"gareth-southgate\">Gareth Southgate</h2><p>Often regarded as a serious candidate for the role of manager of Manchester United during his England tenure, Southgate’s stock appears to have fallen of late.</p><p>The former Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and England defender’s only management experience at club level came with Middlesbrough from 2006 to 2009. He then took charge of the England under-21 side in 2013 before being appointed manager of the full national team in 2016, a role he held until he stood down in 2024.</p><p>United fans, however, appeared consistent in their concerns about Southgate throughout all his previous links to the job over his pragmatic approach to the game. The 54-year-old was perceived by vocal United fans as stifling the attacking talents of the English team, something not in keeping with the United philosophy.</p></div></div></body></html>"
