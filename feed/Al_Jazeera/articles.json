Go has yet to comment on the latest development.</p><p>It was not immediately clear if any of the men named in the prosecution document would face charges in court.</p><p>In a statement posted on Facebook, Kristina Conti, lawyer of several of the deceased victims’ families, noted that it’s the first time “significant details” were disclosed by the ICC to the public.</p><p>She said the inclusion of several high-ranking officials under Duterte showed that the deadly drug war under his presidency “was crafted not only to ensure implementation, but to ensure impunity”.</p><p>“The involvement of those in the investigating units, which should have acted as the killings happen, is material to the plan. This also emphasizes that the ‘war on drugs’ began in Davao,” Conti said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Duterte is facing a four-day “confirmation of charges” hearing from <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/icc-judges-find-former-philippine-president-duterte-fit-to-stand-trial\">February 23</a>, in which judges will decide whether the prosecution’s allegations are strong enough to proceed to trial.</p><p>Judges have rejected arguments that the 80-year-old, who was arrested in March last year and transferred to the Netherlands the same day, was unfit to stand trial.</p><p>Go and Dela Rosa have been named as co-perpetrators in acts that took place during Duterte’s tenures as Davao mayor and president.</p><p>Former Philippine justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, who served as a lawyer for Duterte in cases involving the so-called “Davao Death Squad”, is also among the eight men named.</p><p>Ross Tugade, an ICC-accredited lawyer from the Philippines, said in a post on Facebook that the inclusion of the names of former Duterte officials indicates “that the ICC has evidence” to show a “criminal structure” in the commission of the alleged crimes.</p><p>The first of three counts against Duterte concerns his alleged involvement as a co-perpetrator in 19 murders carried out between 2013 and 2016 while he was mayor of Davao City.</p><p>The second relates to 14 murders of so-called “High Value Targets” in 2016 and 2017 when Duterte was president.</p><p>The third charge covers 43 murders committed during “clearance” operations of lower-level alleged drug users or pushers.</p><p>These took place across the Philippines between 2016 and 2018, the prosecution alleged.</p><p>The ICC also on Friday allowed the addition of 500 more complainants against Duterte in the trial.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312717\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312717\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312717\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20170503__O26SY__v1__MidRes__PhilippinesChinaUsMaritimeDiplomacy-1771054052.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"This handout photo taken and released by the Presidential Photographers Division (PPD) on May 3, 2017 shows President Rodrigo Duterte (R, wearing earphones) talking on the phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping while presidential special assistant Bong Go listens in Davao City, southern island of Mindanao.

because of armed conflict in their country, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced on Friday.</p><p>“After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” Noem said in a statement.</p><p>“Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest,” she said, describing the revocation as an act of “putting America first.”</p><p>Contrary to Noem’s determination, Yemen continues to be riven by years-long conflict in one of the world’s poorest nations.</p><p>The State Department currently advises against travel to Yemen, citing “terrorism, unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, and landmines”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>TPS allows narrow groups of people in the US to live and work in the country if they’re deemed to be in danger if they return to their home nations, because of war, natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances.</p><p>While the protections are technically temporary, historically, presidents have continued to renew TPS statuses for refugees and asylum seekers rather than revoking them and rendering them undocumented.</p><p>The TPS for Yemen was last extended in 2024 and was set to expire on March 3 of this year.</p><p>Yemeni beneficiaries with no other lawful basis for remaining in the US have 60 days to voluntarily depart the country or face arrest, the statement said, offering a complimentary plane

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>This Valentine’s Day, chocolate prices are no longer at <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cocoa--coffee-and-tea-push-up-global-food-import-bill-for-wealthier-countries/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last year’s peak</a>, but cheap chocolate has not made a comeback, and it probably never will. Last year’s cocoa price crisis, driven by a combination of extreme heat, drought and disease in key producing regions, may have eased. But the aftertaste remains: A market that no longer behaves the way it used to, because the landscapes that grow cocoa are no longer the same. And the world’s unwitting appetite for cheap chocolate at the expense of biodiversity is part of the reason.</p><p>Cocoa is one of the most rainfall-dependent crops in the tropics, grown mainly by smallholders with few safety nets. Because cocoa production is concentrated in a handful of regions, a bad season in one place can quickly ripple across global supply. That fragility was laid bare in 2024, when the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which produce nearly 60 percent of the world’s cocoa, were hit by climate extremes that slashed harvests. Prices surged by more than <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/markets-and-trade/news-and-events/news-detail/cocoa--coffee-and-tea-push-up-global-food-import-bill-for-wealthier-countries/\">300 percent</a>, squeezing some farmers, enriching others, and leaving consumers paying for the uncertainty.</p><p>The problem is not simply that cocoa is vulnerable. It is that we have built a cocoa economy that magnifies the vulnerability. For decades, the world has chased low prices and high output, and too often that has meant converting forest landscapes into farmland, from West Africa to parts of Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p><p>But forests are not optional. They regulate rainfall, protect soils, and create the microclimates on which cocoa depends. Full-sun cocoa farms can produce higher yields in the short term, but the sugar rush is followed by a costly crash: Depleted soils, limited protection from heat and drought that is on the increase, and little for farmers to fall back on when the monocrops fail. Yields fall, farms expand deeper into forests to compensate, and the cycle repeats.</p><p>This is why cocoa’s price volatility is not a temporary blip. It is a warning sign: We are weakening the natural systems cocoa depends on at the same moment that climate change is making harvests less reliable.</p><p>Research by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/436c55ae-6662-4f7e-9fac-0588db782f5e\">shows</a> how extreme heat undermines agriculture, reducing both the quantity and quality of crop yields and increasing pest and disease pressure. A recent <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192325000139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> modelling cocoa under mid-century climate change finds that warming could wipe out as much as a third to half of today’s suitable cocoa area in some core producing zones, while shifting production towards new regions. Without safeguards, that transition risks trading climate stress in one place for forest loss in another. The details will vary across regions, but the implication is global: As climate change alters weather patterns, the geography of cocoa production will shift, and a stable supply will become harder to take for granted.</p><p>Unless we build resilience now, future Valentine’s Days may come with less chocolate and higher prices.</p><p>But we can eat our chocolate and keep forests too, by changing how cocoa is grown. It starts with bringing trees back to cocoa farms, reversing the damaging practices that are ultimately undermining production. Change can be made through climate-resilient agroforestry practices that rebuild shade cover, improve soil health and moisture retention, and reduce cocoa’s exposure to heat and drought. Cocoa grown under shade trees can stabilise farm conditions and support biodiversity, while producing higher-quality beans that meet premium market standards, giving farmers stronger incentives to maintain tree cover rather than clear more land.</p><p>Sceptics argue that growing cocoa with trees means accepting lower yields. But when it comes to unsustainable practices, high productivity today comes with a high cost tomorrow. A farm that exhausts its soil, loses shade, is exposed to drought, and needs ever more chemical inputs to maintain production is not a success story. It is a trap.</p><p>In a changing climate, the point is not how much cocoa a farm can produce in a year, but how reliably it can produce year after year. That requires resilience built into the landscape, now more than ever: More tree cover, healthier soils, and diversified farm systems that protect livelihoods when climate extremes hit.</p><p>This is not theoretical. It is already happening.</p><p>In Ecuador’s Amazon province of Napo, a project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and supported with technical assistance from the FAO has helped strengthen a sustainable cocoa value chain built around the traditional <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/giahs/giahs-around-the-world/ecuador-amazonian-chakra/en\">Chakra agroforestry system</a> used by Kichwa communities. Put simply, it is cocoa grown as part of a forest garden: Kichwa women known as Chakramamas help steward these farms, cultivating cocoa under shade trees alongside a diverse mix of other crops and native plants, rather than clearing land for a single crop. Recognised by FAO as a <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/giahs/en\">Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System</a>, the model is still expanding more than a decade on, helping Indigenous producer families earn more from premium cocoa through stronger processing, marketing, and partnerships with high-value buyers. <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/gef/news/news-detail/From-the-Ecuadorian-Amazon-to-the-European-markets-Sustainable-production-of-Cocoa-in-Napo/en\">High-end chocolatiers</a> continue to source from Chakra producers, showing that cocoa grown alongside trees can deliver world-class quality while keeping forests standing for biodiversity, climate and land benefits.</p><p>There are more examples. In the Ivory Coast, FAO-backed efforts supported by the Green Climate Fund are already <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/agroforestry/activities/faos-work/projects-detail/promoting-zero-deforestation-cocoa-production-for-reducing-emissions-in-c%C3%B4te-d%27ivoire-%28promire%29/\">delivering results</a>, restoring 1,084 hectares (2,679 acres) of degraded land and converting 3,527 hectares (8,715 acres) of conventional cocoa into improved agroforestry systems while reducing pressure on forests. Meanwhile, 234 farmers now have access to cocoa cooperatives, ensuring access to international fair-trade and organic certifications and a better price for their products. In <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/newsroom/story/an-island-of-chocolate-gold/en\">Sao Tome and Principe</a>, FAO has supported cocoa agroforestry through the GEF-funded Restoration Initiative, helping restore nearly 10,000 hectares (about 25,000 acres) of forest and improve land management across a further 23,000 hectares (about 57,000 acres). These are not boutique experiments. They are working models for stabilising supply, supporting farmer incomes, and reducing the forest loss that fuels cocoa’s growing volatility.</p><p>But projects alone will not be enough. Scaling them will take serious investment: From governments, companies, and consumers. It will also require rules that shift incentives across the entire cocoa economy, such as a new European Union law that requires cocoa and chocolate entering the EU market to be deforestation-free. By tying market access to how cocoa is grown, these rules are pushing governments, producers, and companies to rethink production models, improve traceability, and strengthen zero-deforestation cocoa systems.</p><p>Governments will also need to invest in farmer adaptation and long-term productivity, not just short-term output. That means accessible finance, practical support on farms, and policies that reward sustainable production instead of expansion into forests.</p><p>And chocolate companies need to promote resilience across their supply chains, not just chase volume. In a world of climate disruption, the cheapest cocoa is not necessarily the best bargain if it comes at the expense of farmers’ livelihoods or the ecosystems that keep cocoa viable in the years to come.</p><p>Paying farmers for chocolate that keeps forests standing is not a luxury. It is part of what makes cocoa more available and keeps farmers in business in a warming world. Chocolate is sold as a simple pleasure, but cocoa is no longer a simple crop: Its future depends on whether we treat forests and biodiversity as essential infrastructure for stable and resilient agrifood systems.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"628\" data-end=\"727\">In the end, the 13th parliamentary election in Bangladesh was not a revolution. It was a reckoning.</p><p data-start=\"729\" data-end=\"929\">When the ballots were counted, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had secured a decisive victory, returning to power after years in the political wilderness under Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule.</p><p data-start=\"931\" data-end=\"1193\">Most headlines framed it as a dramatic comeback, and rightfully so. But beneath the surface, this was less a tidal wave of voter choice than a carefully navigated current. This was a contest shaped by frustration and the arithmetic of first-past-the-post (FPTP).</p><p data-start=\"1195\" data-end=\"1831\">To understand why BNP prevailed, one must first dispense with the lazy narrative that this was a Jamaat moment squandered. When the results became clear, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) secured 68 seats, while the Jamaat-led bloc secured 77 seats in parliament. That is no small feat for a party whose previous best parliamentary showing was just 18 seats in 1991. Many analysts had suggested Jamaat’s support had grown in the run-up to the poll, and the data vindicated that claim. But in an FPTP system, a swelling vote share does not automatically translate into 151 seats out of 300 elected constituencies.</p><p data-start=\"1833\" data-end=\"2173\">This election was not driven by any momentous revolution, even though it came on the back of a mass uprising that toppled Hasina’s autocracy in August 2024. But there was no deep ideological rupture, and no permanent reordering of voter loyalties, at least not on a scale that would rupture the very fabric of the country’s electoral mindset.</p><p data-start=\"2175\" data-end=\"2426\">And of course, it was not a national wave election, in which a single mood sweeps towards a particular party across class, gender and region. What unfolded was a hybrid: Largely a normal election with significant deviations, but a predictable outcome.</p><p data-start=\"2428\" data-end=\"2619\">Party loyalists mostly stayed home. Swing voters mattered. And in pockets of the country, frustration with BNP’s local leadership triggered temporary defections – many of them to Jamaat or NCP.</p><p data-start=\"2621\" data-end=\"2843\">The anger was real. After August 5, BNP’s grassroots machinery performed abysmally. Petty leaders across districts were accused of corruption and extortion. In rural market towns and urban peripheries, resentment simmered.</p><p data-start=\"2845\" data-end=\"3150\">Voters were not merely disappointed; they were, to use the language heard in tea stalls and union parishad courtyards, “really, really pissed off”. That fury explains Jamaat’s surge. A portion of BNP loyalists and a significant share of swing voters drifted towards the promise of an “honest alternative”.</p><p data-start=\"3152\" data-end=\"3177\">But drift is not destiny.</p><p data-start=\"3179\" data-end=\"3381\">BNP’s base, historically broader and organisationally deeper than Jamaat’s, did not collapse. Even after defections, it remained numerically larger. BNP’s nomination strategy proved unexpectedly shrewd.</p><p data-start=\"3383\" data-end=\"3558\">Where Jamaat fielded relatively unknown but ideologically trusted figures, BNP leaned on its old guard – candidates with entrenched name recognition and dense informal networks.</p><p data-start=\"3560\" data-end=\"3790\">That mattered, particularly in rural Bangladesh. Urban, educated voters may be thrilled by the rhetoric of ethical governance. For them, the idea of an incorruptible, ideologically disciplined candidate resonates as a moral reset.</p><p data-start=\"3792\" data-end=\"4067\">But rural voters are pragmatic actors. They operate within intricate patronage webs. An MP is not an abstraction; he (and it is usually he) is a broker of safety nets, jobs, stability and dispute resolution. Honesty, in isolation, does not guarantee access. Familiarity does.</p><p data-start=\"4069\" data-end=\"4396\">Thus emerged the central voter dilemma. Disgusted with BNP’s excesses, many considered a switch. In constituencies where Jamaat fielded a well-known leader, some made it. But elsewhere, voters encountered candidates they did not know, whose “honesty” they could not verify, and whose party offered little beyond moral branding.</p><p data-start=\"4398\" data-end=\"4455\">Faced with uncertainty, they chose the “devil” they knew.</p><p data-start=\"4457\" data-end=\"4723\">Jamaat compounded its structural limitations with strategic missteps. Its awkward posture on women’s issues – oscillating between reassurance and dog whistles – failed to convince large segments of female voters who have, over decades, carved out expanding public roles.</p><p data-start=\"4725\" data-end=\"4958\">Bangladesh’s social transformation is not cosmetic, and women are central to its labour force, education system and microcredit economy. A party that cannot articulate a credible vision for gender equality cannot win a national wave.</p><p data-start=\"4960\" data-end=\"5209\">More damaging was Jamaat’s revisionist flirtation with the memory of 1971. The Liberation War is the country’s moral founding document. Attempts to soften or reinterpret Jamaat’s historical role alienated voters far beyond the secular-liberal elite.</p><p data-start=\"5211\" data-end=\"5363\">Even conservative families drew red lines around 1971. The prevailing mode of public sentiment was probably blunt: One may forgive; one does not forget.</p><p data-start=\"5365\" data-end=\"5619\">Yet Jamaat’s performance was still historic. Jamaat-e-Islami and its allied coalition secured 77 seats, a testament not only to its disciplined cadre but also to BNP’s own misdeeds. Extortion scandals and local arrogance pushed voters into Jamaat’s arms.</p><p data-start=\"5621\" data-end=\"5851\">In a tightly contested FPTP landscape, even a few percentage points can flip dozens of seats. Jamaat capitalised on that anger with precision in Rajshahi, Khulna and Rangpur divisions, where its organisational muscle is strongest.</p><p data-start=\"5853\" data-end=\"6127\">But precision is not the same as breadth. Jamaat’s surge remained regionally concentrated. Its support varied sharply by class, gender, education and age. That is the opposite of a wave election. Without uniform national momentum, being a victor in FPTP is not an easy task.</p><p data-start=\"6129\" data-end=\"6475\">Then there was the ghost in the machine: The Awami League (AL). Much commentary underestimated its residual vote. Surveys suggested a hardcore 5 to 7 percent would never defect, but beyond that lay a larger bloc – perhaps 20 to 25 percent – either undecided or unwilling to disclose preferences. In this election, that particular bloc mattered a lot.</p><p data-start=\"6477\" data-end=\"6773\">Pre-election field research and multiple polls indicated that many non-hardcore AL voters were breaking towards the BNP – probably not out of ideological alignment but out of instrumental rationality. They believed BNP would form the government and wanted access to services through the winning MP.</p><p data-start=\"6775\" data-end=\"7018\">In areas where BNP’s old guard had harassed AL supporters, some abstained or flirted with Jamaat. But nationally, the gravitational pull favoured BNP. Voters wanted to be on the side of the winner. Perception became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p data-start=\"7020\" data-end=\"7421\">The four plausible scenarios before election day clarified the stakes. Without significant AL turnout, BNP would likely secure a plurality in a tight race. With moderate AL support, it would win a comfortable majority. With overwhelming AL backing, even a two-thirds majority was conceivable. Only a full-blown Jamaat wave – a cross-class, cross-gender national embrace – could have reversed the equation.</p><p data-start=\"7423\" data-end=\"7452\">That wave never materialised.</p><p data-start=\"7454\" data-end=\"7839\">BNP’s victory, then, is a product of structural advantage, strategic candidate selection and the rational calculations of the country’s traditional voters. It was aided by Jamaat’s self-inflicted wounds on women’s rights and historical memory. It was enabled, paradoxically, by BNP’s own local misconduct, which inflated Jamaat’s vote share but not enough to overcome FPTP mathematics.</p><p data-start=\"7841\" data-end=\"8124\">One more footnote of this election deserves attention: The emergence of the National Citizen Party (NCP), which captured five seats. For a new party born out of an uprising, in the highly polarised political environment of the South Asian nation, that is no small accomplishment.</p><p data-start=\"8126\" data-end=\"8344\">It signals a hunger, however modest, for alternatives outside the new binary of BNP and Jamaat. Under proportional representation, such a party might flourish. Under FPTP, five seats is both a breakthrough and a ceiling.</p><p data-start=\"8346\" data-end=\"8576\">Bangladesh’s 13th parliamentary election was, in the end, a story of limits: The limits of anger, the limits of moral branding, the limits of revisionism, and the enduring power of organisational depth in a winner-take-all system.</p><p data-start=\"8578\" data-end=\"8649\">BNP won not because it inspired a nation, but because it understood it.</p><p data-start=\"8578\" data-end=\"8649\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

He finished with 20 wickets in the Caribbean Premier League last year, forcing his way into the Pakistan team.</p><p>“My coach informed me about my selection in the Pakistan team while I was busy with my wedding last year, and initially I thought it was a prank,” said Tariq.</p><p>“But it was true, so I think my wife brought luck for me.”</p><p>From a salesman in Dubai to Pakistan’s potential trump card against India, Tariq’s script is still being written.</p><h2 id=\"colombo-boosted-by-india-and-pakistan-tourism-windfall\">Colombo boosted by India and Pakistan tourism windfall</h2><p>Prices of flights ‌and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared as thousands of fans flock to ⁠the city to ⁠watch India play Pakistan.</p><p>The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets ⁠sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices – the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.</p><p>After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like ‌Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.</p><p>Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to about $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 percent to roughly $666.</p><p>Nalin Jayasundera, president of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) said hotels were booked out. “Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4288497\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4288497\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4288497\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-STADIUMS-T20-MENS-CRICKET-WORLD-CUP-2026-FEB3-2026-1770220847.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE -STADIUMS- T20 MEN'S CRICKET WORLD CUP - 2026 - FEB3, 2026-1770220847\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4288497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous ⁠for its ancient temples, pristine beaches and lush tea plantations.</p><p>It is hoped ⁠that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.</p><p>Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told the Reuters news agency that in the first ⁠10 days of February, roughly 20 percent of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.</p><p>The island nation is hoping to ⁠position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.</p><p>“This ⁠is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue.

Children learn from an early age that <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/acute-trauma-the-ever-present-wounds-of-gazas-children-from-israels-war\">trauma</a> will define their lives in ways even other Palestinians are spared.</p><p>Psychologists from the West Bank told Al Jazeera young people in the camps face “incessant traumatisation”, and most are deprived of “safety, places to play, opportunities, and a chance to escape”.</p><p>Instead, as the offspring of refugees denied the right to return to their homeland, they face a life surrounded by poverty, death, and Israeli military violence.</p><p>They are part of Palestinian society, yet remain marginalised within it – without the sense of belonging others take for granted.</p><p>The conditions endured by those in the camps make them a breeding ground for armed resistance to Israel.</p><p>Belal says that it was Wael’s time in prison that eventually pushed him to fight. He says that Wael was tortured by guards for being defiant, and was kept in solitary confinement. He was eventually released as part of the November 2023 prisoner exchange deal, at the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312016\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312016\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312016\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-main-street-through-Balata-1771004964.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A street in the Balata refugee camp\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4312016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Balata refugee camp in the occupied West Bank has been repeatedly attacked by Israeli forces [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"defenders-of-the-camps\" dir=\"ltr\">Defenders of the camps</h2><p>The West Bank’s 19 <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/israels-emptying-of-west-bank-refugee-camps-amounts-to-war-crimes-hrw\">refugee camps</a>, once makeshift tented communities when they were established in 1948 after Israel’s founding and intended to be temporary, are now densely populated built-up areas housing the descendants of hundreds of thousands of refugees.</p><p>The older generations remember being forcibly expelled from their homes in historical Palestine by Zionist militias in the 1948 Nakba to pave the way for the creation of an Israeli state.</p><p>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) describes the camps as dominated by poverty, severe overcrowding, and joblessness. The camps are also the primary targets of Israeli military operations in the West Bank.</p><p>Without the prospect of a normal childhood for their occupants, the lure of fighting Israel can often prove irresistible.</p><p>Nablus-based psychologist, Nisreen Bsharat, said “martyrdom”, particularly for those in the camps, is viewed as the ultimate demonstration of faith and resilience.</p><p>Bsharat, who works with young people and grieving mothers from Balata, said martyrdom is seen as a “’heroic’ contribution to Palestine”, and that martyrs and their families are celebrated as such.</p><p>Those who fight against Israel are seen as “role models” when so few opportunities exist in refugee camps, Bsharat added.</p><p>“Historically, martyrdom is tied to our national identity,” she said. “It’s seen as the least we can offer our homeland, and part of our duty.”</p><p>Though far from an exclusively Islamic concept, Palestinians often refer to those who are killed by Israeli forces as martyrs, believing they sacrifice their lives fighting for their nation, Islam, and the Holy Land – and believe that God promises them their place in paradise.</p><p>Bethlehem-based clinical psychologist and academic, Amanda Manasra, who was born in Aida refugee camp, and focuses on trauma in Palestine, told Al Jazeera the vast majority of camp residents live with untreated complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which is significantly more difficult to cure.</p><p>The harsh environment of the camps creates a revolutionary fervour that is far less common in wealthier areas, Manasra added.</p><p>“The idea of martyrdom is related to how Palestinians find meaning to deal with hardship, individually and collectively,” she said.</p><p>“Many of my cases are adolescent men from the camps – many former prisoners – who have lost so many friends and family members.</p><p>“Joining the resistance is about taking control – it can feel like a reward for experiencing hardship, and can satisfy feelings of retribution.</p><p>“The fighters feel they have survived, persisted, and beaten the occupation war machine.”</p><p>Camps in the northern West Bank came under even more relentless attack since Israel launched “Operation Iron Wall” in January 2025, which has displaced tens of thousands of refugees in nearby Jenin and Tulkarem, and killed hundreds.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312021\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312021\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312021\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/A-side-street-with-tributes-to-martyrs-above-1771005091.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A side street in Nablus\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4312021\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tributes to Palestinians killed fighting Israel are visible across Balata [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2>Psychological toll</h2><p>Belal, who spent eight years in Palestinian Authority (PA) prison during Wael’s childhood, feels the pain of his son’s loss deeply.</p><p>They both had only ever known the narrow, labyrinthine streets and decrepit buildings of Balata, the most populous refugee camp in the West Bank. But Belal feels that he wasn’t able to be there to guide Wael through them.</p><p>“I didn’t get the chance to see Wael growing up, or spend time with him as all other fathers do,” he said, unable to fight back his tears.</p><p>“I envy his mother and brother because at least they lived with him. They have beautiful and plentiful memories with him, shared moments.</p><p>“Do you know what it feels like to carry your son on your shoulders, place him in his grave, and bury him with your own hands? It is the hardest thing in the world.”</p><p>Belal, whose brother was also killed by Israel when he was younger, said he and his son had so many plans for when he would be released from prison.</p><p>In the end, Belal was freed only on compassionate grounds so he could see Wael for the final time before he was buried.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Israel’s actions breed hatred</h2><p>For those in Nablus’s refugee camps, violent incidents like Wael’s killing are nearly a weekly reality – and a doom-laden reminder that death lurks around every corner.</p><p>Belal recalled Wael becoming deeply affected as a child by the 20-year imprisonment of his closest uncle, after whom he was named. Later, he became preoccupied with avenging those close to him whose lives he says Israel had stolen. Four of Wael’s cousins had been killed in the 12 months preceding his death.</p><p>“Of course, it was also the constant invasions and the violence he grew up around, and the barbaric way the soldiers treat us,” Belal told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Every night, we experience the atmosphere of Israel’s raids. We’re forced to accept this life – we have no choice but to adjust.”</p><p>Belal said that when Wael was growing up, there were no youth clubs or even parks that could take his mind off the harsh life in the camp. He added that soldiers had once raided the family’s house and destroyed “literally everything”.</p><p>“It’s actions like these that breed hatred toward them.”</p><p>Belal specifically remembered Wael, who had just begun high school, being enraged by footage of Israeli soldiers beating women in Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites.</p><p>“Wael couldn’t accept that soldiers would beat women and girls,” he said. “It was intolerable for him.”</p><p>Wael’s surviving family live in a crowded second-floor apartment near the centre of the camp, and his father, two of his brothers, his little sister, and his grieving mother took turns tearfully eulogising him.</p><p>His mother, Hanadi, was beaten, and his brother, Ibrahim, was also detained as soldiers broke into their apartment late at night to arrest Wael.</p><p>Hanadi was shocked by Wael’s condition once he was released from prison.</p><p>“The marks of torture remained on his body even after his release,” she said. “Burn scars from extinguished cigarettes were visible on his back and hands.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Refugee camps under siege</h2><p>Balata has often been a target for the Israeli military, and, according to the UN, 30 people have been killed in the camp since Israel intensified its attacks on the West Bank following Hamas’s October 7 attacks.</p><p>The pictures of Palestinians killed fighting Israel are emblazoned, like shrines, on the camp’s walls.</p><p>About 33,000 people are crammed into Balata’s narrow streets. It spans an area of 0.25 square kilometres (0.1sq miles), and has one of the highest rates of unemployment and food insecurity anywhere in the territory, according to UNRWA.</p><p>On August 15, Wael and two other fighters rushed to confront an incursion of Israeli soldiers when they were struck by a drone on the camp’s main street. Wael and fellow fighter Ahmad Khalil were killed instantly, while four others, including children, were injured.</p><p>Hanadi described the camp being surrounded by soldiers while gunshots rang close by, as she comforted her younger children.</p><p>“The moment I heard the sound of the missile, I knew he had been martyred,” she said.</p><p>“I started praying for God to accept him and to give me strength to bear this calamity.</p><p>“I also prayed that his face would remain unharmed because he always wished his face wouldn’t be disfigured so we could say our goodbyes to him properly.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Tsunami of trauma</h2><p>Manasra said there is a tsunami of untreated mental health problems across the West Bank, while services remain hopelessly stretched, underfunded, and inaccessible for most.</p><p>She says the glorification surrounding resistance to Israel and martyrdom also obscures a more difficult reality of unprocessed grief and trauma that lingers with individuals and families forever.</p><p>Supporting families in the camps like Belal’s is nearly impossible when services are so costly and restricted, she says.</p><p>Without any such mental health support, Belal spoke of his suffering and told Al Jazeera that, since his son’s death, “joy has not entered our house”.</p><p>“We may smile or laugh at each other to show politeness, but inside, it’s different,” he added.</p><p>“Inside, there’s only fire – and pain.”</p><p>Too often, the burden of resistance falls on the poorest residents of the West Bank’s refugee camps.</p><p>In each case, the reason for resisting is different. But there are nearly always similarities: Hardship, piety, retribution, and a sense of duty to one’s country.</p><p>The pride found in resisting only briefly distracts from the deep scars left by Israel’s occupation, which is tightening its grip over the West Bank – particularly in the refugee camps.</p><p>The surviving families of those killed are left somewhere between terrible grief and hopeful adulation.</p><p>“When I sit alone, I imagine Wael beside me,” Belal added.</p><p>“Sometimes, I feel like hugging his picture tightly to my chest as I cry my heart out.</p><p>“He was a role model even for me. I bid him farewell with complete serenity – I know God will accept him as a martyr.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

The country has seen eight presidents within the last decade, with several of them impeached or resigning before their term expired.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>In recent months, Jeri has become increasingly embroiled in scandal, including one colloquially known as “chifagate”, named for the Peruvian-Chinese fusion cuisine known as “chifa”.</p><p>The scandal started when local media outlets obtained video of Jeri arriving late at night at a restaurant to meet with a Chinese businessman, Zhihua Yang, who previously received government approval to build a hydroelectric plant.</p><p>Their meeting was not listed in the official presidential agenda, as is required under Peruvian law. Critics have questioned whether Jeri’s outfit — which had a deep hood that rendered him nearly unrecognisable — was meant to be a disguise.</p><p>Additional footage placed Jeri at another one of Yang’s businesses days later. Jeri also allegedly met a second Chinese businessman, Jiwu Xiaodong, who was reportedly under house arrest for illegal activities.</p><p>Jeri has dismissed some of the off-the-books meetings as planning for an upcoming Chinese-Peruvian friendship event. Others, he said, were simply shopping trips for sweets and other food. He has denied wrongdoing but has acknowledged taking the meetings was a “mistake”.</p><p>“I have not lied to the country. I have not done anything illegal,” Jeri told the news outlet Canal N.</p><p>But critics have accused Jeri of using his position for influence-peddling at the unregistered interactions.</p><p>Similar accusations erupted earlier this month when Peruvian media highlighted the irregular hiring of several women in Jeri’s administration and contracts he awarded as possible evidence of bribery.</p><p>The debate over Jeri’s removal comes as Peru hurtles towards a general election on April 12, with the presidency up for grabs. Jeri will not be running to retain his seat.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Pakistan’s participation was confirmed only six days before the fixture, triggering a sharp surge in airfares from several Indian cities.</p><p>Fans who booked their air tickets weeks in advance, too, paid significantly higher fares due to the significantly higher demand surrounding any India-Pakistan match, which is commonly deemed the most lucrative fixture in cricket.</p><p>“I paid a premium of approximately 50 percent compared to the usual rates,” Aditya Chheda, a finance professional from Mumbai, told Al Jazeera. “This was despite booking a month in advance and opting for a layover instead of a direct flight.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4311865\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4311865\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4311865\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/54ba0ff8-67bb-4a70-9360-622e5fd17267-1770997837.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C730&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Chheda is one of thousands of Indian fans who have travelled to Colombo [Courtesy of Aditya Chheda] \" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4311865\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chheda is among thousands of Indian fans who have travelled to Colombo for the blockbuster fixture [Courtesy of Aditya Chheda]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"flight-hotel-prices-skyrocket\">Flight, hotel prices skyrocket</h2><p>A nonstop round-trip journey from India’s western metropolis Mumbai to Colombo, which typically costs approximately $275, went upwards of $1,000 two days before the match.</p><p>Similar fares were spotted for nonstop journeys from Bengaluru in southern India, while round-trip nonstop flights from Chennai to Colombo – a route that takes only about an hour and 20 minutes – had surged to at least $550, up from its usual fare of $165.</p><p>Planning ahead helped Bengaluru resident Parth Chauhan secure deals at a good price, but his friends accompanying him to Colombo had to pay a steep premium – three times the usual cost – after booking closer to the match date.</p><figure id=\"attachment_2351369\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2351369\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-2351369\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230910_151526-1694339334.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A quarter full R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Sri Lanka.\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2351369\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Known as the home of Sri Lankan cricket, the R Premadasa Stadium will host India vs Pakistan on Sunday [File: Hafsa Adil/Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><p>Accommodation costs rose sharply as well.

I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.”</p><p>It was not clear from his message what those legal reasons might be. But Trump’s post comes two days after the US House of Representatives successfully passed a bill to require documents that prove citizenship before voter registration.</p><p>That bill, however, is unlikely to go any further, as it faces steep odds in the Senate.</p><p>In the US, it is illegal for non-citizens to participate in elections, and voter fraud is exceedingly rare.</p><p>Nevertheless, Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that election rigging is widespread. Trump himself has continued to falsely claim that he won the 2020 presidential election, despite bipartisan pushback from election officials about the accuracy of the tally.</p><p>But faced with drooping poll numbers, Trump has turned his attention to November’s midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress for the last two years of his term.</p><p>Already, Trump has expressed fears that, should the Democrats claim the majority in the Republican-held House of Representatives, he could face a third impeachment.</p><p>He was successfully impeached twice in his first term, once for abusing his office and a second time for inciting an insurrection, after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.</p><p>The midterms featured prominently in Trump’s message on Friday. He urged Republicans to leverage popular support for voter ID laws in their campaigns for November.</p><p>“Republicans must put this at the top of every speech – It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND,” Trump wrote.</p><p>A study from the Pew Research Center in 2025 found that US citizens from both major parties overwhelmingly supported requiring photo identification before registering to vote.</p><p>The rate was higher among Republicans, 95 percent of whom supported such measures. But approximately 71 percent of Democrats also favoured such legislation.</p><p>But voting rights advocates and Democratic leadership have largely opposed such measures.</p><p>They argue that providing photo identification could be burdensome for members of low-income and marginalised communities who may not have easy access to documents that prove their identity.</p><p>That, in turn, could disenfranchise US citizens who might otherwise cast a ballot.</p><p>Voter ID laws are not uncommon in the US, though: Roughly 36 states have measures on the books that require residents to show proof of identity before voting, though they vary as to their strictness.</p><p>Congress has also weighed such bills before, including last year. But a renewed push has begun as the midterm elections approach and Trump pressures states for increased federal control over elections.</p><p>The US Constitution requires that states, not the federal government, administer the “times, places and manner of holding elections”. Election organising, therefore, takes place at the state and local level.</p><p>But Trump has threatened to take away that constitutional power. Speaking to conservative podcaster Dan Bongino earlier this month, the president suggested the federal government should take over the election process.</p><p>“We should take over the voting, the voting, in at least, many, 15 places,” Trump said, tripping over his words slightly. “The Republicans ought to nationalise the voting.”</p><p>His comments coincided with the reintroduction of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act earlier this month.</p><p>The expanded version of the bill initially required proof of citizenship, not just at the time of voter registration but ahead of each ballot cast, in the form of a passport or a birth certificate – documents many US citizens lack.</p><p>That provision has since been amended, but critics have also blasted measures that would require state voter rolls to go to the federal government as unconstitutional.</p><p>The bill passed the House on Wednesday with 218 votes in support and 213 against. Only one Democrat, Henry Cuellar, voted in favour of the latest SAVE Act.</p><p>But even with its House passage, the legislation is unlikely to attract enough backing to overcome the Senate filibuster, a tool which allows the minority to block passage of a bill if it fails to attract at least 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber.</p><p>Trump railed against the filibuster, and Democrats in general, in his social media post on Friday.</p><p>“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” he wrote.</p><p>He also called upon the Supreme Court to reject Democrats’ priorities, calling them “corrupt”, “deranged”, “demented” and “evil”.</p><p>But advocacy groups like the Brennan Center for Justice called on the Senate to reject the latest voter ID push.</p><p>“These bills are part of a broader federal agenda to sow distrust in our elections, undermine election administration, and discourage Americans from making their voices heard,” the Brennan Center said in a statement.</p><p>“Congress should stand firm once again and reject the SAVE Act.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The drop in support would seem to suggest that the public has turned away from the People’s Party’s call for structural reform in Thailand’s economy and politics.</p><p>Votes appear to have shifted to Anutin’s camp, an arch-nationalist who represents the interests of the country’s political and economic elite.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>‘Baan Yai’ (Big Houses) politics</h3><p>Though allegations of vote-buying and other polling irregularities in close constituency contests were growing, even the People’s Party leader, Nattaphong Ruengpanyawut, said it would not have been large enough to change the overall result.</p><p>Instead, a tearful Nattaphong apologised in a television interview to the party’s faithful and his members of parliament who lost their seats.</p><p>“I’m sad how the results turned out … but despite these tears, I’m committed to carrying on working for the people,” the 38-year-old said.</p><p>Analysts and political insiders told Al Jazeera that the People’s Party’s loss of voters – apart from urban areas in and around the capital, Bangkok, and the northern city of Chiang Mai – pointed to the deeper realities of Thai politics that continue to be insurmountable for reformists.</p><p>First among those obstacles is political patronage, experts say, where political support is based upon the promise of future favours.</p><p>Powerful political dynasties, called “Baan Yai” (Big Houses) in the Thai language, are entrenched across the country and particularly in Chonburi, Buriram and Sisaket provinces.</p><p>The “Baan Yai” joined forces under Anutin’s Bhumjaithai Party umbrella and brought along their followers to block out the People’s Party on election day.</p><p>“It’s been like this for a really long time,” said an aide to one of the most prominent of the political dynasties.</p><p>“In Bangkok, they think of their MPs as lawmakers, but we see them as village heads – someone who goes out and bats for you,” said the aide, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.</p><p>“This is a person you see every day. This is the person who fixes your problems,” the aide added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>‘The only safety net they have’</h3><p>Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a constitutional law scholar at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the People’s Party may have made a strategic mistake by neglecting “to combat the entrenched influence of Baan Yai” over local voters.</p><p>“Because resources are so scarce, rural populations do not view an MP as a representative in the civic sense … instead, they see them as a ‘clan leader’,” Khemthong explained.</p><p>“They remain tethered to this patronage system because it is effectively the only safety net they have,” he said.</p><p>Thailand’s last election in 2023 delivered a shock warning to some of those dynasties – in Chiang Mai and Chonburi – as younger voters could not be counted on to respect the influence of the Baan Yai at the polls.</p><p>That year, a so-called “orange wave” got behind the strong pro-democracy and reform message of the Move Forward Party – the People’s Party predecessor – after nine years of military rule by former army chief Prayut Chan-ocha.</p><p>Move Forward won that election, but it was promptly dissolved as a political party by the courts over its intention to reform the country’s draconian royal defamation laws, which protect Thailand’s powerful monarchy from criticism.</p><p>Move Forward rose from the ashes and came back as the People’s Party. But with its front-line leaders banned from politics, the movement struggled to reorganise across Thailand, another reason given for the party’s shortfall at the polls last weekend.</p><p>History also appears to be repeating.</p><p>Barely 24 hours after polling stations closed, Thailand’s National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) forwarded a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to ban 44 of the People’s Party Members of Parliament – including Natthaphong – from politics.</p><p>The Supreme Court’s decision could result in a lifetime ban for the progressive MPs – the latest legal blows to its momentum.</p><p><a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/will-pro-military-message-bring-thailands-most-hawkish-party-to-power\">Nationalism also played a big part</a> in Anutin’s win, particularly in the wake of the recent border war with neighbouring Cambodia.</p><p>Bhumjaithai cast itself as the party that got behind the military during the conflict and cast its political rivals as less able to protect the country.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"politicians-buy-the-poverty-of-rural-people\">‘Politicians buy the poverty of rural people’</h2><p>Now, as <a href=\"/news/2026/2/6/as-thais-head-to-polls-can-the-reformist-peoples-party-break-the-cycle\">election analysts assess the results</a>, it appears that the return of the Baan Yai was the most crucial to Anutin’s decisive win, as old political power brokers consolidated under Bhumjaithai’s conservative credentials and refrained from splitting the vote share, which would have been advantageous to the progressive bloc.</p><p>“Voter turnout is at a historic low in the last 30 years, only 65 percent, according to the Election Commission,” said Prinya Thaewanarumitkul, a Thai politics expert and an academic at Thammasat University in Bangkok.</p><p>“When voter turnout is low, the ‘organised votes’ [mobilised supporters] and the influence of the ‘Baan Yais’ become the deciding factors,” he said.</p><p>Preliminary results show that Bhumjaithai made significant gains from central Thailand to the northeast, as well as the southernmost border area with Malaysia – many seats being won due to support from political families who expressed their support publicly for Anutin before the vote.</p><p>Beyond the drop in support for reformers and MPs losing their seats, the vote has left many Gen Z supporters at a loss as to why people did not choose to change Thailand for the better. They wonder why their countrymen appear to have thrown their support behind conservatism rather than change, especially when the poor are falling further behind the rich in Thailand’s slowing economy.</p><p>For People’s Party voter Arsikin Singthong, 22, who lives in Thailand’s southern Muslim-majority border province of Pattani, the reason can be found in money, politics and rural poverty.</p><p>“These Baan Yai politicians buy the poverty of rural people. This is the game,” Arsikin told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“But they can’t buy the urban population any more because we have already woken up,” she said.</p><p>The return of the political dynasties as power brokers reflects the systemic poverty still found in many parts of rural Thailand, analysts say.</p><p>The northeast, north and south lean towards political dynasties and populist promises in nearly all Thai elections, they say.</p><p>“The country is fundamentally split by resource allocation,” said Chulalongkorn University’s Khemthong.</p><p>“A younger generation has managed to break free from these patronage networks,” Khemthong said, referring to urban voters who form the People’s Party support base in Bangkok and elsewhere.</p><p>“They have the luxury of dissent because they have exited the system that still binds those left behind,” he added.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Now it is time for the government to make amends.”</p><h2 id=\"a-surprise-trip-turned-deportation\">A surprise trip turned deportation</h2><p>Lopez Belloza, 19, was arrested on November 20 by immigration agents at Boston’s Logan airport.</p><p>The college freshman had been preparing to board a flight home to her family in Texas to surprise them for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p><p>She has since told The Associated Press news agency that she was denied access to a lawyer after her initial detention at the airport. The immigration agent told her she would need to sign a deportation document first, according to Lopez Belloza, who said she denied the offer.</p><p>For the next two nights, she said she was kept by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in a holding room with 17 other women, without enough room to lie down.</p><p>Then, she was loaded onto a deportation flight, which took her to Texas, then to her native Honduras, on November 22.</p><p>“I was numb the whole plane ride,” Lopez Belloza told the AP. “I just kept questioning myself. Why is it happening to me?”</p><p>Her lawyers, however, had obtained during that time a court order barring her removal from Massachusetts for 72 hours. Lopez Belloza’s deportation violated that court order.</p><p>She has remained in Honduras for the last two and a half months, while legal challenges over her case proceeded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312184\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312184\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312184\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_698f8288-1771012744.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C1156&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Babson College student Any Lucia Lopez Belloza poses wearing a mortarboard after graduating from high school in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., in 2025. massdeportationdefense.org/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4312184\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Babson College student Any Lucia Lopez Belloza poses after graduating from high school in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2025 [Handout via Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"a-legal-battle\">A legal battle</h2><p>In court, the Trump administration has apologised for the error in Lopez Belloza’s case, acknowledging that a mistake was indeed made.</p><p>“On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologise,” prosecutor Mark Sauter told the court.</p><p>But Sauter rejected accusations that the government wilfully defied the 72-hour court order, saying that Lopez Belloza’s deportation was the mistake of one ICE agent and not an act of judicial defiance.</p><p>The government has also argued that Lopez Belloza was subject to a removal order before her November 20 arrest and therefore should not be returned to the US.</p><p>Lopez Belloza was brought to the US from Honduras when she was eight years old, and in 2016, she and her mother were ordered to be deported.</p><p>But the college freshman said she had no knowledge of any deportation order and has told the media that her previous legal representation had assured her there was no removal order against her.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Trump administration has rejected efforts to bring Lopez Belloza back to the country, even on a student visa.</p><p>In a February 6 court filing, US Attorney Leah B Foley wrote that a student visa “is unfeasible as the Secretary of State lacks authority to adjudicate visa applications and issue visas”.</p><p>“In any event,” Foley added, “Petitioner appears ineligible for a student visa.” She explained that Lopez Belloza “would remain subject to detention and removal if returned to the United States”.</p><p>The filing ended with a warning to the court to “refrain from ordering Respondents to return Petitioner to the status quo because this Court lacks authority”.</p><p>The Trump administration has questioned the authority of federal courts to intervene in immigration-related matters.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-series-of-mistakes\">A series of mistakes</h2><p>Critics, meanwhile, have accused the Trump administration of repeatedly failing to heed court orders it disagrees with.</p><p>Lopez Belloza’s case is not the first instance of an immigrant being wrongfully deported since the start of Trump’s second term.</p><p>Trump had campaigned on a pledge of mass deportation, and he has followed through with that promise, leading a series of controversial immigration crackdowns that have been accused of violating due process rights.</p><p>One of the most high-profile cases came in March 2025, when his administration wrongfully deported a Salvadoran father named Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his wife, a US citizen.</p><p>Abrego Garcia had been subject to a 2019 court order barring his removal from the US on the basis that he could face gang violence in El Salvador.</p><p>But he was nevertheless sent back to the country and was briefly held in El Salvador’s Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT), a maximum-security prison.</p><p>On April 10, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return, largely upholding a lower court’s decision.</p><p>But the Trump administration initially argued Abrego Garcia was outside of its power. Then, on June 6, it abruptly announced Abrego Garcia had been returned, only to file criminal charges against him and seek his deportation a second time.</p><p>Another case involved a Guatemalan man, identified only by his initials OCG.</p><p>He had been under a court protection order that barred him from being returned to Guatemala, for fear that his identity as a gay man would subject him to persecution.</p><p>But the Trump administration detained and deported him instead to Mexico, which in turn sent him back to Guatemala. He subsequently went into hiding for his safety.</p><p>In June, OCG was returned to the US after a court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. It also noted that OCG’s deportation “lacked any semblance of due process”.</p><p>Lopez Belloza continues her studies at Babson College remotely from Honduras as she awaits the outcome of her legal proceedings.</p></div></div></body></html>"
