This does not include the US and Mexico, which are bound by the <a href=\"/economy/2025/10/7/canadas-carney-makes-second-white-house-visit-as-trade-tensions-loom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States-Canada-Mexico</a> free trade deal.</p><p>Canada will also impose a global 25 percent tariff on targeted imported steel-derivative products, and incorporate border measures to combat steel dumping.</p><p>In July, Ottawa set a quota of steel imports at 50 percent of the 2024 level from non-FTA countries in a bid to stop the dumping of foreign steel into Canada.</p><p>The measures are being tightened to open up the domestic market for Canadian-produced steel, said a government official.</p><p>The steel industry contributes more than 4 billion Canadian dollars ($2.8bn) to Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) and employs more than 23,000 people directly. It is, however, one of the two sectors hit hardest by US President Donald Trump’s 50 percent tariffs on steel imports from Canada.</p><p>Trump has imposed 50 percent tariffs on steel, and softwood lumber, long subject to US tariffs, is currently taxed at 45 percent after the Trump administration’s hike last month.</p><p>Carney said the decades-long process of an ever-closer economic relationship between Canada and the US is now over.</p><p>“As a consequence, many of our strengths have become vulnerabilities. Last year, more than 75 percent of our exports went to the United States. Ninety percent of our lumber exports, 90 percent of our aluminium exports, and 90 percent of our steel exports, all bound for a single market,” Carney said.</p><p>Ottawa will work with railway companies to cut freight rates for the inter-provincial transfer of Canadian steel and lumber by 50 percent, beginning in early 2026.</p><p>“We will make it more affordable to transport Canadian steel and lumber across the country by cutting freight rates,” Carney said.</p><p>The government said it would also support the use of locally made steel and lumber in homebuilding, and financial aid for companies dealing with tariff-related impacts, such as on their workforce, liquidity crunch, and for restructuring operations.</p><h2 id=\"trump-tensions\">Trump tensions</h2><p>Trump cut off trade talks with Canada last month after the Ontario provincial government ran television advertisements in US markets that criticised Trump’s tariffs by citing a speech by <a href=\"/news/2025/11/1/canadas-carney-says-he-apologised-to-trump-over-reagan-anti-tariff-ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">former US President Ronald Reagan</a>.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Carney said he would be in Washington for the final draw on December 5 for the FIFA World Cup 2026 tournament. He said he would speak to Trump then and said he spoke briefly to the president on Tuesday.</p><p>“We are ready to re-engage on those talks when the United States wants to re-engage,” Carney said.</p><p>Carney’s announcement comes even as there is increased pressure on US businesses reeling from Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>Deere &amp; Co, the maker of John Deere tractors, said on Wednesday that it expects a bigger hit from tariffs in 2026. The company expects a pre-tax tariff hit of around $1.2bn in fiscal 2026, compared with nearly $600m in 2025.</p></div></div></body></html>"

top of the group.</p><p>Jurrien Timber headed Mikel Arteta’s side in front from a corner after 22 minutes, only for Bayern teenager Lennart Karl to equalise in style before half-time.</p><p>Arsenal dominated the second half, though and showed their immense squad depth as substitutes Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli scored the goals to make it five wins from five.</p><p>It proved a quiet return to north London for prolific Bayern striker Harry Kane as his side suffered their first defeat of the season in all competitions.</p><p>With Inter Milan dropping points, Arsenal are now the only team in the competition with a maximum 15 points and look all but assured of a place in the last 16.</p><p>Six points clear at the top of the Premier League and Bundesliga respectively and boasting flawless records after four games in the Champions League, Arsenal and Bayern Munich have been Europe’s stand-out teams this season.</p><p>The sides met in the quarterfinals two years ago with Bayern coming out on top, but Arsenal have moved to another level since that clash and went into Wednesday’s game on a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions.</p><p>With last-16 spots already looking safe for both clubs, the 15th meeting between them lacked jeopardy, but bragging rights and psychological blows were up for grabs.</p><p>It was Arsenal who emerged with both, thanks to a win

simple goal that has become their trademark.</p><p>Bukayo Saka swung in a corner, Myles Lewis-Skelly got the slightest of nudges on Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer, and Timber rose to glance a header into the net.</p><p>The lead lasted only 10 minutes, though, as Bayern responded with another move right off the training ground.</p><p>After a long passing sequence, Joshua Kimmich’s raking pass found Michael Olise, whose volleyed pass across the face of goal was met by 17-year-old Karl, who became the first player to score against Arsenal in the Champions League this season.</p><p>While Kane was largely peripheral, Karl was impressive and should probably have scored again early in the second half when he burst into the area but shot straight at goalkeeper David Raya.</p><p>After that, Arsenal took charge.</p><p>Mikel Merino went close when he nodded a header down and just wide from a Declan Rice corner, Cristhian Mosquera was denied by Neuer and the keeper then saved from Rice after the midfielder’s marauding run.</p><p>Bayern’s defence was creaking, though and Arsenal’s pressure paid off in the 69th minute when Riccardo Calafiori fired in a cross from the left that fellow substitute Madueke turned in for his first goal for the club.</p><p>Neuer then had a moment to forget when he charged out of his goal eight minutes later, trying to cut out Eberechi Eze’s pass, but got nowhere

He then headed in an Arda Guler cross two minutes later, and before the Greeks had time to recover from the double strike, the France forward completed his hat-trick with another fine finish.</p><p>The Spaniards hit the woodwork through Aurelien Tchouameni in a strong first half, but the hosts cut the deficit seven minutes after the restart through Mehdi Taremi’s close-range header before Mbappe’s tap-in from yet another Vinicius Jr assist briefly restored order.</p><p>Olympiacos scored again with Ayoub El Kaabi’s 81st-minute header, but despite intense late pressure, they could not find another goal as Real snapped their three-game winless run in all competitions.</p><p>Real climbed to fifth place on 12 points from five games in the league phase table, with the top eight earning automatic qualification for the knockout stage and with three matchdays remaining. Olympiakos are 33rd with two points.</p><h2 id=\"ucl-holders-psg-made-to-work-by-tottenham\">UCL holders PSG made to work by Tottenham</h2><p>Holders Paris St Germain showed a never-say-die attitude as they twice came from behind to beat Tottenham Hotspur 5-3 in the Champions League, with two moments of brilliance from Vitinha steering Luis Enrique’s side to victory.</p><p>PSG looked fragile at the back, conceding twice from defensive lapses and showing some of the same issues that contributed to their 2-1 defeat by Bayern Munich in the previous round, but they responded with greater control and efficiency to turn the match around at the Parc des Princes.</p><p>Vitinha bagged a hat-trick with two fine strikes and a penalty, while Pacho and Fabian Ruiz also scored for PSG, who were made to work after Tottenham twice led through Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani, the France forward finishing with a double.</p><p>After four victories in five games, PSG, who finished with 10 men after Lucas Hernandez was sent off in stoppage time, are second in the league phase standings, on course for direct qualification to the last 16, while Tottenham are 16th on eight points.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Traditionally, the host of the G20 summit closes the meeting by banging a gavel and then passing the little wooden hammer to officials from the next country to hold the meeting.</p><p>But on Sunday, Ramaphosa did not pass the gavel to anyone.</p><p>Trump confirmed reports on Wednesday that he had offered to send a member of the US Embassy to accept the gavel, but that the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/23/s-africa-says-g20-shared-goals-outweigh-differences-as-it-concludes-summit\">offer had been rejected</a> by Ramaphosa’s administration as a slight.</p><p>“At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S. Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony,” Trump wrote. “Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"heightened-tensions\">Heightened tensions</h2><p>Ramaphosa largely avoided addressing the US absence during the G20 conference, instead underscoring his push for global unity and efforts to combat inequality.</p><p>“Our G20 Presidency has been rooted in the conviction that the world needs more solidarity, equality and sustainability,” Ramaphosa <a href=\"https://x.com/CyrilRamaphosa/status/1993281148852560015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a> on social media on Tuesday.</p><p>“While some have sought to create division and polarisation between nations, we have reinforced our shared humanity. We have fostered collaboration and goodwill. Above all, we have affirmed that our shared goals outweigh our differences.”</p><p>The increasingly hostile relations between South Africa and the US began early in Trump’s second term as president.</p><p>On February 7, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/addressing-egregious-actions-of-the-republic-of-south-africa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued</a> an executive action denouncing South Africa for alleged human rights abuses against white Afrikaners and saying that all aid and assistance to the country would stop.</p><p>As of fiscal year 2023, US assistance to South Africa totalled approximately $441.3m, according to government statistics. In fiscal year 2024, which is only partially reported at present, the total rose to approximately $581m.</p><p>In February’s order, Trump also directed US government agencies to assist in the resettlement of Afrikaners as “refugees” in the US.</p><p>He doubled down on that call in late October, when he set the lowest cap on refugee admissions in US history.</p><p>Of the 7,500 available refugee slots, the Trump administration <a href=\"/news/2025/10/30/trump-announces-lowest-refugee-admission-cap-in-us-history-at-7500\">called for the majority to be</a> “allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa” and other “victims of illegal or unjust discrimination”.</p><p>In May, Trump also <a href=\"/news/2025/5/22/trumps-ramaphosa-ambush-key-takeaways-from-heated-white-house-meeting\">hosted Ramaphosa at the White House</a>, where he attempted to confront the South African leader with accusations of genocide in his country. Some critics have compared the meeting to an “ambush”.</p><p>Ramaphosa, for his part, has repeatedly denied the accusations. <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/trumps-us-boycott-of-g20-summit-is-their-loss-south-africa-says\">When asked by reporters</a> about the US boycotting the G20 this year, he said bluntly, “Their absence is their loss.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

On one hand, it argued that violent gang activity and instability in Haiti were national security threats to the US.</p><p>On the other, it maintained that conditions in Haiti were safe enough to merit the return of the Haitians currently shielded by TPS.</p><p>Nixing the programme for Haitian nationals, the department said, would be akin to giving a vote of confidence to Haiti’s future.</p><p>“Ending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti reflects a necessary and strategic vote of confidence in the new chapter Haiti is turning,” the notice said.</p><p>“The United States cannot call for bold change on the ground while signaling doubt from afar.”</p><p>Temporary Protected Status is a short-term protection granted to foreign applicants who are already in the US but find that conditions in their home country have become unsafe due to conflict, disaster or other emergency circumstances.</p><p>The programme allows recipients to remain in the country legally and receive authorisation to work.</p><p>At the start of the year, citizens of 17 countries were protected by different TPS programmes, including Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen.</p><p>But the Trump administration has sought to eliminate many of the TPS designations, arguing that they run contrary to US national interests.</p><p>The rollback is part of a larger trend to curtail immigration into the US and implement what Trump has promised will be the “largest deportation in the history of our country”.</p><p>But critics warn that revoking TPS and refusing to extend protections will send some foreign nationals back into dangerous situations, where their lives could be in peril.</p><h2 id=\"a-humanitarian-crisis\">A humanitarian crisis</h2><p>The TPS programme for Haitian citizens was originally opened on January 21, 2010, shortly after a catastrophic, 7.0-magnitude earthquake shook the island country.</p><p>Nearly 222,570 people were killed, and more than 1.3 million were displaced from their homes, according to US government statistics.</p><p>That same year, Haiti experienced its first outbreak of cholera in nearly a century. An estimated 10,000 deaths were linked to the disease’s spread at the time, and a new resurgence since 2022 has killed thousands more.</p><p>Haiti is considered the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere, and it has long struggled with inadequate housing, food scarcity and insufficient health services.</p><p>Those problems have been compounded by corruption and upheaval in the Haitian government as well as the spread of gang violence.</p><p>In 2019, national elections were indefinitely postponed, and in 2021, then-President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home in Petionville. No president has replaced him since, and a round of national elections was again postponed from this year to late 2026.</p><p>The last democratically elected officials in the Haitian National Assembly saw their terms expire in 2023.</p><p>A nine-member transitional presidential council currently holds governing power, but its mandate is slated to expire in February.</p><p>In the absence of government leadership, gangs and other criminal organisations have spread in Haiti, taking control of as much as 90 percent of the capital, Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Human rights abuses have proliferated as the gangs expanded their reach. Just this year, from April to June, at least 1,617 people were killed in the violence. In 2024, the death toll was 5,600, an increase over 2023.</p><p>At least 1.4 million people are currently displaced from their homes as a result of the fighting.</p><h2 id=\"court-challenges\">Court challenges</h2><p>But Trump officials have argued that the previous administration, under President Joe Biden, exceeded its authority in approving repeated TPS extensions for Haitians and other foreign groups.</p><p>Trump has accused Biden of allowing unfettered immigration into the US and has sought to reverse some of his predecessor’s efforts.</p><p>In July 2024, the Biden administration approved the most recent TPS extension for Haitians, allowing the protections to continue for an additional 18 months.</p><p>But in February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, under Trump’s authority, announced she would “partially vacate” the extension, cutting it from 18 months to 12.</p><p>That would have forced Haitians with TPS to leave the country or find alternative immigration pathways no later than September 2.</p><p>The US State Department currently lists Haiti under a category-four travel advisory, indicating the highest level of danger. It cites the current state of emergency in the country and notes that there are threats from “kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity, civil unrest and limited health care”.</p><p>“Do not travel to Haiti for any reason,” the State Department advises on its website.</p><p>Plaintiffs have pointed to that fact to argue that curtailing the extension is not only illegal but also irresponsible.</p><p>“Revoking Haitians’ legal immigration status that has kept them safe with their families in the US is cruel and dangerous,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement earlier this year, as she and 18 other state prosecutors filed an amicus brief to stop the TPS revocation.</p><p>“Haitian immigrants have contributed immensely to our communities, neighborhoods and local economies, and without them, New York and this nation would not be the same.”</p><p>Some of the legal challenges to the Trump administration’s decision have raised the question of racial animus.</p><p>While campaigning for re-election in 2024, for instance, Trump spread unfounded and racist claims about Haitian immigrants in the US, including that they eat neighbourhood pets.</p><p>In July, a federal court in New York heard one of the cases against shortening the TPS extension, known as Haitian Evangelical Clergy Association v Trump.</p><p>Judge Brian Coban ruled that shortening the timeline was “arbitrary and capricious” and “violated plaintiffs’ due process rights”.</p><p>His <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.528747/gov.uscourts.nyed.528747.63.0_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ruling</a>, however, left open the possibility that the Trump administration could simply let the existing extension period expire, as it does in Wednesday’s notice.</p><h2 id=\"arguing-for-expiration\">Arguing for expiration</h2><p>The notice announcing the end of the TPS protections makes several arguments for why an end to the programme is necessary, at least according to Noem.</p><p>“The Secretary has determined that while the current situation in Haiti is concerning, the United States must prioritize its national interests,” the notice said. “Permitting Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the U.S. national interest.”</p><p>It also described Judge Coban’s decision in July as “interference” in the work of the executive branch.</p><p>The notice asserts Noem has “determined that there are no extraordinary and temporary conditions in Haiti” that should prevent TPS recipients from “returning in safety”.</p><p>But “even if the Department found that there existed conditions that were extraordinary”, it maintained that national security concerns prevented the government from extending the TPS programme.</p><p>Undocumented immigrants from Haiti continue to arrive in high numbers to the US, the notice said.</p><p>It also pointed to the threat of Haitian gangs and organised crime. Earlier this year, the Trump administration labelled two Haitian groups, Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif, as “foreign terrorist organisations”, as part of a larger crackdown against Latin American criminal networks.</p><p>The notice also highlighted the absence of a central government in Haiti. “This lack of government control has not only destabilized Haiti internally but has also had direct consequences for US public safety,” it said.</p><p>Still, it underscored Noem’s belief that there have been “positive developments” in Haiti.</p><p>In October, for example, the United Nations Security Council approved the creation of a Gang Suppression Force to help bolster Haiti’s police.</p><p>That initiative would replace a Kenya-led, UN-endorsed multinational mission that has struggled to make a dent in Haiti’s gang violence.</p><p>The notice argued that offering TPS protections would undermine goals for Haiti’s recovery.</p><p>“Our immigration policy must align with our foreign policy vision of a secure, sovereign, and self-reliant Haiti,” the notice said.</p><p>Nonetheless, its assessment of Haiti’s safety was measured. Only “parts of the country are suitable to return to,” it said.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Trump administration also announced it was peeling back TPS protections for <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/trump-administration-ends-temporary-immigration-status-for-myanmar-citizens\">citizens of Myanmar</a>, another country facing chronic instability.</p></div></div></body></html>"

And on Tuesday, large protests called for by an Alawite religious leader took place in the religious minority’s traditional heartlands in Latakia and Tartous.</p><p>But, so far, Syria has avoided another outbreak of sectarian violence, unlike a number of occasions – such as in the <a href=\"/news/2025/11/18/syria-launches-first-trial-over-coastal-violence-that-killed-thousands\">coastal areas</a> in March and again in <a href=\"/news/2025/7/15/syrian-troops-enter-druze-city-of-sweida-after-days-of-deadly-clashes\">Suwayda</a> in July – in the almost one year since the fall of ex-President Bashar al-Assad. Security forces from the Minister of Interior and Defence deployed to the area and, in tandem with some tribal leaders, calmed the situation. A <a href=\"/news/2025/11/24/syria-extends-homs-curfew-as-killings-threaten-to-inflame-sectarian-tension\">curfew</a> was imposed by Syrian authorities.</p><p>How dangerous is the potential for sectarian violence in Syria? What is the government doing to prevent it? And why are some minority communities in Syria worried about their future?</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-was-the-government-s-response-to-the-violence\">What was the government’s response to the violence?</h2><p>The government appears to have acted quickly to ease tensions, particularly after the violent response to the killing from some tribal members in Homs’s Alawite neighbourhoods. No casualties were officially reported, though monitoring groups said there were dozens of injuries.</p><p>Government security forces, working alongside tribal leaders, calmed tensions and arrested 120 people involved in the violence.</p><p>Reports from the ground indicate that the deployment has had a positive effect in preventing violent clashes, unlike earlier this year in incidents along the Syrian coast and in Suwayda, when groups or tribes reportedly affiliated with the government mobilised and contributed to widespread violence, alongside armed fighters from minority groups.</p><p>The new Syrian government has faced criticism internationally for its failure to stop those attacks, even as it announced investigations. With <a href=\"/news/2025/11/10/all-you-need-to-know-about-al-sharaas-historic-visit-to-the-us\">international legitimacy</a> one of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s main priorities, the government has quickly acted to ensure that another round of clashes does not take place.</p><p>The Syrian government, whose leadership is from the country’s Sunni Muslim majority, has also sought to cast doubt on whether sectarianism was a motivating factor behind the killing of the Bedouin couple. Interior Ministry spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba saying that the sectarian messages found next to the bodies were likely planted “to mislead investigators and incite strife”.</p><p>The Homs Internal Security Commander, Brigadier General Marhaf al-Naasan, posted a statement on Facebook, saying that the government “strongly condemns this heinous crime and affirms that its objective is clearly to ignite sectarian rhetoric and sow discord within our community”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-current-situation-in-homs\">What is the current situation in Homs?</h2><p>The sectarian tension has not disappeared, but the curfew was lifted by Tuesday morning.</p><p>During the Syrian uprising that eventually brought down al-Assad, Homs was described by some activists as the heart of the revolution. Members of its Sunni Muslim community in particular had long complained about oppression from the al-Assad regime, which was led by Alawite.</p><p>Homs is still a multifaith and multiethnic city, with Sunni, Alawite and Christian communities.</p><p>Since the ouster of al-Assad in December 2024, Alawite in Homs have reported cases of discrimination, violence, and eviction from their homes. After the coastal violence in March, some Alawite fled Syria for villages in Lebanon’s Akkar region.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-has-happened-elsewhere-in-syria-since-the-homs-violence\">What has happened elsewhere in Syria since the Homs violence?</h2><p>The situation in Homs kicked off protests along the coast – known for its large Alawite communities – particularly in Latakia, where hundreds gathered.</p><p>Protests took place in Latakia’s Agriculture Roundabout, the al-Azhari Roundabout and al-Hammam Square. There were also sit-ins in the al-Qusur neighborhood in the city of Baniyas, according to Enab Baladi, a Syrian local media outlet.</p><p>The cities of Jableh, Qardaha, Safita, Dreikish, Sheikh Badr – all in the Latakia or Tartous regions – witnessed sit-ins calling for “the human right to live in safety and dignity” and against the “killing of Alawites”, according to Enab Baladi.</p><p>Reports said that some protesters chanted that the Syrian people are one, while others said there were calls for federalism. There were also calls to release Alawite prisoners detained by the new government.</p><p>The protests were called for on Monday by the head of the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council Ghazal Ghazal. Ghazal called on his community to protest peacefully.</p><p>A pro-government counterprotest also gathered in Jableh and Banias. Reuters reported gunfire at the protest by security forces to break up two rival demonstrations. The government told Reuters that “unknown assailants had also fired on civilians and on the security forces”.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"is-this-a-turning-point-for-syria-s-government\">Is this a turning point for Syria’s government?</h2><p>It is too early to say whether the government has fully been able to prevent a new round of sectarian violence, but the fact that the situation in Homs did not spiral into days of widespread violence is an important step to regaining the trust of many around the country.</p><p>“The communication from the government side was good,” Lina Ghoutouk, a Syrian researcher and human rights specialist, told Al Jazeera. “It was clear that this violence, aggression, or sectarianism is completely unacceptable.”</p><p>But Ghoutouk said more progress is needed to disarm the tribes and bring them under the authority of the state security forces.</p><p>“The problem is that the root cause is not controlled,” she said.</p><p>“Uncontrolled weapons on the loose mean [such incidents] could happen again.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>British Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the latest <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/25/why-the-uks-2025-budget-has-rachel-reeves-facing-an-impossible\">budget</a> on Wednesday, setting out sweeping tax hikes which are projected to raise 26.1 billion pounds ($34.4bn) for the public purse by 2030.</p><p>The budget had been highly anticipated as a “make or break” moment for the UK’s governing Labour party, which has grappled with poor polling over the past year. Earlier this year, an opinion <a href=\"/news/2025/7/3/could-far-right-reform-really-in-a-uks-general-election-now\">poll by YouGov</a> found that if an election were to be held now, the far-right Reform UK Party, which takes a hard line on immigration, would come to power.</p><p>In an embarrassing turn, the country’s Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) published its economic outlook as a result of the budget on its website two hours before the announcement – something it never normally does until afterwards. Reeves called the blunder “deeply disappointing” and a “serious error”.</p><p>Reeves acknowledged that the tax rises – to be paid in large part by freezing existing income tax thresholds, meaning more people will pay higher tax as their incomes rise with inflation – would adversely affect working people. This breaks a key pledge Labour made in its manifesto before last year’s general election.</p><p>“We are asking everyone to make a contribution,” Reeves told parliament.</p><p>However, she said the tax rises would help pay for nearly 22 billion pounds ($28.9bn) in fiscal headroom within five years. Reeves also said government borrowing would fall each year. Borrowing in 2025-26 is expected to be 138.3bn pounds ($183bn), falling to 112.1 billion pounds ($148.3bn) the year after and to 67.2 billion pounds ($88.9bn) by 2031.</p><p>While the UK’s budget deficit is forecast at 28.8 billion pounds for the financial year 2026/2027, Reeves said this would move to surplus in 2028 and forecast a 24.6 billion pounds ($32.55) surplus for 2030/2031.</p><p>That will pay for welfare spending and means there “will be no return to austerity measures”, Reeves said.</p><p>“I said there would be no return to austerity, and I meant it. This budget will maintain our investment in our economy and our National Health Service. I said I would cut the cost of living, and I meant it. This budget will bring down inflation and provide immediate relief for families. I said that I would cut debt and borrowing, and I meant it,” Reeves said.</p><p>Here are five key takeaways from this budget.</p><h2 id=\"1-labour-broke-its-promise-not-to-raise-taxes-for-working-people\">1. Labour broke its promise not to raise taxes for working people</h2><p>Reeves raised taxes by about 40 billion pounds ($52.6bn) in last year’s budget – the biggest hike in revenue-raising measures in decades – in what she said would be a one-off needed to put the government’s finances on an even keel.</p><p>This time around, while she did not increase income tax or National Insurance Contributions for working people, she did extend a freeze on the income thresholds at which tax must be paid.</p><p>This means that more people will be dragged into higher tax brackets as their income rises with inflation. The move will pull 780,000 more people into paying basic-rate income tax for the first time by the 2029-2030 fiscal year along with 920,000 more higher-rate taxpayers and 4,000 additional-rate payers.</p><p>“This ‘fiscal drag’ means that hundreds of thousands will start paying income tax for the first time, and all existing taxpayers will face higher liabilities,” Irem Guceri, associate professor of economics and public policy at Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government, said.</p><p>The previous Conservative government had already frozen these thresholds until 2028. Reeves, who was highly critical of that action at the time – saying it hurt working people – now plans to extend that to 2031.</p><p>“I know that maintaining these thresholds is a decision that will affect working people,” she said. “I said that last year, and I won’t pretend otherwise now.”</p><p>“I can confirm that I will not be increasing National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax or VAT [value added tax],” the chancellor added.</p><p>Reeves said she will also <a href=\"/news/2025/11/19/are-the-superrich-really-fleeing-the-uk-due-to-taxes\">target wealthier people</a> via a “mansion tax” on those who own property worth more than 2 million pounds ($2.65m) and is reducing the amount of tax relief some higher earners can obtain on pension contributions. She also announced a 2 percentage point increase in tax rates on rental income, dividends and capital gains.</p><p>Nigel Green, chief executive of the financial advice firm DeVere, said these moves will have wider “behavioural impacts”. “People make long-term decisions about where to work, where to build wealth and where to retire,” he said.</p><p>“When rules around pensions tighten sharply, it undermines confidence in the broader system. Wealth moves where governments show stability over decades, not sudden extractions,” he added.</p><p>Following the announcement, Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative party, described Reeves decision to raise taxes, despite promising not to do so again, as “a total humiliation”.</p><h2 id=\"2-labour-will-spend-money-on-welfare\">2. Labour will spend money on welfare</h2><p>One of the highly anticipated announcements of the budget was the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap from April 2026. Currently, parents can only claim special tax credits worth about 3,455 pounds ($4,571) per child for their first two children. The cap was imposed by the previous Conservative government. Reeves said this would lift thousands of children out of poverty.</p><p>“The removal of the two-child limit in child benefit is likely to provide significant support to families currently living in poverty,” Guceri said.</p><p>Experts said the move would appeal strongly to Labour Party backbenchers. “The two-child benefit cap is widely despised among rebellious Labour MPs as a major contributor to child poverty,” said Colm Murphy, senior lecturer in British politics at Queen Mary University, London. “Repeal was critical for Reeves to have any chance of political survival.”</p><p>Gregory Thwaites, research director at Resolution Foundation (RF), a British think tank that focuses on improving living standards, also said the move was a positive step towards reducing child poverty in the UK.</p><p>“That’s something that we’ve been campaigning for RF for some time, and we’re very pleased to see that. And then there are some welcome reforms to the tax system, as well. So, for example, charging the people who own very expensive properties a bit more money that will, that’s very welcome, as well,” Thwaites told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Ultimately, budgetary responsibility should not just be seen in terms of fiscal balance but also measures of broader wellbeing,” said professor Jasper Kenter, professorial research fellow at Aberystwyth Business School. “Lifting the two-child benefit cap is important in this regard.”</p><p>GMB workers’ union General Secretary Gary Smith welcomed Reeves’s decision to tax wealth and to increase welfare spending, calling this budget the “final nail in the coffin for the Conservatives’ failed austerity project”.</p><p>“Key public services, essential national infrastructure, and communities across the UK suffered deep wounds because the Tories made the wrong economic choices – we must never go back to those dark days,” a statement from Smith read.</p><p>“The challenge for Labour is to grip the task of rebuilding our economy and country, lock in essential investment to create growth, and start bringing a bit of hope to people,” the statement added.</p><h2 id=\"3-uk-s-hated-rape-clause-will-be-scrapped\">3. UK’s hated ‘rape clause’ will be scrapped</h2><p>Reeves said she would scrap the so-called “rape clause”, which exempts women from the two-child benefit cap policy if they can prove their child was conceived non-consensually.</p><p>She described the exemption requirement as “vile, grotesque, dehumanising, cruel”.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">“I’m proud to be Britain’s first female chancellor,” Reeves told parliament. “I take the responsibilities that come with that seriously. I will not tolerate the grotesque indignity to women of the rape clause any longer.”</p><h2 id=\"4-slower-than-expected-economic-growth-forecast\">4. Slower-than-expected economic growth forecast</h2><p>In response to the budget, the OBR upgraded its forecast for economic growth for this year from 1 percent to 1.5 percent.</p><p>However, it downgraded economic growth for the following four years. GDP growth in 2026 is now expected to be 1.4 percent (down from 1.9 percent), while the OBR has downgraded its forecast for each of 2027, 2028 and 2029 to 1.5 percent (down from approximately 1.8 percent).</p><p>Much of the downgrade stems from lower expectations for productivity growth. Reeves insisted the sluggish outlook was the legacy of the previous Conservative government, however.</p><p>Reeves also announced a freeze on fuel duty and rail fares, as well as support with energy bills, causing the OBR to revise inflation down by 0.4 percentage points for next year, Guceri said. However, the OBR revised up its forecast for this year to 3.5 percent, “reflecting stronger real wage growth and persistent food price pressures”, she added.</p><h2 id=\"5-the-pound-and-financial-markets-responded-positively\">5. The pound and financial markets responded positively</h2><p>Sterling rose by 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.3213 just in advance of the budget announcement, before settling back to roughly where it started by the end of it.</p><p>London’s blue-chip FTSE index and the FTSE 250 index rose by about 0.6 percent each in the wake of the budget.</p><p>“So far, markets showed little reaction to the Budget – something the Chancellor will view as a success,” Guceri said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

Other factors constricting supply include the closure of the Mexican border to live cattle due to concerns over screwworm and steep tariffs on foreign beef.</p><p>Cattle prices paid to ranchers are separate from consumer beef prices, which, as of September, were $6.32 for a pound (453 grams) of ground beef, an 11 percent rise from September 2024 when they were $5.67 a pound. The Bureau of Labor Statistics did not release economic data, including the consumer price index for last month, because of the government shutdown.</p><p>Trump had no patience for the typically loyal ranchers objecting to his plan to import more Argentinian beef, which they saw as a threat to their recent economic gains.</p><p>“If it weren’t for me, they would be doing just as they’ve done for the past 20 years – Terrible! It would be nice if they would understand that,” Trump wrote in an October post on his Truth Social platform.</p><p>While Corbitt Wall, a commercial cattle manager and market analyst, is clear that he “totally supports Trump and everything he does”, he also saw hubris and a misunderstanding of the cattle industry by the president.</p><p>“There was not a person in the cattle business on any level that was not insulted by that post,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Wall religiously follows prices across the cattle trade from ranch to slaughterhouse and has watched the futures market for cattle slide down by more than 15 percent since Trump’s October 21 announcement.</p><p>Futures prices dictate what ranchers can expect to sell cattle for down the line and sway current sale prices as well. For ranchers’ sake, Wall said he hopes Trump leaves the cattle market alone.</p><p>“He doesn’t live in this world, in this cattle world, and doesn’t realise the impact that a statement can make in our business,” Wall said.</p><h2 id=\"years-of-rough-seasons\">Years of rough seasons</h2><p>Oregon rancher David Packham said that while cattle prices have jumped in ranchers’ favour, many are still struggling in the face of years of rough seasons.</p><p>Years of drought across the country raised feed costs for all and pushed some ranchers to sell off cattle. Sticker prices on farm equipment from tractors to pick-up trucks have ballooned as well, especially on the back of supply chain challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, and are expected to rise further on account of Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>Packham said he has regularly sold cattle at a loss and doesn’t want consumers to think ranchers are living high off the hog.</p><p>“I’m looking at a 40-year-old tractor that I use on a daily basis just to keep putting off replacing it, making repairs, although it’s difficult to find parts for now, just to keep it limping along because I couldn’t afford $100,000 for a new tractor,” Packham said. “When I say we’re not really making a whole lot of money, it’s because we have all this loss carryover.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4131299\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4131299\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image000000-1764109356.jpg\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4131299\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image000000-1764109356.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C577&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Nevada Livestock Marketing in Fallon, NV, October 2025\" fetchpriority=\"low\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4131299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cattle are sold at Nevada Livestock Marketing in Fallon, Nevada [Courtesy of Corbitt Wall]</figcaption></figure><p>Packham was a registered Republican until Trump’s first term. The president’s Argentina comments and the subsequent chaos for the cattle industry have propped open a door for ranchers critical of Trump, but they represent a minority within the community, he said.</p><p>“I’m noticing more and more of them [ranchers] that had been cautiously neutral, that are now kind of like me and just saying, ‘You know what? No. This is bulls***. He’s a train wreck,’” Packham said.</p><h2 id=\"perennial-issue\">‘Perennial issue’</h2><p>One action ranchers can support, however, is Trump’s November 7 announcement of a Department of Justice investigation into the big four US meatpackers – Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef – “for potential collusion, price fixing and price manipulation”.</p><p>Historically, ranchers looking to sell cattle have held little negotiating power as the four companies control more than 80 percent of the market.</p><p>However, a prior Department of Justice investigation into meatpacker price-fixing was started under the first Trump administration in 2020 due to a gulf created by falling cattle prices and rising consumer beef prices. The investigation continued under President Joe Biden’s administration but was never publicly concluded. According to Bloomberg News, the investigation was quietly closed with no findings just weeks before Trump announced the November antitrust probe.</p><p>James MacDonald, a research professor in agricultural and resource economics at the University of Maryland, views the administration’s antitrust investigation announcement as “entirely for political consumption”.</p><p>“It is a perennial issue that p***es off ranchers, and you can gain some political ground by attacking the packers,” MacDonald said.</p><p>Packham would prefer the new investigation to come at a different time and said that given the squeeze from the tight cattle market, packers are operating under slimmer margins and not from a position of absolute power.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>On Friday, Tyson announced the closure of a Nebraska beef-processing plant that employed more than 3,000 people. MacDonald called the decision a “shock” indicative of the depths of the US beef shortage. The current low cattle inventory in the US came from years of drought, which wiped out grazing lands and slowed herd rebuilding. Replenishing the cattle supply chain is a years-long process.</p><p>“That’s sort of a fact and a fundamental, and it’s not going to change for a while,” MacDonald said.</p><p>MacDonald also doesn’t believe the increased Argentina imports will ease this shortage or lower prices as the country largely sends lower-grade, lean beef to the US, accounting for only 2 percent of imports. He expected that while the reintroduction of largely lean Brazilian beef will impact the import market, it holds less weight on overall beef supply.</p><p>MacDonald also cited heifer retention numbers, which indicate how many female cattle that ranchers hold back to produce future herds years down the line, which are still low.</p><p>Tyson likely factored in these numbers when making the decision to shutter its Nebraska plant, and it doesn’t seem like the industry is expecting herd numbers to rebound either, MacDonald told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“It’s Tyson saying we don’t think cattle supplies are going to recover anytime soon,” MacDonald said.</p><p>While the actual mechanisms of Trump’s recent policies might not budge consumers’ bottom lines or change the cattle market for the time being, Wall is more concerned about the ripple effects from the news cycle, saying ranchers “live and die” by the cattle markets. While his faith is shaken, Wall regardless believes that ranchers, conservative as ever, will show up for Trump when election time comes around.</p><p>“You look at what the other side has to offer, and there’s no way people are going to go for that,” Wall said. “So in the long run, they’ll stick with him.”</p></div></div></body></html>"
