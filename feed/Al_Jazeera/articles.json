The 47-year-old Pacquiao <a href=\"/sports/2025/7/20/manny-pacquiao-mario-barrios-fight-to-majority-draw\">ended his four-year retirement</a> last year, and he is scheduled <a href=\"/sports/2026/2/18/boxing-legend-manny-pacquiao-to-face-ruslan-provodnikov-in-april\">to meet Ruslan Provodnikov</a> on April 18 in the second bout of his comeback.</p><p class=\"p1\">Mayweather and Pacquiao did not announce a weight class or length for their second bout.</p><p class=\"p1\">The two most prominent boxers of their generation will meet again, 11 years after Mayweather beat Pacquiao by decision in a fight that did not live up to the decade of hype preceding it. The bout’s promoters claimed it was still the most profitable fight in history, setting pay-per-view records and drawing worldwide attention.</p><p class=\"p1\">“I already fought and beat Manny once,” Mayweather said in a statement. “This time will be the same result.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Pacquiao later revealed he fought with a shoulder injury because he did not want to postpone such an important event.</p><p class=\"p1\">He was unable to apply his usual offensive pressure to Mayweather, who employed his typical defence-first strategy while easing to victory.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4333766\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4333766\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4333766\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/reuters_699d6eca-1771925194.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Jul 19, 2025; Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; Manny Pacquiao fights Mario Barrios at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

The streamer showcased Terence Crawford’s victory over Canelo Alvarez last year, and it will present heavyweight champ Tyson Fury’s comeback bout in April.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Sphere venue, which opened in 2023, hosted an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) show in 2024. UFC President Dana White said the promotion had to pay roughly $20m to produce that show – about 10 times more than a normal UFC pay-per-view event – because of the venue’s unusual capabilities and requirements.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

At its furthest advance in March 2022, Moscow’s forces occupied roughly 27 percent of Ukrainian territory. That early momentum, however, proved unsustainable.</p><p>In the second half of 2022, Ukraine mounted sweeping <a href=\"/news/longform/2022/10/14/mapping-one-month-of-ukraines-counteroffensive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">counteroffensives</a> that unravelled Russian positions in Kharkiv oblast and forced a withdrawal from Kherson city. By late November, the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, DC, estimated Ukraine had reclaimed approximately 74,000sq km (28,600sq miles), reducing Russian control to about 19 percent of the country.</p><p>From 2023, the conflict became one of attrition centred on the mineral-rich Donbas region. Russian forces took Soledar and Bakhmut after months of brutal combat, and, in 2024, Avdiivka – gains that were secured at extraordinary human and material cost. That same year, Ukraine mounted a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, underscoring that the front line into Russia’s west was not impenetrable.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4333428\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4333428\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4333428\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-DYNAMICS-OF-TRUST-IN-PRESIDENT-ZELENSKYI-FEB15-2026-copy-2_1-1771917329.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE - DYNAMICS OF TRUST IN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYI - FEB15, 2026 copy 2_1-1771917329\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4333428\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>By 2025, despite heavy reported losses, Russia had only gained a further <a href=\"/news/2026/1/2/over-400000-russians-killed-wounded-for-0-8-percent-of-ukraine-in-2025\">0.8 percent</a> of Ukraine’s territory, according to Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii. These advances mainly occurred in Donetsk, particularly in the town of Pokrovsk, which saw only 70 metres (77 yards) of Russian advances a day in 2025, according to the Reuters news agency. Pokrovsk was finally captured by Russia in early <a href=\"/news/2025/12/2/russia-says-it-captured-pokrovsk-a-key-logistics-hub-in-eastern-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December</a>.</p><p>According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), an independent conflict monitor, the capture of Pokrovsk paved the way for operations in Dnipropetrovsk, resulting in a tripling of violence in the region compared with the year before.</p><p>Moscow’s forces concentrated fighting around the logistical hub of <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/russia-claims-to-have-seized-more-than-5100-square-km-of-ukraine-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kostiantynivka</a>, which they entered in December, in a bid to gain control of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – the last major cities under Ukrainian control in Donetsk.

According to ACLED, in 2025, drone-led targeting of civilians became the leading form of attack, dwarfing other media.</p><p>Shelling, artillery and missile attacks initially dominated the conflict, with more than 101,200 events recorded since the war began. While these types of events have decreased as the war has gone on, there has been a rise in air/drone attacks and armed clashes.</p><p>Air and drone attacks rose from 6,000 in 2023 to almost 16,000 in 2024 and more than 29,000 in 2025. The jump reflects Russia’s expanding drone programme.</p><p>Russia is mainly using Shahed-type drones in their attacks. At the start of the war, these low-cost weapons were primarily supplied by Iran. Now, similar drones are produced in Russia, costing between $20,000-50,000 in production. For example, Geran-2, which are Russian analogues of the Iranian missiles, can reach a range up to 2,000km (1,243 miles) depending on the type. According to the ISW, Russia is producing these drones in Tatarstan, a republic about 800km (500 miles) east of Moscow.</p><p>In January, Ukraine’s top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskii, said: “At the moment, the enemy produces daily 404 ‘Shaheds’ (Iranian-designed drones) of different kinds. And the plans are to increase that. The enemy plans to boost production significantly, up to 1,000 drones a day.”</p><p>Ukraine has employed several tactics and weapons to take down or disable drones, including modern air defence systems, mobile fire teams and electronic warfare.</p><p>However, Russia escalated its use of coordinated mass strikes with waves of drone attacks, missiles and decoys used to overwhelm air defences in Ukraine.</p><p>Particularly devastating drone attacks on civilians have landed in densely populated cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv and <a href=\"/news/2026/2/23/four-killed-in-russian-attacks-in-ukraine-ahead-of-eu-ministers-meeting#:~:text=In%20the%20south%2C%20two%20people,on%20the%20Telegram%20messaging%20app.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Odesa</a>.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"more-than-1-900-attacks-on-energy-infrastructure\">More than 1,900 attacks on energy infrastructure</h2><p>Last month, 16-year-old Taira Sluisarenko’s apartment building in eastern Kyiv was hit by a Russian drone, blowing out windows and buckling walls in the apartments above hers.</p><p>“I was sitting on the toilet floor and right away felt [the explosion] shake us more than usual,” she <a href=\"/news/2026/2/10/in-ukraine-deaths-from-hypothermia-rise-as-russia-attacks-energy-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> Al Jazeera.</p><p>A second drone struck the same location and killed Serhiy Smolyak, a 56-year-old emergency medic, and wounded his colleagues. Russia deployed 278 missiles and drones that night, which killed four and injured dozens.</p><p>Days later, with temperatures plunging to -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit), President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared a nationwide state of emergency for the energy sector, stating that Ukraine’s energy system was meeting only 60 percent of the country’s electricity needs.</p><p>Across Ukraine, similar strikes have played out with grim regularity since 2022, falling hardest in winter, when they strip millions of heat, water and power as temperatures plunge double-digits below freezing.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>According to data from ACLED, since the conflict began, Russia has carried out more than 1,900 attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, which, before the war, was one of Europe’s most robust. The majority of attacks have occurred along the front line.</p><p>On January 16, Defence Minister Denys Shmyhal said: “There is not a single power plant left in Ukraine that the enemy has not attacked.”</p><p>Depending on the facility and scale of damage, the time it takes to repair Ukraine’s energy infrastructure ranges from hours or weeks to months or years.</p><p>In September last year, Russia launched yet another campaign of targeted attacks against energy infrastructure in Ukraine in the lead-up to the coldest months. October saw the highest number of attacks with 175 strikes, followed by January with 138 attacks.</p><p>Across the country, generation plants and distribution networks have buckled under the recent assaults, and rolling blackouts have returned.</p><h2 id=\"the-failure-of-peace-talks\">The failure of peace talks</h2><p>In the past four years, there have been more than a dozen rounds of peace talks and summits, other than sporadic direct negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.</p><p>The most intensive period of negotiations came in the first two months of the war, with five rounds of talks held in <a href=\"/news/2026/2/18/russia-ukraine-talks-all-the-mediation-efforts-and-where-they-stand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Belarus</a> and Turkiye between late February and late March 2022. The most significant were held on March 29, 2022, in Istanbul, where Ukraine presented a detailed 10-point proposal, including neutrality. The talks collapsed in April following the discovery of mass civilian killings in Bucha, 25km (16 miles) west of Kyiv.</p><p>From mid-2022 until early 2025, diplomatic efforts were dominated by multilateral summits, which excluded Russia. Without Moscow’s participation, none of these summits yielded breakthroughs.</p><p>Direct negotiations resumed in <a href=\"/news/2025/6/3/russia-ukraine-direct-talks-no-ceasefire-but-what-did-they-agree-to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 2025</a>, when Turkiye successfully brought both sides to Istanbul for two rounds of talks, which resulted in a prisoner exchange.</p><p>The most recent developments have been the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/7/us-has-given-ukraine-and-russia-june-deadline-to-end-war-zelenskyy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump administration</a>’s engagement starting in late January 2026, with envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner facilitating trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi and Geneva. They are the first sustained direct negotiations since Turkiye’s first efforts in 2022. As of yet, there have no breakthroughs on a peace agreement.</p><p>Talks so far have not yielded results, as Russia has demanded it wants control of all of the Donbas region and the denial of NATO membership to Ukraine. But Ukraine has ruled out ceding control of its territory. Kyiv also wants security guarantees as part of any deal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid linked to thousands of deaths in the US.</p><p>Beyond drug trafficking, the group profits from extortion, migrant smuggling, and oil and mineral theft.</p><p data-start=\"605\" data-end=\"641\">It operates across much of Mexico and has built international trafficking routes stretching through Latin America to the US and parts of Asia.</p><p data-start=\"726\" data-end=\"841\">The cartel has also been linked to a series of high-profile attacks against security forces and public officials.</p><p data-start=\"843\" data-end=\"1131\">In 2015, gunmen shot down a Mexican military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade during an operation to capture its leader.</p><p data-start=\"1133\" data-end=\"1466\">In June 2020, the group attempted to assassinate then public security secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch in Mexico City. He survived. Two bodyguards and a civilian were killed.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-operate\">How does it operate?</h2><p data-start=\"397\" data-end=\"482\">Analysts say the cartel’s growth has been driven as much by strategy as by brutality.</p><p data-start=\"484\" data-end=\"653\">“The CJNG has normalised the worst horrors of the Mexican drug wars, bodies hanging from lampposts, decapitated heads on the side of the road,” Chris Dalby, senior analyst at Dyami Security Intelligence, told Al Jazeera.</p><p data-start=\"655\" data-end=\"795\">But he argues the violence is not random. It is deliberate and performative, designed to dominate rivals quickly and discourage resistance.</p><p data-start=\"797\" data-end=\"948\">“That was an aberration a generation ago. The CJNG made it almost daily news. And that’s because of the way El Mencho trained his cartel.</p><p data-start=\"1153\" data-end=\"1346\">“He trained them almost like Genghis Khan in their approach to conquest,” Dalby said, referring to the feared Mongol warrior. “They would wipe out opposition and use that as a warning: If you oppose us, this is what will happen to you.”</p><p data-start=\"1348\" data-end=\"1583\">That approach helped the cartel grow quickly across multiple states, but it also meant constant confrontation. Much of its influence rests on mobility, intimidation and strategic alliances rather than deeply rooted territorial control.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331507\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331507\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331507\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-23T022824Z_1735401018_RC2ERJARFBG3_RTRMADP_3_MEXICO-VIOLENCE-DRONE-1771831015.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C428&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mexico fears more violence after army kills Jalisco cartel leader\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4331507\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Smoke billows from burning vehicles in Puerto Vallarta amid a wave of violence, with torched vehicles and gunmen blocking highways in more than half a dozen states [Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"what-is-next-for-mexico-after-the-killing-of-el-mencho\">What is next for Mexico after the killing of ‘El Mencho’?</h2><p>The death of Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera is one of the most significant blows to a Mexican criminal organisation.</p><p>While experts note the CJNG may now be in a “weaker position”, many warn that “decapitating” the cartel without dismantling its resources is a mistake.</p><p>Critics argue that instead of long-term “financial strangulation”, the government has returned to a strategy that previously failed during the presidency of Felipe Calderon (2006-2012).</p><p>Under Calderon, a hardline military offensive targeted cartel leaders in an effort to dismantle organised crime. But while several senior drug kingpins were captured or killed, the crackdown led to violent fragmentation. Hundreds of thousands were killed or disappeared in the years that followed, yet criminal groups ultimately adapted and continued to expand.</p><p data-start=\"0\" data-end=\"362\">When the current governing party, Morena, came to power in 2018 under former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, it promised a different approach. Obrador’s slogan, “abrazos, no balazos” (“hugs, not bullets”), signalled a move away from high-profile kingpin takedowns towards social programmes and addressing root causes of violence.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4333324\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4333324\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4333324\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2024-10-01T210657Z_1233931981_RC2NBAABELIX_RTRMADP_3_MEXICO-POLITICS-1771913645.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador gestures on the day of President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum's swearing in ceremon\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4333324\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador [FILE: Quetzalli Nicte-Ha/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><p data-start=\"364\" data-end=\"567\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Critics now question whether that strategy has eroded amid sustained US pressure on President Claudia Sheinbaum to curb drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl, with Washington repeatedly urging tougher action against major cartels.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"7\">In Sunday’s operation, the Mexican government stated it was carried out by Mexican special forces with intelligence support from the US.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"8\">“We see that both the US government and Mexico’s are turning once again to the same strategy of decapitating a cartel while the entire structure continues to exist, along with all the human and material resources they had to operate,” Meza of Defensorx said.</p><p data-path-to-node=\"9\">Analysts expect a new, unpredictable wave of violence. “We will see violence in a different pattern, in a different form, and with different motivation,” said Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on non-state armed groups at the Brookings Institution. She added that this could last “for months to come and potentially years to come as the criminal landscape is being redesigned”.</p><h2 id=\"will-the-jalisco-cartel-survive\" data-path-to-node=\"9\">Will the Jalisco cartel survive?</h2><p>Yes, in all likelihood, say experts.</p><p>According to Meza, the Mexican government, by killing a leader while the organisation “is still at its peak”, has triggered a cycle of retaliation and internal power struggles.</p><p>This is because the cartel still “has the capacity to set half the country on fire”, and, separately, local rivals could now “test how far they can go to see if the CJNG gives ground”, Dalby explained.</p><p>Ultimately, experts suggest that removing a figurehead does not dismantle the business.</p><p>“El Mencho’s removal is like saying that a company is going to fail because you take out the CEO,” Dalby added.</p><p>“Not at all. The flow of drugs is going to continue … and there are going to be plenty of pretenders to the throne. And Mexico is going to have to figure that out.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332975\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332975\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20210424__98M7AC__v1__HighRes__MexicoViolenceCartelsReligion-1771895875.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bullet holes are seen in a sanctuary at El Aguaje community, after a confrontation between Los Viagras Cartel and the Jalisco Nueva Generacion Cartel,\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bullet holes are seen in a sanctuary at El Aguaje community, after a confrontation between Los Viagras Cartel and the Jalisco Nueva Generacion Cartel, in Aguililla, state of Michoacan, Mexico, on April 23, 2021 [Enrique Castro/AFP]</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

ability to serve as an ambassador.</p><p>“We must have an explanation with him,” Barrot said, speaking to public broadcaster France Info. “We don’t accept that foreign countries can come and

If the Israeli people can do it, we can also do it,” Chakravorty told the gathering, adding that the Modi government was “determined” to do so.</p><p>Six years later, Chakravorty’s words ring truer than ever. As Modi prepares for his second visit to Israel starting on February 25, the two countries are bound by more than just friendship, trade and military partnerships – they are increasingly, say some analysts, also joined at the hip in certain facets of their models of governance.</p><p>Under Modi, India has openly embraced Israel – at the <a href=\"/features/2026/2/23/how-modi-broke-down-walls-between-india-israel-at-palestines\">expense</a> of its longstanding support for the Palestinian cause, say analysts. But New Delhi, they add, also appears to have imported multiple elements of Israel’s security and administrative approach to Palestinians, and unleashed them into its domestic policies since Modi took power in 2014.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332441\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332441\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332441\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-17T084945Z_766476451_RC1AE9AD5D10_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771863278.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C527&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi Israel\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332441\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu writes a message in the visitors’ book as his wife Sara and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi look on, during a visit to Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad, India, January 17, 2018 [Amit Dave/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"hostile-subjects-under-occupation\">‘Hostile subjects under occupation’</h2><p>At the heart of these deepening ties, say analysts, is a shared ideological vision.</p><p>Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has roots in a philosophy, Hindutva, that seeks to turn India into a Hindu nation and a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – similar to Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland.</p><p>“The India-Israel relationship under Modi is a bond between two ideologies that see themselves as civilisational projects and Muslims as demographic and security threats,” said Azad Essa, author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel.</p><p>“The friendship works because they have similar supremacist ends,” Essa told Al Jazeera. “Under Modi, India and Israel became strategic partners, and Delhi began to see Israel as a template and as key to India’s move toward becoming a great power.”</p><p>One of the most apparent examples of India borrowing from Israel is the so-called “bulldozer justice” policy of Modi’s party.</p><p>Over the past decade, authorities in several BJP-ruled states have demolished the homes and shops of hundreds of Muslims and also razed multiple mosques. These demolitions have been carried out, for the most part, without legal notices being issued to occupants or owners of the establishments. They have usually followed religious tensions in the particular neighbourhood, or protests against Modi government policies – and sometimes, after just a local argument that had taken on religious overtones.</p><p>One of the BJP’s top leaders, Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, is now known by his supporters as “Bulldozer Baba” (Daddy Bulldozer).</p><p>It’s a leaf straight out of Israel’s playbook. Israel has demolished thousands of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and displaced their residents, making way for illegal Israeli settlements. And during Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, almost all of the Palestinian territory’s homes, offices, hospitals, schools, universities and places of worship have been destroyed or badly damaged.</p><p>“The Hindu nationalist belief system is steeped in affinity for Zionism and Israel,” said Sumantra Bose, a political scientist whose work focuses on the intersection of nationalism and conflict in South Asia. “Generations of [Rashtriya SwayamSevak Sangh, the ideological fountainhead of the BJP] cadres, Modi included, have been indoctrinated in this ideology and have imbibed the love of Israel.”</p><p>The nation-state of Israel, which Bose characterised as majoritarian and supremacist, is the model Hindu nationalists are implementing in India in the Modi era, he argued. “The Israeli ideal finds reflection in many policies and measures of Modi’s government.”</p><p>Muslims in India have faced a range of social boycotts in recent years. It is increasingly difficult to rent a home, Muslim children often face bullying and harassment at school, and the community has mostly fled a number of villages after attacks.</p><p>In November 2024, India’s top court ruled that government authorities cannot demolish any property – even if belonging to people accused of a crime – without following due legal process. However, on the ground, such demolitions continue.</p><p>Essa, the author of Hostile Homelands, said both India and Israel use the bulldozing of homes and properties “to target and punish certain populations and underscore a political message to communities, including who may belong to the nation and who is an outsider”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4332439\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4332439\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4332439\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2018-01-15T083553Z_1879430900_RC1CE343E010_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-ISRAEL-1771863248.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C508&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Modi ISrael\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4332439\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu adjusts his headphones as he and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi attend a signing of agreements ceremony at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India, January 15, 2018 [Adnan Abidi/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"overarching-shadows-of-security-doctrine\">Overarching shadows of security doctrine</h2><p>At the forefront of India-Israel bilateral ties are their defence relations and an overlapping security doctrine. India is the largest buyer of Israeli weapons, pumping in billions of dollars in purchases.</p><p>India has also supplied weapons to Israel amid its ongoing genocidal war on Gaza. Israel has provided joint training sessions for Indian soldiers with the Israeli army, alongside a wide array of Israeli systems, including UAVs, air defence systems, and advanced radar and surveillance technology.</p><p>But among advocates of a deeply securitised Indian state, Israel has long had an appeal that extends far beyond its supply of advanced weapons.</p><p>After gunmen killed 26 civilians in the tourist town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22, 2025, India bombed multiple locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, accusing Islamabad of being behind the attack on tourists.</p><p>Pakistan, which denied any role, hit back, firing missiles and drones as the nuclear-armed neighbours engaged in an intense four-day air war.</p><p>During that period, debates and shows on several Indian TV news channels were rife with references to Israel after the attack in Kashmir. Arnab Goswami, an anchor, stated: “22 April is to India what 7 October was to the Israelis,” referring to the day when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel in 2023. A guest on the programme said, “We demand we turn Pakistan into Gaza.”</p><p>A retired top policeman, who was posted in Indian-administered Kashmir, told a Hindi newspaper that “we must respond like Israel.”</p><p>Among Israel’s most controversial security exports to India is the sophisticated spyware, Pegasus, made by the Israeli software firm NSO Group.</p><p>Siddharth Varadarajan, cofounder of The Wire, a nonprofit news website publishing from New Delhi, was one of the journalists targeted by the spyware that an Israeli firm reportedly sold to the Modi government under an undisclosed defence deal.</p><p>“[The Israeli spyware] turns an iPhone into a personal spying device,” Varadarajan told Al Jazeera, recounting his experience, adding that it could secretly record and transmit video and photographs.</p><p>“This Israeli model of using spyware to keep an eye on any possible arena of opposition or criticism is something that the Modi government has adopted and embraced wholeheartedly,” he said.</p><p>India’s Supreme Court appointed an expert committee, which found malware in some phones but said it could not conclusively attribute it to Pegasus, citing limited cooperation from the Modi government.</p><p>Varadarajan said that even if some repressive ideas are not exclusively Israeli, the Indian government has been “a happy adopter”. India ranks at the top among democracies that impose internet restrictions, and the country has slid in multiple democracy indices in recent years.</p><p>Referring to the overlapping patterns in India and Israel’s policies, Varadarajan said, “It is a great pity that methods that the Israelis use against occupied people are being used by the Modi government against its own citizens.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4299762\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4299762\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4299762\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-08T163436Z_723218502_RC2P7JA6BDJI_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-1770628461.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"West Bank\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4299762\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Palestinian woman ushers her children away from a group of Israeli soldiers during a weekly settlers’ tour in Hebron, in the Israeli‑occupied West Bank, January 24, 2026 [Mussa Qawasma/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"treat-populations-like-external-threats\">‘Treat populations like external threats’</h2><p>To be sure, India has long battled a series of internal security challenges of its own, as it has tried to unify and hold together a large and diverse landmass: Separatist movements have ranged from its northeast to Kashmir. In 1966, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered helicopter gunships to bomb parts of the northeastern state of Mizoram to quell a rebel movement.</p><p>Other regions, especially India’s deep south, have long worried about the Hindi-speaking north trying to dominate them culturally – this has led to sporadic tussles over language and resources.</p><p>But amid all of that, “what Israel has done is help provide India with the technology and expertise to become more oppressive, authoritarian, and militarised, like Israel,” Essa told Al Jazeera. “And these methods are all-encompassing: They treat populations as external threats.”</p><p>Nowhere is that clearer than in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p><p>One of the world’s most militarised zones, Kashmir has since August 2019 been stripped of not just its earlier semi-autonomous status, but of most democratic power – as a region – that other provincial authorities have. The Modi government’s move to kill political dialogue or diplomatic engagement when it comes to Kashmir also mirrors Israel’s approach, said Bose, also a professor of international politics at Krea University, in India.</p><p>“It echoes Netanyahu’s approach of rejection and non-engagement with the Palestinians and the exclusive reliance on military power,” he added.</p><p>To be sure, Kashmir and Palestine have a very distinct past and present. Still, India’s approach to Kashmir increasingly carries parallels with Israel’s treatment of the West Bank, said Essa.</p><p>“There is the militarisation, population management, and the legal regimes that allow both India and Israel to conduct their occupations and maintain daily control over the people – from checkpoints to raids and communication blackouts,” Essa told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Like the occupied West Bank, India maintains Kashmir in a state of almost permanent emergency, where military presence, surveillance, and extraordinary legal powers shape everyday life,” he argued. “And like the West Bank, daily governance in Kashmir is outsourced to local administrators with limited real power.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Afghan Ministry of Defence said the strikes hit a religious school and residential homes, killing and wounding dozens, including women and children. Afghan sources told Al Jazeera that at least 17 people were killed in Nangarhar alone. Kabul pledged a “measured and appropriate response”.</p><p>Later on Sunday, India entered the picture, condemning the Pakistani military action and throwing in its support for Afghanistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p><p>“India strongly condemns Pakistan’s airstrikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal <a href=\"https://x.com/MEAIndia/status/2025602055684108325?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a>.</p><p>“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” he said.</p><p>In many ways, the statement from New Delhi underscored the unease in Islamabad over India’s growing engagement with Taliban-ruled Afghanistan — an emerging partnership between two countries that Pakistan has repeatedly blamed in recent months for its domestic security turmoil.</p><h2 id=\"breaking-point\">Breaking point</h2><p>Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, in a statement issued on Sunday, said it had “conclusive evidence” that the recent attacks on its soil were carried out by fighters and suicide bombers acting on the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers.”</p><p>It said Islamabad had repeatedly urged Kabul to take verifiable steps to prevent armed groups from using Afghan soil, but that no substantive action had followed.</p><p>“Pakistan has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region,” the <a href=\"https://x.com/MoIB_Official/status/2025316690855354804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2025316690855354804%7Ctwgr%5E7b39f2f3cec4e4b436768e9a65ffdfd38d299f73%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.aljazeera.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D4331765action%3Dedit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a> read, “but the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remain its top priority.”</p><p>Pakistan’s attack shattered a fragile ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye after talks in <a href=\"/news/2025/10/30/pakistan-afghanistan-to-resume-talks-amid-tensions-over-border-clashes\">October</a> and <a href=\"/news/2025/10/29/last-ditch-push-pakistan-afghanistan-talks-falter-amid-deep-mistrust\">November</a>, following earlier rounds of deadly border clashes. The discussions last year had failed to produce a formal peace agreement, and calm along the frontier remained tenuous.</p><p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has repeatedly rejected allegations that it is supporting armed groups that attack Pakistan.</p><p>But as far back as October last year, the Pakistan military’s spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, had warned that Islamabad’s patience was wearing thin.</p><p>“Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations against Pakistan, and there is proof and evidence of that. The necessary measures that should be taken to protect the lives and property of the people of Pakistan will be taken and will continue to be taken,” he said during a press briefing, without presenting evidence publicly.</p><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, after a suicide bombing outside a district court in Islamabad in November, had also stressed the need for cooperation from Kabul.</p><p>“Afghanistan must understand that lasting peace can only be realised by reining in TTP and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"left-between-bad-and-worse-options\">‘Left between bad and worse options’</h2><p>The TTP, which emerged in 2007, is distinct from the Taliban in Afghanistan but shares deep ideological, social and linguistic ties with the group. Pakistan accuses the Taliban of providing sanctuary to the TTP on Afghan soil, a charge Kabul denies.</p><p>Abdul Basit, a scholar at the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said Pakistan’s attack confirms the collapse of the temporary ceasefire that followed the talks late last year.</p><p>Basit questioned the logic behind Pakistan’s bombings.</p><p>“The more Pakistan will strike in Afghanistan, the more Kabul and TTP will come closer,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>At the same time, Basit said, he understood Pakistan’s dilemma. “They have to retaliate after losing so many security personnel,” he said, describing Pakistan as being “left between bad and worse options”.</p><p>The losses for Pakistan in recent months have been steep. Last year was among the deadliest in nearly a decade, with 699 attacks recorded nationwide, a 34 percent increase from the previous year, according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><p>Its 2025 security report said at least 1,034 people were killed in the renewed wave of violence, marking a 21 percent rise in “terrorism-related fatalities”. “In addition, 1,366 people were injured over the course of the year, underscoring the growing human cost of terrorism,” the report said.</p><p>Cross-border air raids are not new. A similar operation in December 2024 killed at least 46 people, most of them civilians. That episode prompted sharp warnings from Kabul, but attacks on Pakistani soil — blamed by Islamabad on the TTP — continued.</p><p>Some experts said Pakistan’s strategy needed to involve more than military pressure on the Taliban.</p><p>Fahad Nabeel, who heads the Islamabad-based research consultancy Geopolitical Insights, said Pakistan must also work to build goodwill among Afghans.</p><p>“Reopening the border and resuming bilateral trade are two possible measures that Pakistan can adopt. Pakistan also needs to share actionable intelligence with allied countries like China, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkiye to increase pressure on the Afghan Taliban to act against anti-Pakistan militant groups,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><h2 id=\"the-india-question\">The India question</h2><p>An intriguing dimension of the crisis has been not only who Pakistan targeted, but who responded.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4331802\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4331802\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4331802\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/getty_699c22b308-1771840179.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"NEW DELHI, INDIA - OCTOBER 12: Afghanistan's Taliban Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, adresses media at a press conference on October 12, 2025 in New Delhi, India.

He offered no public evidence to back his claims.</p><p>Basit said while Pakistan’s attacks on Afghanistan would amount to “India’s gain” — drawing the Taliban and New Delhi closer, with a shared enemy in Islamabad — India faced limitations imposed by geography. “It can provide humanitarian support to Afghanistan, but nothing more than that,” he said.</p><p>Still, Nabeel argued, Pakistani policymakers need clarity on how to address armed groups operating from Afghan soil.</p><p>“Pakistan cannot afford to keep both borders [with Afghanistan and India] engaged at a time when the prospects of military confrontation between the US and Iran are growing with each passing day,” he said, referring to rising tensions in the Middle East.</p><h2 id=\"narrowing-options\">Narrowing options</h2><p>Pakistan’s eastern border with India has remained tense since the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/14/what-did-india-and-pakistan-gain-and-lose-in-their-military-standoff\">two countries had</a> a four-day military confrontation in May last year after an attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed. India blamed Pakistan, which denied any role.</p><p>To the west, the Taliban government shows little sign of acting decisively against the TTP, say Pakistani officials. At home, a surge in attacks, including in big cities, has intensified public pressure on the military to respond forcefully.</p><p>Sunday’s air raids were intended to project strength to Kabul, say experts. Whether they amount to a coherent long-term strategy is less clear, especially as the Taliban has pledged retaliation.</p><p>But Basit pointed out that the Taliban leadership also needs to project strength domestically and respond to entrenched “anti-Pakistan sentiment” among Afghans.</p><p>“Kabul is well within its rights to respond, considering it is a matter of their own sovereignty, but also because by doing that, the public will rally behind them and increase their domestic legitimacy, as we saw in the last cycle of attacks,” he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In a Facebook post, Vyhivskyi wrote that the attack, which was the second involving police in three days, was “not a coincidence” and carried out to “deliberately” kill officers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"tr-story-p1\">An explosion also hit a city police station in the southeastern city of Dnipro, smashing windows and damaging furnishings inside.

Here’s what to expect from Trump’s State of the Union.</p><h2 id=\"when-and-where-will-the-speech-be\">When and where will the speech be?</h2><p>Trump will deliver the speech at 9pm local time (02:00 GMT, Wednesday) in front of members of the 100-member Senate and 435-seat House.</p><p>The speech will take place from the podium in the House chamber, with Trump likely flanked by Vice President JD Vance and the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson, as is tradition.</p><p></p><p>Johnson officially “invited” Trump to deliver the speech last month.</p><p>Under the US Constitution, presidents are required from “time to time” to give Congress “information of the State of the Union” and outline the legislative agenda the White House considers to be “necessary and expedient”.</p><h2 id=\"will-focus-be-on-economy\">Will focus be on economy?</h2><p>In 1992, in summing up the top concern for US voters, Democratic strategist James Carville famously quipped: “It’s the economy, stupid.”</p><p>The assessment has proven enduring. Exit polling suggested Trump’s success in the 2024 election was due, in no small part, to voter concerns over the cost of living, with the US economy still experiencing high inflation and soaring prices as knock-ons from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Trump has <a href=\"/economy/2025/11/18/trump-mcdonalds-lower-prices\">regularly touted</a> the strength of the US economy, but several metrics have shown a mixed bag: relatively strong performance by Wall Street, steady job numbers, but, as announced last week, slower-than-forecasted gross domestic product (GDP) growth at the end of 2025.</p><p>Trump’s <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/12/trump-names-conservative-economist-to-lead-labour-statistics-agency\">move last year to fire</a> Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, baselessly accusing her of producing inaccurate labour statistics, has further stoked concerns over federal government data and reporting on the economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the administration’s hyperbolic assessments have run up against a <a href=\"/economy/2026/1/19/the-us-economy-seems-strong-after-a-year-of-trump-but-is-it-really\">harsh reality</a>: Many US voters have not seen the gains Trump has claimed reflected in their lived experience.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Trump has signalled that he will again send a message that his administration has overcome the country’s “affordability” woes, which he has portrayed as a Democratic bogeyman.</p><p>Public opinion polls indicate otherwise, with a Quinnipiac University poll released in early February showing that just 39 percent of registered voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 56 percent disapprove.</p><p>An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released in December found approval on the issue sat at about 36 percent, the lowest rating for a president over the question’s six-year history.</p><p>“I have to listen to the ‘fake news’ talking about affordability,” Trump said during a speech in Georgia last week.</p><p>“I’ve won affordability,” he added. “I had to go out and talk about it.”</p><h2 id=\"major-blow-to-trade-policy-but-trump-still-defiant\">Major blow to trade policy, but Trump still defiant</h2><p>Trump’s speech comes after he received one of the most substantial blows yet to his policy agenda, with the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trumps-global-tariffs\">Supreme Court rejecting</a> the president’s premise that US trade deficits represented an “emergency” for the country’s national security.</p><p>Trump’s wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs had roiled lawmakers within his own Republican Party, representing a rare area of bipartisan support for checking Trump’s broad interpretation of his executive power.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>But Trump has made it clear that he will continue to impose tariffs on imports using existing US laws, rather than emergency powers.</p><p>“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs,” the US president wrote in a social media post on Monday. “It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”</p><p>The US Bureau of Economic Analysis last week reported that the US <a href=\"/economy/2026/2/19/us-trade-deficit-swells-in-december-as-imports-surge\">trade deficit</a> continued to grow in 2025 despite the administration’s new policies, recording a 2.1 percent increase from 2024.</p><h2 id=\"deportation-drive\">Deportation drive</h2><p>Also closely watched will be how Trump approaches his government’s aggressive policies on immigration, which have seen the administration transform legal immigration, as well as refugee and asylum programmes, while undertaking a no-holds-barred mass deportation drive.</p><p>The first months of Trump’s second term have seen immigration and other federal agents surge to communities across the country, employing what advocates have called a “dragnet” approach, which has increasingly ensnared long-term undocumented residents with no criminal records.</p><p>Critics have further accused the administration of taking increasingly dire measures to meet sky-high immigration detention quotas, sparking outrage and protests among US citizens.</p><p>In January, two US citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by immigration agents in separate incidents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with the Trump administration initially offering <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/trump-administration-maga-allies-spread-misinformation-on-pretti-killing\">accounts of the killings</a> that diverged from video evidence.</p><p>Federal authorities have continued to freeze out independent state investigators from the probes.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The issue has emerged as an <a href=\"/news/2026/1/27/trumps-approval-on-immigration-falls-to-record-low-new-poll-finds\">unexpected vulnerability</a> for Republicans heading into the midterms. While stricter immigration enforcement, on its face, maintains wide support among some segments of voters, public opinion polls have shown widespread dismay over the Trump administration’s actions.</p><p>In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late January, 53 percent of respondents disapproved of Trump’s handling of immigration, up from 41 percent shortly after he took office. Meanwhile, 58 percent said immigration agents had gone too far. The poll was conducted after Good’s January 7 killing, and bridged the time period before and after Pretti’s January 24 killing.</p><p>An Associated Press-NORC poll released in February suggested that 62 percent of Americans felt Trump’s deployments of immigration agents to cities across the country had gone too far.</p><p>Immigration raids have also become a key issue in <a href=\"/news/2026/1/22/catch-of-the-day-trump-launches-new-ice-immigration-crackdown-in-maine\">states like Maine</a>, where the Trump administration launched, and then backed away from, a major operation earlier this month.</p><p>Maine’s Republican Senator Susan Collins is considered one of the most vulnerable for the party in November.</p><h2 id=\"spectre-of-war\">Spectre of war</h2><p>Then there are the soaring tensions with Iran, which have seen the Trump administration lob repeated threats as it surged the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/20/iran-says-us-military-build-up-unnecessary-and-unhelpful-deal-achievable\">largest collection of military assets</a> to the Middle East since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p>On February 19, Trump said he would take 10 to 15 days to decide whether to strike. It is an uncomfortable juxtaposition for a president who <a href=\"/news/2026/1/20/trump-undermined-antiwar-vows-in-first-year-will-democrats-seize-on-this\">came into office decrying</a> decades of US “foreign entanglement”, as well as Washington’s past involvement in foreign regime change and “endless wars”.</p><p>Trump had already launched strikes on Iran in June last year, capping a 12-day war between Iran and Israel.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon has launched a bombing campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, increased strikes in Somalia, Nigeria and Syria, and killed at least 145 people in strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean, in an operation described by rights observers as extrajudicial killings.</p><p>The Trump administration began the year with the extraordinary US military abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a move decried as a flagrant violation of international law and sovereignty.</p><p>Trump is set to speak as a set of US lawmakers has again pledged to introduce a so-called “War Powers resolution” that would rein in Trump’s ability to strike Iran without congressional approval.</p><p>A similar resolution on Venezuela narrowly failed in January, as a handful of Republican holdouts folded.</p><p>Trump also announced last week that the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/trump-announces-billions-of-dollars-in-gaza-aid-at-board-of-peace-meeting\">US was committing $10bn</a> to his so-called Board of Peace, a panel meant to focus on reconstruction and rehabilitation in Gaza, for which Trump has envisioned a wider global role.</p><p>But while the president has been pushing to involve US allies in the Middle East in the future of Gaza, his administration’s staunch support for Israel’s right-wing government is causing friction with some Arab countries.</p><p>Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have expressed outrage at US Ambassador <a href=\"/news/2026/2/22/us-envoy-huckabee-tries-to-deny-saying-he-would-support-israel-expansionism\">Mike Huckabee</a> over the past few days for suggesting that it would be “fine” for Israel to take over most of the Middle East.</p><h2 id=\"democratic-response-and-epstein-guests\">Democratic response and Epstein guests</h2><p>Democrats have tapped Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger to deliver the party’s response to the president’s address, which has become a tradition in the US.</p><p>The choice underscores the narrative Democrats hope to establish going into the midterms: one of stable pragmatism in the face of Trump’s policies of upheaval.</p><p>The selection of Spanberger, a former member of Congress and CIA agent, steers away from the more progressive flank of the party, embodied in figures like New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani.</p><p>Spanberger, who has faced criticism from progressives for her past support of Israel and stances on law enforcement, won her race against incumbent Governor Glenn Youngkin last year by a resounding 15 points, energising beliefs that her brand of affordability-focused politics can make inroads against vulnerable Republicans.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The governor has said she will address “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring”.</p><p>At least 12 Democrats, meanwhile, have said they will boycott Trump’s State of the Union and instead attend a counter-programming event on the National Mall, hosted by the progressive MoveOn and MeidasTouch groups.</p><p>“These aren’t normal times and showing up for this speech puts a veneer of legitimacy on the corruption and lawlessness that has defined his second term,” US Senator Chris Murphy, who is among those boycotting, said in a statement.</p><p>Representatives Jamie Raskin and Suhas Subramanyam have announced they will attend Trump’s address with family members of Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>It comes as Democrats continue to heap <a href=\"/news/2026/2/19/ex-prince-andrews-arrest-spurs-epstein-accountability-calls-from-uk-to-us\">pressure on the administration</a> for accountability related to the sex trafficking ring that the financier, who was found dead by apparent suicide in 2019, was criminally charged with running.</p><h2 id=\"get-ready-to-weave\">Get ready to ‘weave’</h2><p>As with any of Trump’s public events, expect the unexpected.</p><p>The US president rarely stays on script, instead dipping into tangents, meandering stories, and lengthy exposition on personal and political vendettas.</p><p>During his 2024 presidential campaign, as Trump’s ubiquitous stump speeches often dragged on late into the night, he dubbed his rhetorical style “the weave”.</p></div></div></body></html>"
