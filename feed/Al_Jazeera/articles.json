Its inhabitants rely on herding, agriculture, and animal husbandry.</p><p>But this simple way of life is met with daily attacks from settlers and Israeli authorities, who have demolished their homes repeatedly, destroyed their agricultural lands, burned their dwellings, and even resorted to murder.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>The latest victim here was a symbol of resistance, Awda al-Hathalin, who was shot by an Israeli settler.</p><p>Others have been injured, some even losing limbs, in other attacks.</p><p>It was this relentless danger that made the villagers decide to establish the Mountain Guardians Committee – a group of about 30 young men who spend the night on the hill overlooking the settlements and the village, taking turns to guard from sunset to sunrise.</p><p>The name comes from their elevated position overlooking the village and the settlements, where they observe nighttime movements and alert the villagers.</p><p>There’s a team of scout monitors, a team managing lights and alarms, a team that feeds everyone and makes hot drinks, and a support team, assisted by some elders who pass by with coffee or sunflower seeds for the watchers – the items as much symbols of solidarity and steadfastness as they are snacks.</p><h2 id=\"hamida-a-mother-s-fear-and-hope\">Hamida, a mother’s fear and hope</h2><p>Hamida Ali Hamamda is a 51-year-old mother of nine, ranging in age from 33-year-old Mufid to 20-year-old Bayan. She lives with her 53-year-old husband, Qassem Hamamda, in one of the village’s mud-brick houses.</p><p>“Life in al-Mufaqara was sweet and simple… We lived in safety, and the sheep grazed freely, until fear came,” Hamamda says, looking out of her window at the hills.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4175819\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4175819\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4175819\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/9H6B2022-1765803874.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Hamida Hamamda in her yard with her grandchilren.

This isn’t Palestinian land.’</p><p>“Life has lost its meaning… Everything has become hardship, with no comfort or security.”</p><p>Hamada dreams of an end to the danger posed by the settlements, and that her grandchildren can live in safety, going to school without fear.</p><p>Families in the village have resorted to simple protective measures for their homes, she says, like barbed wire on windows and dogs in the yard that bark at approaching danger.</p><p>But, she says: “If it weren’t for the guard committees, we wouldn’t sleep a wink… They are our first line of defence.”</p><h2 id=\"the-hand-that-feeds-the-guards\">The hand that feeds the guards</h2><p>Hamamda does her part to help guard the village – every night, she asks a village woman who prepares homemade sweets, cakes and other treats to send some up to the young guards in the hills.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“They guard us, and we send them sweets… At least we share something small to ease their burden.”</p><p>Hamamda’s granddaughter, 11-year-old Asala, Mufid’s daughter, has grown up with more fear than she knows play.</p><p>Pointing to a hole in the ground, she explains: “When the settlers attack the village, we run here … to the cave.”</p><p>She describes it as their underground haven, the place where she and her younger siblings hide away from windows and doors.</p><p>“In my nightmares, I see them attacking us… I wish I could live my childhood and go to school without fear.”</p><p>On the outskirts of al-Mufaqara, Qassem Hamamda stands contemplating the new settlements crowding the horizon around his village.</p><p>Before October 7, 2023, the settlements of Avigail and Havat Ma’on surrounded it.</p><p>Today, settler encroachment is painfully clear, with five new outposts, illegal even under Israeli law, set up around the village.</p><p>Qassem tells the same story his wife told.</p><p>“They came after seizing a cave near my house and threatened to force me out. I told them, ‘You want me to just leave? How?</p><p>This is my land, inherited from my father and grandfather… I won’t leave it. I’ll die here.’”</p><p>He adds that the protection committee has made things better.</p><p>“I feel a little safer.

Even the children here know that the land is life.”</p><p>Near the guard post, Jalal al-Amour, 47, crouches near the fire, stirring a large pot, the aroma of chicken livers he prepared wafting from it.</p><p>The spot where he is cooking was his home, he says, pointing at a nearby cave with a Star of David at its mouth and an Israeli flag flying above it.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>“I was born in this cave, I lived in it with my father and grandfather… until the settlers came, they forcibly evicted us, they destroyed everything.</p><p>“When we complained to the police, they said: ‘It’s a closed military zone.’”</p><p>Al-Amour cooks for the guards every night. “Every day we choose a different dish, trying to keep the place warm… Fire and smoke are all that remain of the scent of home.”</p><p>As dawn approaches, the lights fade over the hills.</p><p>Tired faces smile as they see the first rays of morning.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>The murder of at least 15 people at a Jewish <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/news/2025/12/14/australia-police-responding-after-gunshots-reported-at-sydneys-bondi-beach\">Hanukkah celebration</a> at Sydney’s Bondi Beach by two gunmen on Sunday was a rare occurrence in a country that is known for its strict gun laws.</p><p>The incident, which police describe as a “terrorist” attack, was the worst mass shooting in the country since 1996, when gunman Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people and injured nearly two dozen others at Port Arthur, a tourist site in the southern island state of Tasmania. Bryant received 35 life sentences, but his motive for the shooting, which prompted a raft of new anti-gun legislation, was never made clear.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at what took place, despite Australia’s strict gun laws.</p><h2 id=\"who-were-the-shooters\">Who were the shooters?</h2><p>During a news conference on Monday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said the suspects were a 50-year-old man, who was shot dead by police at the scene, and his 24-year-old son, who was also shot but remains in hospital in critical, but stable, condition.</p><p>Lanyon said the father “is a licensed firearms holder who had six firearms licensed to him”, emphasising that he “met the eligibility criteria for a firearms licence”.</p><p>The police confirmed that the 50-year-old suspect lived in a Sydney suburb and held a New South Wales firearms licence.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2><span>How strict are Australia’s gun laws?</span></h2><p>Two weeks after the shooting at Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, the government led by Prime Minister John Howard of the conservative Liberal-National coalition launched<span> the </span><a href=\"https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1399510/17-257.pdf\">National Firearms Agreement</a> (NFA)<span>, which significantly tightened Australia’s gun laws.</span></p><p><span>The new legislation was effectively an agreement drawn up between the Australian government and Australia’s various states and territories, which adopted the new legislation by passing their own corresponding laws. While specific laws do vary from state to state, they are all guided by the NFA and National Handgun Control Agreement measures.</span></p><p><span>The legislation banned ownership of most automatic and semiautomatic rifles, required gun owners to register their firearms with the police and apply for licences to own them, and initiated a buyback programme that removed some 650,000 assault weapons from public circulation.</span></p><p>It now takes at least 28 days for a gun licence application to be processed.</p><p>Under the law, gun owners are required to provide proof of a valid reason for owning a gun. This could be membership in a recreational hunting club, or being employed as a security guard, for example. Gun owners may own multiple firearms as long as they have specific reasons for requiring them.</p><p>Owning a gun for the purpose of self-defence is not considered a valid reason and is expressly prohibited in Australia.</p><p>Before a gun owner can become fully licensed to own or use a gun, he or she must complete a multi-day safety course, pass a written test, and complete a practical assessment to demonstrate they can safely use and maintain a gun.</p><p>After that, Australia’s National Firearms Register conducts background checks to determine whether the applicant has any criminal record or any court-ordered mental health orders.</p><p>Those who have committed serious crimes linked to sexual assault, violence, drugs, robbery, “terrorism”, organised crime, illegal weapons, or fraud are barred from holding gun licences.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-common-are-shootings-in-australia\">How common are shootings in Australia?</h2><p>Mass shootings are very rare in Australia, which is considered a generally safe country.</p><p>On the Global Peace Index, which is produced by the Australia-based Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the country ranks 18th among 163 countries.</p><p>In the years immediately following the 1996 passage of the National Firearms Agreement, Australia experienced a handful of shooting incidents, each resulting in no more than three fatalities.</p><p>In October 2002, an international student believed to be suffering from paranoid delusions shot and killed two other students on campus at Monash University in Melbourne, Victoria. He injured five others, including a lecturer. After this, handgun laws became even stricter.</p><p>In recent years, however, there has been a rise in the number of guns being sold. It is unclear why this is, but some reports link it to increasing demand for hunting sports.</p><p>But the mass shooting at Bondi Beach comes just two months after a 60-year-old man in the Sydney suburb of Croydon Park shot <a href=\"/news/2025/10/6/australian-police-search-for-motive-in-rare-mass-shooting-in-sydney\">up to 50 bullets</a> from his window at cars in a busy street, wounding one person critically, according to police. Fourteen others were treated at the scene for shock or minor injuries, including from glass from shattered car windows, emergency services said.</p><p>The suspect in that case was arrested after police stormed his apartment. However, police said he has no links to organised crime or “terror” organisations and no history of mental ill health. They have not established a clear motive for the shooting.</p><h2 id=\"how-have-the-australian-authorities-responded-to-the-bondi-beach-shooting\">How have the Australian authorities responded to the Bondi Beach shooting?</h2><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday that he will discuss introducing even stronger gun control laws with the National Cabinet.</p><p>Albanese told a news conference that the Australian government “is prepared to take whatever action is necessary” and “included in that is the need for tougher gun laws”.</p><p>He added that this could mean restrictions on the number of firearms each person is allowed to own or be licensed to use, along with more regular reviews of their licences. The authorities in Australia do carry out firearms licence checks currently, but in most states and territories, these are relatively infrequent unless triggered by a specific incident or raised concern.</p><p>“Licences should not be in perpetuity, and checks, of course, making sure that those checks and balances are in place as well,” Albanese said.</p><p>New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference on Monday: “It does require legislation. It means introducing a bill to Parliament, making it more difficult to get these horrifying weapons that have no practical use in our community.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-did-the-bondi-shooting-happen-despite-australia-s-strict-gun-laws\">How did the Bondi shooting happen despite Australia’s strict gun laws?</h2><p>“It is very reasonable to ask how another massacre has happened in Australia, given we have extremely strict gun laws,” Samara McPhedran, a principal research fellow at Griffith University in South East Queensland, Australia, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>McPhedran, whose research expertise includes gun violence, said that it is too early to know whether there were any failures in the licensing process.</p><p>“This is certainly something that police will look at as part of their investigation, and it is important to gather all the facts before rushing to conclusions. It is crucial that we know the exact circumstances that led up to this event, if we are to identify things that may have gone wrong and ways to fix those.”</p><p>McPhedran said obtaining a gun licence in any state or territory in Australia is not a quick and simple process, and “obtaining a gun licence is subject to an extensive range of controls”.</p><p>She added: “Questions are being asked about the number of firearms – six – that were legally registered to one of the shooters. This number is nothing unusual. Most licence holders own multiple different types of firearms, for different purposes, for example, hunting different types of animals or shooting in different types of competitions.”</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-solution\">What is the solution?</h2><p>“Although it may seem counterintuitive, the number of firearms, what type they were, and whether the perpetrators were licensed, are not the real issue,” McPhedran said.</p><p>In the history of mass shootings in Australia both prior to and after the 1996 Port Arthur shooting, she said, some perpetrators held licences, and some did not. Some perpetrators used semiautomatic firearms; some did not. Most used one or two firearms.</p><p>“However, from 1996 onwards, our reaction to firearm violence has always been the same: swift political announcements of bans, buybacks, more laws. We have done this time and time and time again, and it is very clear that this approach does not work to prevent violence,” McPhedran said.</p><p>She added, “We can keep doing more of the same and hope for a different result. Or we can try a different approach.”</p><p>McPhedran said that for years, politicians have “fostered division and hostility between Australians” based on religious, racial, ethnic, cultural and other identity divisions to win votes, causing lasting harm to communities through increased intolerance and prejudice.</p><p>In recent years, successive governments in Australia have clamped down hard on immigration, with many migrants from some countries held for months on end in offshore detention centres on islands such as Nauru and Manus. This has sparked concerns from human rights activists.</p><p>In January 2025, the United Nations Human Rights Committee said the Australian government had violated a human rights treaty by <a href=\"/news/2023/6/25/last-refugee-held-on-nauru-arrives-in-australia\">detaining a group of asylum seekers, many of them minors</a> on Nauru, despite them being granted refugee status.</p><p>“If we are serious about preventing future violence – whether with a firearm or any other method – we must change how we engage in public debate, stop the short-term political gameplaying, and heal the divisions in our community,” McPhedran said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>On December 3, Israel announced that the Rafah border crossing with Egypt would reopen “in the coming days”, allowing Palestinians to leave Gaza for the first time in months. The statement was, of course, framed as a humanitarian gesture that would allow those in urgent need to travel for medical care, education or family reunification to leave.</p><p>However, Israel’s announcement was met almost immediately with Egypt’s denial, followed by a firm rejection from several Arab and Muslim states.</p><p>To the rest of the world, this response may seem cruel. It may seem like Arab states want to forcibly keep in Gaza Palestinians desperate to evacuate to safety. This fits right into the Israeli narrative that neighbouring Arab countries are responsible for Palestinian suffering because they would not “let them in”.</p><p>This is a falsehood that has unfortunately made its way into <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/02/26/1232826942/rafah-gaza-palestinians-egypt-border\">Western media</a>, even though it is easily disproved.</p><p>Let us be clear: No, Arab states are not keeping us against our will in Gaza, and neither is Hamas.</p><p>They want to make sure that when and if some of us evacuate temporarily, we are able to come back. We want the same – a guarantee of return. Yet, Israel refuses to grant it; it made clear in its December 3 announcement that the Rafah crossing would be open only one way – for Palestinians to leave.</p><p>So this was clearly a move meant to jump-start forced displacement of the Palestinian population from their homeland.</p><p>For Palestinians, this is not a new reality but part of a long and deliberate pattern. Since its inception, the Israeli state has focused on the dispossession, erasure, and forced displacement of the Palestinians. In 1948, 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes and were not allowed to return. My 88-year-old grandfather was among them. He still keeps the Tabu (land registry document) for the dunams of land he owns in his village of Barqa, 37km (23 miles) north of Gaza, where we are still not allowed to return.</p><p>In 1967, when Israel occupied Gaza, it forbade Palestinians who were studying or working abroad from returning to their homes. In the occupied West Bank, where colonisation has not stopped for the past 58 years, Palestinians are regularly expelled from their homes and lands.</p><p>In the past two years alone, Israel has seized approximately <a href=\"https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/162049?utm_source\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">55,000 dunams</a> of Palestinian land, displacing more than 2,800 Palestinians. In Jerusalem, Palestinians whose families had lived in the holy city for centuries risk losing their residency there if they cannot prove it is their “centre of life”. In the past 25 years, more than 10,000 Palestinian residencies have been revoked.</p><p>Since October 2023, Israel has repeatedly attempted to engineer forced mass displacement in Gaza – dividing the Strip into isolated zones separated by military corridors and “safe” axes and launching successive operations to push residents of the north towards the south. Each wave of mass bombing carried the same underlying objective: to uproot the people of Gaza from their homes and push them towards the border with Egypt. The most recent push occurred just before the latest ceasefire took effect.</p><p>According to Diaa Rashwan, chairman of the Egyptian State Information Service, Cairo rejected Israel’s proposal because it was an attempt to shun its commitments outlined in the second phase of the ceasefire. That phase requires Israel to withdraw from Gaza, support the reconstruction process, allow the Strip to be administered by a Palestinian committee, and facilitate the deployment of a security force to stabilise the situation. By announcing Rafah’s reopening, Israel sought to bypass these obligations and redirect the political conversation towards depopulation rather than reconstruction and recovery.</p><p>That Israel wants to create the conditions to make our expulsion inevitable is clear from other policies as well. It continues to bombard the Strip, killing hundreds of civilians and terrorising hundreds of thousands.</p><p>It continues to prevent adequate amounts of food and medicines from getting in. It is allowing no reconstruction materials or temporary housing. It is doing everything to maximise the suffering of the Palestinian people.</p><p>This reality is made even more brutal by the harsh winter. Cold winds tear through overcrowded camps filled with exhausted people who have endured every form of trauma imaginable. Yet despite hunger, exhaustion, and despair, we continue to cling to our land and reject any Israeli efforts to displace and erase us.</p><p>We also reject any form of external guardianship or control over our fate. We demand full Palestinian sovereignty over our land, our resources, and our crossings. Our position is clear: the Rafah crossing must be opened in both directions; not as a tool of displacement, but as a right to free movement.</p><p>Rafah must be accessible for those who wish to return, and for those who need to leave temporarily: students seeking to continue their education abroad, patients in urgent need of medical treatment unavailable in Gaza, and families who have been separated and long to be reunited. Thousands of critically ill Palestinians have been denied life-saving care due to the siege, while hundreds of students holding offers and scholarships from prestigious universities around the world have been unable to travel to pursue their education.</p><p>Rafah should also be open to those who simply need rest after years of trauma – to step outside Gaza briefly and return with dignity. Mobility is not a privilege; it is a basic human right.</p><p>What we demand is simple: the right to determine our future, without coercion, without bargaining over our existence, and without being pushed into forced displacement disguised as a humanitarian project.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

The police or security guards were on the way, he wrote, as he begged for a taxi.</p><p>The boy had shot his target, but the man had survived.</p><p>Only 48 hours had passed between the boy being added to the Signal chat and the shooting.</p><p>Police arrested him shortly after, but due to his age, he was not convicted or sentenced.</p><p>He was placed in state care and remains under social services supervision.</p><p>When the recruitment process began remains unclear, but investigators believed it likely started when he responded to an ad - possibly a so-called murder contract - circulating on social media platforms such as Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram, or on encrypted apps like Telegram, where children are now usually recruited.</p><p>In late 2024, Telegram shut down a channel called Samurai Barnen (Samurai Children), which had amassed about 11,000 members, after Swedish police notified the platform.</p><p>Screenshots later published by local media outlets from the channel show how the “murder contracts” appeared.</p><p><em>Murder:</em></p><p><em>Malmo urgent: 800k-1m ($85,000-107,000)</em></p><p><em>Gothenburg urgent: 300-400k ($32,000-43,000)</em></p><p><em>Stockholm urgent: 500k ($53,000)</em></p><p><em>Denmark: 1 million ($107,000)</em></p><p><em>Throw a grenade:</em></p><p><em>Malmo: 30-50k ($3,100-5-300k)</em></p><p>The attacks are often framed as “challenges” or “missions”, which the police say is a “gamification technique\" to make the posts more engaging and less intimidating for children.</p><p>The timeframe from a child’s initial contact with a recruiter to carrying out a violent act can range from a matter of days to a month, Salman Khan, a project manager of an exit programme for children in gangs at Fryshuset, Sweden's largest youth organisation, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Ten years ago, recruiters would have to go to a place where kids are physically, but now social media is the way,” said Khan, who works with a programme called 180 Degrees, which connects children who have been involved in crime with positive adult role models who can help them leave that world behind.</p><p>Khan describes the recruitment process as a form of grooming where boys, and to a lesser extent girls, as young as 12, who he says don’t necessarily know the difference between “play” and the “real life” consequences of carrying out a violent act, are lured into a criminal underworld.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4175366\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4175366\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-4175366 size-arc-image-770\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-11-17-130738-1765794304.png?w=566&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Sweden child gangs\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4175366\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A transcript of a recruitment conversation published by the Swedish Police Authority.

Looking for a job in Stockholm, just no murder [screenshot from polisen.se]</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>In his conversations with children in SiS facilities, Khan has observed how the role many aspire to in gangs has been inverted in recent years.</p><p>“It has become a status thing to be the one to throw a grenade or to shoot someone rather than be a gang leader. Ten years ago, everyone wanted to be Tony Montana [the fictional crime boss in the film Scarface],” he explained.</p><p>The shift reflects how social media and the glamourisation of violence in popular culture have made instant notoriety more desirable than lasting authority, Khan added.</p><p>Carrying out an attack can give the child a sense of validation in the gang and access to fast money that can get them the \"clothes, chains, phones, cars and luxury life\" they see on social media and in television series.</p><p>He used the example of the popular Netflix series Snabba Cash (Fast Cash), which portrays Sweden’s criminal underworld as a spectacle of guns, money and fast cars and features teenage characters who act as runners for gangs.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Schlanger was British-born but had lived in Sydney for the past 18 years, and had recently become a father for the fifth time.</p><p>His friend Alex Ryvchin, who is also co-CEO of the executive council of Australian Jewry, said that Schlanger spent time with prisoners in jails and the elderly at the public housing societies. “He would listen to their stories, feed them and make sure they had meals and kosher products. He was the sort of person who illuminated our lives with kindness, his grace and generosity,” Ryvchin said.</p><p>Schlanger’s brother-in-law, Rabbi Mendel Kastel, said the family was “broken”. “They have fallen apart,” Kastel told the Reuters news agency.</p><h3>Peter Meagher</h3><p>A retired policeman and longtime rugby volunteer, Meagher was struck down while working as a freelance photographer at the event, Randwick Rugby Club said in a statement.</p><p>“‘Marzo’ as he was universally known, was a much loved figure and absolute legend in our club, with decades of voluntary involvement, he was one of the heart and soul figures of Randwick Rugby,” the club said.</p><p>“The tragic irony is that he spent so long in the dangerous front line as a Police Officer and was struck down in retirement while taking photos in his passion role is really hard to comprehend,” it said.</p><p>“For him it was simply a catastrophic case of being in the wrong place and at the wrong time.”</p><h3>Dan Elkayam</h3><p>French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that a French national, Dan Elkayam, was killed in the attack.</p><p>Elkayam, who local media reported was in his late 20s and had gone down to celebrate at the festival, had been providing technical support to global media company NBC Universal in Sydney since last December, according to his LinkedIn page.</p><p>He played with the Rockdale Ilinden Football Club premier league squad, where he was “an extremely talented and popular figure”, the club said on social media.</p><h3>Matilda</h3><p>A primary school student, 10-year-old Matilda, died on Sunday night, her aunt confirmed on social media.</p><p>In a statement posted on Facebook, the Harmony Russian School of Sydney said Matilda was a former student. “We honor her life and the time she spent as part of our school family,” the post said.</p><p>In local media reports, she has been described as a “bright, joyful, and spirited child who brought light to those around her”.</p><h3>Reuven Morrison</h3><p>A Chabad report described Morrison, another victim, as “a member of the Chabad community who divided his time between Melbourne and Sydney”.</p><h3>Alex Kleytman</h3><p>The 87-year-old Holocaust survivor attended Sunday’s event with his wife, Larisa, also a Holocaust survivor, their children and grandchildren, Chabad and local media reported.</p><p>The couple had recounted their experiences to aged-care provider JewishCare, which referred to Alex’s harrowing memories of the “dreadful conditions in Siberia, where he, along with his mother and younger brother, struggled for survival”.</p><p>The “scars of the past” did not deter them from seeking a brighter future in Australia, as they emigrated from Ukraine, JewishCare wrote in its 2022-23 annual report.</p><h3>Rabbi Yaakov Levitan</h3><p>Levitan served as secretary of the Sydney Jewish religious organisation Beth Din, Chabad said.</p><h3>Tibor Weitzen</h3><p>Weitzen has been identified as one of the victims after he was fatally wounded while shielding his wife from the gunfire, who survived the attack, the Daily Mail reported.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-do-we-know-about-the-bondi-beach-attack-suspects\">What do we know about the Bondi Beach attack suspects?</h2><p>During a news conference on Monday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said the suspects were a 50-year-old and his 24-year-old son.</p><p>“What’s really important is to say we do have a 24-year-old male in hospital at the moment,” Lanyon said.</p><p>“Based on his medical condition, it is likely that that person may face criminal charges. I’m very mindful of not prejudicing any prosecution of that person, if they’re put before the court.”</p><p>Lanyon added that the father, who was killed by police at the scene, “is a licensed firearms holder who had six firearms licensed to him”, emphasising that he “met the eligibility criteria for a firearms licence”.</p><p>He said authorities were not looking for any other suspect.</p><p>Some Australian news outlets, including the public broadcaster ABC, identified the suspects as Sajid Akram, 50, and Naveed Akram, 24. However, the authorities have not confirmed their identities.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The ICTY’s Foca case established rape and sexual enslavement as crimes against humanity.</p><p><strong>Siege of Sarajevo:</strong> The capital, a multiethnic city, was surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces who shelled residential areas and used snipers to target civilians on the streets, in markets and at water queues. The siege lasted from April 1992 to February 1996 and killed an estimated 11,000 people, including more than 1,000 children.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4175074\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4175074\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4175074\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/INTERACTIVE-bosnia-timeline-1765785381.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE-bosnia-timeline-1765785381\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4175074\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h3>1993 – ‘Safe areas’ established but massacres continue</h3><p data-start=\"1551\" data-end=\"1728\">With peace efforts failing, the UN declared Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia a “safe area” in April 1993, followed by Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde and Bihac a month later. But atrocities continued.</p><p><strong>Ahmici massacre:</strong> In April 1993, Croat forces killed more than 100 Bosniak civilians in the village of Ahmici, central Bosnia, and burned homes and mosques. ICTY judgements called it one of the worst acts of ethnic cleansing in the area.</p><p><strong>Rape camps:</strong> The ICTY and rights groups also documented that rape was used as an instrument of terror, particularly in Foca – now located in Republika Srpska in the southeast of the country – where women and girls were held in “rape camps”.</p><h3>1994-1995 – Market attacks and pressure for intervention</h3><p data-start=\"2196\" data-end=\"2543\">Sarajevo remained under siege. In February 1994, a mortar attack on the Markale market killed 68 civilians and wounded many more. A second strike at the same market in August 1995 killed 43 people. ICTY judgements and UN investigators have blamed Bosnian Serb forces for these attacks.</p><p>These and other attacks on so-called “safe areas” raised pressure on NATO and Western governments to act, setting the stage for heavier air attacks against the Bosnian Serb leadership later in 1995.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>Sniper ‘safaris’ during the siege of Sarajevo</h3><p>During the siege of Sarajevo, citizens were subjected to “sniper safaris” – so named as a grotesque reference to hunting expeditions – in which foreigners paid Bosnian Serb units to join them and shoot civilians from positions overlooking the city.</p><p>Following a recent <a href=\"/news/2025/11/13/italy-probes-sarajevo-sniper-safaris-what-were-they-who-was-involved\">Italian investigation</a>, prosecutors in Milan are examining whether wealthy visitors from Italy and other countries travelled to Sarajevo on organised “tours” to shoot at civilians for sport.</p><p>No one has yet been convicted for organising or taking part in these “safaris”, but the allegations highlight the extreme dehumanisation that accompanied the siege of the city.</p><p>It is believed that citizens from multiple countries took part. In 2022, Bosnian film director Miran Zupanic’s documentary, Sarajevo Safari, investigated wealthy foreigners who had participated, including some from the United States and Russia.</p><p>Moreover, in 2007, former US Marine John Jordan testified to the ICTY that “tourist shooters” had come to Sarajevo.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-did-the-1995-srebrenica-genocide-happen\">How did the 1995 Srebrenica genocide happen?</h2><p>By 1995, Srebrenica, a town in eastern Bosnia, had become a refuge for tens of thousands of Bosniaks fleeing surrounding villages, which had been raided and ransacked by Bosnian Serb forces hunting them. The enclave was overcrowded and had become dependent on irregular UN aid convoys, and Bosnian Serb forces controlled the surrounding areas.</p><p>Although the UN had declared Srebrenica a protected zone and stationed a small Dutch peacekeeping unit there, the enclave was under siege. In March 1995, Bosnian Serb leader <a href=\"/news/2021/5/12/bosnian-serb-ex-leader-karadzic-to-spend-life-in-uk-prison\">Radovan Karadzic</a> issued a directive ordering that Srebrenica be completely cut off.</p><p>In early July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces advanced on the enclave. On July 9, Karadzic’s forces were ordered to seize Srebrenica and, on July 11, <a href=\"/news/2017/11/22/ratko-mladic-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-genocide\">Ratko Mladic</a>, a Bosnian Serb military leader known as the “Butcher of Bosnia”, entered the town.</p><p>Over the following days, Bosnian Serb units separated men and boys from women and younger children. More than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were executed at sites in and around Srebrenica and their bodies dumped in mass graves, while about 20,000 women, children and elderly people were forcibly expelled.</p><p>The ICTY and the International Court of Justice later ruled that these killings constituted genocide.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"how-and-when-did-the-bosnian-war-end\">How and when did the Bosnian war end?</h2><p>Western governments had been reluctant to intervene decisively earlier in the war, but the genocide at Srebrenica forced a shift in approach. In August and September 1995, NATO launched a sustained air campaign against Bosnian Serb forces – a turning point that paved the way for the Dayton Peace Agreement, which formally ended the war.</p><p>US-brokered talks brought the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and the then-Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to an airbase near Dayton, Ohio, in the US.</p><p>On November 21, 1995, they agreed to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, better known as the Dayton Peace Agreement, which preserved Bosnia as a single state divided into two main entities – the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska entity.</p><p>The agreement was formally signed in Paris on December 14.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"what-were-the-dayton-accords\">What were the Dayton Accords?</h2><p data-start=\"12225\" data-end=\"12716\">The Dayton Peace Agreement was meant to do more than just end active fighting, and it reshaped the post-war political system.</p><p>Bosnia today has a highly decentralised structure of government, with two political entities as well as the third, self-governing Brcko District, shared between the other two, and layers of state-level institutions.</p><p>An entire section of the Dayton Agreement is devoted to refugees and those displaced during the war. It explicitly states that “all refugees and displaced persons have the right freely to return to their homes of origin” and to have property restored or be compensated if that is not possible.</p><p>But many experts describe the agreement as flawed in practice, as implementation has been partial at best. While many people did return to their homes and hundreds of thousands of property claims were processed, significant numbers of Bosniaks were never able to return to their pre-war homes.</p><p>There were many reasons for this, including the presence of minefields, the fact that their housing had been destroyed, fear, economic hardship, and lingering, deep-rooted ethnic tensions.</p><p data-start=\"515\" data-end=\"835\">Today, entire communities, particularly survivors of the Srebrenica genocide, remain in exile or have simply had to resettle elsewhere in countries such as the US and Australia.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"has-anyone-been-held-to-account-for-the-atrocities-committed-during-the-war\">Has anyone been held to account for the atrocities committed during the war?</h2><p data-start=\"10551\" data-end=\"10888\">In 1993, the UN created the ICTY to prosecute serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the Balkans. The tribunal lasted 24 years, from 1993 to 2017.</p><p>Over more than two decades, witnesses and survivors gave evidence about the atrocities and 161 individuals were indicted. Ninety of those were sentenced, 19 were acquitted, 20 had their indictments withdrawn, 17 died before conviction, 13 were referred to other courts, and two were retried.</p><p>Four types of crime were recorded at the tribunal – genocide, crimes against humanity, violations of laws/customs of war and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.</p><p>Among the people tried by the tribunal were:</p><p><strong>Radovan Karadzic</strong> – the wartime leader of the Bosnian Serbs. In 2016, he received a life sentence for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, including his role in Srebrenica and the siege of Sarajevo. In 2021, he was transferred to the high-security prison, HMP Parkhurst, on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, UK.</p><p><strong>Ratko Mladic</strong> – the Bosnian Serb military commander. In 2017, he was also sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide and other crimes. He is being held in the UN Detention Unit in The Hague, Netherlands.</p><p><strong>Bosnian Croat leaders</strong> – several were convicted for crimes against Bosniaks during the Croat-Bosniak conflict.</p><p data-start=\"11951\" data-end=\"12144\">Dozens of officials have also received long prison sentences for crimes linked to the Srebrenica genocide, though many survivors say justice remains far from being done.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
