So, when Pakistan’s government <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/sports/2026/2/1/pakistan-to-boycott-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-on-february-15\">ordered</a> its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.</p><p>It also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.</p><p>A week of negotiations led to a dramatic <a href=\"https://aje.aj-harbinger.com/sports/2026/2/9/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-on-feb-15\">late U-turn</a> by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.</p><p>But what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.</p><p>With the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"massive-impact-on-tourism\">‘Massive impact’ on tourism</h2><p>For a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the <a href=\"/news/2022/4/13/timeline-of-sri-lankas-worst-economic-crisis-since-independence\">economic crisis of 2022</a>, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.</p><p>The tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.</p><p>Hotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.</p><p>“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.</p><p>“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”</p><p>It’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.</p><p>These short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.</p><p>Another relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.</p><p>Asanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.</p><p>“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.</p><p>“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"a-geopolitical-win\">A geopolitical win</h2><p>The lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.</p><p>So while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.</p><p>Pakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.</p><p>The reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.</p><p>Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.</p><p>Sri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.</p><p>Sri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.</p><p>When Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.</p><p>“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.</p><p>“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.</p><p>“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”</p><p>A little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.</p><p>As of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.</p><p>Come Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4288497\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4288497\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4288497\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-STADIUMS-T20-MENS-CRICKET-WORLD-CUP-2026-FEB3-2026-1770220847.png?quality=80\" alt=\"INTERACTIVE -STADIUMS- T20 MEN'S CRICKET WORLD CUP - 2026 - FEB3, 2026-1770220847\" data-interactive=\"true\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4288497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure></div></div></body></html>"

This is the type of drone used by groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Yemeni Houthis. Suddenly, a blinding whiteness overtakes the image. Seconds later, the wing of the drone snaps off, sending it tumbling down, exploding when it hits the ground.</p><p>This is a video shared by the Israeli Ministry of Defence and arms producer Rafael, a hint towards the future of anti-drone warfare. In it, they are demonstrating one of their new weapons: a high-energy laser designed to take down aerial threats such as drones, but also rockets and even artillery shells. It’s called Iron Beam. Israel claims they have shot down several enemy drones with it already.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>Laser weapons have been a dream for arms manufacturers and militaries since the invention of the laser in 1960. So far, they have remained a dream. But now they seem to be on the brink of a breakthrough. Technological advances have made lasers more robust. At the same time, the rise of drones increases the need for weapons that can shoot them down cheaply and efficiently.</p><p>“Lasers are the next step in air defence systems,” says Iain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he works on high-energy lasers in defence projects.</p><p>“When you are attacked by thousands of inexpensive drones, you cannot afford to defend yourself with expensive anti-air weapons, such as missiles. Lasers might be a solution.”</p><p>This promise is causing a gold rush among defence companies. Independent analyses on the market’s size are lacking, but a flurry of contracts and announcements have recently been made.</p><p>The Israeli Iron Beam contract is worth $500m for Rafael and Elbit Systems, another Israeli defence company. The US Navy has contracted Lockheed Martin to supply its ships with defensive high-energy lasers. UK defence firm MBDA was awarded a 316-million-pound ($430m) defence contract at the end of 2025 to deliver their DragonFire laser weapon system by 2027. MBDA is also cooperating with German defence giant Rheinmetall to develop a German system by 2029. France, in turn, took a similar approach, teaming up again with MBDA and a flurry of its own defence players to develop a laser system.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"star-wars\">Star Wars</h2><p>One of the companies benefitting from this gold rush is the Australian Electro-Optical Systems (EOS), led by the German CEO Andreas Schwer. In 2025, they secured a 71-million-euro ($84m) contract with the Netherlands for the development of a laser weapon. In December, another contract, worth $80m, was announced with South Korea.</p><p>Their laser technology is a descendant of the United States’s Strategic Defense Initiative programme, colloquially known as Star Wars. In the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan created the programme to use lasers, fired from space, to shoot down Soviet ballistic missiles.</p><p>That grand vision failed. Billions were invested, but in the 1990s, most of the programmes ended. EOS was one of the participants. They used Star Wars’ insights to build lasers that track satellites. But now they are using them for a different goal: shooting down drones.</p><p>“Our high-energy laser is a derivative of our Star Wars technology,” says Schwer. “Initially, we developed lasers to track satellites. But when the Houthi rebels used drones to attack Saudi Arabia in 2018, we realised this technology was needed elsewhere.”</p><p>Today, they employ 500 people; by the end of next year, that should be 700. If EOS does any large acquisitions, that number might even be even higher, claims Schwer.</p><p>For their laser weapons, EOS is aiming to cooperate with local defence companies as a growth strategy. In Europe, for example, they are working together with players such as Helsing, OHB, MSI and KNDS. That way, they can grow without having to invest large amounts of capital. “We team up with local champions,” says Schwer.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"dependency-and-sovereignty\">Dependency and sovereignty</h2><p>Particularly in Europe, the market for high-energy lasers is growing. The importance of drone warfare in Ukraine, but also recent cases of drone flights over critical infrastructure in Europe, and Russian drone incursions on the Eastern border of the EU, have caused a surge in demand for anything that can repel mass drone attacks.</p><p>“High-energy laser weapons have, supposedly, been just around the corner for a long time now. However, in the last few years we have seen the technology mature and systems actually being deployed,” says James Black, deputy director of the defence and security research group at RAND Europe.</p><p>The market is still fragmented, however, with many countries launching their own research projects. “You have different countries investing in sovereign R&amp;D projects, testing and low-scale field tests,” says Black. “We don’t yet have a mass market rollout. We haven’t seen industrial consolidation yet.”</p><p>One of the reasons why lasers are so attractive is that they are not dependent on existing supply chains for air-defence weapons. “Countries want sovereign air defence solutions,” says Black. “They want to reduce their dependency on foreign suppliers. For different weapons, such as Patriot missiles, you’re, for example, dependent on the US.”</p><p>For many advanced anti-air weapons, the US is currently the dominant player. The companies that will dominate the market for laser weapons might come from a different part of the world, though. “For the US military, the main priority is deterring and defeating China,” says Black. “That affects which weapons US companies develop. China is more advanced than Russia or Iran. Also, the Indo-Pacific is a very large area, with mostly sea. Massed attacks by small drones are much less of a threat there than in Europe.”</p><h2 id=\"drone-swarms\">Drone swarms</h2><p>Lasers are becoming viable now, on the one hand, because the technology has simply matured. “Twenty years ago, we were using chemical lasers for these projects,” says Boyd. “They were the only ones that had enough power.”</p><p>A laser always has a medium through which the light passes and which amplifies it. Up until recently, for military lasers, the medium of choice was a cocktail of chemicals. These lasers generate a very powerful beam, but they also have downsides, including the volatile chemicals themselves.</p><p>In the past few years, however, solid-state lasers have become more powerful. In such lasers, the medium is a solid material, such as optical fibre. These lasers are more robust and easier to handle. “Solid-state lasers are used for all kinds of industrial processes,” says Boyd. “Civilian industries advanced them significantly. That accelerated their use in military applications.”</p><p>Technical issues still need to be resolved, however. One of those is collateral damage. A laser beam that misses its target just keeps going straight and could, for example, miss a drone and hit an airliner or satellite.</p><p>“Laser beams can also scatter off surfaces and blind people,” says Boyd. “That’s why good targeting systems are so important.”</p><p>This became clear this week when the airspace around El Paso, in the US, was <a href=\"/news/2026/2/12/why-was-el-paso-airspace-shut-down-drones-security-fears-and-confusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">closed down</a> unexpectedly by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), leading to chaos at the local airport. The shutdown seems to have been related to a non-scheduled test of an anti-drone laser weapon by the US Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>“The El Paso incident strongly illustrates the need for careful use of laser weapons,” says Boyd. “In cluttered civil environments, it is particularly important to have an effective process in place for de-confliction of the region into which a laser is being fired.”</p><p>Lasers are also sensitive to the weather; rain or fog reduces their effectiveness significantly. They also generate a lot of heat, which makes them prone to overheating and could make them an easy target on a battlefield. That is why initially, lasers might be used to defend critical infrastructure away from front lines, or be installed on ships.</p><p>“We’re not going to be shooting handheld lasers at each other anytime soon,” says Black. “Lasers aren’t a silver bullet. They don’t solve all problems. But they are making concrete advances, and countries are actually putting them in the field. They will, however, need to be integrated in wider anti-air systems, where they will serve beside other weapons.”</p><p>In Australia, EOS is working on that. One of their priorities is making their lasers more powerful, and able to handle large swarms of drones. “We want to have more kills per minute,” says Schwer. “That’s why you need more power. Our next step is to have 50 kills per minute. Even with large swarms of drones, nothing will be able to get through.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he recently said. “What we need ⁠at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”</p><p>Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life over a 2004 grenade attack on ⁠a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many. He has always denied the allegations, calling ⁠them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.</p><p>From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappeared, and offices shuttered.</p><p>Since his return, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring “people’s ownership of the state” and rebuilding institutions – a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a ‌fresh start.</p><p>Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong.

Rahman is promising a top-down, no-tolerance approach to corruption, and a new era of clean politics in Bangladesh.”</p><p>As he prepared on Saturday to take the reigns of power in the country, Rahman said the new government he will lead faces daunting challenges.</p><p>“We have paved the way for the establishment of democracy in the country,” he added.</p><p>“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakening constitutional and structural institutions and destroying law and order.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

We have taken back Bangladesh.”</p><p>Hossain said the new government’s immediate priorities should be job creation and curbing inflation.</p><p>“Prices have been hurting us, and there are too many unemployed young people. The government must address this immediately,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, remained unusually quiet on Friday.</p><p>The calm was largely by design: the BNP chose not to hold victory processions.</p><p>The Jamaat head office in the capital’s Moghbazar also appeared subdued on Friday. A few supporters around the head office expressed disappointment.</p><p>“There has been engineering in the counting process, and the media has been biased against the Jamaat alliance,” said Abdus Salam, a supporter near the office. He argued that a fair process would have yielded more seats.</p><p>Others, like Germany-based Jamaat supporter Muaz Abdullah, said Jamaat’s defeat was a failure of organisation.</p><p>“In many constituencies, Jamaat didn’t run a good election campaign. They didn’t even have proper polling agents in several places,” he said.</p><p>Though the BNP and Jamaat were allies for years, they faced each other as rivals in this election. The campaign period saw <a href=\"/features/2026/1/27/fear-and-hope-in-bangladesh-how-political-violence-is-haunting-elections\">sporadic violence</a> and months of divisive online rhetoric.</p><p>Sujan Mia, a BNP activist outside the party office, struck a conciliatory tone. “We do not want enmity. We should focus on building the nation,” he said.</p><p>Rezaul Karim Rony, editor of Joban Magazine and a political analyst who closely followed the BNP’s campaign, said the party’s victory is likely to allay concerns of a lurch to the right in Bangladesh.</p><p>“Through this election, people have, in a sense, freed the country’s politics from that risk,” he argued.</p><p>However, Rony cautioned that the <a href=\"/news/2026/2/14/could-bnps-landslide-win-open-a-new-geopolitical-chapter-for-bangladesh\">real test begins now</a>.</p><p>“The challenge is to ensure good governance, law and order, and public safety – and to establish a rights-based state,” he said, describing those goals as being at the “heart of the aspirations of the 2024 mass uprising.”</p><p>Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, said a BNP victory represents “a blow to the politics of change that have galvanised Bangladesh since the 2024 mass uprising”.</p><p>“The BNP, dynastic and long saddled with corruption allegations, reflects the principles that the Gen Z protesters rejected,” he said.</p><p>The party will now face pressure from both the public and the opposition to push beyond old political habits, Kugelman added.</p><p>“If the new government falls back on repressive or retributive politics, reform advocates will be disappointed and democratisation efforts will be set back,” he said.</p><p>The outcome might be the least disruptive for the region as a whole.</p><p>Pakistan might have preferred a Jamaat win, given the party’s historical affinity for Islamabad. But Pakistan has also had strong relations with the BNP, Kugelman pointed out, as has China.</p><p>And “India much prefers the BNP to Jamaat,” he added, noting that the BNP is no longer in alliance with Jamaat, which New Delhi believes takes positions contrary to its interests.</p><p>Back at the BNP’s office in Dhaka, however, geopolitics felt distant.</p><p>Shamsud Doha, a party leader, had brought his two grandchildren to share the moment.</p><p>“Nothing matches this feeling,” he said. “We have long suffered under autocratic rule. Now it is our time to build the nation.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

Go has yet to comment on the latest development.</p><p>It was not immediately clear if any of the men named in the prosecution document would face charges in court.</p><p>In a statement posted on Facebook, Kristina Conti, lawyer of several of the deceased victims’ families, noted that it’s the first time “significant details” were disclosed by the ICC to the public.</p><p>She said the inclusion of several high-ranking officials under Duterte showed that the deadly drug war under his presidency “was crafted not only to ensure implementation, but to ensure impunity”.</p><p>“The involvement of those in the investigating units, which should have acted as the killings happen, is material to the plan. This also emphasizes that the ‘war on drugs’ began in Davao,” Conti said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Duterte is facing a four-day “confirmation of charges” hearing from <a href=\"/news/2026/1/26/icc-judges-find-former-philippine-president-duterte-fit-to-stand-trial\">February 23</a>, in which judges will decide whether the prosecution’s allegations are strong enough to proceed to trial.</p><p>Judges have rejected arguments that the 80-year-old, who was arrested in March last year and transferred to the Netherlands the same day, was unfit to stand trial.</p><p>Go and Dela Rosa have been named as co-perpetrators in acts that took place during Duterte’s tenures as Davao mayor and president.</p><p>Former Philippine justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, who served as a lawyer for Duterte in cases involving the so-called “Davao Death Squad”, is also among the eight men named.</p><p>Ross Tugade, an ICC-accredited lawyer from the Philippines, said in a post on Facebook that the inclusion of the names of former Duterte officials indicates “that the ICC has evidence” to show a “criminal structure” in the commission of the alleged crimes.</p><p>The first of three counts against Duterte concerns his alleged involvement as a co-perpetrator in 19 murders carried out between 2013 and 2016 while he was mayor of Davao City.</p><p>The second relates to 14 murders of so-called “High Value Targets” in 2016 and 2017 when Duterte was president.</p><p>The third charge covers 43 murders committed during “clearance” operations of lower-level alleged drug users or pushers.</p><p>These took place across the Philippines between 2016 and 2018, the prosecution alleged.</p><p>The ICC also on Friday allowed the addition of 500 more complainants against Duterte in the trial.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312717\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312717\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312717\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20170503__O26SY__v1__MidRes__PhilippinesChinaUsMaritimeDiplomacy-1771054052.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"This handout photo taken and released by the Presidential Photographers Division (PPD) on May 3, 2017 shows President Rodrigo Duterte (R, wearing earphones) talking on the phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping while presidential special assistant Bong Go listens in Davao City, southern island of Mindanao.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>This Valentine’s Day, chocolate prices are no longer at <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cocoa--coffee-and-tea-push-up-global-food-import-bill-for-wealthier-countries/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last year’s peak</a>, but cheap chocolate has not made a comeback, and it probably never will. Last year’s cocoa price crisis, driven by a combination of extreme heat, drought and disease in key producing regions, may have eased. But the aftertaste remains: A market that no longer behaves the way it used to, because the landscapes that grow cocoa are no longer the same. And the world’s unwitting appetite for cheap chocolate at the expense of biodiversity is part of the reason.</p><p>Cocoa is one of the most rainfall-dependent crops in the tropics, grown mainly by smallholders with few safety nets. Because cocoa production is concentrated in a handful of regions, a bad season in one place can quickly ripple across global supply. That fragility was laid bare in 2024, when the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which produce nearly 60 percent of the world’s cocoa, were hit by climate extremes that slashed harvests. Prices surged by more than <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/markets-and-trade/news-and-events/news-detail/cocoa--coffee-and-tea-push-up-global-food-import-bill-for-wealthier-countries/\">300 percent</a>, squeezing some farmers, enriching others, and leaving consumers paying for the uncertainty.</p><p>The problem is not simply that cocoa is vulnerable. It is that we have built a cocoa economy that magnifies the vulnerability. For decades, the world has chased low prices and high output, and too often that has meant converting forest landscapes into farmland, from West Africa to parts of Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p><p>But forests are not optional. They regulate rainfall, protect soils, and create the microclimates on which cocoa depends. Full-sun cocoa farms can produce higher yields in the short term, but the sugar rush is followed by a costly crash: Depleted soils, limited protection from heat and drought that is on the increase, and little for farmers to fall back on when the monocrops fail. Yields fall, farms expand deeper into forests to compensate, and the cycle repeats.</p><p>This is why cocoa’s price volatility is not a temporary blip. It is a warning sign: We are weakening the natural systems cocoa depends on at the same moment that climate change is making harvests less reliable.</p><p>Research by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) <a href=\"https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/436c55ae-6662-4f7e-9fac-0588db782f5e\">shows</a> how extreme heat undermines agriculture, reducing both the quantity and quality of crop yields and increasing pest and disease pressure. A recent <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192325000139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> modelling cocoa under mid-century climate change finds that warming could wipe out as much as a third to half of today’s suitable cocoa area in some core producing zones, while shifting production towards new regions. Without safeguards, that transition risks trading climate stress in one place for forest loss in another. The details will vary across regions, but the implication is global: As climate change alters weather patterns, the geography of cocoa production will shift, and a stable supply will become harder to take for granted.</p><p>Unless we build resilience now, future Valentine’s Days may come with less chocolate and higher prices.</p><p>But we can eat our chocolate and keep forests too, by changing how cocoa is grown. It starts with bringing trees back to cocoa farms, reversing the damaging practices that are ultimately undermining production. Change can be made through climate-resilient agroforestry practices that rebuild shade cover, improve soil health and moisture retention, and reduce cocoa’s exposure to heat and drought. Cocoa grown under shade trees can stabilise farm conditions and support biodiversity, while producing higher-quality beans that meet premium market standards, giving farmers stronger incentives to maintain tree cover rather than clear more land.</p><p>Sceptics argue that growing cocoa with trees means accepting lower yields. But when it comes to unsustainable practices, high productivity today comes with a high cost tomorrow. A farm that exhausts its soil, loses shade, is exposed to drought, and needs ever more chemical inputs to maintain production is not a success story. It is a trap.</p><p>In a changing climate, the point is not how much cocoa a farm can produce in a year, but how reliably it can produce year after year. That requires resilience built into the landscape, now more than ever: More tree cover, healthier soils, and diversified farm systems that protect livelihoods when climate extremes hit.</p><p>This is not theoretical. It is already happening.</p><p>In Ecuador’s Amazon province of Napo, a project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and supported with technical assistance from the FAO has helped strengthen a sustainable cocoa value chain built around the traditional <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/giahs/giahs-around-the-world/ecuador-amazonian-chakra/en\">Chakra agroforestry system</a> used by Kichwa communities. Put simply, it is cocoa grown as part of a forest garden: Kichwa women known as Chakramamas help steward these farms, cultivating cocoa under shade trees alongside a diverse mix of other crops and native plants, rather than clearing land for a single crop. Recognised by FAO as a <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/giahs/en\">Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System</a>, the model is still expanding more than a decade on, helping Indigenous producer families earn more from premium cocoa through stronger processing, marketing, and partnerships with high-value buyers. <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/gef/news/news-detail/From-the-Ecuadorian-Amazon-to-the-European-markets-Sustainable-production-of-Cocoa-in-Napo/en\">High-end chocolatiers</a> continue to source from Chakra producers, showing that cocoa grown alongside trees can deliver world-class quality while keeping forests standing for biodiversity, climate and land benefits.</p><p>There are more examples. In the Ivory Coast, FAO-backed efforts supported by the Green Climate Fund are already <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/agroforestry/activities/faos-work/projects-detail/promoting-zero-deforestation-cocoa-production-for-reducing-emissions-in-c%C3%B4te-d%27ivoire-%28promire%29/\">delivering results</a>, restoring 1,084 hectares (2,679 acres) of degraded land and converting 3,527 hectares (8,715 acres) of conventional cocoa into improved agroforestry systems while reducing pressure on forests. Meanwhile, 234 farmers now have access to cocoa cooperatives, ensuring access to international fair-trade and organic certifications and a better price for their products. In <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/newsroom/story/an-island-of-chocolate-gold/en\">Sao Tome and Principe</a>, FAO has supported cocoa agroforestry through the GEF-funded Restoration Initiative, helping restore nearly 10,000 hectares (about 25,000 acres) of forest and improve land management across a further 23,000 hectares (about 57,000 acres). These are not boutique experiments. They are working models for stabilising supply, supporting farmer incomes, and reducing the forest loss that fuels cocoa’s growing volatility.</p><p>But projects alone will not be enough. Scaling them will take serious investment: From governments, companies, and consumers. It will also require rules that shift incentives across the entire cocoa economy, such as a new European Union law that requires cocoa and chocolate entering the EU market to be deforestation-free. By tying market access to how cocoa is grown, these rules are pushing governments, producers, and companies to rethink production models, improve traceability, and strengthen zero-deforestation cocoa systems.</p><p>Governments will also need to invest in farmer adaptation and long-term productivity, not just short-term output. That means accessible finance, practical support on farms, and policies that reward sustainable production instead of expansion into forests.</p><p>And chocolate companies need to promote resilience across their supply chains, not just chase volume. In a world of climate disruption, the cheapest cocoa is not necessarily the best bargain if it comes at the expense of farmers’ livelihoods or the ecosystems that keep cocoa viable in the years to come.</p><p>Paying farmers for chocolate that keeps forests standing is not a luxury. It is part of what makes cocoa more available and keeps farmers in business in a warming world. Chocolate is sold as a simple pleasure, but cocoa is no longer a simple crop: Its future depends on whether we treat forests and biodiversity as essential infrastructure for stable and resilient agrifood systems.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p data-start=\"628\" data-end=\"727\">In the end, the 13th parliamentary election in Bangladesh was not a revolution. It was a reckoning.</p><p data-start=\"729\" data-end=\"929\">When the ballots were counted, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had secured a decisive victory, returning to power after years in the political wilderness under Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule.</p><p data-start=\"931\" data-end=\"1193\">Most headlines framed it as a dramatic comeback, and rightfully so. But beneath the surface, this was less a tidal wave of voter choice than a carefully navigated current. This was a contest shaped by frustration and the arithmetic of first-past-the-post (FPTP).</p><p data-start=\"1195\" data-end=\"1831\">To understand why BNP prevailed, one must first dispense with the lazy narrative that this was a Jamaat moment squandered. When the results became clear, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) secured 68 seats, while the Jamaat-led bloc secured 77 seats in parliament. That is no small feat for a party whose previous best parliamentary showing was just 18 seats in 1991. Many analysts had suggested Jamaat’s support had grown in the run-up to the poll, and the data vindicated that claim. But in an FPTP system, a swelling vote share does not automatically translate into 151 seats out of 300 elected constituencies.</p><p data-start=\"1833\" data-end=\"2173\">This election was not driven by any momentous revolution, even though it came on the back of a mass uprising that toppled Hasina’s autocracy in August 2024. But there was no deep ideological rupture, and no permanent reordering of voter loyalties, at least not on a scale that would rupture the very fabric of the country’s electoral mindset.</p><p data-start=\"2175\" data-end=\"2426\">And of course, it was not a national wave election, in which a single mood sweeps towards a particular party across class, gender and region. What unfolded was a hybrid: Largely a normal election with significant deviations, but a predictable outcome.</p><p data-start=\"2428\" data-end=\"2619\">Party loyalists mostly stayed home. Swing voters mattered. And in pockets of the country, frustration with BNP’s local leadership triggered temporary defections – many of them to Jamaat or NCP.</p><p data-start=\"2621\" data-end=\"2843\">The anger was real. After August 5, BNP’s grassroots machinery performed abysmally. Petty leaders across districts were accused of corruption and extortion. In rural market towns and urban peripheries, resentment simmered.</p><p data-start=\"2845\" data-end=\"3150\">Voters were not merely disappointed; they were, to use the language heard in tea stalls and union parishad courtyards, “really, really pissed off”. That fury explains Jamaat’s surge. A portion of BNP loyalists and a significant share of swing voters drifted towards the promise of an “honest alternative”.</p><p data-start=\"3152\" data-end=\"3177\">But drift is not destiny.</p><p data-start=\"3179\" data-end=\"3381\">BNP’s base, historically broader and organisationally deeper than Jamaat’s, did not collapse. Even after defections, it remained numerically larger. BNP’s nomination strategy proved unexpectedly shrewd.</p><p data-start=\"3383\" data-end=\"3558\">Where Jamaat fielded relatively unknown but ideologically trusted figures, BNP leaned on its old guard – candidates with entrenched name recognition and dense informal networks.</p><p data-start=\"3560\" data-end=\"3790\">That mattered, particularly in rural Bangladesh. Urban, educated voters may be thrilled by the rhetoric of ethical governance. For them, the idea of an incorruptible, ideologically disciplined candidate resonates as a moral reset.</p><p data-start=\"3792\" data-end=\"4067\">But rural voters are pragmatic actors. They operate within intricate patronage webs. An MP is not an abstraction; he (and it is usually he) is a broker of safety nets, jobs, stability and dispute resolution. Honesty, in isolation, does not guarantee access. Familiarity does.</p><p data-start=\"4069\" data-end=\"4396\">Thus emerged the central voter dilemma. Disgusted with BNP’s excesses, many considered a switch. In constituencies where Jamaat fielded a well-known leader, some made it. But elsewhere, voters encountered candidates they did not know, whose “honesty” they could not verify, and whose party offered little beyond moral branding.</p><p data-start=\"4398\" data-end=\"4455\">Faced with uncertainty, they chose the “devil” they knew.</p><p data-start=\"4457\" data-end=\"4723\">Jamaat compounded its structural limitations with strategic missteps. Its awkward posture on women’s issues – oscillating between reassurance and dog whistles – failed to convince large segments of female voters who have, over decades, carved out expanding public roles.</p><p data-start=\"4725\" data-end=\"4958\">Bangladesh’s social transformation is not cosmetic, and women are central to its labour force, education system and microcredit economy. A party that cannot articulate a credible vision for gender equality cannot win a national wave.</p><p data-start=\"4960\" data-end=\"5209\">More damaging was Jamaat’s revisionist flirtation with the memory of 1971. The Liberation War is the country’s moral founding document. Attempts to soften or reinterpret Jamaat’s historical role alienated voters far beyond the secular-liberal elite.</p><p data-start=\"5211\" data-end=\"5363\">Even conservative families drew red lines around 1971. The prevailing mode of public sentiment was probably blunt: One may forgive; one does not forget.</p><p data-start=\"5365\" data-end=\"5619\">Yet Jamaat’s performance was still historic. Jamaat-e-Islami and its allied coalition secured 77 seats, a testament not only to its disciplined cadre but also to BNP’s own misdeeds. Extortion scandals and local arrogance pushed voters into Jamaat’s arms.</p><p data-start=\"5621\" data-end=\"5851\">In a tightly contested FPTP landscape, even a few percentage points can flip dozens of seats. Jamaat capitalised on that anger with precision in Rajshahi, Khulna and Rangpur divisions, where its organisational muscle is strongest.</p><p data-start=\"5853\" data-end=\"6127\">But precision is not the same as breadth. Jamaat’s surge remained regionally concentrated. Its support varied sharply by class, gender, education and age. That is the opposite of a wave election. Without uniform national momentum, being a victor in FPTP is not an easy task.</p><p data-start=\"6129\" data-end=\"6475\">Then there was the ghost in the machine: The Awami League (AL). Much commentary underestimated its residual vote. Surveys suggested a hardcore 5 to 7 percent would never defect, but beyond that lay a larger bloc – perhaps 20 to 25 percent – either undecided or unwilling to disclose preferences. In this election, that particular bloc mattered a lot.</p><p data-start=\"6477\" data-end=\"6773\">Pre-election field research and multiple polls indicated that many non-hardcore AL voters were breaking towards the BNP – probably not out of ideological alignment but out of instrumental rationality. They believed BNP would form the government and wanted access to services through the winning MP.</p><p data-start=\"6775\" data-end=\"7018\">In areas where BNP’s old guard had harassed AL supporters, some abstained or flirted with Jamaat. But nationally, the gravitational pull favoured BNP. Voters wanted to be on the side of the winner. Perception became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p data-start=\"7020\" data-end=\"7421\">The four plausible scenarios before election day clarified the stakes. Without significant AL turnout, BNP would likely secure a plurality in a tight race. With moderate AL support, it would win a comfortable majority. With overwhelming AL backing, even a two-thirds majority was conceivable. Only a full-blown Jamaat wave – a cross-class, cross-gender national embrace – could have reversed the equation.</p><p data-start=\"7423\" data-end=\"7452\">That wave never materialised.</p><p data-start=\"7454\" data-end=\"7839\">BNP’s victory, then, is a product of structural advantage, strategic candidate selection and the rational calculations of the country’s traditional voters. It was aided by Jamaat’s self-inflicted wounds on women’s rights and historical memory. It was enabled, paradoxically, by BNP’s own local misconduct, which inflated Jamaat’s vote share but not enough to overcome FPTP mathematics.</p><p data-start=\"7841\" data-end=\"8124\">One more footnote of this election deserves attention: The emergence of the National Citizen Party (NCP), which captured five seats. For a new party born out of an uprising, in the highly polarised political environment of the South Asian nation, that is no small accomplishment.</p><p data-start=\"8126\" data-end=\"8344\">It signals a hunger, however modest, for alternatives outside the new binary of BNP and Jamaat. Under proportional representation, such a party might flourish. Under FPTP, five seats is both a breakthrough and a ceiling.</p><p data-start=\"8346\" data-end=\"8576\">Bangladesh’s 13th parliamentary election was, in the end, a story of limits: The limits of anger, the limits of moral branding, the limits of revisionism, and the enduring power of organisational depth in a winner-take-all system.</p><p data-start=\"8578\" data-end=\"8649\">BNP won not because it inspired a nation, but because it understood it.</p><p data-start=\"8578\" data-end=\"8649\"><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"

“strongly objects” to the proposed resolution being circulated by the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu in support of last year’s ruling by the ICJ – the UN’s top court.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 4 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The Associated Press news agency, which also reported on the cable, said that it was circulated to all US embassies and consulates this week, shortly after Vanuatu announced it was putting forward the draft UN resolution for consideration.</p><p>“We are strongly urging Vanuatu to immediately withdraw its draft resolution and cease attempting to wield the Court’s Advisory Opinion as a basis for creating an avenue to pursue any misguided claims of international legal obligations,” a copy of the cable seen by Al Jazeera states.</p><p>The <a href=\"/news/2025/7/23/historic-ruling-on-climate-change-by-world-court-what-to-expect\">ICJ’s 15 judges considered</a> tens of thousands of pages of written submissions and two weeks of <a href=\"/news/2024/12/14/icj-weighs-legal-responsibility-for-climate-change-future-of-our-planet\">oral arguments</a> during the court’s biggest-ever case, before delivering their verdict last year that states have a legal obligation to act on the “existential threat” of climate change.</p><p>The ICJ case took place after Vanuatu won the support of 132 countries in the UN General Assembly, which can request opinions from The Hague-based court.</p><p>It also came as the Trump administration has sought to <a href=\"/news/2025/9/27/cop30-urged-to-link-climate-justice-with-reparations-for-historical-crimes\">undo US action on climate change</a>, both at home and at the UN.</p><p>The US cable claims that Vanuatu’s proposed UN resolution in support of the ICJ opinion was based on “speculative climate models to fabricate purported legal obligations that seek to assign blame and encourage baseless claims”.</p><p>Louis Charbonneau, Human Rights Watch’s director at the UN, urged support for Vanuatu’s draft resolution on Friday, saying “governments should live up to their obligation” to protect human rights around the world by protecting the environment.</p><p>“Responsible governments shouldn’t allow themselves to be bullied by those that reject the global scientific consensus and continue to support reliance on harmful fossil fuels,” he said.</p><p>Vanuatu’s UN Ambassador Odo Tevi, who said his country wants a vote on the resolution by the end of March, has stressed that it would ensure that the clarity in the ICJ ruling “strengthens global climate action and multilateral cooperation”.</p><p>An article in Vanuatu’s Daily Post newspaper said that the draft resolution has been endorsed by countries including Barbados, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Jamaica, Kenya, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Netherlands, Palau, the Philippines, Singapore and Sierra Leone.</p><p>Many of these countries are already experiencing the worsening effects of climate change, including increasingly severe storms.</p><p>Trump, who has promised to <a href=\"/news/2025/1/21/drill-baby-whats-the-paris-climate-deal-why-does-trump-want-out\">“drill, baby drill”</a> for oil in his second term, has withdrawn the US from UN climate bodies, including the UN’s top climate change treaty body, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p><p>Trump has also <a href=\"/news/2025/10/18/trump-torpedoes-international-deal-to-reduce-shipping-emissions\">threatened to impose sanctions</a> on diplomats who voted for a levy on polluting shipping fuels at the International Maritime Organization (IMO).</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

He said India pursues a pragmatic approach to its strategic and foreign policy, “though it may sometimes take time to reorient itself”.</p><p>Shahab Enam Khan, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said the BNP will pursue a “more transactional approach” towards both Islamabad and Delhi.</p><p>“Pakistan, as a natural regional neighbour, will benefit from more transparent and structured cooperation,” he said.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2 id=\"new-chapter-with-china\">New chapter with China?</h2><p>Perhaps the most consequential relationship for the incoming Bangladesh government will be with China.</p><p>Beijing maintained strong ties with Hasina, while also cultivating links across Bangladesh’s political spectrum, positioning itself regardless of the domestic political dynamics.</p><p>Under Hasina’s long rule, China expanded its economic footprint through its Belt and Road Initiative, deepening infrastructure investments and military cooperation with Dhaka.</p><p>The interim government that succeeded Hasina also secured about $2.1bn in Chinese investments, loans and grants, alongside high-level visits to Beijing, including by Yunus.</p><p>On Friday, the Chinese embassy congratulated the BNP on its victory, expressing readiness to work with the new government on “writing new chapters of China-Bangladesh relations”.</p><p>Hossain, professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka, said the BNP would likely “further deepen its relations with China, hearkening back to the past experience of friendly ties” under the previous governments led by the party.</p><p>At the same time, he noted, Bangladesh will face a “growing American opposition to China’s increased presence” in the region.</p><p>Ali of the Georgia State University argued that Dhaka’s most viable path would be to “keep Chinese investment and connectivity projects where they serve Bangladesh’s interests, while making foreign policy more predictable and rules-based” in relation to China, India and the US.</p><p>“If Dhaka can be transparent about its red lines and priorities and keep the China file focused on economics rather than security symbolism, it will have a better chance of avoiding being dragged into major power rivalries while protecting its own strategic space,” he said.</p><h2 id=\"dhaka-s-delicate-balancing-act\">Dhaka’s delicate balancing act</h2><p>As Rahman prepares to assume office, he faces what Shahriar, professor at North South University in Dhaka, describes as a “great power competition in the Bay of Bengal region”.</p><p>The BNP manifesto emphasised a “Bangladesh First” policy, which called for all international relations and engagements to prioritise national sovereignty, security and the welfare of the people.</p><p>“The reality is, as a sovereign country, Bangladesh needs to develop its relations with all the countries, including China, Pakistan, Myanmar.

Children learn from an early age that <a href=\"/news/2025/10/31/acute-trauma-the-ever-present-wounds-of-gazas-children-from-israels-war\">trauma</a> will define their lives in ways even other Palestinians are spared.</p><p>Psychologists from the West Bank told Al Jazeera young people in the camps face “incessant traumatisation”, and most are deprived of “safety, places to play, opportunities, and a chance to escape”.</p><p>Instead, as the offspring of refugees denied the right to return to their homeland, they face a life surrounded by poverty, death, and Israeli military violence.</p><p>They are part of Palestinian society, yet remain marginalised within it – without the sense of belonging others take for granted.</p><p>The conditions endured by those in the camps make them a breeding ground for armed resistance to Israel.</p><p>Belal says that it was Wael’s time in prison that eventually pushed him to fight. He says that Wael was tortured by guards for being defiant, and was kept in solitary confinement. He was eventually released as part of the November 2023 prisoner exchange deal, at the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312016\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312016\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312016\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/The-main-street-through-Balata-1771004964.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A street in the Balata refugee camp\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4312016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Balata refugee camp in the occupied West Bank has been repeatedly attacked by Israeli forces [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"defenders-of-the-camps\" dir=\"ltr\">Defenders of the camps</h2><p>The West Bank’s 19 <a href=\"/news/2025/11/20/israels-emptying-of-west-bank-refugee-camps-amounts-to-war-crimes-hrw\">refugee camps</a>, once makeshift tented communities when they were established in 1948 after Israel’s founding and intended to be temporary, are now densely populated built-up areas housing the descendants of hundreds of thousands of refugees.</p><p>The older generations remember being forcibly expelled from their homes in historical Palestine by Zionist militias in the 1948 Nakba to pave the way for the creation of an Israeli state.</p><p>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) describes the camps as dominated by poverty, severe overcrowding, and joblessness. The camps are also the primary targets of Israeli military operations in the West Bank.</p><p>Without the prospect of a normal childhood for their occupants, the lure of fighting Israel can often prove irresistible.</p><p>Nablus-based psychologist, Nisreen Bsharat, said “martyrdom”, particularly for those in the camps, is viewed as the ultimate demonstration of faith and resilience.</p><p>Bsharat, who works with young people and grieving mothers from Balata, said martyrdom is seen as a “’heroic’ contribution to Palestine”, and that martyrs and their families are celebrated as such.</p><p>Those who fight against Israel are seen as “role models” when so few opportunities exist in refugee camps, Bsharat added.</p><p>“Historically, martyrdom is tied to our national identity,” she said. “It’s seen as the least we can offer our homeland, and part of our duty.”</p><p>Though far from an exclusively Islamic concept, Palestinians often refer to those who are killed by Israeli forces as martyrs, believing they sacrifice their lives fighting for their nation, Islam, and the Holy Land – and believe that God promises them their place in paradise.</p><p>Bethlehem-based clinical psychologist and academic, Amanda Manasra, who was born in Aida refugee camp, and focuses on trauma in Palestine, told Al Jazeera the vast majority of camp residents live with untreated complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which is significantly more difficult to cure.</p><p>The harsh environment of the camps creates a revolutionary fervour that is far less common in wealthier areas, Manasra added.</p><p>“The idea of martyrdom is related to how Palestinians find meaning to deal with hardship, individually and collectively,” she said.</p><p>“Many of my cases are adolescent men from the camps – many former prisoners – who have lost so many friends and family members.</p><p>“Joining the resistance is about taking control – it can feel like a reward for experiencing hardship, and can satisfy feelings of retribution.</p><p>“The fighters feel they have survived, persisted, and beaten the occupation war machine.”</p><p>Camps in the northern West Bank came under even more relentless attack since Israel launched “Operation Iron Wall” in January 2025, which has displaced tens of thousands of refugees in nearby Jenin and Tulkarem, and killed hundreds.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4312021\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4312021\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4312021\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/A-side-street-with-tributes-to-martyrs-above-1771005091.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C578&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"A side street in Nablus\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4312021\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tributes to Palestinians killed fighting Israel are visible across Balata [Al Jazeera]</figcaption></figure><h2>Psychological toll</h2><p>Belal, who spent eight years in Palestinian Authority (PA) prison during Wael’s childhood, feels the pain of his son’s loss deeply.</p><p>They both had only ever known the narrow, labyrinthine streets and decrepit buildings of Balata, the most populous refugee camp in the West Bank. But Belal feels that he wasn’t able to be there to guide Wael through them.</p><p>“I didn’t get the chance to see Wael growing up, or spend time with him as all other fathers do,” he said, unable to fight back his tears.</p><p>“I envy his mother and brother because at least they lived with him. They have beautiful and plentiful memories with him, shared moments.</p><p>“Do you know what it feels like to carry your son on your shoulders, place him in his grave, and bury him with your own hands? It is the hardest thing in the world.”</p><p>Belal, whose brother was also killed by Israel when he was younger, said he and his son had so many plans for when he would be released from prison.</p><p>In the end, Belal was freed only on compassionate grounds so he could see Wael for the final time before he was buried.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Israel’s actions breed hatred</h2><p>For those in Nablus’s refugee camps, violent incidents like Wael’s killing are nearly a weekly reality – and a doom-laden reminder that death lurks around every corner.</p><p>Belal recalled Wael becoming deeply affected as a child by the 20-year imprisonment of his closest uncle, after whom he was named. Later, he became preoccupied with avenging those close to him whose lives he says Israel had stolen. Four of Wael’s cousins had been killed in the 12 months preceding his death.</p><p>“Of course, it was also the constant invasions and the violence he grew up around, and the barbaric way the soldiers treat us,” Belal told Al Jazeera.</p><p>“Every night, we experience the atmosphere of Israel’s raids. We’re forced to accept this life – we have no choice but to adjust.”</p><p>Belal said that when Wael was growing up, there were no youth clubs or even parks that could take his mind off the harsh life in the camp. He added that soldiers had once raided the family’s house and destroyed “literally everything”.</p><p>“It’s actions like these that breed hatred toward them.”</p><p>Belal specifically remembered Wael, who had just begun high school, being enraged by footage of Israeli soldiers beating women in Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites.</p><p>“Wael couldn’t accept that soldiers would beat women and girls,” he said. “It was intolerable for him.”</p><p>Wael’s surviving family live in a crowded second-floor apartment near the centre of the camp, and his father, two of his brothers, his little sister, and his grieving mother took turns tearfully eulogising him.</p><p>His mother, Hanadi, was beaten, and his brother, Ibrahim, was also detained as soldiers broke into their apartment late at night to arrest Wael.</p><p>Hanadi was shocked by Wael’s condition once he was released from prison.</p><p>“The marks of torture remained on his body even after his release,” she said. “Burn scars from extinguished cigarettes were visible on his back and hands.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Refugee camps under siege</h2><p>Balata has often been a target for the Israeli military, and, according to the UN, 30 people have been killed in the camp since Israel intensified its attacks on the West Bank following Hamas’s October 7 attacks.</p><p>The pictures of Palestinians killed fighting Israel are emblazoned, like shrines, on the camp’s walls.</p><p>About 33,000 people are crammed into Balata’s narrow streets. It spans an area of 0.25 square kilometres (0.1sq miles), and has one of the highest rates of unemployment and food insecurity anywhere in the territory, according to UNRWA.</p><p>On August 15, Wael and two other fighters rushed to confront an incursion of Israeli soldiers when they were struck by a drone on the camp’s main street. Wael and fellow fighter Ahmad Khalil were killed instantly, while four others, including children, were injured.</p><p>Hanadi described the camp being surrounded by soldiers while gunshots rang close by, as she comforted her younger children.</p><p>“The moment I heard the sound of the missile, I knew he had been martyred,” she said.</p><p>“I started praying for God to accept him and to give me strength to bear this calamity.</p><p>“I also prayed that his face would remain unharmed because he always wished his face wouldn’t be disfigured so we could say our goodbyes to him properly.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h2>Tsunami of trauma</h2><p>Manasra said there is a tsunami of untreated mental health problems across the West Bank, while services remain hopelessly stretched, underfunded, and inaccessible for most.</p><p>She says the glorification surrounding resistance to Israel and martyrdom also obscures a more difficult reality of unprocessed grief and trauma that lingers with individuals and families forever.</p><p>Supporting families in the camps like Belal’s is nearly impossible when services are so costly and restricted, she says.</p><p>Without any such mental health support, Belal spoke of his suffering and told Al Jazeera that, since his son’s death, “joy has not entered our house”.</p><p>“We may smile or laugh at each other to show politeness, but inside, it’s different,” he added.</p><p>“Inside, there’s only fire – and pain.”</p><p>Too often, the burden of resistance falls on the poorest residents of the West Bank’s refugee camps.</p><p>In each case, the reason for resisting is different. But there are nearly always similarities: Hardship, piety, retribution, and a sense of duty to one’s country.</p><p>The pride found in resisting only briefly distracts from the deep scars left by Israel’s occupation, which is tightening its grip over the West Bank – particularly in the refugee camps.</p><p>The surviving families of those killed are left somewhere between terrible grief and hopeful adulation.</p><p>“When I sit alone, I imagine Wael beside me,” Belal added.</p><p>“Sometimes, I feel like hugging his picture tightly to my chest as I cry my heart out.</p><p>“He was a role model even for me. I bid him farewell with complete serenity – I know God will accept him as a martyr.”</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"
