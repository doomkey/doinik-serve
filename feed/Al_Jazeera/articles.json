Colvin refused to move when asked, leading to her arrest.</p><p>“I remained seated because the lady could have sat in the seat opposite me,” Colvin told reporters in Paris in April 2023.</p><p>“She refused because… a white person wasn’t supposed to sit close to a negro,” Colvin said.</p><p>“People ask me why I refused to move, and I say history had me glued to the seat,” she added.</p><p>Colvin was briefly imprisoned for disturbing public order. The following year, she became one of four Black female plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit challenging segregated bus seating in Montgomery.</p><p>The case was successful, impacting public transportation throughout the US, including trains, aeroplanes and taxis.</p><p>Colvin’s arrest occurred at a time of growing frustration over how Black people were being treated on Montgomery’s bus system. The arrest of Parks in December 1955 triggered the start of the yearlong Montgomery Bus Boycott.</p><p>The boycott propelled the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr into the national limelight and is considered the start of the modern civil rights movement.</p><p>“She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history,” the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation said in a statement.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"too-often-overlooked\">‘Too often overlooked’</h2><p>Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said Colvin’s action “helped lay the legal and moral foundation for the movement that would change America”.</p><p>Colvin’s role in helping to trigger the modern civil rights movement is often overshadowed by the actions of Parks, and Reed said her bravery “was too often overlooked”.</p><p>“Claudette Colvin’s life reminds us that movements are built not only by those whose names are most familiar, but by those whose courage comes early, quietly, and at great personal cost,” Reed added.</p><p>While Colvin’s arrest helped to bring an end to racial segregation in the US, there are concerns from civil rights groups that President Donald Trump is looking to roll back policies on social progress.</p><p>On Tuesday, the largest civil rights group in the US said that Trump was being deceptive in his claims that civil rights hurt white people.</p><p>In an interview from last week published by The New York Times, Trump said he believed civil rights-era protections resulted in white people being treated unfairly.</p><p>The comments came after Trump was asked whether protections that began in the 1960s with the passage of the Civil Rights Act resulted in discrimination against white men, according to the newspaper.</p><p>“It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people – people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job,” Trump was quoted as saying.</p><p>“It was a reverse discrimination,” he said.</p><p>In response, NAACP President Derrick Johnson said Trump was “lying through his teeth”.</p><p>“Trump does this all the time. He deliberately invents a false reality to lay the groundwork for policies that further benefit the top one percent by privatising government services and stripping resources away from underserved communities,” said Johnson.</p><p></p></div></div></body></html>"

For instance, World Bank data from 2022 suggested the overall trade volume between China and Iran was worth $37bn.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">China imported 80 percent of Iran’s oil last year, providing much-needed revenue as other major oil buyers, such as India, drastically cut back their imports after US sanctions were imposed during Trump’s first term in office.</p><p>Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing, said China has been Iran’s top trading partner since 2016. The trade has provided an “economic lifeline to Iran”, she said.</p><p>“China does not just buy oil. It also purchases other things, such as plastics, iron ore and chemicals. It’s also a major buyer of Iran’s methanol. There are reports that China was considering even increasing its purchase of Iranian oil in the light of the turbulence now in Venezuela,” she said.</p><p>The new tariff, the Al Jazeera correspondent said, “is really going to hurt Chinese manufacturers” because it will apply on top of the 35 percent tariff that Chinese goods already face in the US.</p><p>The potential new tariff comes months after the US and China announced a trade truce, bringing down China’s tariff from more than 100 to 35 percent following a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Trump in October on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.</p><p>The Al Jazeera correspondent said the new tariff threat “not only could jeopardise the current stability that we have between Beijing and Washington, it will also jeopardise Trump’s planned trip to Beijing in April this year”.</p><p>The Chinese embassy in Washington condemned Trump’s policy, warning that Beijing would take “all necessary measures” to defend its interests and rejecting what it called “illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction”.</p><p>“China’s stance against the arbitrary use of tariffs has been consistent and clear. No one wins in tariff or trade wars, and coercion and pressure are not a solution,” an embassy spokesperson said on X.</p><p>Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning said, “There are no winners in a trade war.”</p><p>“China will resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Mao told reporters on Tuesday.</p><p>Stressing that China wants peace in the Middle East, Mao said Beijing supports Iran to “maintain national stability” and “oppose[s] interfering in the country’s internal affairs and the use, or threat of use, of force in international affairs”.</p><h3>Turkiye</h3><p>According to the UN Comtrade data from 2024, Turkiye was Iran’s second largest trading partner. The trade between the two countries was worth about $5.7bn.</p><p>Turkiye faces a baseline tariff from the US of 15 percent. Since June, the US has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminium from most of its trading partners, including Turkiye, raising them from 25 to 50 percent.</p><h3>Pakistan</h3><p>Pakistan is a top export destination for Iran, where the total value of exports was about $1.2bn in 2024.</p><p>Pakistani exports to the US face a 19 percent tariff at the moment.</p><h3>India</h3><p>India is a top export destination for Iran, where the total value of exports was just over $1.05bn in 2024.</p><p>India faces 50 percent US duties on its steel and aluminium. A range of other Indian exports also faces a <a href=\"/economy/2025/8/27/trumps-india-tariffs-take-effect-which-sector-will-be-hit-whats-exempt\">50 percent</a> tariff from the US.</p><p>Last week, media reports said the Trump administration is planning to slap 500 percent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.</p><p class=\" embed-paragraph-wrapper\"></p><h2 id=\"how-have-sanctions-impacted-iran-s-exports\">How have sanctions impacted Iran’s exports?</h2><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The US has imposed sanctions to cut off funding for Tehran’s nuclear ‌programme. Washington accuses Iran of planning to make a nuclear bomb. But Iran has insisted that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only and has allowed inspections by the global nuclear watchdog.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">But after the US bombed a nuclear plant during Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in June, Tehran imposed restrictions on the nuclear inspections. Talks to break the logjam have stalled as Tehran has accused the US of imposing conditions.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Fuel is Iran’s biggest export item by value while major imports include intermediate goods, vegetables, machinery and equipment.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">Iran exported products to 147 trading partners in 2022, ⁠according to the most recent data from the World Bank.</p><p>Most of the sanctions on Iran were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal under US President Barack Obama, but three years later, Trump withdrew the US from the deal, which had put limits on Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.</p><p>He also imposed additional sanctions targeting petrochemicals, metals (steel, aluminium and copper) and senior Iranian officials as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.</p><p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">The reimposition of US sanctions since 2018 has squeezed oil exports and access to global finance. Iran’s oil exports fell by about 60 to 80 percent, stripping the government of tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue.</p><p>The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita fell from more than $8,000 in 2012 to just over $6,000 by 2017 and a little above $5,000 in 2024, according to World Bank data.</p><p>Iran was exporting about 2.2 million barrels of crude oil per day (bpd) in 2011. Those exports fell sharply after 2018 to an all-time low of just over 400,000bpd in 2020. Exports have gradually risen to about 1.5 million bpd in 2025 but still remain below their pre‑2018 levels.</p><p>Foreign trade has brought billions of dollars to Iran’s economy.</p><p>The country’s exports were worth about $22.9bn in 2024, according to UN Comtrade data, about 5 percent of the country’s total GDP in 2024 of about $475.3bn, according to World Bank data.</p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>Iran is living through one of the most dangerous moments in its post-revolutionary history. Nationwide protests have become sustained rather than episodic. As a new wave of unrest has spread across the country, violence has intensified. The true death toll cannot be verified yet.</p><p>These events have revived a familiar question: Is Iran heading towards another 1979?</p><p>The temptation to rely on this analogy is understandable. Images of mass mobilisation and rapidly recurring protests evoke memories of the final months of the shah’s rule. Yet the comparison is ultimately misleading.</p><p>The success of the 1979 revolution cannot be explained solely by mass mobilisation. Instead, it was the convergence of coordinated opposition under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and, more decisively, the ruling elites’ inability to effectively repress dissent that ensured its triumph.</p><p>Mohammad Reza Shah had cancer, was heavily medicated and was visibly indecisive. His leadership faltered during crises. He left the country twice amid political upheaval, first in 1953 after being challenged by Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and again in January 1979 as protests spread nationwide.</p><p>Equally important, the shah’s repressive apparatus was fragmented and socially heterogeneous. Apart from SAVAK, the shah’s central intelligence organisation, the police and gendarmerie were tasked with maintaining social order while the Iranian army focused on territorial defence rather than political repression.</p><p>These institutions lacked systematic ideological vetting and drew personnel from diverse social and ideological backgrounds. When the shah left the country, some segments of the police stopped their repressive tactics and cooperated with protesters to maintain public order while senior military commanders hesitated, prioritised self-preservation and ultimately abandoned the monarchy.</p><p>The situation today is fundamentally different. Unlike the shah, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s leadership is not marked by hesitation or indecision during crises.</p><p>Since assuming the position of supreme leader in 1989, Khamenei has overseen a profound transformation of the Islamic Republic into what I describe as a theocratic security state that relies more on repression rather than societal consent. As the supreme leader, he presides over a highly institutionalised, cohesive, ideologically committed and deeply invested coercive apparatus. This structural reality, rather than popular sentiment alone, defines the limits of revolutionary change in Iran today.</p><p>The Islamic Republic’s coercive power is not concentrated in a single institution. Instead, it is distributed across overlapping organisations with redundant chains of command. These forces are concentrated within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij, the police, the intelligence services and the social networks attached to them.</p><p>Iran’s coercive institutions are dominated by the regime’s hardcore supporters. Their loyalty is not merely transactional. It is ideological, institutional and generational. Ideological vetting and patronage ensure that their loyalty is not only enforced but actively cultivated.</p><p>Their social mobility, economic security and sense of identity are tied to the survival of the regime and Khamenei’s leadership. For them, regime collapse is not a political transition; it is an existential threat. In moments of crisis, these loyalists act preemptively to prevent the diffusion of protest and frame unrest as foreign-backed sedition, lowering internal barriers to violence.</p><p>Consequently, even protests that are larger and more widespread geographically than those in 1979 would not fundamentally challenge the regime. Instead, they would lead to stricter repression. This highlights a key lesson: Protests by themselves do not cause revolutions.</p><p>Revolutions occur when mass unrest intersects with elite paralysis or defection. That happened in 1979, but it has not happened now.</p><p>What could alter this equilibrium is not protest alone but a direct shock to the regime’s leadership structure. External intervention, particularly by the United States, would likely aim to disrupt elite coordination by targeting senior political and security figures with strikes.</p><p>Such an approach would only generate a genuine regime crisis if it removed Khamenei himself. Power in the Islamic Republic has been heavily centralised within the office of the supreme leader and his inner circle. His sudden absence could trigger elite confrontation over succession and weaken cohesion at the top.</p><p>But intervention could also reinforce loyalist unity. If Khamenei survived, core supporters within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij and the intelligence services would almost certainly close ranks, as they have done during previous external confrontations. Under those conditions, elite defection would remain unlikely.</p><p>Even in the event of regime collapse, Iran would not face the institutional vacuum seen in some post-intervention states. The country’s modern bureaucracy, which has maintained continuity since the early 20th century, would likely continue functioning in the short term. Administrative breakdown would be constrained by state capacity, social organisation and national identity.</p><p>Some warn that the fall of the Islamic Republic would inevitably lead to a prolonged insurgency. That risk cannot be dismissed. However, unlike the cases of Iraq or Afghanistan, in Iran, there would not be external state actors willing and able to finance, organise and sustain armed radical movements. Iranian society has also shown deep resistance to religious extremism and political radicalism. It is possible that instability following a regime collapse could be contained.</p><p>The real danger, then, is not that Iran is on the verge of repeating 1979 but that persistent reliance on that analogy blinds policymakers to how the Islamic Republic functions today. Misreading the nature of power in Iran does not increase the chances of peaceful change. It increases the likelihood that Iranians themselves will bear the cost of repression, escalation and prolonged uncertainty.</p><p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p></div></div></body></html>"
