Full-year sales, earlier seen up to 5 percent higher, are expected to be level with the previous year.</p>\n<p>Investors had largely anticipated a guidance cut after the company held off on assessing the damage from tariffs in the previous quarter and appeared calmed by assurances that the group’s luxury brands Audi and Porsche would recover next year after heavy losses in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>CEO Oliver Blume told investors the company must accelerate its cost-cutting efforts in response to the tariffs.</p>\n<p>“We need to shift our cost efforts into high gear and accelerate implementation. After all, we cannot assume that the tariff situation is only temporary,” Blume said.</p>\n<p>Global carmakers have booked billions of dollars in losses and some have issued profit warnings due to US tariffs. The European industry is also facing <a href=\"/video/counting-the-cost/2025/7/24/china-v-eu-the-fight-for-europes-electric-vehicle-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stiffening competition from China</a> and domestic regulations aimed at speeding up the electric vehicle transition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tariff-hit\">Tariff hit</h2>\n<p>Volkswagen is the third automaker this week to report a hit to their profits because of tariffs. Michigan-based <a href=\"/economy/2025/7/22/general-motors-reports-a-35-profit-drop-as-tariffs-weigh-on-car-industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">General Motors reported that tariffs</a> cost it $1.1bn in the second quarter. Stellantis, the maker of brands including Jeep and Fiat, reported a $2.7bn loss for the first six months of 2025.</p>\n<p>VW and its competitors are pressing European trade negotiators to strike a deal to <a href=\"/economy/2025/2/27/trump-threatens-25-tariffs-on-eu-claims-bloc-was-formed-to-screw-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce a 25 percent</a> US tariff they have faced since April.</p>\n<p>EU diplomats have indicated that the bloc could be moving towards a broad 15 percent tariff as it seeks to avoid a threatened 30 percent levy from August 1. A deal struck between the US and Japan this week raised hopes for a similar agreement for Europe, boosting carmakers’ shares.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>VW finance chief Arno Antlitz said Volkswagen’s profit margin would land roughly in the middle of its guidance with a Japan-style deal, which had a 15 percent tariff rate.</p>\n<p>He warned, however, that the clock was ticking on finding a deal. “We are already in July, so the longer we go into the second half of the year, the more we tend to the lower end of the guidance,” he said.</p>\n<p>Antlitz declined to comment on price increases when pressed by investors on how the company planned to protect its margins against tariffs.</p>\n<p>Volkswagen reported an operating profit of $4.4bn (3.8 billion euros) in the quarter ended June 30, down 29 percent on the previous year. It cited tariffs and restructuring costs for the decline as well as higher sales of lower-margin all-electric models.</p>\n<p>While Volkswagen was able to boost deliveries globally by 1.5 percent in the first six months of 2025, the group saw a decline of almost 10 percent in deliveries to the US.</p>\n<p>North American sales revenue accounted for 18.5 percent of the carmaker’s global sales in the first half.</p>\n<p>Car sales data for June highlighted a broader slowdown in Europe’s struggling auto sector – and showed Volkswagen among the laggards as the company undergoes a major overhaul to cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>Porsche and Audi are particularly exposed to US tariffs given they have no production there and rely heavily on exports.</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, Porsche’s operating result plunged by more than 90 percent to 154 million euros ($181m) and Audi’s by 64 percent to 550 million euros ($647m).</p>\n<p>“For both companies, Audi and Porsche, we are expecting that we will touch the bottom this year with positive momentum from 2026 onwards,” Blume said.</p>\n<p>Despite the losses, VW’s stock is on the upswing. As of noon in New York (16:00 GMT), it was up more than 3 percent since the market opened and up more than 12 percent over the last five days in trading.</p>\n<p>The stocks of other carmakers that also reported tariff hits are trending upwards. Stellantis is up 3.9 percent for the day. GM is about even – up by only about 0.2 percent.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

Figures show that prisons in Eswatini <a href=\"https://www.prisonstudies.org/country/eswatiniswaziland\">operate</a> at more than 170 percent of their capacity.</p>\n<p>Civil society groups – including the Southern Africa Litigation Centre, the Swaziland Rural Women’s Assembly and other regional NGOs – have threatened legal proceedings against the Eswatini government over its acceptance of the five convicted criminals.</p>\n<p>They argued that the detentions violate Eswatini’s own Correctional Services Act and other domestic laws and said there is no lawful basis for imprisoning foreign nationals who lack legal ties to the country.</p>\n<p>Chris Ogunmodede, a foreign affairs analyst familiar with African diplomatic circles, said there are several questions hovering over the agreement made with the Trump administration. These range from the legal justification used to authorise the deportees’ transfers, whether the men were informed and given consular access, the duration of their detentions and the terms of the arrangement with the US.</p>\n<p>He added that Eswatini and South Sudan are “smaller economies with no geopolitical weight” on which White House officials could easily “impose their will”.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-the-eswatini-government-say\">What does the Eswatini government say?</h2>\n<p>In a public statement, Mdluli said the government assured the people of the kingdom that the arrival of five third-country deportees from the US “poses no security threat to the Nation”.</p>\n<p><span>It stated that the five prisoners would be housed in correctional facilities within isolated units “where similar offenders are kept”.</span></p>\n<p>Addressing the bilateral discussions with the White House, she said the “engagements considered every avenue, including rigorous risk assessments and careful consideration for the safety and security of citizens”.</p>\n<h2>Which other African nations does Trump hope to negotiate deportation deals with?</h2>\n<p>In addition to Eswatini and South Sudan, Trump has discussed third-country deportation deals with the leaders of Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon during a <a href=\"/news/2025/7/9/white-house-hosts-west-african-leaders-to-discuss-trade-and-development\">summit</a> at the White House this month.</p>\n<p>Trump reportedly discussed migration, including the need for countries to accept the return of their nationals who do not have the right to stay in the US and the possibility of accepting deported citizens of third countries.</p>\n<p>Tom Homan, Trump’s border tsar, said the Trump administration hoped to forge deals with “many countries” to accept deported migrants.</p>\n<p>“If there is a significant public threat or national security threat, there’s one thing for sure: They’re not walking the streets of this country. We’ll find a third, safe nation to send them to, and we’re doing it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rwanda has confirmed it is in talks with the Trump administration for a similar deal while Nigeria said it had rejected pressure to make an agreement.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3856959\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3856959\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3856959\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-09T171226Z_1209385826_RC25JFAKK13F_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1753454932.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"summit\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3856959\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">US President Donald Trump hosts a summit of African leaders from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal at the White House in Washington, DC, on July 9, 2025 [Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"which-other-countries-have-considered-a-third-country-deportation-policy\">Which other countries have considered a third-country deportation policy?</h2>\n<h2 id=\"united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</h2>\n<p>The UK has explored third-country deportation policies as part of its efforts to manage irregular migration and asylum claims. Under the previous Conservative government, the UK partnered with Rwanda in 2022 and planned to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing with the UK committing 370 million pounds ($497m) in development funding over five years in exchange.</p>\n<p>The plan was first struck down by the UK Supreme Court in November 2023 for violating international human rights norms, given Rwanda’s inadequate asylum system and human rights concerns. In response, the government enacted the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024, which declared Rwanda a “safe country” and limited legal challenges to the policy.</p>\n<p>After the Labour Party’s victory in the July 2024 elections, Prime Minister Keir Starmer swiftly terminated the Rwanda scheme.</p>\n<p>However, in May, Starmer said he was talking to “a number of countries” about “return hubs”, where undocumented immigrants could be sent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"israel\">Israel</h2>\n<p>Similarly, Israel implemented a third-country deportation arrangement targeting African asylum seekers by sending them to countries like Rwanda and Uganda from 2013 to 2018.</p>\n<p>The government offered $3,500 per person to those agreeing to leave.</p>\n<p>In 2018, however, Israel’s Supreme Court in effect dismantled the policy, ruling it unlawful in part due to the receiving countries’ failure to guarantee protections and uphold international obligations under the Refugee Convention.</p>\n<p>Ogunmodede said the UK’s and Israel’s deals with African nations amounted to the “outsourcing of the migration problem”.</p>\n<p>He added that now, the US under the Trump administration is “using a carrot and stick approach to getting countries around the world to comply with the things that they want”.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

That atmosphere may have discouraged the Obama administration from doing anything until after the vote, Perry added.</p>\n<p>In addition, the documents Gabbard released from Obama officials do not appear to contradict the established conclusions of Russian interference, analysts say.</p>\n<p>Obama officials did not allege that vote counts had been manipulated, but rather that Russian hackers had launched covert digital operations aimed at sowing discord in the US during the vote, including by leaking emails of top Democrats, such as Clinton, and trying to influence opinion on social media using “bots”.</p>\n<p>The Senate Intelligence Committee report that Gabbard released, in which she hoped to undermine the Obama-era investigations into Russian interference, affirmed that position, although it blamed Obama administration officials for concluding that Russia interfered specifically to favour Trump.</p>\n<p>Election interference encompasses a wide range of illegitimate means to change election outcomes, including vote rigging, vote buying or covert manipulation of voters.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_787376\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-787376\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-787376\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/337a0bb12d884781b26741a27b776353_18.jpeg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C433&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller (L) and former Deputy Special Counsel Aaron Zebley are sworn in for testimony before the House Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on Capitol Hill in Washing\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-787376\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, left, and former Deputy Special Counsel Aaron Zebley are sworn in for testimony before the House Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, July 24, 2019 [Jim Watson/AFP]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"will-there-be-a-criminal-investigation-now\">Will there be a criminal investigation now?</h2>\n<p>On Wednesday, the Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, announced the creation of a “strike force” that will assess Gabbard’s claims and consider potential next legal steps.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Bondi said the Justice Department would “investigate these troubling disclosures fully and leave no stone unturned to deliver justice”.</p>\n<p>She did not give details about what the next steps might be.</p>\n<p>Obama, as a former US president, enjoys civil and criminal immunity for actions undertaken during his time as president, which are regarded as “official”.

The matter is one of the most extensively scrutinised in US election history. Russia, for its part, has <a href=\"/news/2021/3/17/russia-calls-us-intel-report-on-election-meddling-baseless\">denied the allegations</a>.</p>\n<p>Trump and his allies frequently refer to the investigations as a “hoax” because they also attempted to examine links between Trump, his associates, and Russian operatives.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, two months after the election, US intelligence agencies initially concluded that Russia had been responsible for cyberattacks on the email accounts of top Democrats, and for sowing discord on social media, using bots and trolls. The CIA said that the Kremlin orchestrated and codenamed the operation Project Lakhta.</p>\n<p>FBI investigations also focused on individual Trump officials, such as George Papadoulous, who was <a href=\"/news/2018/9/7/ex-trump-campaign-aide-george-papadopoulos-jailed-for-14-days\">indicted</a> for providing false statements to the FBI regarding his relations with Russians.</p>\n<p>Papadoulous was found to have known about the Russian operation, but there was no evidence that he had shared that information with the Trump campaign.</p>\n<p>During Trump’s first presidency, the Justice Department probed the conduct of the intelligence agencies regarding the investigations and found that there had been no “political bias” involved.</p>\n<p>The most followed <a href=\"/news/2019/3/23/muellers-trump-russia-investigation-who-are-the-key-players\">report</a> was released by special counsel Robert Mueller in 2019. It concluded that the “Russian government interfered in the 2016 election in a sweeping and systematic fashion” through social media campaigns that favoured Trump, because Moscow assessed that it would benefit from a Trump presidency.</p>\n<p>The operations sought to damage Clinton’s image by hacking into email accounts of members of the Clinton campaign and leaking them to the public, the report stated.

The trade balance officially flipped negative – which means imports outnumber exports – in 2022 and has remained so since then.</p>\n<p>But industry experts caution that US ice cream imports account for a minuscule fraction of all the US ice cream consumed in the US, and exports account for a tiny fraction of all US ice cream produced.</p>\n<p>The trade change was driven mostly by a jump in imports. Exports have remained largely unchanged since 2020.</p>\n<p>And the cherry on top? Disagreement over which products to classify as “ice cream” also affects data, experts say. For example, the data referenced by the office of the US Trade Representative also includes “edible ice”, which some experts (and dairy defenders) say doesn’t qualify as ice cream.</p>\n<p>Removing edible ice shows that “the US is a net exporter by a significant margin of ($193 million) or +85% larger by value,” International Dairy Foods Association Executive Vice President Matt Herrick told PolitiFact via email.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ice-cream-imports-increase-causes-us-trade-deficit\">Ice cream imports increase causes US trade deficit</h2>\n<p>From 1995 to 2020, the US had an ice cream trade surplus, ranging from about $20m to about $160m, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, an online economic data platform. Longtime customers include Mexico, followed by Saudi Arabia and Canada.</p>\n<p>In 2021, that surplus nearly vanished, and in 2022 and 2023, the US notched up an ice cream trade deficit of $92m and $33m, respectively.</p>\n<p>At first glance, importing frozen foods doesn’t seem practical.</p>\n<p>“Shipping refrigerated and frozen products overseas is expensive,” dairy economist Betty Berningat of HighGround Dairy said. “Mexico is the top destination for US dairy exports.”</p>\n<p>But many US and European companies have tapped into global markets.</p>\n<p>“Consumers may also want a specific treat that is styled after or known to be from another country,” Herrick said.</p>\n<p>Italy, the birthplace of gelato, is now the United States’ largest single source of imported ice cream. Italian ice cream imports more than quintupled from about $12m to almost $65m between 2020 and 2021 alone, before decreasing somewhat in 2023, the last year for which data is available.</p>\n<p>Some of this stems from increased consumer demand for specialty pints. A report by Mordor Intelligence, a global market research firm, said “product innovation and premiumisation” have become key in the US ice cream industry.</p>\n<p>“This trend is particularly evident in the growth of premium pint offerings and individually wrapped novelties that cater to both indulgence and portion control preferences,” the report said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-us-produces-far-more-ice-cream-than-it-imports-or-exports\">The US produces far more ice cream than it imports or exports</h2>\n<p>To get to the pint: The vast majority of ice cream consumed in the United States is made there, not overseas.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration is cherry-picking stats from a fraction of a sliver of the US ice cream industry.</p>\n<p>According to US Agriculture Department data, US ice cream makers churned out 1.31 billion gallons of ice cream in 2024. This includes regular ice cream, low-fat and nonfat ice cream, sherbet and frozen yoghurt.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the US imported 2.35 million gallons of traditional ice cream in 2024 – that’s 0.18 percent of the amount produced domestically, Herrick said.</p>\n<p>The US exported 16.4 million gallons of that domestic production, which is also a tiny fraction of 1.31 billion gallons of ice cream – a little more than 1 percent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"factoring-in-ice-cream-mixes-excluding-edible-ice-products\">Factoring in ice cream mixes, excluding ‘edible ice’ products</h2>\n<p>Another caveat about the international trade data: It does not include “mixes”, which skews the totals, said Herrick of the International Dairy Foods Association.</p>\n<p>Mixes are used to make ice cream shakes and soft-serve products, and they account for a significant portion of US ice cream exports. “Inclusion of such data points would change the picture quite significantly,” said Herrick. “While it is true that traditional ice cream and edible ice exports have seen decreased exports, the same cannot be said for exports of mixes.”</p>\n<p>US milk-based drink exports increased 621 percent over the past five years, he said. In 2024, the US exported nearly $35m in mixes to the European Union.</p>\n<h2 id=\"americans-and-dairy-based-ice-cream-a-centuries-old-love-affair-melting-away\">Americans and dairy-based ice cream: A centuries-old love affair melting away?</h2>\n<p>The White House has churned out plenty of ice cream devotees.</p>\n<p>George Washington stocked the capital with ice cream-making equipment. Thomas Jefferson is credited as being the first American to record an ice cream recipe. Ronald Reagan declared July National Ice Cream Month in 1984. Barack Obama even slung scoops back in the day.</p>\n<p>Biden, who was often sighted with a cone in hand, proclaimed while visiting Jeni’s Splendid Ice Cream headquarters in 2016: “My name is Joe Biden, and I love ice cream.”</p>\n<p>But consumption of regular dairy ice cream – a category that does not include frozen yoghurt, sherbet or nonfat and low-fat ice creams – has been trending down for years.</p>\n<p>In 1975, Americans ate an average of 18.2 pounds each of ice cream per year. That figure fell to 11.7 pounds by 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-ruling\">Our ruling</h2>\n<p>The office of the US Trade Representative purported a summertime scoop: “America had a trade surplus in ice cream in 2020 under President Trump’s leadership, but that surplus turned into a trade deficit of $40.6 million under President Biden’s watch.”</p>\n<p>It’s accurate that the US ice cream trade balance had a surplus for a quarter of a century before turning negative while Biden was president.</p>\n<p>But the US Trade Representative’s statement makes the US ice cream deficit appear out of cone-trol.</p>\n<p>There are three scoops of context on this trade sundae:</p>\n<p>The change was driven mostly by a jump in imports. Exports have remained largely unchanged since 2020.</p>\n<p>US ice cream imports and exports are a negligible amount compared to domestic production.</p>\n<p>There’s also disagreement over which products should or shouldn’t be included in the data set, which can skew trend interpretations. Excluding edible ice products and factoring in ice cream mixes leaves the US with a surplus.</p>\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs a sprinkling of clarification and additional details, so we rate it <strong>Mostly True</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Louis Jacobson contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The US buys 16 percent of that, making it Brazil’s biggest coffee customer. Experts warn the tariff will hurt competitiveness, especially for family farmers who produce two-thirds of Brazil’s coffee and have fewer resources to weather downturns or shift to new markets.</p>\n<p data-start=\"926\" data-end=\"1199\">Last year’s climate change-driven drought already devastated crops. Now, falling arabica prices, down 33 percent since February, are compounding losses. “We struggle for years, and suddenly we might lose everything,” said da Silva, who grows 40,000 trees and other crops to survive.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1201\" data-end=\"1471\">Nearby in Varre-Sai, Paulo Menezes Freitas, another smallholder with 35,000 trees, fears he may be forced to abandon coffee farming. He says the tariff also affects essential imports like machinery and aluminium. “It feels like the ground is crumbling under us,” he said.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1473\" data-end=\"1720\">Despite the blow, Brazil’s coffee exporters remain cautiously optimistic. The Council of Coffee Exporters of Brazil (Cecafe)’s Marcio Ferreira believes US buyers can’t afford to stop importing Brazilian beans.

Social disconnection – when a person lacks sufficient social contact, feels unsupported in their existing relationships, or experiences negative or strained connections – is an increasingly serious but often overlooked danger to health and wellbeing. There are several forms of social disconnection, including loneliness and social isolation.</p>\n<p>Today nearly one in six people globally report feeling lonely. Among adolescents and young adults as well as people living in low-income countries, the rate is even higher. But loneliness and social isolation are not just emotional states – they can be lethal. According to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), from 2014 to 2019, loneliness was associated with more than 871,000 deaths annually – equivalent to 100 deaths per hour. We now have irrefutable evidence that social health – our ability to form and maintain meaningful human connections – is just as essential to our wellbeing as physical and mental health. Yet for too long, it has been ignored by health systems and policymakers alike.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/30-06-2025-social-connection-linked-to-improved-heath-and-reduced-risk-of-early-death\">report</a> by WHO’s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/groups/commission-on-social-connection\">Commission on Social Connection</a> comes a month after the World Health Assembly adopted the first ever <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA78/A78_R9-en.pdf\">resolution</a> on social connection. The report marks a turning point for this serious global health threat and highlights the need for decisive leadership and action. The commission’s report charts a clear path forward with evidence-based strategies to reverse this scourge and strengthen the bonds that allow individuals and societies to thrive.</p>\n<p>Humans are hardwired for connection. From our earliest years, relationships shape our brains, our emotions and our chances of living a healthy life. Conversely, disconnection, whether through loneliness, or social isolation, can have devastating impacts: It increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, anxiety, dementia and premature death. It can also result in poor school and work performance and costs economies and societies billions per year.</p>\n<p>But the good news is that solutions exist. The commission’s report outlines interventions that work – from national policies and community programmes to campaigns and individual support strategies. It highlights a range of successful examples: peer-to-peer support for low-income older people in South Africa; “social prescribing” of activities to older adults in South Korea, like music, storytelling, gardening and self-help groups; integrating social connection into broader development policy in Djibouti; embedding it as part of ageing policies in Albania and in mental health policy in Spain; establishing dedicated national strategies in countries such as Denmark, Germany, Japan, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden; and campaigns to encourage small acts of kindness in Australia, Great Britain and the United States.</p>\n<p>We call on all countries to prioritise social connection.</p>\n<p>This is not only about personal health and wellbeing. It is also a cornerstone of economic prosperity, national resilience and social cohesion. Societies that foster trust and connection are more innovative, more secure and better able to respond to crises. The COVID-19 pandemic brought this truth into stark relief. As lockdowns forced physical separation, the human need for connection became unmistakable – and so did the costs of its absence.</p>\n<p>The WHO commission proposes a global roadmap built around five key pillars – policy, research, interventions, measurement and engagement.</p>\n<p>The key actions it calls for are to develop national policies that integrate social connection into health, education and labour agendas; invest in research to better understand what works; scale up culturally relevant and cost-effective interventions; collect better data to track the problem and measure progress; and build a global movement to change attitudes and reduce stigma.</p>\n<p>It is critical that this movement includes the voices of those who have endured the pain of loneliness and social isolation as they understand what real solutions look like.</p>\n<p>As leaders, we cannot afford to remain passive. Every day we delay is another day of lost potential, unnecessary suffering and preventable death. But if we act boldly, collaboratively and compassionately and on a large scale, we can build healthier, more connected and more resilient societies.</p>\n<p>Social health is not a luxury. It is a human need. And now, more than ever, it must be a political priority.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><p>As Israel loudly beat the drums of war one day before its unprovoked surprise attack on Iran, a small but significant piece of news slipped by almost unnoticed: The announcement of a new research project on the website of a Washington, DC think tank. On June 12, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) announced the launch of the Balochistan Studies Project (BSP). Significantly, in addition to mentioning Balochistan’s abundance of natural resources “such as oil, gas, uranium, copper, coal, rare earth elements and the two deep seaports of Gwadar and Chabahar”, MEMRI’s statement justifies the project’s necessity by identifying the region as “the perfect outpost to counter and keep under control Iran, its nuclear ambitions, and its dangerous relations with Pakistan, which may provide Tehran with tactical nukes”.</p>\n<p>MEMRI is well known for its selective translation of snippets of Arabic, Persian and Turkish-language media, screenshots from which often end up being shared as memes on social media platforms. Originally founded in 1998, the think tank has consistently peddled a pro-Israel agenda, with its founder, Colonel Yigal Carmon, having served in the Israeli Military Intelligence Corps for more than 20 years. Additionally, MEMRI has been involved “unofficially” in intelligence gathering for the Israeli state since at least 2012.</p>\n<p>Given this context, MEMRI’s creation of the BSP can be seen as an indication of an Israeli attempt to co-opt the Baloch national struggle against both Iran and Pakistan for Israel’s geopolitical objectives. Given the strategic advantages that a successful co-optation of the Baloch cause would grant Israel, and the potential ramifications it would bear upon the resistance of stateless peoples within the region, including Palestinians as well as the Baloch, themselves, there is a need to examine the limitations of geopolitical thinking within national liberation movements.</p>\n<p>MEMRI’s announcement of the BSP is riddled with logical inconsistencies and misinformation regarding the reality of exploitation and resistance in Balochistan. For example, centring the fact that the states of both Iran and Pakistan are currently fighting counterinsurgency campaigns in Balochistan, MEMRI’s website calls for “the international community” to “understand that Balochistan is a natural ally of the West” – ignoring the fact that Western companies such as Barrick Gold and BHP Billiton have played key roles in enabling colonial resource extraction and ecological destruction in the region.</p>\n<p>Another example relates to the personnel involved in the project. One article on the BSP on MEMRI’s website welcomes a “renowned Baloch writer, scholar, and political scientist” called Mir Yar Baloch, whose X account “has been defined as one of the most influential in the Subcontinent”, as a “special adviser”. In May of this year, Baloch made headlines for unilaterally declaring the independence of Balochistan in a series of posts on X, where he also announced to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India had “the backing of 60 million Baloch patriots” after it launched Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.</p>\n<p>More than for his grand proclamations, Mir Yar Baloch is interesting for the amount of mystery that surrounds him, given his supposed status as an important and influential Baloch intellectual. Despite being profiled by a variety of news outlets – notably all Indian – none have deviated from regurgitating a biography for him as limited as that published in the MEMRI article. Significantly, however, more well-known Baloch activists have been quick to distance themselves from him. Niaz Baloch of the Baloch National Movement, for example, posted on X that there exists no consensus for a declaration of independence among Baloch leaders. Crucially, he also listed four “fake accounts”, including that of Mir Yar Baloch, that he stated “should be reported and unfollowed immediately”. Baloch activists therefore speculate that Mir Yar Baloch is a fake persona created by a state with interests in the region to support its objectives.</p>\n<p>Balochistan is a region that spans the border between Iran and Pakistan, where both states are engaged in counterinsurgency campaigns that often spur tensions between them. Each has accused the other of fostering instability by sheltering militant groups across the frontier. Crucially, many Baloch people on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border view themselves as marginalised and systematically oppressed by the states that govern them.</p>\n<p>In this context, an Israeli overture towards supporting the Baloch cause opens the door to new avenues of entrenching Israeli influence in the wider West Asia region. Beyond Israel’s infiltration of the Iranian state and security apparatus, demonstrated to devastating effect by the events of June 13, declaring overt support for the Baloch cause allows Israel to build relationships with secessionist groups in regions where Iranian and Pakistani political legitimacy is limited. Taking into account Israel’s objective of containing and crushing Palestinian resistance, support for such groups also creates conditions that enable Israel to actively undermine efforts at transnational solidarity-building between Palestinians and other stateless populations, such as the Baloch.</p>\n<p>Any Israeli gesture towards Balochistan would also be scaffolded by Israel’s strategic partnership with India, which has long positioned itself as a key supporter of the Baloch cause – a position that has notably undermined attempts at solidarity-building between the Baloch and stateless peoples forced to live under Indian rule, such as Kashmiris. In a substantive sense, it is notable that Mir Yar Baloch, who has tweeted in support of Israel and India, owes his public profile almost entirely to the Indian media. Furthermore, his messaging is overwhelmingly directed at Indian audiences. The BSP thus represents a case of India and Israel’s strategic partnership manifesting in a projection of both Israeli and Indian cross-regional influence.</p>\n<p>I do not deny the relevance of geopolitics in strategising and building capacity for resistance, but elevating it to top priority can be harmful. A “my enemy’s enemy is my friend” approach risks undermining principled long-term alliances. History offers a warning: The Palestine Liberation Organisation’s (PLO) alliance with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, a relationship described by Sadiq al-Azm as “unprincipled”, alienated Kurds and indirectly facilitated the development of relatively warm relations between Israel and the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq. More recently, Iran’s crackdown on Kurdish – and to a lesser extent Baloch – groups following its war with Israel cited fears of their possible collaboration with Israel as a pretext.</p>\n<p>A post-geopolitical approach to foreign policy formulation among stateless groups, therefore, would necessarily take into account the factory defect of nation-states: their necessary prioritisation of survival and the maintenance of a constellation of privileges and interests over a substantive struggle towards justice. In this context, a principled anticolonial inter- and transnationalism that looks beyond geopolitics does not represent a utopian ideal detached from the practicalities of struggle. Instead, it represents a form of long-term pragmatism in and of itself that pushes against the short-termist gains of privileging geopolitics above principles.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.</strong></em></p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

The option to trigger the snapback expires in October, and Tehran has warned of consequences should the E3 opt to activate it.</p>\n<p>Separately, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi said on Friday that Iran has indicated it will be ready to restart technical-level discussions on its nuclear programme with the UN nuclear watchdog.</p>\n<p>Grossi said in Singapore that Iran must be transparent about its facilities and activities.</p>\n<p>He told reporters that the IAEA had proposed that Iran start discussions on “the modalities as to how to restart or begin [inspections] again”.</p>\n<p>“So this is what we are planning to do, perhaps starting on technical details and, later on, moving on to high-level consultations. So this will not include inspections yet.”</p>\n<p>In late June, after the Israeli and US attacks on the country, Iran took an unequivocal stance against the IAEA, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi summarily dismissing Grossi’s request to visit nuclear facilities that were bombed during the conflict.</p>\n<p>“Grossi’s insistence on visiting the bombed sites under the pretext of safeguards is meaningless and possibly even malign in intent,” Araghchi said at the time.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3857034\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3857034\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3857034\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-25T082638Z_1232629104_RC2JTFAKYDWE_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-E3-1753458410.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Iranian consulate in Istanbul\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3857034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A view of the Iranian consulate in Istanbul, Turkiye, July 25 [Dilara Senkaya/Reuters]</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"uranium-enrichment\">Uranium enrichment</h2>\n<p>Iranian diplomats have previously warned that Tehran could withdraw from the global nuclear non-proliferation treaty if UN sanctions are reimposed.</p>\n<p>Restoring the sanctions would deepen Iran’s international isolation and place further pressure on its already strained economy.</p>\n<p>Before the June conflict, Washington and Tehran were divided over uranium enrichment, which Iran has described as a “non-negotiable” right for civilian purposes but the US calls a “red line”.</p>\n<p>The IAEA says Iran is enriching uranium to 60 percent purity – far above the 3.67 percent cap under the 2015 deal, but well below the 90 percent needed for weapons-grade levels.</p>\n<p>Tehran has said it is open to discussing the rate and level of enrichment, but not the right to enrich uranium.</p>\n<p>Iran also says it will not abandon its nuclear programme, which <a href=\"/news/2025/7/24/iran-reaffirms-right-to-enrich-uranium-ahead-of-key-talks-in-turkiye\">Araghchi</a> has called a source of “national pride”.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"

But being here does feel safer, since we’re further from the danger zone now. At least we’re safe,” she said.</p>\n<p>Thidarat was babysitting at a local school when she heard what she described as “something like machinegun fire”, followed by heavy artillery thuds.</p>\n<p>“It was chaos. The kids were terrified. I rushed to the school’s bunker,” she said.</p>\n<p>Inside the shelter, evacuees slept alongside one another beneath the gym’s high ceiling, surrounded by electric fans humming and the quiet whispers of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Elderly residents lay wrapped in blankets, infants slept in cradles, while children played quietly. Pet cats rested in mesh crates near the public restroom.</p>\n<p>This marks the first full activation of the university as a shelter, according to Chai Samoraphum, director of the university president’s office.</p>\n<p>Classes were immediately cancelled, and within an hour, the campus transformed into a functioning evacuation centre.</p>\n<p>Evacuees from four border districts were distributed across six locations throughout the campus.</p>\n<p>“Most of them left in a hurry. Some have chronic health conditions but didn’t bring their medications, others only managed to grab a few belongings,” Chai told AFP.</p>\n<p>The centre, with assistance from the provincial hospital, is providing care for those with chronic illnesses and offering mental health services for trauma victims, Chai explained.</p>\n<p>The border fighting has killed at least 14 people in Thailand, including one soldier and civilians killed in a rocket strike near a Sisaket province petrol station, officials reported. One Cambodian has also been confirmed killed.</p>\n<p>As fighting continues near the border, evacuees face uncertainty about when they can return home.</p>\n<p>For now, the shelter provides safety and a place to await signals that it’s safe to “go back to normal life”, Thidarat said.</p>\n<p>She already has a message for the authorities: “I want the government to take decisive action – do not wait until lives are lost.</p>\n<p>“Civilians look up to the government for protection, and we rely on them deeply,” she said.</p>\n<p>Across the border in Cambodia, about 20,000 residents have evacuated from the country’s northern border with Thailand, the Khmer Times news organisation said, quoting officials in Cambodia’s Preah Vihear province.</p>\n</div></div></body></html>"
