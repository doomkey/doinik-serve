It takes up to three trips to a third country to renew it, submit it and receive the documents to get the passport they hope to abandon soon.</p><p>And if the two-year deadline is not met, there have been cases when the migration service strips people of their Ukrainian citizenship, Tarasenko said.</p><p>She said she had won two cases when courts deemed the decisions illegal, and several similar cases were pending.</p><p>In late 2024, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s lower house of parliament, voted to change the migration law, allowing Russian nationals to wait for the war’s end plus one more month to start the termination of their red passports, she said.</p><p>By that time, Taras was tired of trains to Moldova and endless bickering inside the Russian embassy’s sprawling, white building.</p><p>He was told that a “declarative rejection” of his Russian citizenship could suffice, but the migration services rejected his “declaration”.</p><p>He sued them, and a court ruled that he could finally get the blue passport.</p><p>The Poltava migration service disagreed, and Taras sued again. This time, the court ruled that the officials in charge of issuing his passport should be fined.</p><p>“And as soon as it became money out of their pocket, they were like, ‘Good, come get the passport,’” Taras said.</p><p>He did – last August.</p><p>He cannot be drafted because of severe, progressing myopia coupled with astigmatism, while many other men with Russian passports prefer to hold on to their residence permits and obtain their Ukrainian passports after the war.</p><p>Others are so desperate that they resort to symbolic vandalism.</p><p>In early January, Andriy Kramar, an advertising executive in Kyiv, burned his wife Valery’s Russian passport on a gas stove in the kitchen of their apartment in Hostomel, a suburb that was briefly seized by Russia in 2022.</p><p>They live with their newborn daughter, Oleksandra, amid days-long blackouts caused by Russian shelling and with no running water.</p><p>“That alone could drive you crazy,” he told Al Jazeera.</p><p>Kramar posted the video of the burning passport on Facebook, tagging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s administration and adding: “Give my wife a normal passport!”</p></div></div></body></html>"

No bank can legally operate under US sanctions,” Congolese Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya Katembwe emphasised during a media briefing last year.</p><p>Al Jazeera reached out to the banks to ask about the reasons for continued closure, but most did not respond. Access Bank in eastern DRC said they were “not authorised” to comment. Equity BCDC Bank did not reply, but in a rare statement published in July last year, they informed customers that “branches in Goma and Bukavu have been temporarily closed for several months due to the security situation.”</p><h2 id=\"elusive-peace\">‘Elusive’ peace</h2><p>Although economically, there is much to complain about following the closure of the banks and Goma International Airport, the population remains divided over the capture of Goma.</p><p>M23 leaders say they have brought peace and basic services to the city, including a stable supply of water and electricity – and many residents agree.</p><p>“Since the AFC has been here, we have seen an improvement in the overall security of the population because today, at least, we can sleep peacefully. There are no more targeted killings of motorcyclists and money changers. Peace reigns here in Goma,” says Gentil Mulume, a resident.</p><p>According to M23, there were about 50,000 armed men in the city of Goma before they seized it, and it is this over-militarisation that they say was the root cause of instability in North Kivu.</p><p>Mulume also said he noted the good faith of the AFC-M23 authorities in resolving the social difficulties of the people of Goma.</p><p>“These days, water flows in the city 24 hours a day, there is no longer a water shortage and no untimely power cuts. We are seeing work being done on the road infrastructure.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4271543\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4271543\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4271543\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26027246858866-1769610751.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Congo\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4271543\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A woman sells bananas on the shores of Lake Kivu in Goma, a year after M23 took control of the city [Moses Sawasawa/AP]</figcaption></figure><p>Still, other residents do not agree.</p><p>“Did they bring electricity to Goma? Did they bring water? Did they find Goma without roads?” asked Dieudonne Muweza, an architect, who believes that the M23-AFC leaders should prove themselves.</p><p>“I think the M23 leaders should show us the difference between their mode of governance and that of Kinshasa,” he observed, saying nothing has changed. He hopes for the total withdrawal of the M23-AFC from all areas under their control.</p><p>Muweza has been between jobs since M23 took over the city and wants all ongoing peace initiatives to be concluded to enable the Congolese people to enjoy an “endless peace” that seems “elusive” right now.</p><p>A year since M23’s rapid advance, peace deals mediated by the United States and Qatar have been signed by the rebels and the DRC’s government, while regional efforts also continue. The rebels recently withdrew from the city of Uvira, on the border between the DRC and Burundi, allowing the “symbolic” return of authorities installed by Kinshasa.</p><p>But for Congolese across the east of the country, the future remains uncertain.</p><p>“They [M23] have done well on security, but we are very hungry,” said David Linda, a resident of Goma. “Peace is good. People are sleeping well. The guns are silent. But we don’t have food.”</p><p>A year after her life and bank account were thrown into disarray, Zawadi, the pharmacy owner – like other businesspeople in Goma – is still finding workarounds to make a living. Most of her customers pay her using internet or mobile banking, depositing into her bank account electronically. After that, she still crosses the border into Rwanda to withdraw foreign currency and change it to US dollars and then back into Congolese francs – losing a percentage with every transaction.</p><p>She finds it a difficult cost to bear, especially in a time of simmering conflict and uncertainty, where every expense has to be carefully weighed. But until the banks reopen, this is her only choice.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></div></div></body></html>"

But it has become central to the voting climate as the most visible guarantor of public order, with the police still weakened in morale and capacity after the upheaval of 2024, and with the country still reckoning with a “security apparatus” that watchdogs and official inquiries say was used to shape political outcomes under Hasina.</p><p>For nearly a year and a half now, soldiers have policed the streets of Bangladesh, operating under an order that grants them magisterial powers in support of law and order.

But the military chose not to, he said, in part because it had learned from the fallout of past experiments with its direct political control.</p><p>Asif Shahan, a political analyst and professor at Dhaka University, said the military was aware that a takeover would have also jeopardised key interests, including Bangladesh’s United Nations peacekeeping deployments, which carry both financial benefits and reputational weight for the armed forces. Bangladesh has for decades been one of the biggest suppliers to UN peacekeeping missions, and receives between $100m and $500m a year in payouts and equipment reimbursements for these services.</p><p>But Shahan argues that the military remains “an important political actor”. Today, he said, its influence is “less about overt intervention than the institutional weight it carries through the security and intelligence apparatus”.</p><p>He also pointed to what he called the army’s “corporate” footprint. That footprint spans involvement in major state infrastructure projects, the military’s own business conglomerate, and the presence of serving and retired officers across commercial and state bodies.</p><p>Shahan said the last Hasina government “gave them a share of the pie”, leaving “a kind of culture of corruption … ingrained”. He suggested that this could translate into informal pressure on whoever governs next to do the same, and anxieties inside the force over whether “the facilities and privileges” it has accumulated will shrink.</p><p>On the election itself, Shahan too said that the possibility of the army trying to gain overt control was “very low” unless there is such a major law and order breakdown that there is public demand for the army to step in as the “only source of stability”,</p><p>Others who track the military closely agreed. Rajib Hossain, a former army officer and author of the best-selling book Commando, said he “strongly believes” the army will avoid partisan involvement for its own sake. “The army will play a neutral role during this election,” he said. “What we’ve observed on the ground over the past year and a half, there is no record of the army acting in a partisan way.”</p><p>But, he added, pressure on the institution has been intense since 2024. “Internally, there’s an understanding that if the army fails to act neutrally, it could lose even the public credibility it still has,” he said.</p><p>Mustafa Kamal Rusho, a retired brigadier general at the Osmani Centre for Peace and Security Studies, also told Al Jazeera that the military does not have “any clear intent” to influence politics, though “it still remains a critical power base”.</p><p>That leverage was clearest during the 2024 uprising, Rusho said, when Bangladesh’s political crisis reached a point that many Bangladeshis and international watchdogs viewed the military’s posture as decisive. “If the military did not take the stand that it took, then there would have been more bloodshed,” he said.</p><p>With protests <a href=\"/news/liveblog/2024/8/5/bangladesh-protests-live-army-chief-to-address-nation-amid-new-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">escalating</a>, the military refused to fully enforce Hasina’s curfew orders and decided troops would not fire on civilians. It enabled Hasina to flee to India on an air force plane, and the army chief then announced an interim government would be formed.</p><p>In an Al Jazeera <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txhtxb0ZjVk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentary</a> on the uprising last year, Waker-uz-Zaman, who is related to Hasina and was appointed less than two months before her collapse, also stressed that his forces would not turn their guns on civilians. “We don’t shoot at civilians. It’s not in our culture … So we did not intervene,” he said.</p><p>In the same interview, he added: “We believe that the military should not engage in politics … It’s not our cup of tea.”</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273206\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273206\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273206\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024-12-16T170242Z_329957784_RC2CDL3DOEQ0_RTRMADP_3_REUTERS-ARCHIVE-1769664979.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C517&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"President Hussain Muhammad Ershad of Bangladesh meeting British PM Thatcher at Downing St. London.

Rahman was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/31/world/bangladesh-leader-is-shot-and-killed-in-a-coup-attempt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assassinated</a> in 1981 in a failed coup attempt by another group of military officers. The BNP remains a key contender in the February 12 vote, now led by Rahman’s son, Tarique Rahman, who has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/25/bangladesh-opposition-leader-tarique-rahman-returns-after-17-years-in-exile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">returned to front-line politics</a> after a long exile.</p><p>In 1982, then army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad seized power and ruled for much of the 1980s. Writer and political historian Mohiuddin Ahmed has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/bengali/articles/cx208wg3n1jo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described</a> Ershad’s takeover as coming only months after he publicly argued that “the army should be brought in to help run the country”.</p><p>Eventually, a pro-democracy movement led by Zia’s wife, Khaleda Zia, and Hasina, also Mujibur Rahman’s daughter, forced him from office. The BNP won a landmark election, and in 1991, Khaleda became the country’s first female prime minister.</p><p>Since then, Rusho said, the military’s influence “became more indirect”, though Bangladesh still saw an abortive May 1996 showdown when the then army chief, Lieutenant General Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim, defied presidential orders, and troops loyal to him moved towards Dhaka. Nasim was arrested and removed from office.</p><p>A decade later, in 2007, the military in effect “fully backed” a caretaker government that was formed to replace Khaleda’s second administration, which had ruled between 2001 and 2006. That caretaker government was installed in January 2007 after a breakdown in the election process and escalating political violence. The International Crisis Group <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/rpt/asia-pacific/bangladesh/151-restoring-democracy-bangladesh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">described</a> the caretaker administration as “headed by technocrats but controlled by the military”, while then-army chief Moeen U Ahmed argued the political climate “was deteriorating very rapidly” and that the military’s intervention had “quickly ended” street violence.</p><p>It was only after 2009, when Hasina came back to power – her Awami League had first ruled between 1996 and 2001 – that the military became “subordinate to the civilian regime”, Rusho said.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273209\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273209\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24203441938562-1769665076.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Bangladeshi military force soldiers on armored vehicles patrol the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh, Saturday, July 20, 2024.

The interview, which critics described as something unprecedented for a serving army chief, placed the military close to the country’s central political debate.</p><p>Hossain, the former army officer and author, criticised the public nature of the intervention. “If he [Zaman] had discussed this after sitting with all the stakeholders … the interim [administration], political parties, protest leaders … and then gone to the media, that would be acceptable,” he said. “But here, he declared it unilaterally and blindsided the government from his position of power. He had no authority to do that.”</p><p>“You may say this is an extraordinary, transitional time and the military has a role to play,” Hossain added. “But then, why do we have an administration at all?”</p><p>Shahan, the Dhaka University professor, said Zaman “came very close” to crossing the line and explained it as a product of military institutional culture after August 5. “Military organisations … like to follow standing operating procedures, order, stability,” he said. But August 5, he added, was “a political rupture” that forced the army and the nation into uncertainty: about the interim government’s longevity, legitimacy and how it would deal with the military.</p><p>Those anxieties, Shahan said, likely pushed Zaman to speak. In principle, he said, it is reasonable for the army chief to say elections are needed for stability. But “when he set a specific timeline – within 18 months – that is beyond his role”, Shahan said. “It then appears as if he is dictating.”</p><p>Shahan added that the problem becomes sharper when that kind of specificity appears to respond to a party demand; he was referring to a time when only the Bangladesh Nationalist Party was repeatedly pushing for a vote timetable.</p><p>Eight months later, in May 2025, Zaman again weighed in, telling a high-level military gathering, according to local media reports, that his position had not changed and that the next national vote should be held by December 2025. After that, Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special adviser to Yunus, wrote on Facebook that “the army can’t meddle in politics” and argued that the military chief had failed to maintain “jurisdictional correctness” by prescribing an election deadline.</p><p>Around the same period, rumours emerged suggesting that <a href=\"/features/2025/5/24/why-is-bangladeshs-interim-leader-muhammad-yunus-considering-resigning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yunus had considered resigning </a>amid political discord.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4273212\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4273212\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4273212\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24226468280254-1769665174.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"FILE - Military personnel stand in front of a portrait of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on July 30, 2024, during a national day of mourning to remember the victims of recent deadly clashes.

Human Rights Watch has described enforced disappearances as a “hallmark” of Hasina’s rule since 2009.</p><p>When the United States sanctioned the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) in 2021 over allegations of extrajudicial killings, the US Department of the Treasury <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>, “These incidents target opposition party members, journalists, and human rights activists.” Critics argue that security institutions became central to governance, and questions about how that machinery was used are now part of the post-Hasina political settlement.</p><p>Hossain, the former officer, said the Hasina-era legacy still echoes inside the top brass. “If you look at the leadership, the general, five lieutenant generals, and some major generals and brigadier generals, a lot of them were part of Hasina’s apparatus,” he said, “aside from a handful of professional officers”.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://coied.portal.gov.bd/pages/publications/final-report-69662bc77746b8be8ee26287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> by Bangladesh’s Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances says disappearances were used as a “tool for political repression” and that the practice “reached alarming levels during key political flashpoints”, including in the run-up to elections in 2014, 2018 and 2024. The commission said it verified 1,569 cases of enforced disappearance.</p><p>In cases where political affiliation could be confirmed, the <a href=\"/news/2026/1/21/what-is-bangladeshs-jamaat-e-islami-party-could-it-lead-the-country-next\">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> and its student wing accounted for about 75 percent of victims, while the BNP and its affiliated groups accounted for about 22 percent. Among those “still missing or dead”, the BNP and its allies accounted for about 68 percent, while the Jamaat and its affiliates accounted for about 22 percent, the report said.</p><p>The commission also noted that the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), the military-run intelligence agency, had been “accused of manipulating domestic politics and interfering in the 2014 parliamentary elections”, and argued that perceived alignment with the <a href=\"/news/2025/5/11/bangladesh-bans-activities-of-awami-league-the-party-of-ousted-pm-hasina\">Awami League</a> compromised its neutrality.</p><p>Several senior military officers, including 15 in service, are now facing trial in a civilian tribunal on charges of enforced disappearances, murders and custodial tortures.</p><p>The proceedings have become a delicate issue in civil-military relations, as cases against serving officers in civilian courts are rare in Bangladesh’s history.</p><p>Former army chief Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan wrote on Facebook that local media had reported disagreements over the “trial process” for officers accused of crimes against humanity and that those disagreements had created what he described as a “chasm” between the interim government and the army’s top leadership.</p><p>Hossain, the former officer, however, said he disagreed. “These trials are not defaming the army,” Hossain said. “Rather, they are a kind of redemption for the institution to recover from the stigma created by the crimes of some self-serving officers.”</p><p>He argued that accountability could motivate younger officers and reduce the risk of the military being politically exploited again. Rusho, the retired brigadier general, also argued that politicisation under Hasina was driven less by formal doctrine than by executive control over careers.</p><p>“Promotions, important postings, placements … they were influenced considerably by the executive branch,” he said. “When you influence postings, some people’s loyalty often gets diverted to political masters, [and] it affects … professionalism and capability.”</p><p>Kean of the International Crisis Group said the real test for Bangladesh now would be whether it can stop the security state from being reabsorbed into partisan politics.</p><p>“The military is going to remain a powerful institution in Bangladesh, with a level of influence in domestic politics,” he said. “One hopes that the lesson of the past 18 months is that the military is better to support civilian administrations rather than be in power directly – that it can be a stabilising force, and one that is ultimately committed to democracy and civilian leadership.”</p><p>But, he added, the onus to do that isn’t only on the generals. Civilian politicians, too, needed to resist the temptation to misuse the military. That alone, he suggested, would help Bangladesh keep the army in the barracks and politicians accountable to the people, not to men in khakis.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Their ties have been tested by Trump’s tariff war and his recent threats of annexing Greenland, much to the alarm of NATO members like the UK.</p><p>Trump was angered by a similar visit this month to Beijing by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who also sought deeper economic ties with China.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>It is unclear how Trump will respond to Starmer’s visit to Beijing, but the UK prime minister said that maintaining a “consistent” relationship with China is “firmly in the national interest”.</p><p>Following the Starmer-Xi meeting, the UK announced it would cooperate with Beijing to address the ongoing problem of human trafficking in the English Channel.</p><p>The agreement will see UK law enforcement work with Chinese authorities to keep small boat engines – used by smugglers for Channel crossings – out of the hands of criminal gangs, according to Starmer’s office.</p><p>Starmer is seeking deeper economic ties with China, as well, which was the UK’s fourth-largest trading partner in 2022, according to UK government data.</p><p>Accompanying the prime minister on his trip is a delegation representing nearly 50 UK businesses and cultural organisations, including HSBC, British Airways, AstraZeneca and GSK.

Human Rights Watch said Israel has <a href=\"/news/2025/12/18/israel-strikes-across-south-eastern-lebanon-in-latest-truce-violation\">systematically targeted reconstruction equipment</a> across southern Lebanon.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Without the US support, however, analysts said they don’t see Israel being open to negotiations.

after the remains of several bodies were recovered from the wreckage, the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office said on the Telegram messaging app.</li>\n<li>At least six people were injured in a Russian missile attack on Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, the head of the regional military administration, Ivan Fedorov, said on Telegram.</li>\n<li>Russian forces attacked several locations across Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, killing a 46-year-old man and injuring at least two other people, the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Hanzha, said on Facebook.</li>\n<li>One

security</h2><ul class=\"spaced-bullet-spacing\">\n<li>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at an event in Paris that a 2035 target for rearming Europe “would be too late”.</li>\n<li>“I think rearming ourselves now is the most important thing,” Frederiksen said. “Because when you look at intelligence, nuclear weapons, and so on, we depend on the US,” she added.</li>\n</ul><ul

Court of Canada later this year – said Bill 9 “masks discrimination as secularism”.</p><p>“These harmful bans disproportionately target and marginalize religious and racialized minorities, especially Muslim women,” Harini Sivalingam, director of the CCLA’s equality programme, said in <a href=\"https://ccla.org/press-release/quebecs-bill-9-masks-discrimination-as-secularism/\" target=\"_blank\"

these Islamophobic views or hateful views to actually take it out on people”.</p><h2 id=\"hate-continues-to-threaten\">‘Hate continues to threaten’</h2><p>At the federal level, <a

antifascism programmes and other initiatives.</p><p>But Elghawaby told Al Jazeera that Islamophobia has nevertheless been rising in Canada, “whether it’s through police-reported hate crimes [or] whether it’s Canadians sharing that they’re experiencing discrimination at work [and] at school”.</p><figure id=\"attachment_1613961\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1613961\"

There was a slight increase in 2024 – the most recent year for which the data is available – with 229 incidents reported.</p><p>Elghawaby, whose office was established after <a href=\"/news/2021/6/8/canada-anti-muslim-attack-it-could-have-been-any-one-of-us\">another anti-Muslim attack</a> killed four members of a single family in London, Ontario, in 2021, said the figures underscore “that hate continues to threaten Canadians”.</p><p>“Canada, despite a global reputation of being a country that welcomes people from around the world, does struggle with division, with polarisation, with the rise of extremist narratives,” she said, adding that remembering the Quebec City mosque attack remains critical.</p><p>“[The families of the men killed] don’t want the loss of their loved ones to be in vain. They want Canadians to continue to stand with them, to continue to stand against Islamophobia, and to do their part in their own circles to help promote understanding,” Elghawaby said.</p><p>“History can sadly repeat itself if we don’t learn from the lessons of the past.”</p></div></div></body></html>"

decision on whether to allow foreign journalists independent access to Gaza, in the latest delay of a legal battle that has stretched over a year.</p><p>The court granted the government until March 31 to <a href=\"https://aje.news/0ptcar?update=4271016\">respond</a> to the petition filed by the Foreign Press Association, despite state attorneys failing to provide detailed justifications beyond citing security risks.</p><section class=\"more-on\"><h2 class=\"more-on__heading\">Recommended Stories </h2><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">list of 3 items</span><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">end of list</span></section><p>The decision extends a policy that has barred foreign correspondents from entering Gaza to report on conditions there, unless reporters are prepared to embed with the Israeli army.</p><p>At the hearing on Wednesday, justices appeared frustrated with the government’s explanations for maintaining the blanket ban on independent press access, which has remained in place since Israel launched its genocidal war against the Palestinian people of Gaza following the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.</p><p>A ceasefire took effect in October 2025, though Israel has <a href=\"/video/birds-eye-view/2026/1/28/israels-phase-one-gaza-ceasefire-violations\">continued</a> carrying out attacks, which have killed more than 400 people.</p><p>\t\t</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>Justice Ruth Ronen rejected the state’s arguments, insisting that “it is not enough to cite ‘security risks’ without providing details” and noting there had been “a very significant change on the ground” since the ceasefire.</p><p>The FPA’s legal team was barred from attending or accessing the material presented to the judges.</p><p>The FPA, which represents 370 journalists from 130 media outlets, said it was “deeply disappointed that the Israeli Supreme Court has once again postponed ruling on our petition for free, independent press access to Gaza.”</p><p>“All the more concerning is that the court appears to have been swayed by the state’s classified security arguments,” the FPA added, calling the closed-door process one that “offers no opportunity for us to rebut these arguments and clears the way for the continued arbitrary and open-ended closure of Gaza to foreign journalists.”</p><p>This marks the ninth extension granted to the government since the petition was filed in September 2024.</p><p>Just days earlier, on January 25, Israel <a href=\"/news/2026/1/25/israel-extends-ban-on-al-jazeeras-operations-by-90-days\">extended</a> its shutdown of Al Jazeera’s operations for another 90 days, citing national security threats the network denies.</p><h3>US plan for Gaza demilitarisation</h3><p>The postponement comes as mediators continue to press for progress in the US-backed plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza.</p><p>At the UN Security Council, the United States said it had unveiled plans for an “internationally funded buyback” programme to disarm Hamas as part of Gaza’s demilitarisation, which is a key element in the second phase of the US-backed plan.</p><p>US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the Security Council on Wednesday that “international, independent monitors will supervise a process of demilitarisation of Gaza to include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning”, supported by the buyback scheme.</p><p>Hamas still controls just under half of the territory in Gaza beyond the Yellow Line, where Israeli forces remain present.</p><p>The second phase of the US plan will also require the Israeli army to withdraw, though Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said demilitarisation would have to come before any further progress on the ceasefire.</p><p>Two Hamas officials told the Reuters news agency this ‌week that neither the United States nor the mediators presented the Palestinian group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He also added that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would be investigating whether federal funds “were awarded arbitrarily, capriciously, or contrary to law”.</p><p>Trump used his public appearance on Wednesday — organised to boost his child savings account programme — to double down on his attacks.</p><p>“I went there a couple of days after the fire, met so many people on the streets. In many cases, they were fairly wealthy people, some very rich people. Some of the best houses in California burned down,” Trump told his audience.</p><p>The Republican president, whose fortune derives from his family’s real estate empire, proceeded to bemoan the slow pace of construction permitting, as well as California’s tendency to lean Democratic.</p><p>“It’s a national emergency,” Trump said. “What they’ve done to these people is horrible. It’s just horrible. And they’ll still vote Democrat. Can you believe it? After all, it’s just they get used to it.”</p><p>But Democratic leaders have fired back, questioning Trump’s motives and authority.</p><p>Previously, the two sides have clashed over Trump’s decision to send National Guard troops to southern California without Governor Newsom’s permission, with Democrats arguing that Trump’s efforts also represented an unconstitutional overreach of presidential authority.</p><p>In a statement to local media this week, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass emphasised her view that Trump had once again overstepped his bounds.</p><p>“The President has no authority over the local permitting process, but where he could actually be helpful is by providing the critical FEMA funding we have been asking for, by speeding up FEMA reimbursements, and by regulating the industries that he alone can impact,” the statement said.</p><p>Bass added that Trump could also be helpful by pushing insurance companies to compensate homeowners for their losses, as well as by encouraging banks to offer mortgage forgiveness and no-interest loans to survivors.</p><figure id=\"attachment_4272348\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4272348\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4272348\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26020477246343-1769630741.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80\" alt=\"Gavin Newsom surrounded by cellphone cameras at Davos\" fetchpriority=\"low\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4272348\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">California Governor Gavin Newsom attends the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 20 [Markus Schreiber/AP Photo]</figcaption></figure><p>Under Bass’s leadership, in January 2025, the city of Los Angeles suspended requirements under the California Coastal Act and California Environmental Quality Act to help speed up reconstruction efforts.</p><p>The city also ordered an expedited permit review process that required qualifying reviews to be completed within 30 days of a submitted application.</p><p>Still, as of Wednesday, a <a href=\"https://www.ca.gov/lafires/track-progress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">state website</a> monitoring reconstruction efforts showed that just 2,981 permits had been approved between Los Angeles County, the city of Los Angeles and the nearby municipalities of Malibu and Pasadena. A total of 6,811 applications had been received, according to the site.</p><p>But residents have also complained about delays in federal assistance, particularly as Trump takes efforts to dismantle FEMA and limit its payouts to disaster survivors.</p><p>Some California wildfire survivors have reported that their FEMA payments only covered a small fraction of the damage the agency estimated for their properties.</p><p>Governor Newsom, a frequent target of Trump’s, seized upon those accusations this week to issue a missive on social media that both mocked the president and criticised his lack of support.</p><p>“The Feds need to release funding not take over local permit approval speed — the main obstacle is COMMUNITIES NOT HAVING THE MONEY TO REBUILD,” Newsom’s press office <a href=\"https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/2016191022574010597\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote</a>.</p><p>“Mr. President, please actually help us. We are begging you. Release the federal disaster aid you’re withholding that will help communities rebuild their homes, schools, parks, and infrastructure.”</p><p>Thousands of homes remain in rubble, as crews continue to address hazardous waste from lead, asbestos and other toxic materials that the fires left behind.</p></div></div></body></html>"
